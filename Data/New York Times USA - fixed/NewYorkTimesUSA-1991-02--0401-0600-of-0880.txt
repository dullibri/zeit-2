HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Diplomacy;
Hussein Meets With Soviet Envoy And Talks of Effort to End War

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said tonight that he was willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union to end the Persian Gulf war, but he also said that Iraq was determined to keep fighting "until aggression and the aggressors are beaten back."
Mr. Hussein's remarks were read on the Baghdad radio after he met with a Soviet special envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov. Mr. Primakov was in Baghdad to deliver a personal appeal from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Mr. Hussein to withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait in conformity with United Nations Security Council resolutions and thereby avoid further destruction and casualties. 
 Whether Mr. Hussein's statement represented a change in Iraq's position was not immediately clear because it made no reference to an Iraqi withdrawal, the central issue Soviet officials have been urging Mr. Hussein to address.
 
Too Early to Judge
 The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said "it's just too premature to make a judgment" about Mr. Hussein's remarks, adding, "The deciding factor is what he has to say about getting out of Kuwait."
The Baghdad radio report, which was monitored by Western governments and news agencies at about midnight Baghdad time, quoted Mr. Hussein as saying, "Iraq is prepared to extend cooperation to the Soviet Union and other nations and agencies in the interest of finding a peaceful, political, equitable and honorable solution to the region's central issues, including the situation in the gulf."
The statement said Mr. Hussein also emphasized to Mr. Primakov that "the people and armed forces and leadership of Iraq have firmly resolved to tackle aggression with all that the national and pan-Arab responsibility entails in the way of honor, pride and courage, regardless of the sacrifices needed, until aggression and the aggressors are beaten back."
A senior Administration official said the statement did not appear to offer anything new from Baghdad.
"There's a sentence in there that says, 'including the situation in the gulf,' implying that they want to deal with other issues first, implying Palestine for instance," the Administration official said. "So the bottom line is that it doesn't look like anything new."
Mr. Hussein sharpened his accusations that the Persian Gulf conflict had been transformed from a United Nations police action to a campaign of destruction against what he called "the civilian infrastructure built by the Iraqi people," saying that the targets included "economic, cultural and scientific property" as well as "all that is dear and cherished in their heritage and contemporary edifice."
The Iraqi leader, reflecting Baghdad's disappointment that the Soviet Union, its onetime ally and main arms supplier, has done nothing to blunt the course of the war, said that Moscow "has a legal, political and moral responsibility" to help find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
 
No Excuse, Iraqi Asserts
 "The differing Iraqi and Soviet perspectives on the gulf situation do not justify condoning the crimes committed by the United States under the cover" of the United Nations resolution, Mr. Hussein said.
After Mr. Primakov's mission was announced by Mr. Gorbachev last Saturday, Soviet spokesmen went out of their way to say he would continue to insist that Iraq had to withdraw from Kuwait as a first step. The Russians have obtained agreements from the United States and France that an end to the hostilities in the Persian Gulf is possible if Baghdad unquivocally states that it will withdraw from Kuwait and takes actions to do so.
Reuters, in a dispatch from Nicosia, Cyprus, quoted other Iraqi radio reports that said Mr. Primakov had criticized the United States for striking civilian targets in the bombing campaign that began Jan. 17. He was quoted as telling Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq, "It is appalling and regrettable that residential districts have been targeted and civilians hurt."
A senior Administration official said he expected Mr. Primakov to relay to Washington a thorough assessment of his meeting with Mr. Hussein, as he has after previous missions to Baghdad.
 
Diplomacy Under Bombs
 The circumstances of Mr. Primakov's visit to Baghdad were in themselves extraordinary since on Monday night and tonight, Baghdad came under some of the most intense allied bombardment of the war.
Mr. Primakov traveled to the Iraqi capital overland from Iran. United States officials said that while they received notification of his presence in Baghdad after the fact, Moscow did not request a pause in the bombing campaign to allow safe passage for Mr. Primakov's mission.
In other diplomatic efforts today, the Soviet press agency Tass reported that the Soviet and French Foreign Ministers, meeting in Moscow , said any settlement in the Persian Gulf must be built on "the need to insure the full and unconditional implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions." Tass said the ministers, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh and Roland Dumas, emphasized that "the end of hostilities is possible if Baghdad makes a clear statement that it will withdraw from Kuwait and acts accordingly."
Referring to the possibility of tackling larger issues in the region, like the questions of a Palestinian homeland and Israeli security, the Tass report said, "The sides agreed that specific elaboration is needed of the problem of insuring a stable and secure future in this strategic region of the world during the after-crisis period."

HEADLINE: Hired to Be Negotiator, But Treated Like Pariah

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
President Bush gave him the job of knocking on the doors of the nation's governors. But all are afraid to answer. Where he hoped for a yes, he would now consider himself lucky with a maybe.
A half year after he became the Federal Government's newest hope in the tortuous effort to dispose of four decades worth of highly radioactive nuclear waste, David H. Leroy has made no visible progress in his job of persuading a state or an Indian tribe to accept the waste. 
 So far, Mr. Leroy says, all the people with whom he needs to negotiate will not be caught dead talking to him.
Officials of several Western states who knew the 43-year-old negotiator when he was Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, from 1983 to 1987, say he is not exaggerating his pariah status. "His fear is accurate," said W. Val Oveson, Utah's current Lieutenant Governor. "If someone knows who he is, and what he's doing, and finds him on the schedule of any politician, it's going to be a major news story."
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the 1987 law that created his job, Mr. Leroy is supposed to negotiate with governors to discover what would induce them to play host. The thinking was that local opposition might be overcome by economic benefits, which would include hundreds of jobs.
 
Treated as a Pariah
 But nuclear waste is so unpopular with voters, Mr. Leroy said, that if he walked into any governor's office and created the impression that that state was being singled out "I would instantly have created the principal issue in that governor's next re-election campaign."
So Mr. Leroy is planning to approach all 50 states with a request for proposals. And he has lowered his sights. "I don't expect them to say yes," he said in a recent interview. "I simply hope they'll say maybe."
If they all turn him down, he said in his confirmation hearing last summer, "I would follow up to determine with each state the circumstances and conditions of the refusals," to see if there were any "ideas or possibilities" in the refusals that could lead to further discussions.
Exactly what inducements he can offer is not clear. Mr. Leroy says his job is to design a negotiating process. But whatever state or Indian reservation accepts the nuclear waste will gain hundreds of construction jobs, a smaller number of extremely long-term jobs for plant operators and perhaps some research contracts and public works projects. In his confirmation hearings, Mr. Leroy promised that if an Indian tribe volunteered to accept the waste he would not proceed without the approval of that state's governor.
 
Dumps. Repositories. Dumps
 Under the 1987 law, Mr. Leroy is looking for sites for two kinds of "repositories," as the Government prefers to call what their opponents call a "dump."
In a recent interview in his office a few blocks north of the White House, in an antique brick town house with a brass plaque that looks as if it should mark a historic site but says instead, "United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator," Mr. Leroy cheerfully recited the conventional wisdom about his mission.
Opposition to nuclear waste, he said, goes beyond the standard nimby ("not in my backyard") and even beyond nimtoo ("not in my term of office"), and all the way to nuac ("not under any circumstances").
One category of repository is a permanent burial spot. The Energy Department is engaged in a $1 billion examination of a site selected by Congress for that purpose, Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles north of Las Vegas. Yucca was chosen as the prime candidate by the same law that established Mr. Leroy's job. But Nevada is fighting tooth and nail, and some scientists think the site is impractical. They say water could get into the site and spread the waste, so Mr. Leroy is looking for another.
Even if Yucca Mountain is eventually opened, it seems unlikely to be available until well into the next century. So Mr. Leroy is also looking for an interim storage site, where the waste, mostly spent fuel rods from civilian power plants, could be stored until a permanent repository is built. There is also waste from the production of nuclear weapons.
 
Interim vs. Permanent
 Interim is the only basis on which high-level radioactive waste has been stored since the nuclear age began, however, and since it is not clear when this waste will be moved, the distinction between interim and permanent is not clear. One clear difference is method: the interim site would use a system called "monitored retrievable storage," with above-ground tombs envisoned by the Energy Department; at a permanent site, the waste would be buried.
Seeking to prevent a temporary site from turning into a permanent one by default, Congress specified that a monitored retrievable storage repository could not be built until a permanent site was well in hand. Under those circumstances, the interim site would not be very useful. If Mr. Leroy finds a candidate for an interim site, the law would have to be amended if it was to be used before a permanent site was found. President Bush called for such an amendment in the draft of his national energy strategy.
Oak Ridge, Tenn., the site of a major Government nuclear laboratory, expressed interest in being the host for a monitored retrievable storage complex a few years ago, but the idea was dropped because of opposition from the Governor of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, now the nominee for Education Secretary.
 
An Optimistic Negotiator
 Mr. Leroy is optimistic, though, that other potential sites will be found for temporary and permanent storage.
Nevada is not hopeful. "Frankly, it's difficult for me to see somebody volunteering to undertake that," said Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat who is a former Governor of the state.
Electric utilities, on the other hand, are anxious for Mr. Leroy to succeed. Most reactors were built with the idea that their waste would be trucked away after a matter of months or a few years. The pools of water built to temporarily hold the waste are rapidly filling. Some utilities have moved the spent fuel into huge steel casks, which can be stored away from the reactor.
"People aren't going to like a forest of casks," said a spokeswoman for one such company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And the lack of a permanent repository is emerging as a major stumbling block to construction of reactors.
But if the idea is presented in the right way, Mr. Leroy says, volunteers will emerge. The Energy Department's request for proposals for the superconducting supercollider received 43 favorable responses, he pointed out. (The $8.6 billion collider, the world's largest particle accelerator, is to be built in Waxahachie, Tex.)
 
Keeping Washington at Distance
 Mr. Leroy does not closely associate himself with the Energy Department. A former Idaho Attorney General who was active in Republican Presidential campaigns, he makes a point of noting that his headquarters is in Boise, far from his Washington liaison office and the Energy Department.
He envisions a brokered solution, in which the Federal Government offers to build roads, a hospital and other benefits, perhaps including a nuclear science program at the state university. "We simply are not going to be able to buy people with money," he said.
In his Senate confirmation hearing he said, "It is not the task of the nuclear negotiator to ask any jurisdiction to trade off the lives and safety of future generations of children for large sums of money."
But Shira Flax, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club in Washington, said in an interview: "That's the only way he'll get it, to buy them out. No one will do that without a lot of money; the only thing that has worked is a bribe."
Mr. Leroy puts it more gently. "The host must be self-convinced of the benefits which are associated with such a program," he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Rejects British Airways Bid To Cut Fares to U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Transportation Department today rejected British Airways' plan to reduce its fares sharply on flights between Britain and the United States, putting pressure on Britain to liberalize its aviation trade agreement with the United States.
The nations have been unable to agree on a new treaty governing air travel between them, and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said today that until the broader trade issues were settled, he would not approve the low excursion fares proposed by the British airline this week. 
 Mr. Skinner linked the fares to the main issue in the trade talks, which broke down late last month over whether Pan Am and T.W.A. could sell many of their London routes to United and American Airlines, respectively.
Mr. Skinner's tough bargaining stance, which was disclosed this evening, breaks with the department's normal posture, which encourages low international fares.
But he held out the promise of reviewing the decision once the trade talks are completed and said that although he would not approve the fare cut for the busy summer season, he would approve them if the offer was limited to travel before April 30.
British Airways had said it would reduce its fares across the Atlantic by a third on tickets bought before March 15, with the low fares in effect from April 15 to Oct. 31, including the busy summer vacation season. Air travel has been off sharply because of the recession and terrorism fears.
Current round-trip fares for seats bought at least 30 days in advance are $778 for spring weekend travel and $938 for the summer; British Air had planned to lower those fares to $521 and $628, respectively.
Pan Am is in bankruptcy court and T.W.A. is losing money, making it difficult for either to compete with the well-heeled British Airways in a fare war.
In efforts to insure their survival, the ailing airlines have proposed selling their London routes for hundreds of millions of dollars to two of the more prosperous United States airlines, United and American, both of which would be stronger competitors in the international air trade.
British aviation authorities, however, have insisted that only Pan Am and T.W.A. can fly into Heathrow Airport near London, the preferred destination because of its plentiful links to other cities and direct subway service to central London.
United States officials said it would be unwise to allow British Airways to cut its trans-Atlantic fares now, which would put extraordinary pressure on Pan Am and T.W.A., without any guarantee that stronger United States companies would be allowed to participate in the competition.
 
Future of Pan Am and T.W.A.
 When the latest negotiations between the countries broke down, Mr. Skinner warned that if the issue was not resolved soon Pan Am and T.W.A. might be liquidated. His department said British Airways' proposal made sense only in such a context.
Under the current aviation trade agreement, either country can block proposed fares for international flights.
Although the United States rarely does so, it has been common for Britain to reject fares proposed by American carriers. The Transportation Department said many proposals were rejected last year by Britain.
It is unclear whether the rejection of the British Airways fares meant that travelers would now be unable to obtain the cheap tickets to Europe that had been dangled before them.
Other carriers had been thought likely to match the offer, and T.W.A. announced 50 percent off its London fares in newspaper advertising on Wednesday; the ad appears on page A6 of The New York Times. But the airlines would have cut their fares reluctantly, since international flights are usually the most profitable.

HEADLINE: Indictments of 2 Officials Darken Detroit's Mood

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Twenty-four years ago, in devastating riots, this city burned with black rage over a predominantly white Police Ddpartment that seemed to blacks to be more like an occupying army. Then came Coleman A. Young, the city's first black mayor, and soon afterward, William L. Hart, the city's first black police chief, and an era of black pride and inclusion.
Now criminal indictments against Chief Hart, a symbol of a hard-won fight for self-determination and one of the Mayor's most loyal appointees, have dealt a harsh blow to a city that could least afford a setback. 
 On Monday, Chief Hart, a 67-year-old career police officer, was charged with embezzling $1.3 million from a secret police fund and obstructing justice by tampering with a witness who was to testify against him before a grand jury. Kenneth A. Weiner, a former deputy police chief and business associate of Mayor Young's, was charged with stealing another $1.3 million from the fund. Mr. Weiner is white.
Chief Hart has requested a paid leave of absence. Mayor Young is expected to name a temporary replacement for the chief by Friday.
 
Singled Out for Prosecution?
 The indictments have raised questions about the dealings of one of the nation's biggest police departments and have renewed angry accusations from blacks, denied by white Federal prosecutors, that black elected officials, among them Marion S. Barry Jr., the former Mayor of Washington, have been singled out for prosecution.
Indeed, the investigation that produced Monday's indictments was fueled by Federal officials' suspicions of Mayor Young, and some say that it was the Mayor the prosecutors were really after.
"It's another failed attempt to catch the Mayor," said Teresa Blossom, a spokeswoman for the Mayor.
The Young administration has been the subject of Federal investigations for most of its 17 years, but the investigations have never directly linked Mayor Young to any wrongdoing.
"People will look at these indictments as suspect," said Paul Hubbard, president of New Detroit, a community development group here. "They'll just say, 'There go the Feds going after somebody again.' "
Still, the indictments will hurt the city's already ravaged image and make it more difficult for Mayor Young to lure the affluent residents and businesses Detroit needs to survive.
"This will have a devastating effect on the city," said Wilbur Rich, a professor of political science at the Wayne State University who wrote an authorized biography of Mayor Young. "The city was on a shaky foundation in the first place. This will divert attention from serious social and economic problems to one individual."
The fall of a respected police chief is being seen as more of a personal tragedy than an indication of widespread corruption on the force or in the Young administration, some political insiders say.
Chief Hart rose from coal miner and auto worker to one of the city's best undercover officers and, in 1976, to chief of Detroit's 5,000-member force. He presided over the transformation of the Police Department as it moved from a predominantly white force that black residents said harassed them to an integrated corps bearing the stamp of a streetwise, grass-roots Mayor. The force is now 52 percent black and nearly 20 percent female.
 
Doctorate in Education
 Along the way, Chief Hart earned a doctorate in education from Wayne State University. It was there that he met Mr. Weiner, then an assistant professor of criminal justice. In 1979, Chief Hart appointed Mr. Weiner civilian deputy police chief to oversee security for the 1980 Republican National Convention. A few years later, the indictments say, the two were stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from a city fund set up by Chief Hart.
According to the Federal indictments, however, the money was diverted to Mr. Weiner's bogus companies to be spent on things like the $3,000 monthly rent for the Beverly Hills, Calif., house for Chief Hart's daughter.
Detroiters, some hardened, some heartbroken, say that such behavior by leading law-enforcement officials will do little to make Detroit a safer place. "When the police chief is embezzling, how do you tell young people to abide by the law?" Professor Rich asked.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Saudi Arabia;
SAUDIS REPORTED TO LOOK FOR LOANS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Facing rising costs from the Persian Gulf war, Saudi Arabia is seeking to borrow billions of dollars from international banks, a Western diplomat said today.
Such borrowing would mark the first time since the early 1970's that the Saudi Government decided to go to the world financial market for loans, another Western diplomat said. 
 The diplomat could provide no specific figure on the amount of money the Saudis were seeking to borrow.
Saudi businessmen portray the move as one of many strategies available to the Saudi Government to finance the war effort. While Saudi Arabia has spent great sums in the crisis already, the country, one of the world's richest, still has enormous assets of its own, both liquid and otherwise, that it could draw upon if it chose to.
According to Western and Saudi officials, the Government here has contributed about $48 billion in military and economic assistance to the United States and other allied nations since the gulf crisis began in August.
Rising oil prices, particularly in the early months of the Middle East crisis, yielded a windfall of between $12 billion and $15 billion, leaving Riyadh with a six-month deficit of more than $33 billion.
 
Letter to U.S. Lawmakers
 To stifle an increasing perception among members of Congress that Saudi Arabia has profited from the tensions, Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, sent a letter to lawmakers late last year outlining Saudi financial difficulties.
Another side of increasing Saudi fiscal difficulties was the mutual decision last month by the Bush Administration and the Saudi Government to postpone a $15 billion arms sale to the kingdom, the second part of the largest United States weapons sale in history.
Nonetheless, many American officials remained unconvinced that Saudi Arabia could possibly be suffering financial hardship.
But a Western diplomat noted that the Saudi Government had been running an $8 billion annual deficit for the last several years, largely to pay for booming growth that has transformed the skyline of Riyadh, as well as to pay for generous health care and higher education benefits for Saudi citizens.
And officials said oil price fluctuations throughout the gulf crisis may be resulting in less of a continuing windfall for the Saudis than is generally assumed.
 
Choices Other Than Loans
 The Government has several options available in addition to borrowing from international banks. It could, for example, order state-owned corporations like Saudi Aramco to increase dividends to the Government, slow down payment on its bills or simply stop spending so much money.
The gulf crisis has clearly disrupted the free spending ways of years past.
In the first three months of 1991, a Western diplomat said, the Saudis pledged $13.5 billion to the American war effort. That includes the cost of providing fuel for all American vehicles and aircraft and supplying hundreds of thousands of gallons of fresh drinking water to more than 450,000 American air and ground personnel.
In that same period, the Government committed $6 billion more to aid countries like Turkey and Egypt that have suffered economically due to sanctions against Iraq.
A Western diplomat said the cost of the gulf crisis had surprised the Saudis to some extent.
The Western official said that while a sober reckoning had gripped senior Saudi officials, including the ruling royal family, there was no sense of panic.

HEADLINE: Mardi Gras Reveling Marked By Darts at Iraq and Hussein

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of revelers lined New Orleans streets today as the habitual drinking and rowdiness of Mardi Gras blended with wartime patriotism.
Effigies of Saddam Hussein hung from oak trees and lampposts, and among the usual scantily clad men and women along parade routes were dozens of people dressed as the Statue of Liberty, Betsy Ross or soldiers.
"I'm the most popular person to hate," said Pat Fanning, dressed in Arab robes and headdress. A missile appeared to be sticking through his mid-section. "I tell everyone it came down the chimney of my bunker and got me."
Donna Crowe, a medical technician from Evansville, Ind., who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty. said: "You can forget about the war for a little while, especially today. But it will be back before long."
The weather was nearly ideal for outdoor merriment: partly cloudy, with temperatures in the upper 60's. Parade-goers had camped out overnight, setting up tents and barbecue grills, to stake out the best places along parade routes. They wanted to be in position to catch beads and other trinkets tossed by maskers on the hundreds of floats in successive parades on Mardi Gras, French for Fat Tuesday, the day before Lent begins.
 
Talk of Cancellation
 Parades included the procession of Rex, King of Carnival and head of a secretive "krewe" of high society, old-money businessmen. Also rolling was the all-black Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, which started 75 years ago as a spoof of the more staid, all-white krewes.
Parodies of Iraqi dress were the costume of choice for many. There had been talk of canceling Carnival parades when the Persian Gulf war broke out, but city officials said that would be economic suicide in a city still suffering the effects of the oil bust. Officials estimated that Mardi Gras would mean about $480 million for the local economy this year.

HEADLINE: War? Poverty? In Rio, Carnaval Goes On

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Toasting the crowd from an exclusive box, Brazil's most famous transvestite blew kisses. A television actress in a red satin dress swayed dangerously over a brass rail clutching a champagne glass. Below, a mass of pirates and Polynesians, clowns and cancan dancers danced on, fueled by rivers of beer and a blasting samba band.
Perspiring in the thick tropical night, King Momo maneuvered his 528-pound frame through the door and collapsed on a red velour love seat, surrounded by his bikini-clad queen and princesses. "I'm king of the largest people's celebration in the world," bellowed Momo, otherwise known as Reinaldo de Carvalho. 
 Rain or shine, war or peace, economic boom or bust, the pre-Lenten Carnaval once again convulsed this beachfront city with four days of merrymaking, sensuality and spectacle. The celebration ends Wednesday with a municipal hangover known elsewhere as Ash Wednesday.
Carnaval connoisseurs, and they are on every street corner here, grumble that this year's festivities have been marred by a series of ills. The Persian Gulf war provoked a string of last-minute cancellations by American and European tourists; Brazil's economic depression caused samba associations to cut corners on parade costumes and floats; crime and commercialism channeled festivities off the streets and into tickets-only balls and parades, and the spread of AIDS again has raised the price of a weekend of libertinism.
While images of Rio's revelry annually enliven television news shows the world over, few cameras focus on the millions of Brazilians who flee the event. In a great migration Friday, 250,000 cars crossed the Rio-Niteroi bridge, one of four major escape routes to beaches and mountains outside this city of seven million people. Bus companies added 1,400 buses on Friday to help residents escape Rio's salute to the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer.
The Roman Catholic Church, a historic opponent of carnival, has in recent years held religious retreats for people who want to shut out the annual excess. They have proved so popular that this year a church group, Catholic Charismatic Renewal, rented Maracanazinho, a 25,000-seat soccer stadium.
As carnival started to unfold Saturday, Eugenio Cardinal Sales, the Catholic Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, warned in a front-page newspaper essay, "Two aspects characterize Carnaval among us today: pornography and violence."
Criticizing live television coverage of the private balls, like the one at Scala where Rogeria, the transvestite, blew kisses, the cardinal warned of "condemnable exhibitions" that take place in "closed clubs where orgies and bacchanalia dominate."
Turning to the highpoint of Carnaval, the nightlong parades of the competing samba associations, the cardinal wrote: "The poor save their miserable salaries all year long to to consume them in ephemeral extravagances of a fleeting happiness. Extraordinary sums of money come from dubious sources; luxury and waste clash with reining misery."
But in Brazil, where more copies of Playboy are sold than in the United States, the sermons against hedonism did not appreciably ebb the tide of revelers.
"Brazil's Carnaval makes people feel uninhibited," Ricardo Amaral, a restaurant and nightclub empresario, said Monday night as he stood in a parade box, holding a glistening glass of cold beer. "It's a collective uncorking. It isn't just people playing: it's protest, it's euphoria, it's relaxation."
A few feet away, Karla Kweatkowski, Miss Brazil, gushed about dancing the samba in high heels and a rhinestone bikini atop a 30-foot float. "The whole avenue is singing your school's song," she said of the 70,000 people that filled bleachers and boxes on the "sambodromo," as the parade avenue is known. "And you are appearing on national television."
And at the Saturday night costume contest, the word austerity had no translation in Portuguese. Glittering from head to toe in sequins and rhinestones, men and women vied for the prize in monuments to narcissism that included 12-foot high peacock feather fans that brushed chandeliers.
This year, several European cities -- Venice, Nice and Vienna -- canceled carnival, partly out of fear of terrorism, partly out of fear of the unseemliness of cavorting while fighting rages in the Persian Gulf. In Rio, where Carnaval is a deeply rooted event, the idea of canceling was never seriously discussed.
"I am very sad that some carnivals were canceled," Trajano Monteiro Ribeiro, president of Rio's state tourism agency, said after watching a samba association disappear down the avenue in a sea of feathers. "People drink, people dance, people sing -- Carnaval is humanity's re-encounter with its original happiness."
Dressed in a turquoise lame tuxedo and matching two-foot high hat, Marcos Aurelio found the idea of cancellation outlandish. "They have their war over there in Arabia," said Mr. Aurelio, a print-shop employee who led the 80-minute, six-block parade of his association, Portela. "Just because they are fighting doesn't mean we can't be happy over here."
Reflecting the traditional insouciance of Rio residents, the only visible impact of the war was a hot-selling item: the Saddam Hussein mask. Sold as fast as they could be stamped and painted, the plastic masks featured the Iraqi leader with a demonic grin and his trademark mustache.
The runner-up in mask sales was an unflattering rendering of Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the nation's economy minister. Many Brazilians apparently had a hard time deciding which figure was scarier.
The Persian Gulf war plays daily on the television news. But Brazil's economy, under the reins of Miss Cardoso since last March, shrank 4.3 percent last year. Hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs. Inflation in January ran at a monthly rate of 20 percent.
Reflecting the minister's failing grip on the economy, a price freeze decreed two weeks ago was universally ignored during Carnaval. Beer, the life blood of the festivities, sold for $1.40 a can, twice the official price.
One result of the Persian Gulf crisis was that this year's Carnaval was one of the most Brazilian in memory. While hotels outside Rio were booked solidly with fleeing residents of the city, Rio's beachfront hotels had to advertise in Sao Paulo to fill rooms left empty by cancellations from overseas.
Several foreigners that came said they had a wonderful time.
"I feel safer here," said John Gillespie, a visiting investment banker, as he sipped a bloody mary after attending an all-night ball. "My office building in New York has an oil company."
On Monday night, John Casablancas, owner of Elite Model Management, hoisted himself off the avenue into a box sponsored by Brahma beer and picked his way through miniskirted actresses and models to reach the bar.
"Brazilian women have a sensuality that is incredible," Mr. Casablancas said, still enthusiastic after watching a float on which topless women danced the samba under portable showers. "If President Bush can go to his weekend house during the war, why can't Brazilians enjoy Carnaval?"

A Fictional Desert War a Lot Like the Real One

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Something to Die For
By James Webb
333 pages. William Morrow. $19.95.
James Webb has it right from the start in his prescient Washington-and-war novel. His story takes place in a fictional future in the sands of a third-world country. With a mixture of irony and flackery, the military action in his book is called Operation Justifiable Anger. If that reminds readers of Operation Desert Storm, well, the whole tone of his informative and cynical novel suggests that it's supposed to. 
 "Something to Die For" will not be appreciated by the hasty hawks and surgical strikers in Washington and elsewhere. To the author, such experts appear as bigger targets than the old cold war enemies who are encountered on an accidental battlefield in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea. In the imagination, it's easy to transfer these places to Iraq and the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Webb's story properly begins in the corridors of the White House, the Pentagon and Congress. Here, ambitious men and women smile and scheme on the battlefield of power, where no prisoners are taken. Only scant consideration is given to the real casualties that may result on some distant war front from their political and military folly.
The reader is immediately made aware that this isn't going to be just another us-against-them, high-tech story; that here is a novelist with something tough-minded to say that goes beyond wild-blue-yonder weaponry. As his ship heads toward the war zone, Bill Fogarty, the gallant Marine colonel who serves as the conscience of the novel, smells something rotten about the mission. The author speaks for his character:
"And times were not good in Washington. Fogarty could sense it from little hints on the news that he never would have noticed had he not spent three years learning the doublespeak of government. The more bellicose members of the Administration seemed especially antsy of late, spoiling for a reason to use military force."
Because fact and fiction are so well intertwined in "Something to Die For," it's useful to give the author's credentials and mention what he has been saying about the Gulf war. He is a highly decorated Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War. Mr. Webb is a Washington insider -- he was an Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy until February 1988. In recent weeks, while expressing confidence in the professionalism of those serving on foreign shores, he has been publicly doubting the wisdom of the Bush Administration's decision to go to war in the Persian Gulf.
Against this personal background, Mr. Webb's "Something to Die For" is all the more compelling as fiction. His previous books, including "Fields of Fire," about a Marine combat unit in Vietnam, are small-scale compared to his new novel. What he says about the compromises, payoffs and hypocrisies of some members of the executive and legislative branches is as authoritative as anything written about Washington in recent years. If only half of it is true, it's truly frightening.
The action in the story is about equally divided between Washington and the war front. In Washington, there's a sleepy-headed President, "gangly and familiar, his face baggy and his hair dyed charcoal-gray," whose aides seem to run his office by popularity ratings. A scene that takes place at a Cabinet meeting is brilliantly done, where jockeying for position is more important than any principle of governance.
In the plot, two powerful rivals are involved in a scandal about the illegal transfer by a Japanese company of military technology to the Soviet Union. One is an Ivy League Secretary of Defense, who knows how to cut throats and manipulate the press; the other is a veteran chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, a womanizer who is out to get the Secretary of Defense's job as well as his wife, a centerfold with brains. The author invites the reader to believe that the chairman's affair with the Secretary's wife is more or less known and acceptable to all three. It's the only part of the book that strains credulity.
The devious Secretary of Defense (but then nearly all the Washington characters are devious) and his good friend, an admiral aptly known as Mad Dog Mulcahy, are looking for a diversion from the scandal involving the Japanese company. What better than a nice little war, on behalf of so-called freedom fighters, that would be directed against the Cubans and the Russians on the Horn of Africa, with the possibility of toppling Fidel Castro?
The Secretary of Defense thinks to himself that what Americans need is a military crisis: "Something fresh, dangerous, and yet remote. Something to unite their anger and get their blood going, without causing them any economic or personal discomfort. Something relatively safe, which would nonetheless demonstrate that America would not be intimidated by the Soviets or their allies. Something that would help justify the defense budget . . ."
This isn't Iraq, and the actual situation in the Horn of Africa has changed in the last year, but in the hands of Mr. Webb, the political motives and military actions come close enough to reality. The battle scenes in the novel, where too many marines die needlessly because of the ambitions of high-ranking officers, are totally believable.
Under heavy fire and wounded, Colonel Fogarty curses the White House: "They toss us into hell, and then worry about the Russians," he reflects. "Anyway," the author continues, "there was no time to think about it. They'd played politics with human lives for longer than he'd been a Marine."
Where the author shines as a true war novelist is in showing both enemy and ally in a human light. This is one of the major achievements in "Something to Die For," a headline novel that is breathtaking in its vision.

HEADLINE: The Poverty Tilt, Magnified

 BODY:
The cities, long America's poorhouses, are now staggering under the burden of caring for the poor, disabled and homeless, as recession bleeds revenues from urban economies. The Bush Administration doesn't care, or at least doesn't notice. President Bush barely mentioned cities or poor people in his State of the Union Message, or his budget presentation, or yesterday's windy Economic Report to Congress.
Whether or not Mr. Bush opens his eyes, there is a compelling case for federalizing programs for poor individuals. State and local governments are not the ideal levels of government to help the poor because they are tempted to stint on benefits, hoping the poor will gravitate to other jurisdictions. Local governments that try to help get socked with large bills for retraining and education, only to have graduates take their new skills to jobs elsewhere. 
 The idea that Washington should pay poorhouse expenses runs directly counter to Mr. Bush's misguided proposal to turn over responsibility for $15 billion in Federal programs to the states. Almost all the eligible programs focus on helping the poor; these should remain Federal responsibilities.
The best way to help the states and cities would be for Washington to increase its share of costs that are logically and reasonably Federal: welfare and Medicaid. If it increased its contribution from 55 percent to, say, 75 percent, that would provide at least $20 billion of relief for state and city coffers. New York City could recoup $3 billion, enough to close its looming budget gap and spare the need to fire teachers and postpone bridge repairs.
Cities house a disproportionate number of poor families. Worse, the cost of providing decent public services is much higher in some cities than elsewhere. And these magnified costs are inescapable; they would exist in even the best-run cities.
By one estimate, Newark, N.J., even well managed, would have to spend $7 to provide the same level of police services that cities without its welfare population could buy for $1; New York would have to spend nearly $5. That variable burden is poorly understood -- and intolerable.
The poor need police protection, adequate schools and medical services no matter where they live. But as Prof. Helen Ladd of Duke and John Yinger of Syracuse University have shown, many central cities can't afford to do the job.
They estimate how much 86 U.S. cities would need to spend, assuming efficient bureaucracies, to provide public services of average quality. They also estimate the capacity of a city's economy to generate taxes. For many cities, the gap between needs and capacity is huge, and growing.
Yet this research also gives cause for optimism. Though many cities can't provide for all their needs, the problem is concentrated in places like Newark, New York and New Orleans. Professors Yinger and Ladd estimate it would cost $17 billion to close 10 percent of the services gap for the six worst-off cities. And to do that for the 40 worst-off cities would require less than $30 billion.
In other words, the fiscal problem is not bottomless. These figures suggest that by concentrating on select, severely depressed cities, Washington could make a big difference.
The idea of compensating cities for their unusual poorhouse expenses is not utopian. Massachusetts implemented just such a plan six years ago, allocating aid to cities according to a formula that accounts for need and revenue-raising capacity. Minnesota is considering a similar plan.
Poverty is a national problem; it demands a Federal solution. This one is workable, if only the Bush Administration were willing to work at it.

Ford Is Reported To Delay Models

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Detroit Free Press reported that the Ford Motor Company would delay the introduction of two new luxury cars and one mini-van. The newspaper, citing engineering sources at Ford and an auto analyst, said the No. 2 United States car maker was pushing back the introduction of its 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII, the 1995 Lincoln Continental and the 1994 Aerostar mini-van. Ford declined to comment.
The newspaper said introduction of the Mark VIII had been shifted from the spring of 1992 to the fall, while the Continental would make its debut in the fall of 1994 instead of the spring of 1994. Chris Cedergren, an analyst at J. D. Power & Associates, said the introduction of a new Aerostar would come in the spring of 1994.

McGwire Stands Tall Under Scouting Pressure

SERIES: The Making of a Pro: Third article of a series that will appear periodically about Dan McGwire as he prepares for the National Football League draft on April 21.

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Throughout the past weekend, athletes had come through the hotel lobby in search of a ride to the airport and an airplane to take them far from the most elaborate, unique and economically significant inspection of their football lives.
They had just endured the National Invitational Camp, an annual event conducted for the 28 National Football League teams that will help determine the selections made in the league's draft on April 21-22 and the order of the marketplace for a new generation of players.
Many of the athletes, from little-known small-college players to all-Americans who admitted they had been intimidated by the process, appeared as if they had just experienced the back-breaking final examination best immediately forgotten regardless of how well they thought they might have done.
 
Feeling Confident
 And then there was Dan McGwire, projected by many to be the first quarterback chosen nine weeks from Sunday, who was asking friends if they were headed for the hotel's hot tub. McGwire appeared as if he had completed his test 45 minutes early and had used the remainder of the time efficiently compiling a list of Things to Do.
Just after his six-hour workout, the climax of a player's three-day experience in the Hoosier Dome, was completed late Monday afternoon, McGwire had seemed to master an essential requirement for someone who aspires to become the highest rated quarterback in the draft-day class of 1991.
Never let them see you sweat.
 
Likes His Position
 "I feel like I'm in a very good position right now," McGwire said. "This is just one more hurdle to get over, and I think I did it successfully. I feel very good about myself."
The only disappointment he mentioned was that unlike most of the players, quarterbacks and receivers had not been asked to lift a 225-pound weight as many times as possible. McGwire had hoped that test would hold evidence of his strength and create one more favorable impression.
If the familiar faces in the Dome, the people who determine the success or failure of football careers, were there to evaluate the quarterback from San Diego State against some of the best competition in the nation, McGwire worked to make sure their presence would not affect what they saw.
"I never thought one time, 'There are people watching me,' " McGwire said. "It was just me and the receivers."
 
Happy With the Drills
 McGwire quietly said he had been pleased with everything he was asked to do: a three-step drop and pass to a receiver running a quick, 5-yard pattern. A five-step drop and a 12-yard pattern. A seven-step drop and a 20-yard pattern.
He rolled out to the right and threw on the run. He stepped to the left and threw 20 yards downfield. Quick slants. Out-routes. In-routes. Curl routes. Streak patterns. Post-corner routes. Anything that the eyes in attendance might have missed, cameras captured for subsequent coast-to-coast film inspections.
"I didn't want to look around," McGwire said. "I wanted to stay focused and do the best I could do. I didn't let the outside stuff distract me. I know there were people out there thinking, 'Oh my God, this coach or that coach is looking at me.' That can put that much more pressure on you."
After the end of an event that seems designed for the purpose of flaw detection, McGwire's imperfections appear minimal. His unofficial 40-yard time of just over 5 seconds was not considered alarmingly slow.
 
Praise From Giants' Young
 "I don't think anybody had a better arm," said George Young, vice president and general manager of the Giants. "He certainly was impressive with arm strength. Not knocking people over or anything; he can make the throws he needs to make. His touch seems to be pretty good."
McGwire's size -- he was measured here as 6 feet 7.7 inches -- makes him different, and in some N.F.L. opinions, different is usually seen as bad. While Young said he could not tell how high McGwire would be selected, he did not see a problem.
"You'll probably have to adjust your style of offense a little," he said. "It's not as easy for a 6-foot-8-inch guy to ball-handle as a 6-foot-2-inch guy. His legs are going to get in people's way.
"But guys can break the mold. I don't think his height will be the major factor. How quick he gets out from the center, how quick he gets rid of the ball, those things are going to be factors. He's got great vision, obviously, because he's tall."
"I thought he ran fairly well for a big man," said Ernie Accorsi, executive vice president of the Cleveland Browns. "He moved around better than I expected him to. That was a part of him that impressed me. He was really impressive."
 
And Now, the Waiting
 After the succession of decisions McGwire has made in his brief career -- the original choice of the University of Iowa, then the transfer to San Diego State that he said made this opportunity possible -- he now faces an emotional intermission.
He has earned his college degree in public administration. His part in the evaluation process is nearly complete. Now there is little to do but continue his early-morning training regimen, spend time with his girlfriend, Dana Orlich, and perform for the scouts that conduct follow-up visits to the campus.
And wait.
"There's a big itch in my back I can't get to scratch right now," McGwire said.

HEADLINE: Robert Wagner, 80, Pivotal New York Mayor, Dies

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY

 BODY:
Robert Ferdinand Wagner, who oversaw a vivid transformation of the city's politics and even its personality in three terms as Mayor, died early yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
The police and emergency medical technicians were summoned at 3:30 A.M. to his town house on East 62d Street, where the ailing former Mayor was pronounced dead of heart failure. He had been suffering from bladder cancer. 
 Mr. Wagner's cautious style frustrated his critics, but helped New York City cope with the accelerating pace of its social, economic and polical evolution. He presided from 1954 through 1965 with sagaciousness, grace and dry wit as the keystone of a political dynasty: his father was a United States Senator; his son, who is known as Robert F. Wagner Jr., has been elected and appointed to city posts in his own right.
 
Defeated His Mentors
 Only two other modern Mayors of New York City -- Fiorello H. La Guardia and Edward I. Koch -- served for 12 years, too. None surpassed Mr. Wagner's 1957 plurality of more than 920,000 votes. After he left City Hall, he was appointed a diplomat overseas and became a trusted adviser to political figures in New York, Albany and Washington. Twice, though, his "sentimental journey," as he once described it, to succeed his father in the Senate ended in failure.
Yet his legacy for New York, a city that his father had adopted as a German immigrant, was profound. He was inaugurated as its 102d mayor during a period that, in retrospect, typified simpler times. When he left 12 years later, social and economic pressures had turned New York into a city that critics said epitomized the urban dilemma and his administration's reticence in responding to it.
Flexing his political muscle, Mr. Wagner won infusions of state and Federal funds to clear slums in urban-renewal areas, build public housing and to help maintain the 15-cent subway fare. He granted collective-bargaining rights to municipal labor unions. He integrated government with more black and Hispanic appointees who began to reflect the city's rapidly changing population. And his third-term campaign against his estranged political mentors dealt the Democratic machine a defeat from which it has never recovered.
His administration contributed to bringing Shakespeare to Central Park and a World's Fair to Flushing Meadow. But his city also lost two institutions, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the baseball Giants to California, although the Mayor was instrumental in luring another National League franchise, the Mets, to a new stadium in Queens.
 
'Servant of the People,' Who Was an Institution
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who once described Mr. Wagner as the city's greatest mayor, said yesterday: "A large, living piece of our best political history has fallen away, and there is nothing adequate to replace it. Robert Wagner was a superb public person, servant of the people and adviser to their leaders -- so great, he became and will remain an institution."
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who ordered flags on municipal buildings to be flown at half-staff for 30 days, traced his own election as the city's first black mayor, in part, to Mr. Wagner's role in the election of the first black Democratic leader of Manhattan. Mr. Dinkins said Mr. Wagner "made dignity and decency the watchwords of a long career of government service."
Former Mayor Koch said Mr. Wagner and La Guardia were the city's two best mayors. Former Mayor John V. Lindsay, a long-time antagonist, described Mr. Wagner, his immediate predecessor, as New York's "first modern mayor."
 
He Never Succeeded At 'Sentimental Journey'
 Mr. Wagner started his political career as a protege of Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party machine that had controlled city affairs for most of 150 years. By 1961, he had broken with Tammany and its chief, Carmine G. De Sapio, and had defeated the organization. In defeating Tammany, he had espoused the self-designated Democratic reform movement, which he took over himself rather than becoming its servant.
His greatest political failure came in 1956, when at the urging of former President Harry S. Truman and other powerful Democrats, he ran for the United States Senate against the Republican incumbent, Jacob K. Javits. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's sweep of the state in the election helped Mr. Javits win; Mr. Wagner never got another chance to run for the seat his father had once held. In 1952, the state party had rejected his offer to run against Senator Irving M. Ives.
Publicly, Mr. Wagner denied he was disconsolate that he had never gone to Washington in his father's footsteps. Privately, he conceded that he would have liked to follow his father, also named Robert Ferdinand Wagner. Once his time had passed, the former Mayor harbored the same ambition for his own son.
Mr. Wagner also failed in an attempt to gain the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1969, and in 1973 a deal that would have made him the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor also collapsed.
In his later years, Mr. Wagner was active as a lawyer, and was periodically consulted in Washington and in Albany.
Vicariously, he participated in politics and government through the career of his oldest son, Robert F. Jr., who was a City Councilman, an unsuccessful candidate for borough president of Manhattan, chairman of the City Planning Commission, a Deputy Mayor under Mr. Koch and head of the city's Board of Education from 1986 to 1990.
Mayor Wagner had himself been chairman of the City Planning Commission and had served as Borough President on his way to City Hall.
As Mayor and the most powerful figure in New York Democratic politics in the early 1960's, he was also a kingmaker, supporting John F. Kennedy over Adlai E. Stevenson for the Presidential nomination at the party's 1960 national convention. In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson had Mr. Wagner sit near Mrs. Johnson at the party's national convention in Atlantic City, stimulating speculation that the Mayor might be Mr. Johnson's choice for Vice President.
 
Expressed Special Pride In His Diplomatic Roles
 Mr. Johnson rewarded Mr. Wagner for his support in 1968 when he named him Ambassador to Spain, a post that Mr. Wagner held for nearly a year, resigning after the Nixon Administration arrived in Washington.
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter, whose New York campaign he had supported in 1976, named him the unofficial United States representative to the Vatican, a post he held until 1981.
By the end of the 1970's, Mr. Wagner had become as much a socially prominent figure in the city as a political one. His presence at nightclubs and social events, with his third wife, the former Phyllis Fraser Cerf, the widow of Bennett Cerf, the publisher and humor anthologist, was occasionally chronicled in gossip columns.
Mr. Wagner and his first wife, the former Susan Edwards, the sister of his roommate at Yale, were married in the rectory of St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1942. They had two sons, Robert Jr., born in 1944, and Duncan, born three years later. Susan Wagner died of cancer in 1964, and when Mr. Wagner announced in June 1965 that he was not seeking re-election, he said, with tears running down his cheeks, that he was quitting public life to honor her last wish for him.
In 1965, described by friends as lonely and depressed at his first wife's death, he married Barbara Jean Cavanagh, the sister of his former Fire Commissioner, Edward Cavanagh. The marriage ended in a civil divorce and church annulment in 1971. Mr. Wagner married Mrs. Cerf in 1975.
Mr. Wagner was literally reared in the politics of the city he was to govern for 12 years. His mother died when he was 9 years old, and he was brought up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan by his father, who rose to be one of the most prominent and powerful supporters of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
By the time that young Robert became Mayor, at the age of 43, the city was undergoing profound change as post-World-War-II prosperity enabled middle-class whites to start moving to the suburbs in waves. They were replaced largely by blacks from the South and Puerto Ricans lured here by the hope of better jobs and less racial discrimination than they had found in other parts of the country, as well as relatively generous welfare benefits.
Mr. Wagner, even his critics acknowledged, grasped the enormity of the social problems that were accelerating and sought in a deliberate, methodical way to solve them. This quality of deliberation, which his detractors sometimes called indecision or ineptitude and which was often marked by the appointment of a study commission, he had learned from his father, who, the Mayor often repeated, had counseled him: "When in doubt, don't."
The Mayor, in reviewing his career after announcing in 1965 that he would not seek re-election that year against his challenger, Mr. Lindsay, said of his own stewardship: "The days of scandal, the days of political influence, getting contracts and assistance from the city have disappeared, and I believe I hand on to my successor a government that had changed radically in this way."
 
Was It Good Old Days Or the Crisis to Come?
 As Mayor, Mr. Wagner usually appeared placid, if not phlegmatic, in public. Privately, he had a sharp sense of humor that could deflate an adversary or break tension among his aides.
In referring to his record in office in starting or completing several large slum-clearance and renewal projects, he acknowledged that he was disappointed with his administration's performance on housing by saying: "I had hoped we could have moved even faster in our clearing of the slums. We got bogged down in red tape here and in Washington."
"I think part of the reason for the mistakes," he said, "was the fact that these were new programs and we had to feel our way along. I had hoped that we would be further on our way to the slumless city that I always said must be our goal."
But whether the Wagner era at City Hall marked the peak of the good old days, or the beginning of the city's fiscal and social crises, is debatable. The Daily News sometimes praised him, but sometimes called him "Bumbling Bob." The New York Herald Tribune ran a series of articles in 1965, as its publisher, John Hay Whitney, was persuading Mr. Lindsay to run for Mayor, that portrayed a "city in crisis" and blamed Mr. Wagner.
Years after he left office, Mr. Wagner recalled the series with a bitter smile, but remembered that The Herald Tribune had also written on its editorial page that "New York City has probably never been better governed" than under him.
 
Relied on Financial Help From Rockefeller
 His contention that he had cleaned up city government was largely true. In his 12 years in office there were no major scandals, and the minor ones never came close to impugning Mr. Wagner's personal honesty. He was also credited by associates, friends and opponents as having generally raised the caliber of people he appointed to such high-level offices as commissioners.
It was during his administrations that nonwhites began to get more and more jobs in the city's growing Civil Service ranks; antidiscrimination laws and the Mayor's personal policies were far in advance of the policies and practices of labor unions and private businesses.
While city spending grew under Mr. Wagner, he was always able in his last two terms to persuade Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and the State Legislature to bail him out with more state aid or increased taxing power. Mr. Wagner and Mr. Rockefeller, although from opposing parties, trusted each other's word.
During his administrations, Mr. Wagner was also instrumental in the establishment of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the creation of the city's part of the Gateway National Park, including the Jamaica Bay wildlife preserve and the beach at Breezy Point, Queens, and the fluoridation of the city's drinking-water supply.
He was particularly proud that he had resisted opposition to letting Joseph Papp, later to become one of the most distinguished theatrical producers of public theater in the world, start his "Shakespeare in the Park" program in Central Park.
"You know," he said years after he left office, "that I had a hell of a time with some people who told me not to let Joe Papp in because they said he was a Communist."
 
Childhood Upbringing Of Opera and Poker
 Robert Ferdinand Wagner Jr., as he was known for much of his life, was born on April 20, 1910, in Yorkville, where his father, who would be elected to the Senate in 1925, was already one of the most prominent lawyers and politicians.
When his mother, the former Margaret Mary McTague, died in 1919, young Robert's rearing was taken over by his father.
The elder Mr. Wagner took his son to the opera on Friday nights, invited him to Washington frequently and let him watch the poker games played at their Yorkville home with politicians who included Alfred E. Smith, later Governor of New York and a Presidential candidate.
The conversations that the future Mayor heard among the Roosevelt New Deal Democrats who visited the Wagner home helped form his political and personal manner. Long after he had become a wealthy lawyer, out of office, he retained his reputation as someone who would let almost anyone else pick up the bill for his breakfast or lunch.
He was educated at the Loyola School, a Jesuit institution on Park Avenue, and at the Taft School, at Watertown, Conn. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1933 and later studied at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and the School of International Studies in Geneva. He received a law degree from Yale in 1937, the same year he was elected to the New York State Assembly and a year before he was admitted to the bar.
During World War II he served in the Air Corps as an intelligence officer. Once, at an American air base in England, a plane returning from a combat mission tried to jettison its bombs in the Channel, but missed, hitting the base and ruining Mr. Wagner's hearing in his left ear. Before he left active duty as a lieutenant colonel, Mr. Wagner had received the Bronze Star and the French Croix de Guerre.
 
After World War II, An Advancing Career
 After the war, his political career began to move swiftly, with his father's help and his own energy. He was a somewhat short, plump figure, which prompted William O'Dwyer, who was the Mayor then, to comment: "Here comes young Bob Wagner, wearing his father's pants."
But Mayor O'Dwyer appointed the young man as City Tax Commissioner, and Mr. Wagner later also held appointive posts as Commissioner of Housing and Buildings and as chairman of the City Planning Commission. In 1949 he was elected Manhattan Borough President, defeating Oren Root.
In November 1953, six months after his father's death, Mr. Wagner was elected Mayor for the first time, following a bitter fight among the city's five Democratic county organizations. None of the political machines had controlled the two previous Mayors, Mr. O'Dwyer and Vincent R. Impellitteri, and the leaders were lusting for their own winner.
Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, after a raucous meeting at the Commodore Hotel in July, decided to support Mr. Impellitteri. Manhattan's Tammany Hall leader, Mr. De Sapio, and the two Bronx leaders, Edward J. Flynn and Charles A. Buckley, announced their support for Mr. Wagner.
Mr. Wagner defeated Mr. Impellitteri, easily in the primary. In the general election he was chosen Mayor with less than a majority of the votes cast, polling 1,021,488 votes to 661,410 for Harold Riegelman, a Republican, and 468,392 for City Council President Rudolph Halley, a Liberal who had gained national publicity as counsel for a Federal anti-crime commission that had held hearings in New York and elsewhere.
 
Left Tammany Hall For Reform Movement
 In 1957, Mr. Wagner, running with the endorsement of the Democratic, Liberal and Fusion Parties, won by the largest plurality in the city's history -- 923,007 votes -- over the Republican, Robert K. Christenberry.
His split with the Tammany and other county leaders began in 1958, when the regular state Democratic organization split with former Gov. Herbert H. Lehman and Eleanor Roosevelt in its choice of a candidate for the United States Senate. The division spawned the self-styled reform movement in New York City and forced Mr. Wagner, as he sought re-election in 1961, to choose.
He went over to the reformers, now facing the ire and power of the very party leaders who had sponsored his first mayoral candidacy. The party's state chairman, Michael H. Prendergast, said of Mr. Wagner's political ability: "He's so light he could tap-dance on top of a Charlotte Russe," a whipped-cream and cake confection once sold widely on city streets in springtime.
To oppose Mr. Wagner, his former supporters, whom he now called "the bosses," chose State Comptroller Arthur Levitt, a strong candidate in statewide races. Mr. Wagner won the primary with more than 60 percent of the vote. In the general election, Mr. Wagner defeated another statewide invincible, Louis J. Lefkowitz, the Republican State Attorney General who was widely known in the city, where he was born and raised on the Lower East Side. Mr. Wagner, running on the Democratic, Liberal and Brotherhood lines, defeated Mr. Lefkowitz and City Comptroller Lawrence E. Gerosa. Mr. Wagner had dropped Mr. Gerosa as his running mate in favor of his Budget Director, Abraham D. Beame, who had the support of the regular Brooklyn party organization.
 
Developed the Ability To Eliminate Tension
 By his third term, Mr. Wagner had further developed, and in some ways changed, his manner of running the city. He was not a particularly early riser and was often late for his first appointment of the day. He chain-smoked cigarettes, a habit he did not stop until after he left office, and liked to drink bourbon. By 1962 he had stopped drinking bourbon, switching to dry vermouth, which, he said, allowed him to have a drink in his hand at the interminable round of parties and dinners he had to attend, without its affecting his concentration.
While his public appearance was usually dour and somewhat uneasy and stiff, privately he could tell an off-color joke without seeming excessively vulgar, and he knew how to bring down the pompous and the outraged with a remark.
During the newspaper strike negotiations that he brought to City Hall in early 1963, one of Mr. Wagner's aides, a man of short physical stature, burst into his office, furious, and shouted, "Do you know what burns my backside?" Mr. Wagner leveled his palm a few feet above the floor and said "Yeah, a flame about this high." The tension melted.
After retiring from active politics, Mr. Wagner was consulted, and asked for support, by many prominent politicians, including Senator George McGovern, whose 1972 Presidential campaign was headed in New York by the former Mayor; Hugh L. Carey, a Brooklyn Congressman who successfully ran for Governor in 1974; President Carter, and two of Mr. Wagner's successors in City Hall, Mr. Beame and Edward I. Koch.
In 1976, his law firm was merged into the firm that later became Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey. He was a partner there until 1987 and then joined Fischbein, Badillo & Wagner. In the 1980's he also served as a member of the city's Charter Revision Commission. In 1989 New York University named its school of public service for him.
 
Found Few Politicians That He Could Trust
 Of the man who immediately followed him in City Hall, Mr. Wagner wrote, "Part of the reason the Lindsay administration never fulfilled its high promise stems from the impression held and proclaimed by the Mayor and his subordinates that nothing had ever happened in New York City until John Lindsay took office."
Out of office, Mr. Wagner spoke more candidly of his personal feelings about politics and the city. "There aren't too many people you can trust," he said in an interview in 1965. "And after a while you begin to hold things to yourself."
"Probably the most important appointment you make in a campaign headquarters," he said, "is your telephone operator."
Mr. Wagner is survived by his wife, Phyllis and his two sons, Robert and Duncan.
Visiting will be at Frank E. Campbell funeral chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street, in Manhattan tomorrow and Friday from 7 to 9 P.M. A funeral Mass will be offered at St. Patrick's Cathedral at 10 A.M. Saturday.
 
A Feeling of Home On New York Sidewalks
 Mr. Wagner, who at various times had summer and weekend homes at Islip and Sands Point on Long Island and at Mount Kisco in Westchester County, always considered himself a New Yorker, an East Sider, and spent most of his time there. He said once that he had considered retiring to live "in the South or the Caribbean, or some place like that." Then he said:
"I think that would be great, and I think I could take it for a month or two at a time. I'd always want to come back to New York -- my father's home and my home and, I think, now my sons' home in the years after I'm gone. And I feel a great love for this city, and I'm grateful to this city for the opportunity it gave my father to come up as a little immigrant boy to become the famous United States Senator. It gave me the chance to serve it here, and the privilege of being Mayor."
"You know," he said, "they used to say years ago that New York will be a great city when it's finally built. But, of course, it just is a great city, even now," adding:
"I don't know if it was Bugs Baer, but one of those wags of the past said, 'In the United States, once you leave New York City, everything else is Bridgeport.' "

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about former Mayor Robert F. Wagner of New York City misstated Jacob K. Javits's role in the 1956 race for the United States Senate. Mr. Wagner was defeated by Mr. Javits, a Republican who was then the State Attorney General. They competed for the seat vacated by Senator Herbert H. Lehman, who chose not to run again. Mr. Javits was not the incumbent.

HEADLINE: Forsaking the Mentally Ill

BYLINE: By Oliver Sacks; Oliver Sacks, a neurologist, is author of "Awakenings."

 BODY:
There will be substantial layoffs this month of physicians, nurses, therapists, treatment aides and others at state hospitals throughout New York State. Some 1,200 jobs, including my own, will be eliminated for budgetary reasons.
Apart from the hardship this will cause, I am deeply concerned, even fearful, for our patients. As a neurologist who has worked since 1966 at Bronx Psychiatric Center, I daily encounter the reality of how disabled many of these patients are and how little their needs could be met in any setting but a residential one. 
 When deinstitutionalization was first undertaken in the 1960's, it seemed a noble aim. Coupled with the use of such "wonder drugs" as Thorazine, it was perceived as a humane way of returning patients to their communities while cutting the costs of their treatment.
In practice, deinstitutionalization did not work. The vast majority of the patients discharged from state hospitals were not looked after by the community, were not adequately treated by outpatient facilities and rapidly drifted into homelessness, destitution, misery and sometimes death. Indeed, the late Seymour Kaplan, the psychiatrist who pioneered deinstitutionalization in New York State, often said later that it was the gravest error he had ever made.
Under ideal conditions, that is, in communities where there may be a very exceptional communal sense of responsibility, deinstitutionalization can work. But in a large, bustling, indifferent city, such as New York, it has no chance of success.
There is indeed a "hard core" -- perhaps 25,000 in New York State alone -- of very disabled patients who have to live in chronic hospitals. Most are deeply psychotic and lacking in social skills; many in addition have medical, physical and neurological problems: retardation, autism, epilepsy, AIDS, Alzheimer's.
In addition to these permanently ill people, there are others, another 25,000, who do very well outside, for years at a time, with adequate support and crisis facilities and medication -- but then relapse, become deeply psychotic again and have to be readmitted, often forcibly, to the hospital. City and university hospitals have limited capacity and can admit psychiatric patients for only short periods. The relapsed schizophrenic, however, needs months to restabilize, and only state hospitals can provide such long-term care.
Nothing has been sadder than the steady deterioration of the state hospital system since the mid-1970's. The hospitals are not only underpopulated but dirty and dilapidated. They have come to labor more and more heavily under the costly burden of a huge administrative, nonmedical machinery. There has not been a medically qualified director of the Bronx Psychiatric Center, for example, for a decade; the present administration never visits the wards, has no experience, no idea, of the needs and realities of medical care.
And yet, precisely at this juncture, further cuts are being made. Massive lay-offs have been announced, not only in the huge, bureaucratic machinery, which is the real drain on state resources, but among the few physicians, therapists and treatment aides left. With this, the state hospitals will lose their last care-giving capacity and become little more than warehouses for the sick.
Outpatient clinics, the last resource for deinstitutionalized patients, are also being closed all over the country. For example, the huge crisis center at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco, which looks after 10,000 patients a year, is scheduled to close next month. All psychiatric care in the U.S. is being dangerously cut back now.
There are 80,000 desperately ill and wretched people on our streets, not only homeless and endangered, and perhaps dangerous to others, but often in a nightmare of their own psychoses. These people need institutional care. We must not reduce the state hospitals to shadows of themselves, but restore and adapt them into streamlined, economically efficient strongholds of care. We need to restructure our state hospitals, not close them.

Coffee Prices Surge Again On Worries of Tight Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices leaped higher yesterday in heavy trading on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid mounting worries about the availability of Brazilian and Central American beans.
Oil futures, meanwhile, fell as home-heating oil declined with warming temperatures in Europe. 
 Coffee settled 3.1 cents to 4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 91.2 cents a pound, a two-month high.
Coffee futures have made several jumps in the last week since the start of a dock workers' strike at the Brazilian port of Santos, the leading coffee port of the world's biggest coffee-producing country.
"If the strike were to persist, it would be very disruptive to the coffee market," said Arthur Stevenson, coffee analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
He said coffee futures were also supported by continued tight availability of high-quality beans, especially from Central America.
 
Cut in Crop Estimate
 Other analysts said buying interest was stirred by a downward revision Tuesday of the Agriculture Department's estimate of this year's Brazilian coffee crop to 25 million 132-pound bags from 31 million.
Celeste Georgakis, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc., said the Agriculture Department typically overestimated Brazilian production. She said the new estimate was close to previous industry estimates of 21 million to 24 million bags, but that some Brazilian growers had since lowered their crop projections by another 2 million bags.
She said production estimates were falling because Brazilian economic reforms had reduced agricultural loans, leaving farmers with less to spend on fertilizer and crop care.
Oil prices eased on the New York Mercantile Exchange as home-heating oil futures fell after a rally based on cold weather in Europe ended.
Light sweet crude oil finished 37 cents to 41 cents higher, with March at $22.56 a barrel; heating oil was 0.05 cent to 3.69 cents lower, with March at 67.11 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.81 cent to 1.3 cents gasoline was 0.81 cent to 1.3 cents lower, with March at 62.38 cents a gallon, and natural gas was 0.5 cent lower to 1.3 cent higher, with March at $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Orange juice futures recovered almost all of the steep losses posted Tuesday on the New York Cotton Exchange amid forecasts for chilly temperatures in Florida.
There is little threat to this year's orange crop, which is nearly all harvested, but traders fear the cold temperatures expected on Saturday morning could hurt trees that are now in bloom and damage next year's crop, Ms. Georgakis said.
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.5 cents to 4.15 cents higher, with March at $1.2215 a pound.

HEADLINE: OTAY MESA JOURNAL;
Can One Airport Unite Two Nations?

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTAY MESA, Calif.

 BODY:
For years the flat scrub lands here have been best known for nightly wrangles between illegal Mexican immigrants and the United States Border Patrol. But these days, Otay Mesa has also come to symbolize a far different vision of Mexican-American relations: a proposed binational airport that would join the two countries in a new experiment in cross-border cooperation.
Otay (pronounced oh-TIE) Mesa, thousands of acres of largely undeveloped land on the southern edge of California, is just 40 minutes from San Diego and is one of the few potential sites that city has found for replacing, or at least relieving, its overburdened downtown airport. 
 The mesa's terrain is so flat and mostly treeless that the Mexican side is already home to the Tijuana airport. But low mountains nearby make it impossible to build a new airport on American soil that would operate separately from the Mexican airport.
For many San Diego city officials and politicians, the answer to that problem would be to join a new San Diego airport with the existing Tijuana field in what would be one of the few -- and certainly the largest -- binational airport in the world. Straddling the border, the airport would have separate customs and immigration terminals but enable both countries to share runways that could handle the largest passenger jets.
The idea has provoked sharp opposition from some residents on the American side, who say the complex would create unacceptable noise and other disruptions in an area that had been set aside for industrial, commercial and residential developments. More important, the proposal has received only mixed reactions from the Mexican Government, which would have to approve any cross-border airport.
But proponents remain undaunted, and have gathered a formidable body of technical analyses and political support. In mid-1990, the San Diego Association of Governments, the regional authority charged with overseeing airport development, made public a federally financed study stating the feasibility of the proposed Otay Mesa airport. In late November, a delegation approached Mexican officials for the first time to promote direct government-to-government talks.
"This would change the whole psychology of the region," said Michael C. Abrams, an aide to Councilman Ron Roberts, who has been a big supporter of the airport.
Under the most ambitious plans yet discussed, the airport would cost about $2 billion, cover some 4,000 acres and be able to handle up to 40 million passengers and 400,000 takeoffs and landings a year. San Diego's current airport, Lindbergh Field, has 471 acres and handles 11.5 million passengers a year.
Some who fear the noise and other disturbances such a huge airport would create want a scaled-back version, with only one large new runway and associated terminal buildings.
But all of the configurations would be aimed at giving Otay Mesa the ability to handle long-haul flights of aircraft as large as the Boeing 747, directly linking the region for the first time with such trading partners as Japan and Taiwan.
Together with a new $200 million aircraft maintentance complex now being constructed on the site of the current Tijuana airport, proponents say, the new airport would make the border region a vital new gateway to international trade.
The most formidable obstacle is winning approval of the Mexican Government for a binational commission to study the project. Although many business leaders have expressed support for the plan, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has taken no formal position on it, and Mexico's Secretary of Communications and Transport, Andres Caso Lombardo, has opposed the project.
"The questions of national sovereignty are very important," said San Diego's Deputy Mayor, Bob Filner, whose City Council district includes Otay Mesa, which is administered by San Diego. "Why would either side want to put a major transportation network under the control of the other side?"
But advocates say that, even if President Salinas attempts to derail or postpone the Otay Mesa idea, the pressures generated by northern Mexico's own economic growth will eventually overcome nationalist resistance.
As Jack Koerper, director of special projects for the San Diego government group, put it, "In a few years, they will be coming to us, just like we are coming to them now."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fall 0.9%, Hurt by Drop in Autos

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales in January were nine-tenths of 1 percent lower than in December, the Commerce Department said today, with a sharp drop in auto sales largely responsible for the decline.
Some economists said the figures were better than expected and indicated an end of the unwillingness of consumers to spend. But others said that a sharp revision downward of the December figures was evidence that the end was not in sight. 
 December sales were revised to a 1.5 percent decline from November. They had been reported last month as having declined four-tenths of 1 percent. The adjustment was largely because of lower auto sales.
Falling demand for new cars and cheaper gasoline were the major culprits behind the slumping sales in both January and December, the department reported.
 
Decline From Last Year
 On a year-to-year basis, January retail sales were 1.4 percent lower than in January 1990, when they were valued at $150.3 billion. That represented the first year-to-year decline in nearly 30 years.
The United States Chamber of Commerce said the steeper-than-anticipated drop in December indicated the economy was weakening even faster than was thought at the end of the year.
"The sharp downward revision in December retail sales, along with the decline in January, show the consumer is not ready yet to lead the economy out of recession," the business group said.
Retail sales are considered crucial by economists because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity.
 
Some Expected Worse
 January's decline was less extreme, however, than some analysts had feared. Retail sales had been expected to tumble 1.7 percent as shoppers worried about their jobs and the the Middle East war cut spending.
After excluding cars, sales in January were unchanged after falling seven-tenths of 1 percent in December without cars included. Some categories of sales, including department stores, food stores and restaurants, rose last month.
"This report shows sales were a good deal stronger than was expected on discretionary items," said Russ Sheldon, senior economist with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Analysts noted, however, that the January sales data could be revised downward, particularly if spending weakened dramatically after war broke out in the middle of the month.
 
The Auto and Gas Factor
 The Commerce Department said auto dealer sales fell 4.4 percent in both January and December. Car makers have been lowering assembly rates since late last year with sales falling. The other significant factor in January was cheaper gasoline; dealer sales in the month fell 2.3 percent, after a 1.7 percent December decline.
Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. of Washington, said that it was too soon to say whether consumers were growing more confident, but that it was time to watch for signs that lower interest rates were having an impact.
"We expect to see signs of recovery because of the very big interest rate cuts we've already had," Mrs. Sundrla said. The Federal Reserve Board, she noted, "is accommodating this economy now and political pressure is on to get interest rates even lower."
 
Drop in Durables Sales
 Sales of durable goods -- items meant to last at least three years -- were down 2.8 percent in January after falling 3.4 percent in December. Sales of nondurable goods, like food and disposable items, rose one-tenth of 1 percent after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Sales at general-merchandise stores rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in January after a 1.1 percent fall in December.
Food-store sales increased four-tenths of 1 percent last month after a two-tenths of 1 percent December rise.

HEADLINE: Early-Month Vehicle Sales Down 23.6%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks dropped 23.6 percent earlier in the month as most buyers remained out of the market because of concerns over war and the weak economy.
Dealers and automotive analysts have been saying that most sales in the last month were to fleets and to customers forced to buy a new vehicle, as opposed to those trading in for a newer or more luxurious model. 
 Seasonally adjusted, domestic cars sold at a 6.2 million rate, compared with 7.4 million in the 1990 period.
 
Truck Sales Plunge 31.2%
 The nation's nine domestic auto makers posted sales of 124,885 for Feb. 1-10, compared with 173,859 in the corresponding period last year. The latest period had eight selling days, compared with nine last year.
Light-truck sales plunged 31.2 percent from a year ago, to 52,295 from 96,903. Light-truck sales were harder hit because they are less fuel-efficient and because they reflect the cost-cutting in many businesses, analysts speculated.
"The good news is it hasn't gotten any worse" than in January, said Joel H. Pitcoff, sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company. "The bad news is it isn't any better."
"The loss in volume is certainly no reason to be encouraged," said John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. He noted that popular Japanese brands were experiencing declines as well. "When the most desirable products in the market are off 25 percent it's clear that business is very bad," he said.
Ford's sales declined disproportionately because of comparisons with an unusually strong period last year, Mr. Pitcoff said. The company's car sales were off 35.9 percent, to 32,573. The sales of the Probe, Mustang and Thunderbird models were especially soft, compared with last year
Ford's light-truck sales dropped 31.3 percent, to 21,903 from 35,881. The one bright spot was the new four-door Ford Explorer utility vehicle, which continues to sell strongly.
 
G.M. Posts 12.6% Drop
 The General Motors Corporation outperformed the overall decline in cars. G.M.'s car sales dropped 12.6 percent, to 62,363, from 80,239 last year. The Buick and Pontiac divisions each posted gains. G.M.'s truck sales, however, were worse than average, falling 39.7 percent, to 24,153 from 40,046.
The Chrysler Corporation declines to provide 10-day sales totals. But Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication, estimated its car sales at 13,800 in the period, a 14.4 percent decline from last year. Light-truck sales were estimated at 11,100, a 31 percent decline from last year.
The Honda Motor Company posted a 14 percent decline in car sales, to 6,217. The Nissan Motor Company's car sales dropped 6 percent, to 1,363, and the Toyota Motor Corporation had a 44.4 percent decline, to 3,458.
But Toyota reported that sales of its Lexus luxury cars, which are imported, declined only 14.7 percent, while its imported cars over all declined 32.1 percent.
Nissan's light-truck sales were off 44.3 percent, to 1,647.
 
Less Production
 Most domestic auto makers have been trimming production to prevent inventories from rising too sharply. But the inventory of domestically built light trucks was 115 days of supply at the beginning of February, compared with 96 a month earlier, Ward's said. The car supply was 91 days, compared with 74 days a month earlier. A 65-day supply is normal.
Honda's inventory set a record at the beginning of the month, hitting 88 days' supply, from 70 a month earlier and 39 a year ago. Honda recently said it would trim production to bring inventories in line with sales.
The Big Three this week are operating 27 of their 55 North American car and truck assembly plants. All 12 "transplants" -- factories owned or partly owned by foreign auto makers -- were operating.

HEADLINE: Oil Imports and Inventories Reported Down

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Imports of crude oil and oil products were down sharply last month, the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday, and inventories were also off sharply.
The report echoes a finding by the Energy Department on Monday that crude and product stocks in January were at their lowest levels in several years, with "the potential for creating tight product markets and rising prices in the coming months if major unforeseen problems should develop." 
 Heating oil inventories are down, partly because cold weather in Europe has raised prices there and product stocks are flowing that way. Gasoline inventories are also down.
The Energy Department suggested the reason might be low margins for refiners, and a belief that crude prices would decline, providing a disincentive to make more gasoline now.
 
7.3 Million Barrels a Day
 According to the Washington-based institute, the industry's primary trade organization, imports last month averaged 7.3 million barrels a day, down 20 percent from the previous January. Although last January's imports were unusually high, because of a cold spell, the drop last month follows a trend stretching back to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, on Aug. 2, of lower oil imports.
Experts say several factors are at work. Oil users may be wary of holding high invetories, because of the potential for another crash. With a slow economy and warm weather, domestic demand is down; the institute said yesterday that deliveries were 1.4 percent lower than last January.
Peter C. Beutel, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group, in Hoboken, N.J., said he thought that the leading oil companies had made a tacit agreement with the White House to draw down inventories rather than bid up prices.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Acts On Cellular Competition

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Setting a significant regulatory precedent, the Federal Communications Commission decided today to allow a new form of mobile telephone service in six cities, including New York.
The action erodes current Federal rules that permit only two cellular telephone companies in each city. The new system makes it possible for a company that now provides mobile communications for car and truck fleets to provide mobile telephone service to hundreds of thousands of individuals in a city. 
 Because the new system would closely resemble a third cellular service, it could force cellular companies to cut prices. F.C.C. officials made it clear they would approve similar applications for other cities.
 
Threat in the Long Run
 Industry analysts said traditional cellular companies would still have several practical advantages over the new service, but could lose ground over time.
"Certainly, there is no threat in the near term, but over time this increases the competitive intensity of the business," said Edward Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company.
The cellular industry, which bitterly opposed the new service, denounced the decision and said it was unfair. Robert W. Maher, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association in Washington, said the group might challenge the F.C.C. decision. Charging that the new service would face fewer restrictions than those placed on cellular companies, Mr. Maher said the F.C.C. had imposed a fundamental policy change without holding a public debate.
 
Benefit Seen for Consumers
 Officials of the company that made the proposal, Fleet Call Inc., based in Bloomfield, N.J., were ecstatic. "I'm delighted," said Brian McAuley, the firm's president. "The industry is going to benefit from this, as will consumers. There is no question that another choice for those seeking wireless communications will bring more competitive pricing."
The company plans to build systems in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dallas. A system in Los Angeles should begin operating by early 1993, Mr. McAuley said, and New York should be ready by later that year. The F.C.C. has given the company five years to complete construction.
Much like ordinary cellular service, the system would allow individuals to have conversations without being heard by other customers. It would also be able to patch calls from mobile telephones into the local telephone network, allowing customers to speak with people using regular telephones.
Previously, only two services had been allowed in each city because the available radio spectrum could handle no more. A third service would use a different part of the spectrum, but it would be difficult to find space for more than three.
F.C.C. officials generally applauded Fleet Call's effort to use the radio spectrum more efficiently.
 
'This is a Turning Point'
 "Truly, this is a turning point in the private, land-mobile community," said Ralph Haller, chief of the F.C.C.'s private radio bureau.
But industry experts noted that cellular companies offer several advantages for individual consumers seeking mobile telephones. The biggest advantage is that local cellular companies offer "roaming" service, which allows customers to make or receive calls in distant cities. The Fleet Call system, by contrast, would be limited to use in one locale.
Numerous analysts predicted that Fleet Call's mobile telephones would be more expensive than standard cellular phones, because they would be made in smaller production volumes for a more limited market.
One key issue is whether other providers of mobile radio service will follow Fleet Call's lead in additional cities. If so, it becomes easier to develop nationwide technical standards for the new service.
"Before there can be real competition, this will have to spread beyond Fleet Call" to other companies, said Andrew Roscoe, president of Economic and Management Consultants International, a market research firm in Washington.
 
Microwave Channels for TV
 The F.C.C. also decided today to make it easier to distribute cable television programming over microwave channels. The action could eliminate one of the practical difficulties confronted by "wireless cable" companies that compete against local cable television franchises.
Wireless companies, which typically broadcast programming over microwave frequencies, can reach customers only in their direct line of sight and have difficulty in cities where tall buildings block views.
In today's action, the F.C.C. allowed such companies to use additional microwave frequencies for relaying signals to more locations.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan to Start Talks on Chips

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Japan will reluctantly begin quiet negotiations Thursday over extending a trade agreement that government and industry officials here would much rather let die -- the five-year-old semiconductor accord with the United States.
Officially, the Japanese Government says it sees no need to extend the pact because American chip makers have significantly improved access to the Japanese market. 
 But privately, Japanese officials acknowledge that a new agreement is inevitable, largely to forestall threats of further trade action by Congress. The decision by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to send a delegation to Washington this week seemed to send a clear signal to Japanese industry that some kind of new agreement is on the way.
 
Agreement Signed in 1986
 The agreement was signed in 1986 after one of the most politically charged trade battles of the 1980's. The negotiations followed American complaints that Japan "dumped" memory chips -- sold them below their fair market value -- to drive American makers of dynamic random access memory chips out of the market. In fact, by the time the agreement was signed in 1986, most of the American makers of those chips had left the business. Even under the protection of the accord, none have re-entered it.
The reason for a new agreement is not clear. The Japanese practice of dumping ended several years ago. Critics of the accord say the practice would have stopped without an agreement, once the Japanese manufacturers gained more than an 80 percent share of the market -- and could raise prices at will.
Indeed, the agreement tended to raise prices, and computer makers have complained that the biggest losers were American consumers, who were forced to pay, indirectly, for higher-priced chips.
 
Retaliatory Tariffs
 Japanese electronics makers continue to be rankled by the Reagan Administration's decision in 1987 to impose retaliatory tariffs, after the United States accused the Japanese of failing to comply with the agreement in its first months. These companies have made little secret of their opposition to any extension.
"When the time comes that this agreement expires, our belief is that we will no longer need anything of this nature," Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, the senior executive vice president of the Toshiba Corporation and the head of its semiconductor operations, said last week.
For the Bush Administration, the prospect of a new accord also poses some difficult questions of economic ideology, mostly surrounding the Administration's avowed distaste for "managed trade."
One provision of the 1986 agreement, contained in a secret side letter, the text of which was widely circulated in Washington and Tokyo, set a target of 20 percent penetration of the Japanese market by American semiconductor makers.
The secrecy allowed Japan to maintain the polite fiction that it never committed itself to surrendering a fifth of its market. It also allowed the United States to contend that it was simply clearing away trade barriers so that American makers could freely compete.
Soon after she took office in 1989, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, was harshly critical of the quota, saying it might serve as a limitation on American companies. But now the Bush Administration is under intense pressure from the American semiconductor industry to renew the 20 percent figure, which is now referred to as a goal rather than a quota.
"Our access, while improving, is still far short of 20 percent," Roger Mathus, who heads the Tokyo office of the Semiconductor Industry Association, told a meeting of journalists here today. A joint committee of American semiconductor makers and computer makers said in October that Japan's commitment to a 20 percent market share for foreign companies should be attained at the end of 1992, with perhaps a new target set for later years.
The success of the 1986 agreement is difficult to measure. The two sides still argue bitterly about who is at fault for the relatively poor performance of American chip makers in Japan, and they cannot agree on how much of the market the United States now holds.
The figures cited by American makers indicate that the United States now holds a little more than 13 percent of Japan's market, about three percentage points higher than in 1986. The market itself has grown enormously since 1986.
The Japanese say the market share of American makers is a few percentage points higher. Their numbers include "captive suppliers" like the International Business Machines Corporation, which makes chips in the United States and sells them to its Japanese subsidiary.
Most American suppliers here are now in strategic alliances with Japanese chip makers, sharing the cost of developing products. Others say they have enjoyed some modest success getting their chips designed into future Japanese cars, telecommunications equipment, facsimile machines and a few consumer electronics products, where American chip makers are weakest.
They argue that extending the agreement is important because its pressure is needed to keep Japan using American chips. "Things have gotten better in the last two years," Mr. Mathus said. "But two years is just not long enough to demonstrate the longevity of this."
 
Not Enough Designers
 Japanese companies contend that while the quality of American-made chips has improved, few companies have placed enough designers, support staff and fabrication operations in Japan to provide the kind of service that Japanese suppliers offer. And they argue, as they did five years ago, that the United States has few competitive offerings. American companies dismiss that: Texas Instruments says it produces 45,000 different types of chips and its market penetration in Japan is half its penetration elsewhere in the world. It is also one of the very few American companies that makes its chips here.
Under a new agreement, an elaborate system set up by the United States to assess the fair market value of Japanese chips is likely to be abandoned. Less certain is what will happen to the market access goal. Japanese press reports say the United States has already informally notified Tokyo that it will seek to renew the 20 percent figure. The Japanese contend the target constitutes government interference in the market and there is sufficient political pressure to assure that American market share will grow steadily.
Those American companies whose products Japan cannot replicate or live without do have booming businesses here. NEC and Toshiba are among the biggest customers of the Intel Corporation, which sells the microprocessors used in millions of Japanese portable and desktop computers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Overseas; Gold Falls a Bit in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced on foreign exchange markets yesterday, helped by a British interest rate drop and by signals that the major industrial nations do not want the United States currency to decline further.
Gold prices were mixed, falling slightly in New York after rising overseas. Gold fell 80 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $367.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $366.55, down 20 cents. 
 The decline in British interest rates and a cut that is expected in Japanese rates helped send the dollar higher, said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York.
The Bank of England cut its base rate by one-half of a percentage point, to 13.5 percent, making the pound a less attractive investment. All currencies are supported by higher rates in their home countries and lower rates abroad, so a drop in British yields is a positive sign for the dollar.
Analysts said the dollar was also aided by comments by United States and Japanese officials that the Group of Seven industrial nations did not want the dollar slide any further.
Treasury Under Secretary Charles H. Dallara said in a speech yesterday that the United States did not want a lower dollar. The Bank of Japan governor, Yasushi Mieno, said earlier that the Group of Seven would take coordinated steps to counter a sharp dollar decline. The group consists of Germany, Britain, France, Canada Italy, Japan and the United States.
Central bank intervention on Tuesday on behalf of the dollar also helped the currency yesterday.
The British pound fell to $1.9840 in New York from late Tuesday's $1.9910.
The dollar rose to 129.67 Japanese yen in New York, from 128.65 yen late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to a closing 128.70 yen from 127.70; in London, it rose to 129.05 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York to 1.46395 marks, up from 1.4542.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.2530 Swiss francs, up from 1.2460; 4.9875 French francs, up from 4.9565; 1,100.75 Italian lire, up from 1,094.75, and 1.15365 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15355.
Earlier, gold rose in London to a late bid price of $367.50 a troy ounce, up from $365.95 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $367, up from $365.10. Hong Kong's gold market was closed for the week-long New Year holiday.
Silver rose 3.9 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $3.743 a troy ounce. Earlier, silver rose in London to a late bid price of $3.75 an ounce, up from $3.70 on Tuesday.

Restrictions on air travel between the United States and Canada costs $9.5 billion a year in lost economic activity, according to a study released Tuesday. Liberalizing air travel rules could create up to 210,000 jobs, according to United States Airports for Better International Service, a coalition of 23 American cities, states and airport authorities. The group said limited seat capacity, restricted air routes and poorly situated air transport hubs caused slow growth in air travel between the countries.

HEADLINE: Agents Take Aim at Drugs in Projects

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
The door of a ninth-floor apartment in a Brooklyn housing project swung open at daybreak yesterday, and Sgt. Jeffrey Cea lunged inside with his pistol drawn. With a grab of a shirt front, he swung a startled man into a hallway filled with police officers and Federal agents.
Within minutes, a half-dozen other people were yanked half-asleep out of other apartments in the Red Hook Houses as the New York City Housing Authority police and the Drug Enforcement Administration ended seven months of undercover work against two crack gangs that had been distributing to dealers throughout Brooklyn. 
 The joint operation was an example of how new law-enforcement power is being brought to bear in the city's housing projects, where drug distributors and dealers have outmaneuvered the thinly stretched ranks of the special housing police and have become a deeply entrenched criminal force, law-enforcement officials say.
"In the past we've targeted our agents on high-level international cases," said the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York, Robert A. Bryden. "Now we're starting to divert some of our resources to work with the housing police."
 
'Little One-Upsmanship'
 Assistant Chief Joseph Keeney of the housing police said drug dealers and distributors can more easily conceal their activities in the projects, with their maze of hundreds of apartments in each building, than on the streets and tenements.
"They know the layouts of the projects," he said, "and this gives them a little one-upsmanship."
Apartments are used to store cash, drugs and equipment, Chief Keeney said, but often sales and deliveries take place on the streets outside the projects.
Crime in general in the city's 323 projects usually occurs at about half the rate of the city as a whole, said Val Coleman, a spokesman for the Housing Authority. But the 182 killings last year and 180 the year before, many of them involving drugs, gave public housing a murder rate about equal to that of the whole city.
 
'A Special Problem'
 "This says to us," Mr. Coleman said, "that guns and drugs are a special problem."
In one of their first operations together, the housing police and the Drug Enforcement Administration arrested 36 people and shut down a heroin distribution ring at the Lillian Wald Houses on the Lower East Side last May.
The investigation in the Red Hook Houses, a complex of 28 buildings with 8,000 residents, began with a casual conversation between a housing police undercover officer and a young woman who lived there.
In a short time, the woman, who was among those arrested yesterday, had introduced the agent to the leaders of the two gangs. Soon, about a dozen crack distributors were selling drugs to the housing officer and to Federal agents.
 
'He's O.K. He Ain't a Cop.'
 "It snowballed," said one drug enforcement investigator. "The other dealers saw one guy dealing with our guy, and everybody wanted a piece of the action."
One of the undercover housing officers, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the man whom Sergeant Cea pulled out of the apartment at 82 Dwight Street, identified as Wayne Franklin, 33 years old, was one of the first people who had offered to sell him crack.
"He did the negotiating," the undercover officer said. "He told the other guy, 'He's O.K. He ain't a cop.' "
On that advice, the police said, Alexander Williams, 32, handed over 50 vials of crack for $450 in cash. The police seized Mr. Williams in the apartment where Mr. Franklin had been arrested as Mr. Williams was rising from his bed and swung his feet to the floor.
The police also took 300 vials of crack from the apartment as well as a safe that two officers struggled to lift into an elevator.
 
'Hard-Working Man'
 Lying on the floor of the hallway in handcuffs, Mr. Franklin insisted he was an unemployed construction worker.
"I'm not in the cocaine business," he said. "I'm a hard-working man."
The chairwoman of the Housing Authority, Laura D. Blackburne, accompanied some of the nearly 100 police officers and Federal agents in the raids and announced that she was setting up a special telephone line, 1-718-HA-DRUGS, to receive anonymous reports from the city's half-million project residents of drug-dealing incidents.
"This line is direct to the police operations center," she said," and that means that if you spot drug activity something will be done about it and something will be done about it fast."
Saying she wanted to "get guns out of the projects," Ms. Blackburne also appealed to people to turn in weapons and promised that no criminal charges would be pursued in connection with them.
"I want those guns out of circulation," she said.

HEADLINE: Police Plan New Version Of Foot Duty

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
The vision of a new activist police force -- blanketing city streets with foot patrols, defusing crime before it happens and organizing neighborhoods -- was set forth yesterday by New York City officials charting the next stage of a sweeping, if still clouded, police reform program.
The changes, termed revolutionary by Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown at a City Hall briefing, are part of a blueprint for restructuring the department into a modernized version of the beat system abandoned decades ago. It followed this week's approval in Albany of a tax package to finance the expansion of the department to a record total of 31,400 officers, from the present 26,809, over the next three years. 
 Through the tax package and various economies, the number of officers in uniform would increase by 24 percent and the number of officers on patrol by more than 50 percent.
 
Precincts to Be Phased In
 Under the plan announced yesterday, one model precinct, the 72d in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, would be totally converted to the new system of community policing by April. The 74 other precincts would be phased in by 1994.
Officials said the plan, aimed at explaining how an expanded Police Department would be deployed, would mean the following for New Yorkers by 1994:
*Almost all uniformed officers would be assigned specific territory, amounting to just a few blocks in many neighborhoods, and would collect intelligence on emerging problems, like drug trafficking and prostitution.
*The officers would be, in effect, community organizers and advocates, empowered to devise creative solutions to persistent problems.
*Precinct detectives would be given specific territory as their primary responsibility, instead of working cases throughout the precinct.
*Nonemergency calls to 911 would be diverted to individual precinct officers most familiar with local conditions.
Beyond patrolling, the plan foresees changes in virtually every aspect of police organization, including the recruiting, screening and training of officers and the creation of new ways to link rewards to performance.
But much about the planned transformation remained unclear, including such central questions as: Which neighborhoods deserve the most protection? How large will the officers' territories be? How will officers be retrained for their new responsibilities?
There are also questions about how eager officers will be to exercise their new responsibilities as community organizers and whether the police bureaucracy, which has stifled initiatives in the past, will respond positively to the changes. It also was not clear how well officers would interact with growing numbers of civilian employees.
One sensitive area is the intention to form peer groups in each precinct to review the performance of officers. The police unions have traditionally held that only supervisors can judge performance.
 
'Hardest' Step Acknowledged
 Both Mr. Brown and Mayor David N. Dinkins acknowledged the uncertainties of the plan at the City Hall briefing. The Mayor called it "a detailed second step, a careful strategy for change." But he added, "The third step, and the hardest, is implementation of the innovative strategies and the aggressive schedule."
The Police Commissioner, who has made community policing a leitmotif of his earlier career in Oregon, Atlanta and Houston, also called the changes "evolutionary" because, he said, "they will take time to achieve." But he added: "Organizationally and philosophically it is indeed revolutionary."
Initial reaction to the plan was cautious and fragmentary, reflecting in part its scope, lack of specifics and long secrecy. The report, titled "Policing New York City in the 1990's," was prepared over six months by three consultants -- Georgette S. Bennett, Stephen J. Gaffigan and Robert Wasserman -- working with a committee of department chiefs under the First Deputy Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.
Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a business-sponsored watchdog group and usually an outspoken commentator on law-enforcement issues, was uncharacteristically noncomittal. "The bottom line is how well they translate this into reality on the local level," he said.
 
Some Initial Resistance
 Lieut. Roger Perrino, an integrity control officer in the 34th Precinct in upper Manhattan, said: "I think it absolutely can be achieved. It's just going to take time."
But other officers -- who did not want their names used -- voiced resistance, particularly detectives in precinct squads who bridled at the idea of being assigned to territories.
Perhaps the main feature of the new plan is a commitment to provide a "community policing presence" -- that is, one or more police officers for every neighborhood in the city. Some precinct and community board boundaries may also have to be redrawn so neighborhoods are not divided, the report suggested.
Mr. Brown cautioned that every street would not have its own officer, but rather that every street would be the responsibility of one designated officer or group.
With redeployments and the expansion of the force by 1994, the number of available officers for specific neighborhood duty will increase dramatically from some 750 to 17,400, plus 3,991 precinct supervisors and detectives, the report said.
 
Innovative Solutions Sought
 Currently each of the 75 precincts has at least one team of 10 foot-patrol officers in the Community Patrol Officers Program, but most are stretched too thin to cover all parts of the precinct.
The more than 21,000 officers, supervisors and detectives available for neighborhood duty under the new plan would be encouraged to devise innovative solutions to head off crime problems, like lights for dark alleys. Creativity would be prized and rewards devised to elevate patrol from a largely disdained to a prestigious function.
To obtain proper neighborhood officers, screening, recruiting and training would all have to be revamped to stress the service nature of the job instead of adventurism, the report said. It recommended raising the cutoff age for a police officer to 35 from the current 29 to widen the pool of candidates.
One of the plan's more provocative aspects is revamping the 911 emergency call system, which the department considers vastly overused. At present eight million calls a year are received, only half of which result in the dispatching of a police officer. But even the four million remaining calls consume some 90 percent of the time of all radio-car officers.
The plan foresees nearly doubling to 1,800 the number of radio cars on duty in a 24-hour period, allowing radio-car officers to spend no more than 60 percent of their time responding to emergencies and the rest walking around their neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Demand Is Brisk for New York Bonds

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Two days after a rating agency downgraded New York City's bonds, New York City officials sold $1 billion in bonds yesterday and said they found demand strong, suggesting the downgrading had little effect.
But despite what officials viewed as heartening news, the city continues to pay a steep price for its fiscal problems, paying far higher interest to attract bond buyers than it did before the city's current fiscal problems surfaced last October. 
 By late yesterday, prices on longer-term tax-exempt bonds were set to yield 8.35 percent to investors, about the same levels the bonds were trading at in the days before Moody's Investors Service cut the city's rating to the second-lowest investment-grade rating.
By one count -- measuring the change in the city's interest rates against the changes for other similar bonds -- the city is now paying about a full percentage point more in interest than it did last September.
Underwriters said there was strong demand for many of the bonds, particularly the $800 million in tax-exempt bonds that made up most of the issue. As a result, the city added $50 million more in bonds to the sale late yesterday and negotiated a slightly lower interest cost on $300 million of the issue.
 
Stable Market for City Bonds
 City officials hailed the sale as a clear demonstration that there was a stable market for city bonds despite months of declining revenues and worries over a growing city budget gap. "It would be nice to be boring for a change," said Darcy Bradbury, a deputy city comptroller.
Even so, the officials acknowledged that the city continued to pay considerably higher rates than state and local governments whose bonds had similar investment-grade ratings. Yields to investors on New York City bonds rose sharply in October, when Mr. Dinkins first warned that there would be a budget gap. The gap has grown to about $3 billion over 19 months.
The Moody's downgrading had little effect, they said, because the city's tax-exempt bonds were already selling at rates comparable to bonds that had already been downgraded.
Stanley Ciemniecki, an executive vice president at Lehman Brothers, which led a syndicate of 22 underwriting firms, said yesterday's sale and another large one last December "prove there has been a definite market, good demand, established for New York City securities." But he acknowledged that the demand came "at a high price."
If the city is paying about 1 percent more than it would have without the fiscal problems, the higher rate would translate into $1 million more a year in interest rates for each $100 million in bonds outstanding. The terms of the bonds range from one to 30 years. Assuming all the bonds were for 15 years, the extra interest paid because of the city's financial troubles would total $142 million.
 
An Ambitious Plan
 On Monday, Moody's announced that it had downgraded $16 billion in city bonds, including yesterday's issue, from A to Baa1, because of concern that the Dinkins administration might have difficulty carrying out an ambitious plan to pare down city goverment.
Another rating agency, Standard & Poor's, also considered downgrading the city's bonds but decided instead to reaffirm its previous rating of A-, while warning that the city's outlook remained negative.
But when city bonds maturing in 15 years are compared against bonds from other cities and states, the city paid 1.15 percentage points more than on typical bonds rated Baa by Moody's -- its lowest investment grade rating.
While the tax-exempt bonds sold well, some of the $200 million in taxable bonds included in the sale attracted few buyers. The city agreed to change the yields on the bonds offered and increase their maturity dates. The longest-term taxable bonds, due in 2010, were priced to yield 10.95.
City officials conceded that the Moody's downgrading might have affected the demand for the bonds. Major buyers of tax-exempt bonds have long been familiar with the city's fiscal strengths, they said, but buyers of relatively new taxable issues are not.
 
Largest Borrower
 City officials attribute at least some of the city's higher costs to the fact that it is the largest borrower in the municipal marketplace -- borrowing more than $4 billion a year -- rather than to the city's fiscal uncertainties. Some of the city's traditional buyers -- like bond mutual funds -- already have about as many city bonds as their company rules allow them to hold.
But some bond traders say that with the city facing such heavy future borrowing needs, more bad news, including further downgradings, could yet raise the city's costs in selling bonds.
To attract new buyers for the city bonds, city officials have been trying to set up new marketing devices, including bonds with variable interest rates and zero-coupon "CitySaver" bonds, which are sold at a discount and pay no interest. Yesterday's sale included $60 million in zero-coupon bonds.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Holds Court at a Town Meeting in Queens

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, in his first foray under a new strategy for getting his message out to the public, charmed and cajoled a warm audience last night as he took easy control of a town meeting at Forest Hills High School in Queens.
Although only about 400 people showed up to take seats in an auditorium that holds 1,100, many seemed impressed by the Mayor's efforts to reach them. 
 Mr. Dinkins was relaxed and amiable, even laughing when he was mistakenly referred to as Mayor Koch, as he fielded a barrage of questions about firehouse closings, the economy, crime and education.
Many wanted to know what Mr. Dinkins was doing to keep the middle class in a city that corporations are fleeing and where crime is increasing.
 
'A Nut for Kids'
 Mr. Dinkins's answer was that he was trying to streamline government to do more for less.
He told Jane Brody, a teacher worried about education cuts, that he was "a nut for kids" who "cares desperately about education."
As an example, he cited the controversial 5.5 percent wage increase teachers won in negotiations with him.
He told Maria Kaplan, who said that lives were at stake with the closing of Engine Company 294: "I wish we could have an engine company on every two blocks. We don't have the capacity to do that."
Much of last night's meeting was an attempt by Mr. Dinkins to convey what his administration is doing to improve the quality of life in a city whose resources are dwindling.
He plans to hold a series of town meetings to help combat what he acknowledges is a difficulty in conveying his message to the public.
 
Meetings Planned Last Year
 He announced plans for the series last August, when residents were demanding to know what he was going to do about the summer's wave of crime.
City officials said yesterday that the meetings were delayed as the administration confronted new fiscal bad news and began wrangling with the City Council.
Last night, buoyed by the passage of his anti-crime bill in Albany, Mr Dinkins and an entourage that included the police, fire, parks and finance commissioners, took his show on the road. The 90-minute question-and-answer format was similar to the forums held by his predecessor, Edward I. Koch.
The first reviews said Mr. Dinkins was doing a better job than Mr. Koch under difficult circumstances.
"He was open, he was flexible," said Marion A. Howe, an administrative assistant who lives in Queens Village. "There's no comparison to Koch. He's better. I hear what this man has to say."
"I think he's trying his best," said Janack Surujnauth, a private duty nurse in Rego Park. "It's a difficult situation with the economy and everything that is going on. He thinks before he says something. Koch would just say something."

HEADLINE: Weicker Proposes an Income Tax In Fiscal Overhaul for Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. tonight proposed to overhaul Connecticut's tax system by imposing a personal income tax on wages beginning on July 1 while cutting the state's 8 percent sales tax almost in half.
The changes, which Mr. Weicker said would lay the foundation for a recovery from recession as well as help the state close a $2.4 billion budget gap, would leave little of the state's current system of raising and spending public money untouched. 
 An income tax, which could be enacted only through the action of the state legislature, the General Assembly, would end Connecticut's status as a tax haven from its neighbors, all of which have personal income taxes. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that do not tax wages.
Budget officials said the new income tax, when combined with a cut in the sales tax -- now the highest statewide rate in the nation -- would reduce the total tax burden on Connecticut's poorest families while raising the state taxes paid by most residents.
 
Debacle of '71
 It also thrusts Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who was elected last year as an independent Governor with no members of his own party in the Assembly, into the center of an issue that has worried and divided Connecticut for decades. Mr. Weicker's predecessor, William A. O'Neill, a Democrat, vowed for 10 years to veto any bill calling for an income tax, and left his party, which controls both chambers of the Assembly, deeply divided on the question. The Republicans, members of Mr. Weicker's former party, have been almost completely united in their opposition, and tonight showed no sign of bending.
Many members in both parties still recall the great debacle of 1971, when the Assembly actually passed an income tax. It lasted a matter of weeks before being repealed under a storm of public protest.
The co-chairman of the Assembly's joint tax-writing committee, Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford, said tonight that he would push for the plan, but he a gave a 50-50 chance of passage, at best.
Mr. Weicker said in defending his proposals: "This plan takes care of the past and starts tomorrow today. Without it, our Connecticut, as we envision it, would slip away."
Under Mr. Weicker's proposal, the sales tax would be reduced to 4.25 percent but would be expanded to include many items that are now exempt, including gasoline, movies and haircuts, though the exemption for groceries would be retained. A 13.8 percent tax on corporate profits, now the highest in the nation, would be cut to 11.5 percent.
 
A Flat Rate of 6%
 Existing taxes on dividends and interest, with a top rate of 14 percent, and on capital gains, with a rate of 7 percent, would be eliminated. Instead, all personal income would be taxed at a flat rate of 6 percent.
The plan, presented tonight to the General Assembly and broadcast live to the state on television, was linked to a series of deep cuts in spending that would slash about $1.1 billion from agency budgets and eliminate about 1,800 jobs from the state payroll, including 1,100 layoffs.
"Few in a generation have the chance to make history," Mr. Weicker told lawmakers. "Everyone within and without this chamber starts at such a threshold this evening."
Mr. Weicker, a former United States Senator, repeatedly couched his proposals in terms of dark contrast to what the other options might have been to resolve the state's huge revenue shortfall. The phrasing, combined with the stringent cuts in spending, seemed aimed at allaying the great fear that has surrounded the introduction of a wage tax for the state -- that it would lead to out-of-control increases in spending.
 
Decline in Spending
 For example, Mr. Weicker said that under his plan the income tax would become overnight the biggest single source of state revenue, with a projected collection of $2.1 billion in the first year. But the overall size of the general fund budget would actually decline by 2.8 percent in the year that begins on July 1, to $6.8 billion, not counting such one-time expenditures as the cost of setting up the wage tax system. The total budget, including capital spending for transportation, would be $7.4 billion.
Several lawmakers said the fact that the Governor had stepped out front to sponsor and endorse an income tax would make it easier for some Assembly members to go along.
"The key element here is that a lot of people now have political cover," said Mr. Mulready, the co-chairman of the Assembly's Finance Revenue and Bonding Committee. "People can say, 'You elected him to settle this problem, and while I don't neccessarily agree with his tax, let's give him a shot.' "
 
'War on the Middle Class'
 But Representative Richard Foley Jr., a Republican from Oxford who is also his party's state chairman, said, "It's a declaration of war on the middle class."
Revenue from the state's two main taxes, the corporate profits tax and the sales tax, which together account for more than half of the budget, have plummeted. Collections under the state's 13.8 percent corporate tax were projected last year, for example, to raise $958 million for the year that ends on July 1. Actual collections are now expected to fall almost 20 percent short of that target as companies earn less money, or lose money, in the recession.
Collections from the sales tax are also expected to fall well below last year's level, as residents have cut back on consumer purchases, especially the major household appliances that were linked to the now dashed 1980's real-estate spiral of buying, building and furnishing new homes.
But, as Mr. Weicker and legislators repeatedly pointed out in the weeks leading up to tonight's address, simply filling in the blanks with tax increases and spending cuts was only half of the equation. The less tangible aspects over which Mr. Weicker in particular has publicly wrestled concerned who must bear the burden and how the overall package could affect an economy already in recession.
Mr. Weicker sought to retain all options. But he said again and again during the campaign that imposing an income tax during a time of economic stress would be like "pouring gasoline on a fire."

Chart: 'Taxes in the Region'
 The personal income tax proposed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. would impose a flat rate, compared with graduated rates in New York and New Jersey.
 
Connecticut
 A flat 6 percent tax would be imposed on adjusted gross income reported on Federal tax forms - that is, before deductions - in excess of $25,000 for couples, and $12,500 for individuals.
 
New York
 A graduated tax is imposed on adjusted gross income minus deductions, ranging from a beginning rate of 3.9 percent and rising to a top rate of 7.875 percent on income over $65,000.
 
New Jersey
 A 3.5 percent tax is imposed on adjusted gross income of up to $70,000 for couples and $35,000 for individuals. The rate then rises to a maximum of 7 percent on income over $150,000 for couples and $75,000 for individuals. (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: Travel Resurges Across U.S. As Americans Adjust to War

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Almost a month has passed since the country went to war, and many Americans are tying yellow ribbons to their car antennas and heading off for a long weekend of skiing or sightseeing.
Although the recession and fears of possible terrorism have depressed the travel industry for weeks, spokesmen for travel, hotel, cruise and recreation companies and spot-checks at dozens of tourist destinations show signs that people are beginning to relax and enjoy themselves again. 
 War is still on people's minds, and visitors to Mel's Diner at Universal Studios in Hollywood are plucking the tiny paper American flags off their hamburgers and sticking them into their lapels.
But after a sharp drop in travel and bookings in the first weeks of the war, people in the travel industry say they see an easing in what they had come to call "the CNN effect" in which the television news took over lives.
"When the war first started I didn't want to leave the television set, let alone travel," said Bridgid McDonnell, a nanny who was visiting Universal Studios this week from her home in Washington, D.C. "But your interest becomes less and less. You begin to feel that the war is going to go on for a long time, and you begin to adjust to it."
One reason for the signs of a possible upturn in domestic travel, say a number of people in the industry, is a cutback in travel abroad because of fears of terrorism.
"People are coming in and asking about places like Santa Fe, N.M.," said Estelle Lessack, who heads Travel Trends, a small agency in Fort Lee, N.J. "There is definitely a fear about crossing the water."
Shawn Flaherty, a spokeswoman at the Travel Industry Association, said that although the industry as a whole was suffering in the recession, a number of travel sectors were reporting signs of improvement after big drops at the start of the war.
 
Signs of a Comeback
 "People are telling me that the short-term effects were a drastic downturn," she said. "But they are encouraged because bookings are coming back compared to Jan. 15."
In Boston, landmarks along the Freedom Trail got high attendance as travelers apparently cancel more expensive or distant trips, said Nina Zannieri, director of the Paul Revere House.
In New York, the number of visitors to the Empire State Building has been up recently, although officials there say that may have been because of unusually mild weather.
Washington, where security concerns are perhaps more pronouced than other destinations, remained an exception. Group visits by schoolchildren have been canceled at the Kennedy Center and at landmarks controlled by the National Park Service. The Smithsonian Institution reported that 100,000 fewer people had visited its museums so far this year than in the same period last year. And museum officials said they did not expect much of a turnaround soon.
 
Has Fear Peaked?
 With some airlines, cruise companies and resorts offering special rates and with no terrorist incidents in this country, some large travel agencies report an increase in bookings in the past week.
"We may have seen the fear hit its peak," said Steve Heydt, the vice president of marketing for Liberty Travel, a chain with 165 offices on the East Coast.
He said that in the past few days, for the first time this year, bookings at some offices were higher than during the same week last year.
Henry Blinder, vice president of marketing for Thomas Cook, said that travel "right now seems to be on the rebound," including record bookings with a businessmen's service called Thomas Cook Express.
He said that leisure travel had dropped 15 to 20 percent since the Persian Gulf war started but that price cutting by airlines and special offerings by the cruise industry had helped bring back business.
At the American Hotel and Motel Association, Michele Kelley, a spokeswoman, said "the phones are ringing" after a severe slump.
Michael Ribero, senior vice president of marketing for the Hilton Hotels Corporation in Los Angeles, also reported the beginnings of a resurgence after what he called the worst tailspin the United States travel industry had experienced. "The days after the Persian Gulf crisis began were literally the days the earth stood still for the travel industry," he said.
 
Economic Factors Cited
 Delta Airlines is booking about 7,200 passengers per day traveling to and from the Boston area, he said, compared to about 7,000 bookings during this period last year. American Airlines has booked 5 percent more passengers than last year. And the number of Northwest Airlines bookings has gone from about 8,000 to 8,400 per day.
"Total numbers for the year will probably be down, but this weekend people are traveling," he said.
John Garrish, a 21-year-old painter from Scituate, Mass., said he was going ahead with a trip to visit his girlfriend in San Francisco. He had postponed it when war broke out because "nobody really knew what Saddam Hussein was up to." Now he was headed for the airport.
"I don't want to sound corny," he said, "but some things just can't wait forever."
Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, said its recent cut in fares had brought more bookings and travel, and several industry analysts attributed a boost in travel to a half-price promotion by America West.
Mr. Smith said domestic air travel was affected more by the economy than by the war, and was slow even before Jan. 15.
A spokesman for Amtrak, Pat Kelly, said business had remained basically steady over the past months, with rail travel less dependent than air or road travel on fluctuating oil prices.
At the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., Gretchen deWeese, acting director of public relations for the hotel, said, "There was a lull right around the 15th, 16th, 17th of January." But she said this had been softened by an increase in bookings by groups that had canceled trips to Europe.
Spokesmen for cruise lines also said they were doing well after a sharp drop in bookings in the middle of January. For Carnival Cruise Lines, Jan. 28 was the fifth-busiest day and Feb. 4 was the third- busiest day in the 17-year history of the company, said a spokesman, Tim Gallagher.
At the Chamber of Commerce in Aspen, Colo., Carol Pasternak said snow conditions were excellent and bookings this year have been up from last year every week except for the week of Jan. 13.
At Universal Studios Florida, Matthew L. Palmer, a spokesman, said, "The gulf war and the recession haven't affected us."
Gamblers seemed to be somewhat more hesitant than skiers or movie buffs, as bookings slumped and hotels continued to lay off employees. But with an eye out for a switch in fortune, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is plugging for more visitors.
"After the war we pulled our television spots for two weeks because at that time, when people were still pretty much in shock about the war, we thought it was in poor taste," said a spokesman, Rob Powers. "But we've started up again in the last few days."

HEADLINE: White House Details 5-Year Transit Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today proposed to Congress a five-year, $105 billion program of Federal aid to the states for highways and mass transit that would increase combined highway spending by the Federal and state governments by one-third in 1992.
But whether the states can afford their share of such a program is a major point of disagreement in what is expected to be a contentious debate over programs that affect almost everybody every day. 
 Another contested issue is the contention by advocates of mass transit that the program shortchanges public transportation in favor of highway spending. The program includes an overhaul of the nation's major roads, creating a new network of Federal highways.
The broad outlines of the bill, drafted over the past two years, have been known for some time. Its particulars were met with considerable skepticism by groups that are to join in the debate.
 
Skinner Predicts Approval
 Congress must enact a new bill by September, when the current five-year law expires.
Stressing the proposal's potential for eventually reducing traffic congestion and increasing economic productivity,Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner predicted that Congress would accept most of the Administration's recommendations.
"We are submitting a good bill," he said at a White House appearance with President Bush this morning. "We believe our agenda will receive broad support on the Hill."
But Representative Robert A. Roe, the New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, withheld endorsement.
"The Administration proposal has some good ideas, but I am concerned that in some cases they are masking reduced funding with philosophy and rhetoric," he said. "I don't know how the states, with all their financial problems, are going to come up with the money that's needed." His committee will hold hearings on the proposal beginning next week.
 
Criticism on Mass Transit
 Although several lawmakers criticized the Administration for barely increasing spending on mass transit, the proposal's highway provisions are likely to prove appealing. The plan calls for a rapid increase in Federal aid to local projects, and the money that will be spent has already been raised, thanks to the increase last year in the Federal tax on gasoline.
But to match the increased Federal aid with their own contributions, many states may have to further increase their own gasoline taxes. The National Conference of State Legislatures said today that over half the states would consider such increases this year.
If the bill becomes law, it could mean a major infusion of money into road building projects almost immediately. Such projects traditionally have been a major stimulus to local economies gripped by recession.
The Administration estimated that $14.3 billion in Federal funds and an additional $4.9 billion in state funds would be spent in 1992, the first year of the program, an increase of more than a third over highway spending in the current fiscal year. By 1996, state and Federal highway spending would reach $27.6 billion.
The Federal share of highway spending would total about $87 billion over the five year period.
 
More Jobs Projected
 The Transportation Department said that for every $1 billion in capital investment under the program, about 10,000 construction jobs could be generated. The new jobs would in turn carry the stimulus throughout the economy, the department argued.
The Administration's most striking proposal calls for a new 150,000-mile network of highways that includes both the 47,000-mile Interstate Highway System and a vast new network of other major highways. Almost all these roads already exist. But the highway program envisions widening many of them and making some of them resemble Interstates.
These roads, which will be selected on the basis of traffic volume and the importance of the economic centers they link, will be given most of the Federal highway funds.
At least 700,000 miles of roads would also be eligible for Federal aid but at lower levels than the major national highways.
The program also includes money for repairing and replacing bridges, rising to $2.8 billion in 1996 from $1.8 billion in 1992.
There would be other notable changes in financing. For example, for the first time Federal funds could be used to pay for toll highways, and in some cases the private sector would build and operate toll roads.
Although spending on highways would increase markedly under the proposal, the percentage contributed by the Federal Government would decline. For example, in the program of the network of national highways the Federal share would be only 75 percent, as against its contribution of up to 90 percent during construction of the Interstate highways.
In contrast to the highway program, Federal spending on mass transit would increase only slightly, rising slowly from the current year's level of $3.2 billion to about $3.3 billion in 1996.
There would be major changes in how the mass transit money is distributed, including sharp reductions in Federal payments for operating expenses, and the increased use of traffic patterns, rather than political decisions, to determine which states get the most money.
Jack Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association, a lobbying group for local transit agencies, called the proposal "a recipe for more traffic jams, air pollution and wasted energy."
But Administration officials defended the plan, pointing out that unlike previous transportation programs it would allow state and local officials to choose for themselves whether to spend large parts of the Federal aid for local roads or mass transit.
Hal Rives, Commissioner of Transportation in Georgia and president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said: "The concept is good. But the funding is clearly inadequate to meet our national transportation needs, and what money is there is not fairly distributed."

HEADLINE: Soldiers and Barbie Aiming at Nintendo

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

 BODY:
THE noise of war was deafening, and a lone soldier dressed in beige desert camouflage stood ready for battle. But this soldier, a 6-foot-tall mannequin, held in his hand not a lethal weapon but a new board game, "A Line in the Sand," in which the allied forces fight the army of Iraq on a map of the Middle East.
That was the scene in one showroom this week at the 88th American International Toy Fair. In another, there was familiar background music, a song that most Americans stay up to hear once a year way past their bedtimes. 
 "There she is, Miss America. . . . "
And there she really was. Miss America, Marjorie Judith Vincent, regally attired, beauty-queen style, in a body-hugging, neckline-plunging black and gold gown. She was there to introduce "Miss America," a new line of beauty-queen dolls that are packaged with individual names and identities. Raquel, for one, is "a majorette with political aspirations."
War-related toys and new dolls were among the attractions at the fair, the industry's annual shopping spree. Twenty-thousand buyers came to play with new toys, climb into the mindsets of children and bet on merchandise that will line the shelves of toy stores. The fair, which is open to the trade only, continues at several Manhattan sites through Wednesday.
The toy fair is always a mixture of the serious and the silly, and this year was no exception: a buyer could place an order for millions of dollars' worth of merchandise and then bump into a gigantic Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle roaming the corridors. But with the country faced by an economic recession and war in the Persian Gulf, the mood was more somber and unsettled than usual.
This year's fair came at a time of dismal toy sales and worries about the futures of some well-known manufacturers and retailers. George D. Ditomassi, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., the trade association that sponsors the show, reported at a news conference that retail sales were $13.4 billion last year, virtually unchanged from the previous year.
There is also controversy within the industry over the propriety of toys that capitalize on the war. David Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers of America, said that while increases in sales of model kits and action figures related to combat were inevitable, he found some war-related toys "tasteless."
At TSR Inc., the manufacturer of "A Line in the Sand," there was much debate over the game. "It took a lot of soul-searching to bring this out," said Justin McCormack, TSR's West Coast publisher. "We expected that people would question our intentions, but since they are aboveboard, to provide an educational simulation, we feel we are doing the right thing."
Kenner is also aware of a potential image problem with its stuffed Proudheart Bear, which it rushed into production after American troops were sent to Saudi Arabia last August. The bear is white, with a heart-shaped version of the American flag across its chest. Ginger Kent, Kenner's vice president for marketing, said the company is "internally arguing" about what to do with profits from the bear. "All or part of the proceeds will go to charity," she said.
Mattel 's new All-American Barbie, dressed in denim with patches of stars and stripes, is attracting "a strong response from retail buyers," said Glenn Bozarth, vice president for corporate communications. "The line was in development prior to the war, but it was obviously well timed."
As for other toys, among the nearly 6,000 new items on display were several designed to exploit a growing interest for many children: the environment. These included kits that allow children to test air and water for pollution, action figures that are environmental heroes and board games with names like Recycling and Earthalert. Two new lines of action figures, Toxic Crusaders and Captain Planet, not only emphasize concern for the environment but, like an increasing number of toys, are also packaged with recycled material.
Buyers saw a multitude of scaled-down replicas of professional wrestling heroes, high-speed racing cars that are controlled with a turn of a glove worn by the operator, an electronic game that transforms the television screen into a full-color drawing pad, dolls based on the film "The Little Mermaid" and numerous Saturday morning television shows, and an electronic learning aid for -- yes! -- the crib. The manufacturer, Video Technology , says a baby can press the keypad to make five different animals "talk."
This year manufacturers introduced an unusual number of new action figures. They say they hope these toys will benefit from a slowing in the growth of Nintendo video games.
The success of Nintendo, which does not exhibit at the fair, hung like a dark cloud, as it has for the last five years. Manufacturers of traditional toys complain that Nintendo, which reported sales of $3.4 billion in the United States last year, has stunted the growth of the rest of the toy business.
"They accuse us of being the Grinch that stole Christmas," said Peter T. Main, vice president of marketing for Nintendo of America Inc.
Toy industry analysts say Nintendo's future largely depends on the growth of Game Boy, a hand-held system, and a more powerful 16-computer-bit system that will be on the market later this year.
For girls there were dolls that slurp and burp and make funny faces. There was also one that eats a fake chocolate ice cream cone. Hasbro , the manufacturer, decided that little girls would like nothing better than to clean up the mess.
Larry Carlat, editor of Toy & Hobby World, said he saw "nothing that will get the industry out of its five-year slump, no compelling toy that is going to bring people back into the stores."
Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst for Gerard, Klauer, Mattison & Company, a securities brokerage firm, was more optimistic. "Everybody has the sense there is nothing hot," he said. "But guess what: There will be something hot. Nobody knows where it will come from."
Dan Lauer offers an answer. Mr. Lauer, a 30-year-old former banker from St. Louis, decided that life behind a desk was "non-creative." So he quit his job as a bank vice president to chase his dream: he wanted to invent a doll. He assembled it with condoms and balloons and filled it with water. Thus his Water Babies were born.
Most major toy companies were not impressed. But Playmates , which made a fortune with another toy that had its share of rejections, Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, said yes. The company liked this water-filled doll because "it jiggles, like a real baby," said Richard Sallis, senior vice president. Playmates has since refined the doll from its condom stage and plans to promote it with $3 million in advertising.
"You can imagine the abuse I took from my friends for playing with dolls," Mr. Lauer remarked. "But now they all want to work for me."

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Will the Mets Sign 'Enough Pitching?'

BYLINE: By Dave Anderson

 BODY:
For decades, the Yankees were known as the "best franchise in sports" until, bluster by bluster, George Steinbrenner destroyed it. With the title vacated, several franchises in various sports can argue that with their success over the years each now deserves to be hailed as the best. The San Francisco 49ers. The Boston Celtics, the Los Angeles Lakers. The Edmonton Oilers. And in baseball, the Oakland Athletics, the Los Angeles Dodgers.
But in a casual moment last year, Frank Cashen, whose Mets title is now senior executive vice president as well as chief operating officer and general manager, proposed that the Mets were now the best franchise. 
 After all, Cashen explained, the Mets were always a contender, the Mets were always above or approaching the three million mark in attendance, the Mets had a fat television contract, the Mets had a national appeal, the Mets had a productive farm system, the Mets had two owners (Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon) who didn't try to upstage the team.
"The Mets," Cashen concluded, "are now the best franchise in sports."
At the time, the Mets were also the best second-place team in baseball. Until proven otherwise, they still are. But if the Mets are to justify Cashen's boast as being "the best franchise in sports," he must justify his favorite baseball phrase.
"You never have enough pitching," Cashen likes to say.
If you never have enough pitching, you never quibble about signing Dwight Gooden and Frank Viola to new contracts. No matter how many millions it takes. No matter how many millions Roger Clemens collected from the Boston Red Sox last week: $21,521,000 over four years, a $5.38 million average. That's a new high in a baseball economy that doesn't recognize the recession in the national economy.
But according to Al Harazin, who negotiates the Mets' salaries, the Clemens contract will make it "difficult" for the Mets to sign both Gooden and Viola.
What's so difficult? Harazin presumably understands Cashen's belief that "you never have enough pitching." Harazin presumably understands Cashen's belief that the Mets are the "best franchise in sports." If those two tenets are observed, the "best franchise" will assure itself "enough pitching" by signing both Gooden and Viola soon in order to eliminate the possibility that either or both will test the free-agent market after the season ends.
Only time will determine the wisdom of Cashen and Harazin in allowing Darryl Strawberry to join the Dodgers as a free agent. If they were to allow Gooden or Viola, or both, to depart, Cashen and Harazin will risk being linked in infamy to their front-office predecessor, M. Donald Grant, who traded Tom Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds in 1977.
Without Strawberry's bat, the Mets will be depending on Gooden and Viola more than ever before. Of the other 25 major league teams, only the Athletics possess two such premier pitchers: Dave Stewart and Bob Welch. Stewart is now in the first year of a two-year $7 million contract, a $3.5 million average. Welch recently signed a four-year $13.8 million contract, a $3.45 million average.
But now that Clemens will be earning more than $5 million annually, Gooden and Viola understandably deserve to be considered at that plateau.
Over the last seven seasons, Viola has a 126-86 record, Gooden 119-48 and Clemens 116-51. In earned run average, Gooden is low at 2.82, with Clemens at 2.89 and Viola at 3.38. Clemens has the most strikeouts with 1,424, to Gooden's 1,391 and Viola's 1,258.
In last season's stats, Clemens was 21-6 with a 1.93 earned run average and 209 strikeouts, Viola was 20-12, 2.67 and 182, Gooden was 19-7, 3.83 and 223.
Looking to future durability, Clemens, who will be 29 years old in August, had a sore shoulder late last season. Gooden, who was 26 in November, had a sore shoulder the year before that limited him to a 9-4 reccord in only 17 starts. Viola, who will be 31 in April, has been an iron man, averaging nearly 250 innings and about 36 starts in each of the last eight seasons.
The pitching arm is the most fragile item in sports. Any pitcher's career might end with his next pitch, meaning that a team can be stuck with a multimillion-dollar contract. But because a dominant pitcher is so rare, teams assume the financial risk.
Even a not-so-dominant pitcher, like Bud Black, was signed as a free agent by the San Francisco Giants for $10 million over four years. If Bud Black, with a career 83-82 record, was worth that much, Roger Clemens was worth even more than $5-million-plus a year.
And now Dwight Gooden and Frank Viola will discover how much they're worth to the "best franchise in sports" that believes "you never have enough pitching."

HEADLINE: Blue Skies for Mr. Bush's Economists

 BODY:
An overview of the current and future economy could be a valuable source of analysis and a stirring call to action. But you won't find either in the latest Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers. Slavishly opposed to government intervention, including any new taxes, President Bush's economists address few pressing problems. Indeed, they devote more attention to Eastern Europe and South America than to matters at home.
The council drifts from topic to topic, never committing the Administration to very much and always leaving the reader with a rosy view of the future. Worried about recession? Don't be. The downturn is sure to be shallow and short; free enterprise will handle it. The council's devotion to unfettered markets borders on the mindless. First-year economics students learn that unregulated factories and families will ignore the effects of their energy consumption on the environment. But nowhere does this council call for higher energy taxes to correct a blatant market failure.
More discouraging is what the report doesn't say. Worried about the growing gap between wages of college and high-school graduates? It isn't even worth discussing. Worried about slums, homelessness, crack babies? Turn your attention instead to intellectual property rights in Brazil or privatization in Czechoslovakia.
Eastern Europeans and South Americans might find the report mildly interesting. But for Americans, only the up-to-date statistical tables at the back of the volume will justify the $12 price.

HEADLINE: I'm Ready To Run in '92

BYLINE: By George McGovern; George McGovern was the Democratic nominee for President in 1972.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Perhaps because of my long opposition to the Vietnam War, I am constantly asked what a citizen does who is opposed to the war with Iraq but doesn't want to appear unpatriotic or ineffectual in protesting the war policy. It's a complicated question.
If I were still in the Senate, I would have voted with the 47 Senators to continue the economic sanctions, with war only as a last resort. But with American forces committed to battle, with low casualties and high television coverage of the most dramatic aspects of aerial attack, it is not very effective to stand in front of the White House and shout, "Stop the war!" 
 The proper course for me is not antiwar rallies, although I respect those who choose that course. Rather, I'm going to seek out a Presidential candidate who challenges the policies that set the stage for the present war and other difficulties gripping the nation. The Presidential campaign arena is the best place to focus attention on the need for new policies.
The Democratic loyal opposition should be mobilizing now. It needs at least one strong Presidential contender to make clear that the 1990's call for policies dramatically different from those applauded in the 1980's.
We need a President who recognizes that the American dream and our role in the world must be grounded in enduring values, a healthy economy, a just society and a government of the people. In two years, while turning away from challenges and opportunities at home, President Bush has given us two wars -- a small one in Panama to seize Gen. Manuel Noriega and a larger one in the gulf to stop Saddam Hussein.
George Bush and Ronald Reagan supported Saddam Hussein for years, including selling him $1.5 billion worth of equipment that he used to build chemical and nuclear war facilities. Mr. Bush, as Director of Central Intelligence had Mr. Noriega on his payroll and helped pave the way for his rise to power in Panama.
I would support a Presidential candidate who pledged to take the following steps:
* Curtail the giving of arms to dictators and carefully re-examine our current role as global policeman.
* Stop committing young Americans to military campaigns unless the security of the U. S. clearly requires it and Congress so determines.
* Develop an energy policy based on conservation and increased energy efficiency, improved public transportation and renewable resources to reduce our dependence on Persian Gulf oil -- the real cause of the present war.
* With the end of the cold war, utilize much of our obsolete military budget to reduce the national debt, strengthen the environment, convert to a peacetime economy and rebuild decaying public facilities.
* At the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, press for a comprehensive Middle East settlement and for a "new world order" based not on Pax Americana but on peace through law with a stronger U.N. and World Court.
I would be pleased to support a Democratic candidate with views similar to these. But if no such candidate gets into the arena soon, I will and I will go all out to win.
I've told an exploratory group pressing me to announce for the Presidency to qualify me first for Federal matching funds. If we meet that goal, and first signs are encouraging, it becomes practical to launch a Presidential campaign. Both the nation and the Democratic party would profit from a candidate who looks honestly at the nation's problems, proposes common sense solutions and raises the pride of the American people in their constitutional democracy.
In my soul, I know my qualifications for the Presidency -- wisdom, wit, historical perspective, toughness -- are better at 68 than they were at 48. Perhaps another candidate is even now waiting in the wings to announce. If not, get ready for McGovern in '92.

HEADLINE: Layoff of New Jersey Workers Will Hurt State

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The "harsh but necessary menu" for New Jersey that you endorse in "The Bad News Boys: Mr. Florio Cuts Back" (editorial, Feb. 2), including massive layoffs of state workers, would go far to cripple the state's essential public services, its civil service system and the union movement. Is it sound economic strategy in an economic downturn to fire thousands of public employees? Franklin D. Roosevelt thought otherwise. His strategy was to create public jobs for the unemployed, enfranchise labor and expand the minimum wage. The way out of the Depression, President Roosevelt believed, was to boost purchasing power and generate demand.
And where President Roosevelt declared that if he went to work in a factory, "the first thing I'd do would be to join a union," Gov. James Florio's tactics are designed to break the unions that represent 78,000 state workers. He's seeking to scrap the three-year contract he signed only last year and to fire as many as 10,000 critically needed state employees if they don't swallow massive pay givebacks of 20 percent and agree to pension and health pay reductions.
Since management claims that state workers are denied the right to strike, it is axiomatic that legal contracts be scrupulously observed. But Governor Florio, by breaking his own contract, would turn back the clock to the open shop of the 1920's. Tragically, the majority of those Governor Florio seeks to fire are clerical and professional workers, particularly working women, who make up, for example, 72 percent of my union local, a great many of them single, African-American working mothers.
The Governor's companion budget-reduction scenario involves cutting back much of the essential services provided by these employees: aid to the blind, the mentally ill, the poor, the autistic, the elderly and veterans, to cite just a few. How much sense does it make to balance a budget by slashing tens of millions in Medicaid clinic visits, thus inviting higher future bills for extended hospital stays? But this is precisely his approach.
As you have pointed out in your news columns, New Jersey's budget shortfall is only about 6 percent. Accordingly, there is absolutely no need to achieve balance at the expense of public employees and the people they assist, primarily the poor, when so many creative alternatives have not been explored.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford the High Price of Cheap Oil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Oil Prices and Profits; What Goes Up . . . " (Op-Ed, Jan. 26), Mark Green, New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, asserts that lower gasoline prices could "spur more home building and retail buying, lower overall business costs and hasten the recovery by adding a half point of growth to the gross national product." While cheap oil stimulates economic growth short-term, cheap oil encourages the United States to continue to use energy unwisely.
Energy complacency causes extra pollution, pays for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries whims, swells our trade deficit massively and funnels money out of our economy. Raising the taxes on fossil fuels and lowering income or other taxes on modest-income Americans would discourage energy waste and raise our long-term competitiveness.
If income taxes were a little lower and gas was a little more expensive, it would be profitable for industry to develop new energy technologies. Solar and wind power provide limitless and pollution-free alternatives. Cheap fossil fuels in the United States are the principal reason we lag behind Germany and other countries that are investing far more heavily in the emerging energy technologies that are so critical for future economic growth.

HEADLINE: Interest in Ski Dorms Goes Beyond Weekends

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
Ski dorms have been around since young people began sliding down snow-covered hills. The dorms were attractive because they provided warm beds, a menu of hearty food and they were cheap. They offered few frills, but the atmosphere was informal and friendly.
Over the years, ski dorms have continued to appeal to high school and college students, church groups, ski clubs and racing teams, particularly on weekends and holiday weeks. But the dorms haven't increased in number even as the number of skiers increased. But in this recession year, the concept of dormitory accommodations is taking on a new appeal. 
 Moreover, a new dormitory has come on the scene and is attracting crowds as well as good reviews. The Snow Cap Lodge at Sunday River, Me., (800) 543-2754, which opened in December 1989, has two two-story wings and each floor of a wing holds one busload of 50 people. Rooms accommodate four to eight people in bunk beds and have a bath. There is even a private room for the bus driver of the group.
The two-day weekend rate for the Snow Cap dorm, including two breakfasts, one dinner and lift tickets for two days, is $125 a person. Skiers can also book accommodations without meals at $25 a person a night on weekends or a night midweek.
While the Snow Cap, and most other ski dorms in New England, are booked for winter weekends, there are often midweek vacancies and dorm managers are reporting an increase in business.
"We're seeing more families during the week," said Skip King, public relations manager for Sunday River. "Midweek business is up about 20 percent this year over last year."
Individuals must still share rooms during the week, but a two-day package with meals and lift tickets is $117.
The Vermont State Ski Dormitory in Stowe, Vt., built by the C.C.C. in 1933, is the oldest ski dorm in New England and was originally run by the state, but for the last two years has been under the management of Lillie Ferris. Two rooms -- one with 26 bunk beds for men and one with 24 bunk beds for women -- are usually filled on weekends, but midweek there are vacancies. The telephone number is (802) 253-4010.
"We've had people from three months to 85 years old here," said Ferris. "It's rustic, but homey with a big fireplace in the living room and you may be asked to bring in wood to keep the fire going."
Breakfast and dinner are included in the $35-a-day rate and there is free shuttle service to the ski lifts. Like most of the dormitories, the Vermont Ski Dorm has a recreation room, but unlike others, it also has a ski room with facilities for tuning skis.
Another old-time ski dorm in Stowe is the Round Hearth, which was built in 1947. Most of the rooms sleep four to eight people in bunk beds, and there are a few rooms with private or semiprivate baths. Meals are served cafeteria style in a large dining room that has a round fireplace in the middle. The telephone number is (802) 253-7223.
The nightly rate, including breakfast and dinner, is $32 a person, but groups of 10 or more get a 10 percent discount. For five nights the rate is $130. Most weekends are booked, but midweeks when families stay three to five nights, for each adult, one child under 12 can have free accommodations and free skiing at the mountain. The Round Hearth management will also arrange bus transportation from major cities and discounted lift tickets for groups.
The Trailside Lodge near Killington, Vt., has more resort-type amenities than most of the ski dorms with rooms, each with a private bath, accommodating six people in bunk beds. Besides a living room and a game room, there is an outdoor hot tub, a full service bar and live entertainment on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and sleigh rides on Tuesdays and Saturdays. A professional ski tuner comes by every evening to prep the guest's skis. The telephone number is (802) 422-3532.
The midseason weekend rate is $100 a person including three meals, but it can be as low as $55 in early and late season. Midweeks, the rate for five nights with breakfast and dinner every day is $139 a person and can be as low as $99 during special periods. There is a free shuttle to Killington.
The Vagabond Lodge in Jamaica, Vt., is about 15 minutes from Stratton and 20 to 30 minutes to Bromley and Magic. It has 96 beds in rooms that accommodate from four to 15 people each, which makes it appropriate for families during midweeks. The telephone number is (802) 874-4096.

HEADLINE: Business Sales Off 2.3%, Steepest Drop in 4 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Business sales plunged 2.3 percent in December, the steepest in four years, the Government said today in a report that analysts said showed the economy in a significant decline.
The report, however, provided a slight touch of good news, as the Commerce Department said business inventories had fallen. In past recessions, goods piled up on shelves and backlots, causing production cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses struggled to sell backlogs. In December, however, business inventories dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $810.7 billion, after advancing two-tenths of 1 percent in November and four-tenths of 1 percent in October. 
Business sales in December, the Commerce Department said, slowed to a seasonally adjusted $530.9 billion, even worse than the 1.5 percent decline in November and the biggest drop since January 1987, when they fell 3.1 percent.
The report on overall sales came a day after the department said sales on the retail level continued to fall in January. The nine-tenths of 1 percent decline followed a 1.5 percent drop in December for the first back-to-back decreases in seven months.
Retail sales, which were flat in November, have not risen since a barely perceptible one-tenth of 1 percent advance in October.
The overall activity pushed the ratio of inventories-to-sales to 1.53, from 1.5 in November. The ratio means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust the backlog at the December sales pace. It stood at 1.5 in November and 1.48 in October.
The ratio jumped to 1.74 during the 1981-82 recession and to 1.75 in the 1974-75 downturn, and analysts noted that businesses are using new techniques to keep backlogs under control.
"Instead of waiting until later in the recession to cut back on inventories, companies clearly are cutting back early," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. "To some extent, that will moderate the decline."
But at the same time, Mr. Steinberg said, "the consumer sector is retrenching at this point about as much as had happened in the early 80's and 70's," when the two deepest postwar recessions occurred.
"Inventories are going to contribute to a lesser extent to the overall economic decline," he said. But he added that consumer cutbacks "are more severe than they usually are and therefore the overall economy is declining significantly."
In addition to the 1.5 percent decline in retail purchases, manufacturing sales plunged 3.4 percent after a 2.5 percent drop in November. Sales on the wholesale level were off 1.2 percent after falling 1.5 percent the previous month.
Retail inventories, on the other hand, declined eight-tenths of 1 percent in December and two-tenths of 1 percent in November. They were off a similar eight-tenths of 1 percent on the manufacturing level and three-tenths of 1 percent on the wholesale level. Manufacturing inventories had risen two-tenths of 1 percent in November, while wholesale backlogs grew seven-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Slow Trading; Gold Prices Are Also Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced yesterday in uneventful dealings on the world's currency markets.
Gold prices also moved higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $368.20, up $1 a troy ounce from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $367.65, up $1.10 an ounce. 
 Currency dealers worldwide said trading was light and lackluster, with no fresh news to influence the dollar's direction.
John McCarthy, chief dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland, attributed the United States currency's advance to a market being "tired of selling dollars."
Some traders said they were awaiting the release of a new round of United States economic data today, including producer prices and industrial production figures for January.
The reports are expected to show a continued slowdown in economic activity. Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said that fundamentals "point to lower interest rates, and that means a weak dollar."
Many expect the Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates lower to stimulate growth. But lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
Still, Mr. McCarthy predicted the dollar would be little changed unless the figures are out of line with market expectations, since traders will not want to be short dollars ahead of the Washington's Birthday holiday on Monday.
 
Direction of Interest Rates
 Separately, he said there was a "sense that rates might be peaking and coming lower in Europe." Investors typically move money to the highest-yielding instruments. Lower interest rates overseas would dampen the advantage of foreign investments while enhancing the value of United States securities.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.05 yen, to a closing 129.75 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.75 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.67 yen, unchanged from Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9805, from $1.9945 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9796 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.9840.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4665 German marks, up from 1.4640; 1.2570 Swiss francs, up from 1.2530; 4.9950 French francs, up from 4.9875; 1,103.25 Italian lire, up from 1,100.75, and $1.1523 Canadian dollars, down from $1.1537.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368 a troy ounce, from $367.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $367.75 from $367. Hong Kong markets were closed for a weeklong national holiday.
Silver prices also gained. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.826 a troy ounce, up from $3.743 on Wednesday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $3.81 an ounce from $3.75.

HEADLINE: New Life for Rechargeable Battery

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Several companies are offering new lines of rechargeable batteries to try to get consumers to throw away their disposable alkalines for good.
Companies like Sanyo and Gates have brought out new brands, under the names Sanyo and Millennium, with changes they hope will make them more appealing to consumers. Rechargeables have been available for decades, but aside from their use in small appliances like hand-held vacuums and tools, they have yet to catch on with the public. 
 Technical refinements in the recharging units have shortened the time needed to replenish the batteries' strength. The prices of some models have fallen, and some have been repackaged to look more attractive and less boxy.
 
8% Market Share
 American consumers use 2.5 billion batteries a year, and rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries, known as ni-cads, account for only 8 percent of the $2.8 billion market. But rechargeables have the potential to account for up to 20 percent of the market, said Joseph A. Carcone, vice president of marketing and sales for Sanyo, a division of the Sanyo Electric Company of Japan.
"It is probably the fastest-growing segment of the battery industry," said Terry Telzrow, manager of standards and product safety for the Eveready Battery Company, the nation's No. 1 battery maker and a unit of the Ralston Purina Company.
To stimulate new growth, some companies are also hoping to capitalize on the perception that rechargeable batteries are less harmful to the environment. Regular batteries, which must be thrown away after several hours' use, contain carcinogenic chemicals, like mercury, that can poison the environment. Rechargeable batteries can be reused hundreds of times.
But an environmental pitch might backfire, some battery makers warn. Rechargeables contain cadmium, a carcinogen that is highly toxic to aquatic life and can cause kidney ailments in people who eat the contaminated fish.
That makes an environmental appeal "a double-edged sword," said Jay Pomeroy of the General Electric Company, an early proponent of rechargeables. He said the cadmium content had prevented company officials from "beating our chest" about the environmental benefits.
That has not stopped others from recommending rechargeables as products for a new age. The Sanyo Energy U.S.A. Corporation of San Diego trumpets its new rechargeables and chargers as "environmentally responsible." Sanyo, which for years was one of the world's largest makers of rechargeables for industrial uses, introduced a line of rechargeable batteries for consumers in January.
Gates Energy Products Inc., a Gainesville, Fla., battery maker that introduced its line of Millennium rechargeables for consumers last year, says in its promotional material, "All of us are learning we haven't been as kind to our planet as we should have been."
 
No Recycling Center
 Sanyo and Gates will accept used rechargeables for recycling, if consumers send them in, but there is no cadmium recycling operation in the United States. The battery makers say they will ship the dead batteries to East Asia for recycling.
Other companies making a strong push into rechargeables include SAFT America Inc. of Valdosta, Ga., a subsidiary of Compagnie General d'Electricite of France, and the Panasonic Industrial Company, a division of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan.
SAFT and Gates executives say consumers are buying 25 percent more rechargeables each year.
A sharp drop in recharging time -- from overnight to as short as an hour -- may also make the batteries more appealing to consumers.
Batteries generate an electric current by creating a chemical reaction. In alkaline and other regular batteries, the reaction is one way and the battery eventually goes dead. In rechargeables, the chemical reaction is reversed by applying electricity. This returns the chemicals to their original state, and the battery can again produce electricity.
The technical refinements that have shortened recharging time include improvements in the electrolyte, the fluid used as a medium for the electric current in batteries, allowing for faster recharging.
 
Signs of a Trend
 Because of such improvements and perceptions that rechargeables are better for the environment than throw-away batteries, Richard Thalheimer, founder and president of the Sharper Image stores, predicts that consumers will soon be flocking to rechargeables.
Mr. Thalheimer said the shift would be partly driven by the new rechargers reaching the market. Sanyo is selling a sleek black recharger that looks like a portable compact disk player.
Panasonic calls its streamlined version the Slim Charger, and is telling retailers to sell it as an "affordable impulse or gift item" for teen-agers, who are big consumers of batteries for items like Walkman-style stereos.
The Panasonic charger will sell for about $14, compared with more than twice as much for chargers already on the market.
But rechargeable batteries are still not a marketer's dream.
They cost nearly four times as much as akalaine batteries, and they last only one-sixth to one-third as long before they need recharging. A child's toy can drain a fully charged set of rechargeables in 12 minutes, compared with 72 minutes for an alkaline set, said Mr. Telzrow of Eveready. Rechargeables account for less than 10 percent of sales at Eveready, the world's largest battery maker.
A pair of AA-size rechargeables costs about $7, compared with about $3 for a four-pack of of disposable alkaline batteries.
Even advocates of rechargeables, like Mr. Carcone of Sanyo, acknowledge that "the convenience of aklaline totally outweighs the hassle of rechargeables."
Another problem with rechargeables is that they are not suited for all uses because their power drains even when the toy or appliance is turned off. Rechargeables should probably not be used in smoke detectors or other safety devices.
The main advantage is economic. Once a charger is bought, a set of rechargeable batteries can take the place of up to 300 alkaline batteries.
Despite some companies' attempts to portray nickel-cadmium batteries as being better for the environment than alkaline batteries, environmentalists and some battery executives say the choice is not so clear.
"There's not a real easy answer," said Tim Forker of the Environmental Action Coalition, a not-for-profit environmental group.
Under pressure from environmental groups, battery makers have begun reducing the mercury content of alkaline batteries. Encouraging consumers to use rechargeables would result in introducing large volumes of toxic cadmium into the environment.
A research effort is under way to replace the cadmium in rechargeables with a safer metal, probably nickel metal hydride.

HEADLINE: Scant Success for California Efforts To Put Women in Construction Jobs

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
After more than a decade of organized effort to recruit women for the construction trades, few women in California have succeeded in breaking into such jobs through the state's broad network of certified apprenticeship programs.
Statistics compiled by advocates for women seeking the jobs show that the number of women who are able to get the training to become plasterers, bricklayers and sheet metal workers remains very low. 
 In 1978, Federal and state officials set goals of 20 percent female participation in the apprenticeship programs overseen by the state. But today, California is still about the same as the rest of the country, where women constitute only 2 percent of the construction industry work force, a figure that has remained virtually unchanged since 1983.
In a public hearing here last month, the Coalition for Equality in the Trades, a group of 15 organizations interested in issues involving women and minority groups, charged that the State Division of Apprenticeship Standards, which oversees hundreds of apprenticeship programs, had failed to integrate women into the construction trades.
 
Number May Have Fallen
 Representatives for the coalition testified that in California, women hold less than 5 percent of the spaces in the construction trades apprenticeship programs that the division oversees. Moreover, they said, calculations from the agency's annual reports suggest that the number dropped to 4.9 percent in 1989 from 5.14 percent in 1988.
They recommended that the Division of Apprenticeship Standards be required to refuse to certify apprenticeship programs unless goals for female participation are met and to institute sanctions against those that do not comply.
"If they don't bring women into the apprenticeship programs, the programs should not be allowed to continue," said Judith E. Kurtz, senior staff lawyer for Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco public interest law firm that is part of the coalition. "Because if they continue, you then have discrimination under state approval."
Gail W. Jesswein, chief of the state agency, noted that women now hold nearly 6,000 of the 51,000 total apprenticeship slots statewide, including those in the construction trades as well as others that are overseen by his division. That number represents an increase to 11 percent in 1989 from 8 percent in 1983.
"We are doing our job for the public and I resent any implication it's our responsibility and fault there aren't 20 percent women in these programs," he said.
He disputed the calculations that showed a possible decline in women in the 31,000 construction apprenticeship positions. Although he said neither he nor his staff had checked the advocacy groups' calculations, he said that "since the overall numbers are up, they must be up in the construction trades, too; it's just logical."
Ms. Kurtz said an analysis of the division's statistics showed that most of the gain by women was in training programs for jobs like psychiatric technicians and correctional officers. "When you eliminate those two jobs from the data, the numbers really drop for women," she said.
The primary responsibility of the division is to develop apprenticeship programs with private employers and insure that the employers have plans for recruitment and training of women. While the division has the power to decertify apprenticeship programs that fail to meet these affirmative action goals, it has never done so.
The complaints in California are similar to those expressed last March at hearings before the New York City Human Rights Commission regarding the construction trades in Manhattan, where women hold about 4 percent of approximately 100,000 jobs.
 
Treatment Becomes an Obstacles
 Helen R. Neuborne, the executive director of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, which compiled statistics for those hearings, said that even when women succeed at winning slots in apprenticeship programs, their on-the-job treatment often becomes an obstacle to advancement.
"They're sent for coffee, they're put off by themselves, they're sexually harrassed, men urinate next to them," she said. "There is so very little incentive to stay."
The hearing here last month was conducted by the California Commission on State Government Organization and Economy, a bipartisan panel that investigates complaints about the functioning of public agencies.
Mary Gaddis, who in 1979 became the first woman in the 1,800-member Federation of Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 393, has worked on major construction projects, including the San Jose sewage treatment plant. She testified about sexual harrassment of women on the job.
Included in her presentation were photographs of sexually degrading graffiti in the women's portable outhouse, some of it aimed specifically at her.
 
Abuse on the Job
 Similarly, Linda Jofuku, a former carpenter who is now the business representative for the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, testified that she was doused with water while working with electrical wires and grabbed and fondled while carrying heavy loads up ladders. "You get really sick of it," she said.
"It's not enough to have affirmative action goals," she said. "You need to support women once they are in the programs."
The commission is expected to issue a report to the Legislature this spring suggesting legislation to improve the apprenticeship program.
"On the face of it, it doesn't look real good," said Kathleen Johnson, research manager for the commission. "The whole point of the report will be to overhaul the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, to have them not function as they have been."

HEADLINE: Real Estate Group Buys G.M. Building

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
One of the country's largest private real estate investment groups quietly acquired the landmark General Motors Building in Manhattan last month, people at G.M. said yesterday. The headquarters building was sold for $500 million plus other unspecified considerations, they said.
The 50-story building was acquired by Corporate Property Investors, the real estate investment trust that refinanced the property for G.M. in the early 1980's and in exchange received the option to acquire the building, on Fifth Avenue at the southeastern corner of Central Park, which opened in 1968. 
 To raise cash in the early 1980's, G.M. got a 10-year, $500 million mortgage on the marble-clad tower from the investment group at 10 percent interest, which was favorable considering that 10-year Treasury bills carried interest rates of 14 percent. At the time of the deal, it represented the largest mortgage ever put on a New York office tower. In exchange for the favorable interest rate, Corporate Property Investors got the option to acquire the property at the end of the 10-year period in exchange for the $500 million mortgage.
But at least one person at General Motors said the auto maker received additional considerations for the building. As a result of the transaction, which closed early last month, G.M. will record a special, one-time gain of about $600 million, but it was not clear what the additional $100 million represented.
Telephone messages to Hans C. Mautner, the chairman and chief executive of Corporate Property Investors, were not returned.
The Manhattan-based realty group, which was started in 1971, is one of the most successful real estate investors in the country. With about 21 million shares and about $3.4 billion in shareholders' equity, the investment trust, which is not traded publicly, has some of the nation's largest public and private pension funds as shareholders. A.T.&T.'s pension fund is believed to be the largest shareholder. In addition, it also has major foreign shareholders like the Kuwaiti Investment Office.
Its annual return to shareholders has averaged about 17 percent over the last 15 years. Originally, shares sold for $25 apiece but today a single share costs about $162. Dividends, too, have risen sharply, from about $1.90 for the first dividend to about $6.90 recently.
The group has a portfolio that is 80 percent large, regional shopping malls -- the best performing segment of the commercial real estate market at present -- with the remaining 20 percent in prime office buildings.

 BODY:

Long, Not Too Long
Five hours 11 minutes for the uncut "1900." Three hours 10 minutes for "Dances With Wolves." Two hours 41 minutes for "The Godfather Part III."
"Not every movie can be very long, but there are good examples," said the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, whose 1977 epic, "1900," has finally been released at the length he intended. 
 "1900" has long been a prime example of the penchant of distributors and exhibitors to cringe at leisurely storytelling, preferring instead films that run two hours or less. The theory being: There's more money to be gleaned from a movie that can be shown in a theater six times a day than from one that can be shown only two or three times.
"I have not seen it," Mr. Bertolucci said of "Dances With Wolves," "but I hear Kevin Costner's movie is three hours, and it works very well.
"We say in Italy, the last chicken that sings has made the eggs. They always follow the last success. So after Kevin Costner's film, there will be more room for long movies for a while."
Mr. Bertolucci is, of course, the Academy Award-winning director of "The Last Emperor," the 1987 film that won nine Oscars, including that for best picture.
"When I did 'The Last Emperor,' which was 2 hours 45 minutes," Mr. Bertolucci said, "the distributors were terrified at the beginning. Then the movie did well, and they said it is, in fact, the right length."
Although his latest film, "The Sheltering Sky" (2 hours, 17 minutes), is in the theaters, Mr. Bertolucci has not yet decided on his next project.
"There is an idea of doing a movie about Buddha, which is very fascinating," he said. "But I cannot say at the moment that movie will be my next project. That will take years of study. Maybe I have to become a Buddhist before doing it."
 
Accolades at Last
 If length was Bernardo Bertolucci's problem with "1900," content was Jiri Menzel's concern with "Larks on a String."
Mr. Menzel, the Czechoslovak director who won an Academy Award for his 1966 film "Closely Watched Trains," made the 69-minute "Larks on a String" in 1969, in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Prague. The film, about a group of intellectuals being re-educated through manual labor under the Communist regime, was promptly banned.
When "Larks on a String" was finally released last year, it went on to win a Golden Bear, the top award at the Berlin Film Festival; it opens today in New York at Film Forum 1.
"It's a nice surprise for me," said Mr. Menzel, noting he had long hoped that "Larks on a String" would be released in Czechoslovakia but never anticipated that the film would prove interesting to audiences in other countries.
"It think basically it's very easy to understand," he said. The message, he added, is: Don't hate your enemies. "For the future to be better," he explained, "you have to try to understand both sides and together go forward."
Going forward himself, Mr. Menzel, hopeful of an autumn release, is beginning to edit his latest movie, an adaptation of Vaclav Havel's stage adaptation of "The Beggar's Opera," by John Gay. And he is preparing for two more films.
One is "The Engineer of Human Souls," an adaptation of a novel by the exiled writer Josef Skvorecky. "It's his memories of his youth during the war in a small town in Czechoslovakia compared with his life now in Canada," Mr. Menzel said.
The other is "Fadeout," a true story of wartime Prague that is a project for the producer David Puttnam.
Having sampled both Communist repression and new freedom in Czechoslovakia, Mr. Menzel said he found the current atmosphere a bit difficult for film makers because the rules have changed. Now, he said: "It's economic censorship. It's as bad as ideological censorship. It's very difficult to start a new movie, because we don't have enough money.
"The solution is, first, to make movies for a large public, also to try to make co-productions and also push banks or rich people or the state to help us."
So he finds the outlook uncertain. "It's a big problem," he said. "If we are not successful, it will be bad for the future. During socialism, Czech movies were independent of the box office, but now it is a different time."
 
2 Who Produced
 Richard Zanuck and David Brown, the producers who brought audiences such films as "The Sting," "Jaws" and "The Sugarland Express," have been chosen by the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to receive the organization's Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.
The award honors "a creative producer whose body of work reflects a consistently high quality of motion picture production" and is conferred only in years when the board feels there is a deserving recipient. It has been presented 29 times in 62 years of academy history, and this year's presentation, during the ceremonies March 25, will be the first to a pair of producers.
Mr. Zanuck and Mr. Brown, who formed the Zanuck-Brown Company in 1972, produced 17 films before going their separate ways after 15 years. Mr. Zanuck, with his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, produced last year's best picture, "Driving Miss Daisy."

Thwarted Expectations

BYLINE: "H-2 Worker" was shown as part of the 1990 New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from Caryn James's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 24, 1990. The film opens today at the Collective for Living Cinema, 41 White Street in Manhattan.

 BODY:
As black workers cut sugar cane in the 1940's, a narrator notes that these happy laborers are following the "hereditary urge to go back to the plantation." That archival clip, included in Stephanie Black's "H-2 Worker," suggests how little the plantation mentality has changed in nearly 50 years, though today the sugar-cane growers rely on Jamaicans imported to Florida for six months every year.
Ms. Black's documentary follows the men who arrive on H-2 visas, temporary permits that allow foreigners to take jobs for which employers cannot find Americans. According to the film, each year 10,000 Jamaicans respond to the promise of more money than they can make at home, and become virtual prisoners, crowded into dormitories that resemble Army barracks, paid at most $5 an hour -- minus transportation and housing fees -- for grueling field work. 
 Although Ms. Black's sympathy with the laborers is manifest, "H-2 Worker" is that rare hybrid that succeeds as both film and advocacy. The documentary's look and form is smooth and sophisticated, combining reggae music, voice-overs of letters between the Jamaicans and their families at home, interviews with the workers and with a sugar industry representative, and archival material that sets the current situation in historical context. Ms. Black is not artistically innovative, but she has mastered some fundamental rules of effective documentary film making. She assumes a calm, objective tone, allowing the visual images and interviews to speak for themselves. She lures viewers to her point of view rather than bludgeoning them.
Maryse Alberti's cinematography is a major element of the film's convincing realism. Ms. Alberti creates rich images of the men in the fields, bending to cut cane that stands taller than they do; even a glimpse suggests the strain on one's back. The dormitory, with laundry strung between the bunks, looks stark and demoralizing, but not exaggeratedly gruesome. Most important, the film never looks picturesque or condescending.
The workers are quietly angry, dignified and often resigned as they describe their thwarted expectations. One man has been returning to Florida for 14 years, suggesting the dilemma facing poor people with limited opportunities. When the workers stage a stoppage to complain about low wages, the police are brought in to remove them from the camp; within a week, 300 replacement workers are flown in from Jamaica.
"H-2 Worker" does not pretend to offer any answers, but it solidly frames issues about the economy, employment and the treatment of workers who seem just steps away from slavery.

HEADLINE: First Executive Loss Likely

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The First Executive Corporation said today that it expected to report a loss "of a material amount" for the fourth quarter and the full year.
The life insurance company said the loss would be caused partly by a 4 percent decline in the value of its investment portfolio in the period. The portfolio is largely made up of high-risk, high-yield "junk bonds." The company said the results would also be affected by the outcome of a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission of First Executive's plan to restructure its preferred stock.
First Executive, which is based in Los Angeles, also said it had completed a previously announced restructuring of its senior debt.
First Executive, which was among the largest purchasers of junk bonds in the past decade, has been scrambling for several years to avoid a financial crisis brought on by the decline in junk bond prices. The company said it was continuing to negotiate or consider a number of other deals to strengthen its financial condition.

HEADLINE: Slump in Reading, Pa.: From Threat to Reality

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY, Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Feb. 9

 BODY:
In the last two months, recession has quietly infiltrated this blue-collar city on the edge of the Pennsylvania Dutch country, transforming an impending threat into a grim reality for residents like Herbert Cook.
"It's getting tough," said Mr. Cook, co-owner of two Midas muffler shops. At the shop on Kutztown Road his gaze fell on a repaired Oldsmobile that has languished for weeks because the customer can't afford to pay the bill. With revenues down 10 percent in December and January from levels a year earlier, Mr. Cook plans to cut his workers' hours if business doesn't pick up this month. "I just don't have the cash flow," he said. 
 As in other cities across America, the economic pulse of Reading, named for the ancestral home of the William Penn family in England, and its environs has clearly weakened since an initial visit here just after Thanksgiving. And while no city or county can stand for the nation as a whole, the Reading area, with its diverse economic base, provides a snapshot of how a fairly typical East Coast manufacturing city is adapting to a slump.
Despite its broad business base, small shops like Mr. Cook's and large companies like the Dana Corporation are hurting all across Reading, most of which is visible from the Japanese-style pagoda atop Mount Penn that has become the city's symbol.
To be sure, there are businesses that have yet to feel any significant pinch from what has developed into the nation's ninth postwar recession.
In fact, some enterprises, like Jack O'Reilly's tuxedo-rentals, seem to be thriving. Mr. O'Reilly, who moved into larger quarters last month, outfitted 13 weddings last week. He said his biggest problem was the competition from bridal shops that offered free tuxedos for bridegrooms.
But for most enterprises, conditions are sobering.
"No question, there is further economic slowdown," said Fred D. Hafer, head of the Metropolitan Edison Company, the main supplier of electricity to the city and surrounding Berks County. Both homes and businesses are using less power, he said, and even though factory use was up slightly in December, the January figure was 8.2 percent below the level of January 1990.
"Business is poor," said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, president of Meridian Bancorp Inc., which has 36 percent of the county's banking market. He dissented from predictions by the Bush Administration and most private economists that the recession would end by midyear. "I'm not that optimistic myself," he said.
Probably the most serious single blow to the Reading job market in the last two months was the decision by Dana, which laid off 60 of its 2,400 local workers in October, to idle another 400 employees who had been working short weeks.
 
Slump in Used Cars, Too
 "We're suffering due to the hard economic times in Detroit," said Richard Harman, division controller of the company, which is based in Toledo, Ohio. The Dana plant here makes frames for Chevrolets and Cadillacs and side rails for light-truck chassis.
Over all, the Reading area jobless rate averaged 5.4 percent in the final three months of 1990, up from 4.7 percent in the preceding quarter but still a half-point below the national average.
Although it has Dana, Exide batteries and some automotive heritage in Charles E. Duryea's turn-of-the-century road trials on Mount Penn, Reading is not essentially a car town. Yet it suffers heavily when the car business goes sour.
Frank Borek, who has a used-car lot in suburban Temple, emphatically rejected a visitor's supposition that in a recession consumers shift from new cars to used ones. "That's a fallacy," Mr. Borek exclaimed. He said he sold 28 cars last month compared with 56 in January 1990, and that his average sale had slumped 40 percent so far this year, to $1,80.
There is little overlap between new- and used-car buyers, Mr. Borek maintained, with both groups tending to trade down within their own categories during hard times.
Yet at least some of the new-car dealers in Reading have eluded the general battering. For example, at Tom Masano Lincoln-Mercury near the armory from which a Marine Corps artillery unit has been called for Persian Gulf duty, salesmen say a late January surge regained ground lost earlier in the month and allowed the dealership to equal the 78 cars sold and leased in January, 1990.
When war broke out, "we were nonexistent" for about a week, said Doug Potts, the sales manager.
 
Cut Costs or Raise Demand
 The general squeeze here has prompted various actions to either cut costs or raise demand so incomes can be maintained in the face of thinner margins:
*Jack Leifer of Bloom Furniture has cut inventories to the near-minimum to deal with what he calls worse conditions than in the recession of 1981-82. Bloom's January sales slumped 30 percent from levels a year earlier. When the rebound comes, he said, "we can accelerate pretty fast."
*The Reading Eagle Company, publisher of the main area newspapers, is working to counter "flat" overall advertising linage and a 10 percent plus drop in lucrative classified linage. It is using cross-promotions involving its WEEU radio station and other affiliates; a new telephone information service in which messages are preceded by commercial plugs, and stepped-up efforts to help local merchants get advertising money from national companies whose products they sell.
*The Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse and Boscov's Department Stores have been driven to two-for-one and "gift with purchase" offers to spur sales. At the same time, the city's famous outlet malls are wooing the local shoppers they have long neglected.
*TCBC of Reading, a computer store, says it is selling personal computers and facsimile machines to many of the newly unemployed who have decided to go into business for themselves. But other business is soft, according to Kevin Bitz, the controller, and "the sales cycle is definitely longer" before a deal is finalized.
*The Carpenter Technology Corporation, a specialty steel company that is the city's second-largest employer after A.T.&T., still finds orders for energy and aircraft equipment largely offsetting poor auto and appliance business. But Paul R. Roedel, its chairman, said Cartech would be "hard-pressed to match" the profits of second-half 1990, which were down 9 percent, because of fierce price pressures. Mr. Roedel said he had just received a letter from General Motors, which it supplies, asking about reductions.
More drastic steps are being taken by managers of the Sonoco Fibre Drum Inc., although they are more the result of industry overcapacity than of general recession. The company announced in early October that the 313,000-square-foot plant would be closed with the loss of 140 jobs.
 
United Way Pledge Worry
 "Now I'm strictly into a cleanup and dismantling mode," said the production manager, Dennis J. Leonard, who said he thought only "a small fraction" of his work force, which had average earnings of $11.50 an hour excluding benefits, had found new jobs.
One factor in the demise of this plant appeared to be modern, "just-in-time" inventory practices that reduce the volume of material that companies need to store in drums on their premises.
The recession has Bob Pollack, owner of a downtown fur store, worried that the apparently successful United Way drive he led last fall will suffer from a high rate of unmet pledges. The recession has already led various companies to delay paying their Chamber of Commerce dues.
But there are some encouraging signs. The Georgia-Pacific paper plant shut down last year has been bought by a New Jersey company that plans to reopen it in 1991 to make recycled paper products. And, not surprisingly, the economy is getting some extra lift from Defense Department orders for such things as underwear, batteries, candy, steel and chemical antidotes related to the Persian Gulf war.
 
Mortgage Applications Rise
 Moreover, while there has been a rise in personal and business bankruptcies, Chris Mills, manager of the Credit Bureau of Reading and Berks County, said loan delinquencies had not climbed much beyond the post-Christmas increases of other years.
In fact, Mr. Mills said, his bureau received 116 mortgage applications in the first week of February, about twice as many as the late 1990 pace.
Albert Boscov, whose family's three department stores in the Reading area ranged from a 3 percent sales decline in January to a 3.6 percent advance, said that major appliances -- traditionally strong in January -- constituted the only notably weak sector.
"Business is pretty flat now," he said, expressing the view of many in this city, "But," he added, "it's not a disaster."

'German Angst': The Costs of War

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
"GERMANY'S relations with the United States are under strain," said Otto Lambsdorff, the chairman of the Free Democratic Party, a partner in the coalition Government with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, in an interview in New York this week. He had just finished a round of meetings in Washington with top Bush Administration officials and Congressional leaders and with business executives and bankers in New York.
Washington is annoyed, it seems, because it believes Germany has not done enough to support the United States in the Persian Gulf war. Many Americans are angry because the German Government moved slowly to prevent German companies from supplying Iraq with arms and poison gas plants. 
 Lloyd Cutler, a prominent Washington lawyer who has recently spoken at length with German business executives in this country, said in an interview yesterday that unless the rising trend of anti-German sentiment was checked, there was "real concern" in German circles about the danger of a boycott against German products.
Mr. Lambsdorff said American annoyance with Germany was partly related to "misconceptions" but also to "mistakes we have made." It is a misconception, he said, to believe that most Germans are opposed to the war against Iraq. Americans are misled, he said, by the widespread demonstrations in the streets. Most Germans -- at least 75 percent, he said -- support the war.
He did not try to minimize the fury of the German demonstrators: "There is widespread hysteria, a strong rejection of any opposition to the Iraqi dictator, an assessment of the United States as a menacing power."
But he denied that the German protests were a manifestation of anti-Americanism. The demonstrators, he said, were fiercely critical of Germancompanies for shipping arms and poison gas to Iraq. Mr. Lambsdorff was bitter in his denunciation of the small number of companies that had done so. He said he shuddered to hear three words linked together for the first time in decades: "Germans, Jews and gas."
"These companies," he said, "knew what they were doing. They did so in violation of existing German laws." Why? "Greed," he said.
"Such things must not and will not recur," Mr. Lambsdorff told an audience in Washington. "Never again!" he declared, using the slogan of Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and historian of the Holocaust. He said all German parties were supporting aid for Israel, financial and military, and the German Government had supplied Patriot and Hawk missiles to the Israelis.
Mr. Lambsdorff, a former Economics Minister, was also critical of the German Government for being so slow to provide greater financial support for American and coalition actions in the gulf. Germany has pledged nearly $11 billion to the coalition, of which $6.6 billion is pledged to the United States. But the money has been slow to arrive here. As of Feb. 11, only $272 million in cash had been received from Germany by the United States.
Mr. Lambsdorff said there could be no doubt thatthe full German pledge would be paid, adding that the commitment of $6.6 billion to the United States was based on the assumption that the war would last three months. "If it lasts longer," he said, "then we will have to pay more."
He attributed Germany's slowness to several factors: wishful thinking that peace had arrived with the end of the cold war; a fundamental change in German attitudes about war resulting from the nation's terrible experiences in the last two world wars; the German Constitution and its requirement of a two-thirds vote to permit troops to be sent outside the NATO area, and a preoccupation with the problems of German unification.
Overriding all was "German angst," which Mr. Lambsdorff defined as "the fear of losing things hitherto taken for granted." He called it a fear of losing political, social and even ecological stability. He said "German angst" was best expressed in the motto chosen for the German demonstrations: "We won't let our future be destroyed."
But the German anxiety is also rooted in economics, particularly fear of inflation. In addition to its increased pledges to support the gulf war, Mr. Lambsdorff said, the German Government will pay 50 billion marks this year to rebuild East Germany, with the trend rising in coming years; it will pay 13 billion marks to make possible the withdrawal of 400,000 Soviet troops from Germany, and it spend billions more to help the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe "avoid a social catastrophe."
The German budget deficit could rise to 5 percent of gross national product in 1991, a huge ratio for Germany. To hold down the deficit, the Government plans to increase taxes. And to ward off inflation, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, has raised interest rates at a time when the United States, Britain and other European countries are pushing rates down to check recession.
Thus, the war in the gulf is not only straining German relations with the United States but also with its partners in the European Community. The road to European political and monetary union looks rockier and longer than it did before the war in the gulf started. And Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, looks politically weaker.

HEADLINE: Big Losses For G.M. And Ford

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Saying that war and recession had shattered consumer confidence, the nation's two biggest auto makers today reported huge fourth-quarter losses. General Motors, with a $1.62 billion deficit, and Ford, with $519 million, said sales had dried up faster than they could cut costs.
Both companies said losses seem likely to continue for several months as they had seen no signs of a rebound in sales yet. Both also said they would intensify efforts to cut costs. 
 When added to the small quarterly profit posted last week by the Chrysler Corporation, the Big Three's collective deficit was the second largest in history, more than doubling the mark set in the last recession. The Big Three racked up an even bigger loss in the third quarter, but that resulted from expenses attributed to a reorganization at General Motors.
The loss at the General Motors Corporation, which came on revenue of $29.88 billion, compared with a profit of $700.2 million, or $1.01 a share, on revenue of $31.36 billion in the period last year. The Ford Motor Company's loss, on revenue of $24.2 billion, compared with a profit of $314 million in the 1989 period, or 68 cents a share, on $24.1 billion in revenue.
 
Auto Stocks Decline
 The stocks of the two companies fell today in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with G.M. down 62.5 cents, to $36.25, and Ford down 25 cents, to $30.50.
G.M., the industry leader, speaking of overall 1990 performance, said its North American automotive operations had lost money. That loss reflected a drop in the number of vehicles sold in the United States and Canada, a greater proportion of less profitable vehicles sold and intense competition, which reduced prices. But G.M.'s overseas subsidiaries earned $2.4 billion on the strength of GM Europe's record results and despite depressed economic conditions in Brazil. On Wednesday, G.M.'s non-automotive units posted strong profit increases.
Ford's domestic sales volume was also down for the quarter and the year, as was the company's proportion of high-profit vehicles sold. And, like G.M., Ford was forced to pay big rebates, averaging $1,000 a vehicle for 1990, which contributed to making its American auto operations unprofitable. But Ford was also hurt by a huge drop in the profitability of its overseas operations, caused by labor and market disruptions in Britain, and inflation in Brazil and Argentina.
G.M. and Ford said that throughout the second half of 1990 they were selling far fewer pickups, utility vehicles, vans and other trucks, which have provided a disproportionate amount of profit in recent years.
Although G.M. and Ford remain financially strong, each says it is contending with far tougher economic conditions than anticipated early last year when it appeared the economy was headed for a mild recession. Chrysler, while eking out a narrow profit, is financially weak, with fewer liquid assets and less borrowing power than its domestic rivals. At risk for all the Big Three, however, are expensive vehicle development programs meant to help against future Japanese cars and trucks.
"It's not clear what's going to happen," said David McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, who acknowleged that Ford also expected to post a big loss in the current quarter. "Rarely do we have a downturn and a war at the same time."
Both auto makers, vowing to hold capital spending sacrosanct, say their capital spending will be steady, but analysts and suppliers are reporting that a few programs already are being drawn out over a longer period of time. Since the war, for example, G.M. has told managers working on two new versions of the mid-size Buick Century and Oldsmobile Ciera that their project would be delayed for at least a year, a G.M. spokesman acknowledged.
Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, declared in a statement that the automaker would cut costs faster and deeper "without sacrificing its emphasis on a continuing flow of new and improved products."
That means some workers may feel the pinch, starting almost immediately. Mr. McCammon said Ford, the No. 2 auto maker, would try to cut salaried employee costs through attrition, early retirements and other expenses, but he acknowledged that white-collar dismissals would likely occur as well. The pay of hourly workers who are put on layoff is guaranteed by union contract but is usually less than full pay.
 
Ford's Particular Trouble
 The latest results are particularly difficult for Ford, whose top executives have said they reorganized the company in the 1980's so it could be profitable during an industry downturn. Mr. McCammon said a profit for all of 1991 might still be possible.
But Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, said Ford "probably didn't anticipate the loss of market share, the downturn in Europe and the high incentive costs."
Mr. Heinbach said "all the Big Three will have losses in the first quarter and possibly in the second."
Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said, "We expect the U.S. economy will start a gradual recovery at some point in 1991 and G.M.'s North American automotive operations will be in a stronger position."
Mr. Poling said, "Although today's environment is quite negative, we are well poised for the economic recovery that inevitably will happen." Mr. McCammon said orders from dealers had improved slightly in early February from a low level in January.
A G.M. spokesman noted that it planned to reduce white-collar ranks only through attrition. "This puts pressure on the organization to be disciplined," he said.
The results of G.M.'s latest quarter included a one-time charge of $132 million to cover the closing of Saab's plant in Malmo, Sweden; G.M. owns half of Saab. The results also include a $60 million charge to cover the write-down of inventory in Brazil.
For all of 1990 Ford earned $860.1 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenue of $97.65 billion, compared with net income of $3.84 billion, or $8.22 a share, on revenue of $96.15 billion in 1989.
G.M. lost $1.99 billion on revenue of $124.7 billion in 1990, compared with a profit of $4.22 billion, or $6.33 a share, on revenue of $126.93 billion in 1989. G.M.'s 1990 results included a $2.1 billion charge against earnings, announced in November, to close up to nine factories.

HEADLINE: Bloomingdale's Union Asked to Forgo Raise

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Citing financial hardship, Bloomingdale's has asked the union representing 3,500 full-time employees to rescind an $18-a-week wage increase due to take effect March 1.
But the union said it would not comply and that it would meet with Bloomingdale's management next Thursday to discuss the matter. 
 "This is the first time in 50 years of collective bargaining with Bloomingdale's that they have asked for a wage cancellation," John O'Neill, president of Local 3 of the United Storeworkers, said yesterday.
The scheduled wage rise, the third annual increment in a five-year contract that began in 1989, covers full-time sales and non-sales personnel at Bloomingdale's main store in Manhattan, two warehouses and three office centers. The other 14 Bloomingdale's stores are not unionized.
Bloomingdale's and eight other chains owned by Federated Department Stores Inc. and the Allied Stores Corporation -- units of the Campeau Corporation of Canada -- have been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code since January 1990. Like other New York-based retailers, Bloomingdale's has experienced sluggish sales because of the recession and the Persian Gulf war.
"We have never before asked for rescinding a wage increase, but under the circumstances, with our financial burdens and the recession, we don't think it is unusual," a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman said yesterday.
 
Added Health Benefits
 But Mr. O'Neill of Local 3 said: "It's particularly serious because our contract also calls for the employer to pay 9 percent of payroll for health benefits. So the $18 a week is really $19.75."
In a letter sent to the union last month in which it sought to void the wage increase, Bloomingdale's said that if discussions failed to "produce a mutually satisfactory understanding," it might petition the Federal bankruptcy court to obtain approval for blocking the increase.
Neither Bloomingdale's nor the union would comment on the possibility that a partial wage increase might be acceptable if no other settlement could be reached in the discussions.
Although American retailing is largely non-unionized, it is unusual for a unionized retailer to seek cancellation of a planned wage increase.
"Canceling a contract wage increase is a serious business," a retailing consultant who asked not to be identified said yesterday. "I can't help wondering what other retailers will do when they hear of the Bloomingdale's move,"
R. H. Macy & Company, which is unionized in New York, recently gave a $15-a-week increase to its New York employees. Other large retailers are seeking ways to reduce costs, mostly by reducing staffs through terminations or attrition.
In addition to seeking to erase the union's wage increase, Bloomingdale's is also acting to reduce wages for some 2,000 executives. In a recent letter, it told its executive staff that the effective date of their wage increases this year would be moved from Feb. 1 to May 1.
"What it means is that last year increases were given in May but were made retroactive to Feb. 1. Now, they will not be retroactive," a company spokeswoman said.
Bloomingdale's letters to the union and to its executives regarding wage increases were not released, but copies were obtained by a reporter.
 
A Limited Budget
 In its letter to the executives, sent earlier this month, Bloomingdale's said it would impose "a limited merit increase budget."
"As you all know," the letter said, "Bloomingdale's has just completed one of the most difficult business years in our history. The combination of a recessionary economic climate and the constraints of bankruptcy have forced us to examine our expenses and make some difficult decisions. As we plan for our successful emergence from Chapter 11, we need to capitalize on every opportunity to contain costs and operate more economically."

Pan Am Starts New Fare War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Pan American World Airways Inc. fired the latest salvo in the air travel industry's fare wars yesterday, and some competitors soon followed.
Pan Am said it would offer round-trip tickets, some to foreign destinations, for prices that are discounted in many cases by more than half.
American Airlines and Northwest Airlines immediately said they were matching the promotion with their own discounts. Others said they were studying the move. 
 Pan Am, which is operating under Federal bankruptcy protection, said it was trying to stimulate business. Airlines have been hit hard by high fuel prices, the recession and a drop in bookings that came as travelers began fearing Iraqi-sponsored terrorism.
Pan Am said its cheap tickets would apply to most cities it serves in the United States and to many overseas destinations, including western Europe. The tickets cost as little as $119 each way for passengers who fly a regular flight of at least $250 by March 1, or as little as $139 each way for passengers who do not fly other flights.
For an extra $100, people can fly to Hawaii, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil, Pan Am said. Other fees may apply, the airline said.
American and Northwest matched the Pan Am promotion with deals they said were the same or better. Travel is good from early April through May 20 on the three carriers.

HEADLINE: Gov. Weicker Delivers

 BODY:
Lowell Weicker promised to be tough if Connecticut elected him governor -- so tough that he'd be dumped after one term, he quipped. Five weeks in office, he has now delivered in spades, by proposing a personal income tax. Whether his plan succeeds or fails, it took guts and it's years overdue.
There is need for drastic action. Connecticut's deficits this year and next will be among the nation's most severe -- almost one-third of the $7.5 billion budget. Fairness and fiscal sanity recommend what Mr. Weicker has proposed, but governors have banished all thought of it since enactment of an income tax in 1971 met such ferocious protest that it was quickly repealed. 
 Connecticut's main revenue source is the nation's highest state sales tax -- 8 percent. It also levies the highest state tax on corporate profits -- 13.8 percent. Mr. Weicker would chop the sales tax nearly in half and expand its application, cut the profits tax and repeal personal taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest. The sales and corporate tax cuts will boost business, and folding unearned income into the income tax will spread the overall tax burden more equitably.
The strongest argument for converting to income taxation is fairness; a sales tax is disproportionately harsh on the poor. The flat 6 percent rate Mr. Weicker proposes for taxing individual incomes of more than $12,500 and joint incomes of more than $25,000 is less progressive than the graduated rates in New York, New Jersey and other states. But, compared with the current regime, it is a coup for equity -- and stability, too. A sales tax swings sharply with economic ups and down, creating recurrent crises; income taxes are relatively steady.
The strongest counterargument is that an income tax yields a tempting heap of revenue. Republicans who object to the Weicker proposal were quick to demand more control over spending. Governor Weicker's budget for next year cuts $1.2 billion from the budget Gov. William O'Neill left him, and would actually be 2 percent less than this year's -- an extraordinary accomplishment. But the spending cappers want controls written into law, as they are in half the 40 states with income taxes. Statutory strictures are arbitrary, but they can be made workable.
Addressing the General Assembly in person, the Governor said, "Neither you nor I signed on to muck around in the mistakes of the past; we're in the future business." With admirable boldness and Weickerian bluntness, he has defined the debate.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Down the Middle?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Pete Wilson, California's new Republican Governor, has one picture behind his desk: of Ronald Reagan. In his inaugural speech last month he hailed Mr. Reagan. But among former governors he also praised Democrat Pat Brown and Earl Warren, the great liberal Republican.
Mr. Wilson is coming on as something unusual in American politics: nonpartisan. In a rush of early actions there has been hardly a whiff of ideology. He put a Democrat in his cabinet, and he proposed new programs for prenatal and child care. 
 Is nonpartisanship possible? I asked in an interview the other day. He replied that some party conflict was inevitable, for example on reapportionment. California, gaining seven seats in the House, will soon have to redraw Congressional district lines.
"But I have consciously sought to minimize partisan friction," Mr. Wilson said. Voters, he said, had "an accurate perception" that important issues were not being resolved in part because politicians spent "a great deal of time and energy on partisan gamesmanship."
Two colossal problems confronted him when he left the Senate and took office as Governor on Jan. 7. California was going to be $7 billion short of revenue over the next 18 months. And after four years of drought it faced a critical water shortage.
Governor Wilson proposed some modest tax increases and lots of budget cuts. The cuts hit some sensitive areas. For one, he proposed zero funding of mandatory provisions for cost-of-living increases.
Welfare payments to families would also be trimmed, by $61 a month. The Governor justified that cut by saying California's payments in the program of Aid for Dependent Children had risen 150 percent in the last 15 years, and become a disincentive to employment.
But at the same time he proposed a series of programs for what he called "prevention" instead of "remedial actions with big price tags but uncertain results." Altogether, the new programs would cost $200 million. They focus on children.
One new program would establish a public-private system of medical insurance for poor women, covering prenatal care. Others would establish health and social services in schools, and add money for Head Start.
Mr. Wilson proposed funds for mental health counseling in elementary schools, saying "I want to discover that a child is suffering from depression that prevents learning when she is 6 -- not when she is 16." And he urged a substantial increase for contraceptive services and family planning education, "among the most sensible and humane investments we can make in our strategy of prevention."
When drug-addicted women give birth to damaged children, he said, the women should be counseled and treated. He said, "Rehabilitation is our best assurance against their delivery of a second addicted newborn."
The water problem is daunting. California is in the grip of its worst drought since the 1930's -- when, Mr. Wilson noted, the state "had one-fifth of the population we do now."
The first step, he said, is "to assure the health and safety, the sanitation of all Californians. Then you're in the business of apportioning economic hardship. Nature has already done a considerable amount of that."
What about novel ideas, like water desalination?
"There's no doubt of the ability to desalinize sea water," he said.
"The difference between Santa Barbara and Saudi Arabia is that the Saudis know they need water, and they also know it ain't going to rain there -- not next year or the next hundred. They don't know that in Santa Barbara. You know, it may rain next year! So Santa Barbara has to think: My God, is it worth this investment? Again, it's economics."
Would a desalination plant need a nuclear or oil-fired electric power plant? I asked. Neither is a realistic possibility now, he said, in a state with serious air quality problems. "Maybe natural gas would be feasible."
Governor Wilson won points from environmentalists by calling for a new state environmental protection agency and shifting pesticide control to it from the Agriculture Department. He also appointed a noted conservationist, Douglas Wheeler of the World Wildlife Fund, as director of natural resources.
The Democrats control both houses of the California Legislature. So far they have been friendly to the new Governor. It seems hard to believe that the era of good feeling can last. But perhaps the deliberately unexciting Pete Wilson has found a way to lead the country's largest state through a hard time.

HEADLINE: We'll Pay Dearly for Exporting Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"But Are There Enough Jobs for the Poor" by David R. Riemer (letter, Feb. 5) is too narrow. Yes, getting people into jobs is the preferred solution, not creating another government program, even a Civilian Conservation Corps. A far simpler, less expensive, more effective course would be to stop exporting jobs.
American trade policy has resulted in a massive giveaway of the very jobs most needed to remove people from homelessness, hopelessness and welfare. Apparel is a classic example of the surrender of tens of thousands of jobs to workers in Communist China, Bangladesh and other third-world countries. The reason for this is not productivity, quality or achievement in the workplace, but price.
In our on-again, off-again trade negotiations, the Bush Administration proposes a further liberalization of textile and apparel import policy, which would virtually insure the further reduction of this work force by more than one million jobs in 10 years or less. Apparel, the most labor-intensive part of this complex, will bear the brunt of these further reductions. These are the very jobs the less educated can handle, the entry-level positions in manufacturing.
Our trade policy leadership expresses confidence in high tech as the future of American employment, just as it expressed confidence in service jobs and, more recently, in the "information economy," as if that implied a new kind of workless workplace that will generate a national solution to employment problems. Services and information are developed and used principally by or on behalf of those who generate physical wealth. When that output is surrendered at home and moved abroad, the rest follows. Japanese producers will not long permit themselves to be dependent on United States companies for financing, software or technology.
America's strength lies in a diverse economy that can provide opportunities for all its people, not just those smart or lucky enough to afford college or technical educations, or professional training. Not everyone will be able to master the requirements of labor in a high-tech environment in which most manufacturing and assembly is handled by robots and the jobs involve building and maintaining them. Some must find their role in more basic activities.
We are giving away tens of thousands of those jobs now, even as domestic sweater and other apparel factories close and still more workers are put onto unemployment. These closings are not so easily reversed. Like deregulating the savings and loan associations, this "market" approach to trade may be great for a few for a while, but will be devastating to the country as a whole when the bills come in.

Amax Coal Buys Cannelton Concern

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Amax Coal Industries, the nation's third-largest coal producer, today bought the Cannelton Holding Company and its large, low-sulfur reserves in West Virginia.
Amax Coal, based in Indianapolis, paid $100 million to the Algoma Steel Corporation in Canada, a unit of Dofasco Inc. in Hamilton, Ontario, an Amax spokesman, Kevin Feeney, said. The deal is expected to be closed by next month. 
 The move follows Amax's strategy of increasing its holdings in relatively stable energy concerns to complement its business in the more cyclical aluminum business, analysts said.
The deal also brings Amax more reserves of low-sulfur coal, a commodity that was heavily sought after the clean air amendments were enacted last year. The law requires electric utilities to reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions created when coal is burned. Low-sulfur coal would help utilities meet the new standards.
Amax Coal, a unit of the New York-based Amax Inc., ranks third in the industry, after the Peabody Coal Company and Consolidated Coal. It shipped about 46 million tons of steam coal last year, mostly to electric utilities and industrial companies.
Last year, Cannelton shipped about six million tons of coal, almost 70 percent of which was low-sulfur steam coal. It also supplies metallurgical coal to Algoma. Cannelton holds 138 million tons of economically recoverable reserves, of which 80 percent are low sulfur.
Analysts said an acquisition by Amax Coal was not unexpected. Last year, it was rebuffed in its attempt to buy Peabody. It was outbid by Hanson P.L.C., a British concern that owned 45 percent of the company.
Amax said this week that it had produced 44 million tons of coal last year, of which nearly 31 million came from low-sulfur reserves in Wyoming. It produced 6.2 million tons in Indiana and 5.4 million tons in Illinois from primarily high-sulfur mines.
Last year, Amax mined only 440,769 tons of coal in West Virginia.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Amax's shares rose 12.5 cents each, to $12.75.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 16, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Company News page of Business Day yesterday about Amax Inc. misstated the closing price of the company's stock on Thursday. It was $25.25 a share, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Goodyear Executive To Head Celeron Unit

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
At a late date in his career, George R. Hargreaves has been handed a challenge by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. He has been named as the next president and chief executive of Goodyear's Celeron Corporation subsidiary, generally acknowledged to be the company's white elephant.
Celeron, which runs the All American Pipeline, an oil pipeline stretching from California to Texas, posted a loss of $52.9 million last year and was a heavy contributor to Goodyear's $38.3 million loss for the year. 
 Mr. Hargreaves, 61 years old, is currently vice president and treasurer of Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio. He will take over the Houston-based Celeron on March 1. Robert W. Milk, who currently runs Celeron, will then go on special assignment until April 30, when he retires at age 65.
"Celeron and its All American Pipeline represent a considerable opportunity and challenge for its management team," Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said in a statement.
Celeron has been hurt by low oil prices and domestic production in recent years. An increase in the price of oil, however, could lift the pipeline's prospects.
Goodyear got into the oil business in 1983 as a move to diversify. It bought Celeron and the All American Pipeline Company for about $800 million. The pipeline was folded into Celeron, and Celeron has since sold many of its other assets.
Goodyear spent an additional $1 billon to construct the 1,225-mile pipeline. The pipeline has never run at anywhere near capacity.
"Circumstance changed, economics changed," Mr. Milk, has said of the project.
Mr. Hargreaves was in Houston yesterday, out of the office, and could not be reached for an interview, a Goodyear spokesman said. Mr. Hargreaves, who was born in Akron, joined Goodyear in 1971. He was named vice president and treasurer in 1987 after serving as finance director for Goodyear Great Britain. Mr. Hargreaves is a graduate of Harvard and Case Western Reserve universities.

HEADLINE: Governor of Louisiana Says He May Abandon Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Feb. 14

 BODY:
Faced with poor showings in public opinion polls and a revolt by his fellow Democrats in the State Legislature, Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana says he may abandon the Democratic Party and run for re-election this year as a Republican.
Mr. Roemer says he is disaffected with the ideological drift of his party at the national level; Louisiana politicians say he is motivated not so much by ideology as by a calculated political strategy for survival in the fall election. But whatever the motive, his intentions have drawn no small interest from national figures in both parties, and they are trying to sway his decision. 
 A defection by a Democratic Governor, especially in a year in which only three other Governors are up for re-election, would be an important victory in the Republicans' long-standing effort to boost their hold over local and state offices in the South.
 
Staving Off David Duke
 In addition, Republican officials hope a Roemer candidacy would weaken the strength of State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, who is expected to run for governor and whose political successes in Louisiana as a Republican are viewed by many national Republicans as an embarrassment.
Among the Republicans who have called Mr. Roemer to lobby him are Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who himself was a longtime Democrat and who has been efforts to convert conservative Democrats.
On the Democratic side, national leaders have enlisted the help of one of Mr. Roemer's fellow Southerners, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has repeatedly tried to reach Governor Roemer by telephone but to no avail, according to Ginny Terzano, the committee's press secretary.
Billy Nungesser, chairman of the Republican State Committee, said in an interview today that after speaking to the Governor and many others involved in the deliberations, "it is my opinion, my knowledgeable opinion, that Roemer is ready to switch when he is confident that no other major Republican candidate will enter the race."
While in Congress between 1980 and 1987, Governor Roemer frequently voted with Republicans, and he was one of the Southern "boll weevil" Democrats who supported the Reagan Administration's fiscal policies. He campaigned for the governor's mansion four years ago as an outsider who would battle the capital's well-entrenched Democratic establishment.
He has sought to raise taxes, reduce perquisites for legislators and tighten ethical standards. His opponents consider him abrasive and unwilling to keep political promises.
 The fueding has left the Governor with few ties to the Democratic Party. Even as national figures are lobbying to keep him, some local party figures would be just as glad if he left.
"I don't know of any effort, public or private, by the state Democratic leadership to try and dissuade him from leaving the party," said State Senator Allen R. Bares, a Democrat who was unseated as President of the Senate last year by fellow Democrats who accused him of being too closely allied to the Governor.
Though he acknowledges that he is considering shifting parties, Mr. Roemer is somewhat coy about the reasons. "The question I've got to decide," he said last week, "is, Do I do more for my neighbors trying to make the Democratic Party more realistic economically or the Republican Party more sound socially?"
Mr. Roemer denies that he is motivated by efforts to save his own political career. Asserting that he could win regardless of his party, he said: "Quite frankly, this next election works either way. We have checked the numbers."
But local leaders say he is searching for a strategy to survive what promises to be a very difficult re-election campaign. Simply put, they say, he is offering to switch parties if the Republicans will guarantee that he will be their standard-bearer.
The Governor already faces a formidable challenge within the Democratic Party. Edwin Edwards, the Democratic former Governor whom Mr. Roemer defeated in 1987, announced his candidacy last week. Mr. Edwards retains a substantial following, especially among black voters.
As for Mr. Duke, he will be a formidable presence in the race. Though he was disowned by the Republicans for his white-supremacist associations, he captured 44 percent of the vote in his first statewide race when he challenged Sen. J. Bennett Johnston Jr., a Democrat, last fall.
Under Louisiana's open primary law, all candidates regardless of affiliation will face the voters on Oct. 19. If no one wins a majority, a runoff is held among the top two.
Mr. Nungesser said the possibility of Mr. Roemer's switching had not been initiated by the Republicans. "There has been no courtship," he said. "This was initiated by Roemer based on what he and everybody else could see in the polls."
 
The Calculations
 In a poll published last month by The Baton Rouge Sunday Advocate, Mr. Roemer was preferred by a solid plurality of 45 percent of respondents in a three-way race with Mr. Edwards and Mr. Duke. But when mainstream Republicans were added to the list, the Governor dropped to near-even with Mr. Edwards. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.
Edward Renwick, the political scientist at Loyola University in New Orleans who conducted the poll, said: "Edwards and Duke each have a solid core vote. If a significant Republican candidate enters the race, he and Roemer will be competing against each other for the moderate-conservative white vote. That could very well produce an Edwards-Duke runoff, and that would be a nightmare for the Republicans."
Mr. Nungesser, the state Republican chief, said Governor Roemer asked late last year whether the party would be willing to withhold its support from any candidate so as to avoid the diluting effect of a crowded field.
He said he told the Governor that the party was determined to run a solid candidate. Subsequently, he said, Governor Roemer began negotiations to frame a deal in which he would switch parties and become the endorsed candidate and all other mainstream Republican candidates would agree to stay out of the election. Several other local politicians of both parties confirmed that account.
Chief among those potential candidates is former Gov. David Treen. According to Mr. Nungesser, Mr. Treen recently met with Governor Roemer and is now at a vacation home in Florida considering his options.

HEADLINE: Weicker's Tactic Is to Sell Income Tax to the People

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who was elected Governor without the support of either major political party, began a campaign today to leapfrog the legislature and convince the people of his state to accept what they have opposed in the past: an income tax.
On the morning after Mr. Weicker stunned the General Assembly and the state with his plan to resolve Connecticut's fiscal crisis and ease the recession in a single blow by throwing out the state tax system and starting over, the effort at selling the package began. In his shirtsleeves, meeting with reporters and politicians, Mr. Weicker showed that the push was on -- if not to make people like his ideas, then at least to make them understood. 
 In doing this, Mr. Weicker was making clear that he hoped to avoid the fate of the Governor of New Jersey, Jim Florio, who pressed through a major overhaul of state taxes but was reviled for failing, as he admitted later, to explain his program adequately and to rally support for it.
"I don't intend to get into a war of words," Mr. Weicker said. "I intend to get into a presentation of facts."
A sampling of opinion among Connecticut residents, business executives and local officials showed support for the Governor's plan to cut the sales tax but concern over the proposed state income tax. [Page B4.]
 
'A Tremendous Test'
 Mr. Weicker, a former Republican, was elected last year as a third-party candidate, using the same kind of nonparty personal appeal. But many lawmakers and residents say his selling job will be much harder this time around, and much more complicated.
"This will be a tremendous test of his leadership," said the State Senate majority leader, Cornelius O'Leary, a Democrat from Windsor Locks. He said that he gave Mr. Weicker's plan a "less than even" chance of success in becoming law as it now stands but that much would ride on the Governor's powers of persuasion.
"If he truly believes that this is the only option, that this is the best thing for the state, then he's got to convince the people of the state that this is the case," he said. "It will be a very formidable task."
Mr. Weicker's budget plan, with an interlocking series of deep spending reductions and state layoffs, combined with major tax increases and tax cuts -- all crowned by the introduction of a 6 percent income tax and a nearly 50 percent cut in the 8 percent sales tax -- would change most aspects of public finance in Connecticut.
Budget officials say that low-income residents would see a cut in their taxes but that the majority of residents would pay more, in some cases much more. Companies in the state would generally see their taxes cut. Aid to state universities would be cut, forcing increases in tuition of 20 to 30 percent. Some budget items would be eliminated entirely, such as the $20,000-a-year coupon program to help the elderly poor buy fresh produce. About 1,100 state employees would be laid off.
 
'Jumping Up and Down'
 Mr. Weicker, who outlined his budget plan Wednesday night before the General Assembly, conceded in the interview that many people were "jumping up and down" about his plan. But he said details, once made clear to the public, would overcome the partisan political comments that he said were already emanating from the Assembly.
"I don't think the people are going to stand for a political resolution of the fiscal problem," he said.
Mr. Weicker's press secretary, Avice A. Meehan, said the Governor's first major budget whistle stop would be next week -- a two-hour television call-in show devoted entirely to the budget.
One of the main facts of the budget plan is that even Mr. Weicker does not like it. Inaugurated on Jan. 9, he said it was soon clear to him that the old tax system built around sales and corporate profits taxes had reached its limit.
The state faces a projected $2.4 billion shortfall in tax revenue over the next 16 months, with its current biggest tax sources -- the 8 percent sales tax and 13.8 percent corporate profits tax -- already both the highest rates for state taxes in the nation. His plan would cut the sales tax to 4.25 percent and the corporate tax to 11.5 percent.
Mr. Weicker said that while almost everyone would hate some aspect of the package, the idea was to build in things that those same critics might find indispensable enough not to kill the whole thing. "We felt that as long as everybody takes a hit, there is less basis for claiming one group against the other," he said.
For liberals and conservatives alike, the plan offers jolts of pain and gain woven tightly together. The income tax, for example, long abhorred by many lawmakers who argue that it would open the gates of unrestrained spending growth, has been grafted onto an austere budget that actually reduces most state spending in the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 
An Inordinate Impact
 The sales tax, long criticized as having an inordinate impact on the state's poorer residents, would be cut sharply, but the list of taxable items would be greatly expanded so that people would pay less of the tax each time they made a purchase, but pay it more often. All clothing purchases would be taxed, for instance, as would newspapers, gasoline and international telephone calls.
There were indications today that ambivalence would keep the plan afloat for the moment. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association, for example, said that if its members could be assured that the spending and business tax cuts were real, the income tax would get a fair and open hearing. Some citizens' groups said the spending cuts might be swallowed if a progressive income tax were assured.
"There's a lot of people trying to kill this plan, but we're not among them," said Ethan Rome, legislative and political director for the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, which has advocated an income tax for years as a way to make the tax system fairer for poor people.
 
To Seek Graduated Scale
 Mr. Rome said his 100,000-member group would push to introduce a graduated scale into the income tax that would make the tax bite rise with income levels. Under the current plan, all income over $25,000 a year would be taxed at 6 percent for a couple filing jointly. For a single person, the first $12,500 would be tax free.
Some questions about the Weicker plan remain unanswerable. The state does not know yet, for example, how many of the thousands of residents who commute to jobs in New York or Massachusetts or Rhode Island -- or who commute into Connecticut from those states -- would see their taxes change.
But the acting deputy commissioner at the state's Office of Policy and Management, Lorraine M. Aronson, said that for most people, Connecticut's income tax would be lower than those charged in the other states.
The rule of interstate taxes, she said, is that the state where the money was earned gets first crack at the revenue. If the home state has a higher rate, it can then charge the marginal difference, but not the full tax.
No one, she said, would pay the full tax charged in each state.

Chart: "Highlights of Weicker's Proposals"
 The budget that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut presented to the General Assembly on Wednesday includes scores of tax revisions and spending cuts for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. Following are some of the proposals.
 
Taxes and Other Revenue
 
* Establish personal income tax of 6 percent on adjusted gross income over $25,000 for couples and $12,500 for individuals, beginning July 1.
 
* Eliminate the tax on capital gains, dividends and interest income, which would be taxed as personal income beginning July 1.
 
* Reduce sales tax to 4.25 percent, from 8 percent, beginning July 1, and apply it to many goods and services that are now exempt, including clothing, gasoline, newspapers, haircuts and movie tickets.
 
* Eliminate 20 percent corporate tax surcharge, as of Jan. 1, 1991.
 
* Increase motor vehicle registration renewal fee to $90, from $62. Increase driver's license fee to $90 for six years, from $31 for four years.
 
* Increase fee for pretrial alcohol-education program to $600, from $250. Add $20 to the fines for some motor vehicle violations.
 
Spending
 
* Eliminate 1,855 state jobs, including up to 1,100 layoffs. But 1,181 jobs would be added, for a net loss of 674.
 
* Eliminate most cost-of-living increases included in labor contracts covering state employees.
 
* Save $80 million by reducing school aid to wealthy towns.
 
* Close 7 of 19 Department of Motor Vehicles offices.
 
* Close four offtrack betting parlors.
 
The Deficit
 
* Eliminate $707.4 million revenue shortfall in fiscal 1991 by borrowing, to be paid back over three years.

HEADLINE: Peru's Neighbors Halt Food Imports

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Seeking to contain a cholera outbreak in Peru, health authorities across Latin America halted food imports today and tightened controls on people arriving from that country.
 Since the outbreak was publicly identified as cholera 10 days ago, 86 Peruvians have died and 12,669 people have fallen ill, the health authorities reported in Lima today. 
It's the first major outbreak of cholera that we have had in this century in the Western Hemisphere, and it's major," David Brandling-Bennett, an epidemiologist for the Pan American Health Organization, said today in a telephone interview from Washington.
 At the international airport here, in Mexico City and in other capitals, health inspectors checked passengers arriving from Peru for symptoms of the fatal disease -- dehydration, vomiting and diarrhea. Airplane sewage and food garbage was tested for the cholera bacillus.
 
Uncooked Food Banned
 Tightening land exits from Peru, health officials in Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile banned the entry of uncooked food from Peru, largely fish, fruits and vegetables.
 In Bolivia, navy boats patrolled Lake Titicaca with orders to seize and destroy fresh food shipped across the lake from Peru. On Tuesday, Argentina banned the import of Peruvian fish and shellfish, whether fresh, frozen or canned.
 Cholera, a disease that can be fatal if untreated within hours of the first symptoms, is transmitted through water, shellfish or vegetables contaminated by the disease.
 Peru has not suffered from a cholera outbreak since the 1880's. But since Feb. 4, the disease has been reported in cities up and down the nation's Pacific Coast and most recently in the nation's Andean highlands.
 
3 Cases Reported in Ecuador
 According to news reports, there have been three cases in neighboring Ecuador, but these have not been confirmed by Ecuadorean health officials. Ecuador has taken emergency health measures in two southern provinces where 60,000 people a day cross the border with Peru. Ecuador started distributing thousands of pamphlets in the border area today instructing residents on precautions to take, such as boiling drinking water and thoroughly cooking food, to avoid contracting the disease.
 "My advice to tourists is to go ahead with their travel," Dr. Brandling-Bennett said. "It is the indigenous people living under poor conditions, drinking poor water, who are at risk."
 
U.S. Travelers Advisory
 Addressing travelers' concerns about cholera, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said in a statement today: "The risk to U.S. travelers of acquiring cholera in endemic areas is low. During the first 20 years of the current pandemic, only 10 cases in U.S. travelers were reported to C.D.C. -- representing a risk of acquiring a reported case of cholera of less than one per 500,000 returning travelers."
 Concerning a spread of the disease, many health experts believe that Peru's neighbors are better prepared to combat a cholera epidemic because they have better health care and better water and sewage treatment facilities. One of Latin America's poorest countries, Peru suffers from widespread unemployment and malnutrition. More than half of the seven million inhabitants of Lima, the capital, live in shantytowns without access to proper sewage disposal facilities.
 To help Peru contain the outbreak, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador have sent aid, largely saline solution that reverses the fatal dehydration caused by cholera. On Tuesday, the European Community pledged $700,000 in emergency medical aid. France has sent epidemiologists and a field hospital capable of treating 10,000 people.
 With the help of the foreign aid -- rehydration salts, saline solution, and antibiotics -- Peru has been able to reduce the mortality rate from five percent of all cases two weeks ago, to less than .7 percent on Wednesday, Peruvian Health Ministry officials said.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
I.R.S. Eases Rule On Outplacement

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For people caught in the wave of layoffs sweeping the nation's businesses, there is one bit of encouraging tax news. The Internal Revenue Service, which ruled in December 1988 that the value of outplacement services should be treated as taxable income to recipients, withdrew that ruling late last year and said it would study whether employer-provided outplacement services could be treated as an excludable fringe benefit.
"It's a very hot topic," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company in New York, and director of employee benefits and executive compensation for the firm. "With the coming of recession and sudden cutbacks implemented by all types of employers, a ruling like this just didn't sit well." 
 Industry and trade groups, bar associations and others lobbied with the I.R.S. last year to change its position. The American Electronics Association, for example, wrote, "By requiring outplacement counseling to be treated as taxable income, the I.R.S. is kicking terminated employees while they are down."
The basic legal test of whether a benefit can be excluded from taxable income as a "working condition fringe benefit" is whether an employee who paid for the same benefit personally could deduct it as an unreimbursed business expense, said Mr. Neumark, who is chairman of the American Bar Association's subcommittee on fringe benefits. Examples include subscriptions to business and professional journals, professional dues and the use of a car for business purposes.
Outplacement services provide dismissed employees -- executives and managers generally -- with temporary office space and telephone service. They prepare people to look for another job, teaching them to how to make contacts and to handle themselves in interviews, sometimes videotaping practice sessions. They give advice on preparing resumes and writing letters, for example, but do not handle actual job placement. That is generally done by an executive search firm.
Outplacement fees are high, Mr. Neumark noted. They are usually either fixed or a percentage of an employee's annual salary. Either way $10,000 to $20,000 would not be uncommon. Thus, if the services are deemed taxable to employees, they could be liable for thousands of dollars in taxes without having received the cash needed to pay those taxes, and that may discourage people from accepting the services, outplacement experts say.
The cost of providing the services is deductible to employers in any event, Mr. Neumark said, but business groups have lobbied to have them treated as a nontaxable working condition fringe because providing the services is beneficial to employersand they want people to accept them.
"Outplacement services benefit the employer by mending fences with the terminated employee -- averting possible lawsuits charging wrongful dismissal and avoiding revelations of confidential information," he said, "and at the same time creating good will among remaining employees."
The I.R.S. position that the services were taxable income came in a private letter ruling. Although such rulings are technically binding only on the person addressed, their directives are generally widely followed by other taxpayers who do not want to run afoul of the I.R.S. The agency withdrew the ruling and agreed to study the matter in the light of new regulations on fringe benefits last year. That leaves the issue unresolved, but signals to many employers that they need not report the value of the services on terminated employees' W-2 forms.
"Individuals need to be aware that this is under study," Mr. Neumark said. "Certain field agents are focusing on this benefit, usually when the audit an employer." If that happens and the service decides at some future date that the benefits are taxable income, it could affect the recipients. In that case, he continued, a recipient could then deduct the value of the services as an unreimbursed business expense, but that is a miscellaneous itemized deduction that can be taken only to the extent that it exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
Any job-hunting expenses incurred are deductible if they are in the same line of work, Mr. Neumark noted, so it is important to keep records of everything -- postage for mailing letters, lunches with business acquaintances, telephone costs -- because they add up.
But job-search expenses are not deductible for people who change careers. "And if there is a substantial break between the old job and the new job," the deduction may be denied, he said.

A Credit Review By First Chicago

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The First Chicago Corporation reviewed the credit backgrounds of its New England credit card holders in August to find customers who have been delinquent on other loans. Once identified, the bank either reduced the card holder's line of credit or revoked the card altogether. A spokeswoman for the bank said it was the only time the bank had selected credit histories in a particular region as a target.
The spokeswoman, Lisa Petrison, said, "Any further action of the sort will be done on a national basis." Another spokeswoman, Lisabeth Weiner, said the bank focused on New England, which accounts for a very small portion of First Chicago's 6.6 million credit card accounts, because the recession is more severe in that region. United States Representative Joseph Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the review discriminatory.

HEADLINE: U.S. Securities Mixed in Volatile Day

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with bills and notes slightly lower and the longer maturities showing small gains. But dealers said the price movements masked a day of sharp swings, mostly caused by short-lived hopes of peace in the Persian Gulf.
Early reports that Iraq had agreed to leave Kuwait caused prices to spurt upward, but President Bush's description of Iraq's terms as a "cruel hoax" ended the rally. The bond market then turned to the day's flow of economic statistics and found then essentially neutral. 
 "The slight decline in January's Producer Price Index was disappointing, but this was offset by the sharper drop in industrial output," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. "The big improvement in our trade balance in December was expected. Over all, the prospect of a long weekend at a time of uncertainty over developments in the gulf war inhibited most market participants from taking any significant positions."
 
 Weekend Preparations
 Late in the session, as market participants squared their books for the three-day weekend, the Treasury's benchmark new long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue due February 2021, were offered at 98 27/32, up 4/32 on the day, which shaved its yield to 7.97 percent, from 7.98 percent the day before and a week earlier.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 6 7/8 percent percent notes of 1994 fell 4/32, to 99 21/32, for a yield of 7.00 percent; the new 7.75 percent long notes of 2001 rose 2/32, to 99 26/32, to yield 7.77 percent.
Meanwhile, the $12 billion of new two-year notes that the Treasury plans to auction on Wednesday traded on a when-issued basis to yield 6.81 percent, up 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, on the day. The $9 billion of new five-year notes scheduled for sale the next day traded on the same basis to yield 7.40 percent, up a basis point.
 
 Fed Adds Reserves
 The Fed added $2 billion of reserves to the banking system a day after the central bank injected a much larger amount of funds. Both moves were aimed mainly at avoiding a shortage of credit yesterday when purchases in last week's $34.5 billion of refunding issues had to be completed. If so, the Fed's actions served their purpose as the funds rate that banks charge each other dropped from 6 7/16 percent early in the day to 5 percent at the close. The Fed's perceived target for the fund rate is 6.25 percent.
In any event, dealers said the Fed's operations did not influence the discount rates on Treasury bills, which are normally most sensitive to any central bank maneuvers. The 90-day bills rose 6 basis points, to 5.83 percent; six-month bills climbed 7 basis points, to 5.91 percent, and the one-year bills advanced 5 basis points, to 5.89 percent. Some dealers attributed the rise in rates to the shifting of funds from bills to the stock market.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Iraqi Statement;
Baghdad's Offer and Conditions for Ending War Over Kuwait

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the Baghdad radio address today on a withdrawal from Kuwait, as provided by the State Department via the Foreign Broadcast Information Service:
Honorable Arabs, true Muslim believers, freedom-loving people around the world. Ever since the United States, Zionism, and the United States' imperialist Western allies came to realize that an Arab Muslim country, Iraq, was developing a force of its own, capable of being a counterweight to the imperialist-backed Zionism -- a free, honorable force, resolved selflessly to tackle Zionist aggression and greed, and to reject imperialist hegemony over the region -- the United States, Zionism, and all colonial powers who entertained hatred against Arabs and Muslims set about taking measures, making decisions, and waging campaigns of falsehoods and incitement against Iraq, with the object of thwarting the creation and development of this force, and isolating and punishing Iraq, because it has faithfully, determinedly, and efficiently gone beyond the limits set by the United States, imperialism, and imperialist forces for the states of the region. 
 The years 1988 and 1989 saw sustained campaigns in the press and other media and by officials in the United States and other imperialist nations to pave the way for the fulfillment of vicious aims.
The year 1990 saw these campaigns escalate feverishly and mount day by day. The aim was clear to us and to all conscious Arabs and true Muslims, as well as to all the free people who believe in freedom and justice in the world. The aim was to pave the way for destroying this nascent force and to tip the regional balance back in favor of the United States, Zionism, and the imperialists -- the balance that has been in place for many decades and that has prevented the Arabs from regaining their rights and the usurped and occupied lands in Palestine, the Golan Heights, and Lebanon.
It has also stood in the way of the Arab nation realizing its aspirations for revival, progress, and justice in the interest of occupying its deserved place in the world by virtue of its glorious history and its great contribution to human civilization.
In the early months of 1990, these campaigns intensified, expanded, and assumed a hysterical dimension, with daily incitements to hit Iraq, liquidate its leadership, and deprive it of the means to achieve a revival and progress. Along with other imperialist nations, the United States took a string of measures and made unfair decisions banning the export of whatever might contribute to Iraq's development and its scientific and industrial revival.
 
Economic Blockade
 These decisions called for an effective economic blockade, including the cancellation of food contracts in March 1990. It was also clear that, in concert with the Zionist entity, the United States was preparing to hit Iraq's scientific and industrial facilities and liquidate its patriotic, believing leadership.
When the United States discovered that its plan, which largely rests on the Zionist military capability, fell short of achieving its evil aims, it brought into the conspiracy its hirelings, corrupt agents, and conspiratorial rulers in the region -- the enemies of God.
Their role was to undermine Iraq's economy and then push Iraq to the brink of economic collapse.
In the meantime, the United States set about tightening up the network of the imperialist alliance in the interests of forging a political and military U.S.-Atlantic alliance with the aim of dealing a blow to Iraq and controlling the region, when the opportunity to achieve this aim presented itself with the lopsided balance represented in the Soviet Union becoming preoccupied with internal developments.
O Iraqis, O Arabs, O Muslims, O free men of the world. The events of Aug. 2, 1990, in substance and goals, were not as portrayed by the U.S. and colonialist propaganda, or as were described by the traitorous rulers, followers of America. These events were a national, pan-Arab, and Islamic uprising against the conspiracy and conspirators -- an uprising against injustice, immorality, corruption, and imperialist-Zionist-colonialist hegemony of the region, and against the plotters whose role in the U.S.-Zionist conspiracy became exposed.
Thus, the imperialistic-Zionist-Atlantic alliance revealed its true goals and intentions from the very first hours of those events. The alliance massed armies and forces, and organized the biggest and most malicious campaigns of misinformation, lies, and deception witnessed by the world in the modern age.
 
U.N. Actions
 This oppressive and sly imperialist-Zionist-Atlantic alliance manipulated the United Nations to issue in unparalleled swiftness a series of unjust and unprecedented resolutions, although this body failed throughout several decades to fulfill the simplest demands of the Arab nation and preserve the simplest rights of the Arabs in Palestine, despite the clarity of the Arab right and the severity of the tragedy of the struggling Palestinian people, from which other Arabs, including the oppressed Lebanese people, have suffered.
This tyrannical alliance has forced its will on the world. It has pursued terrorist and extortionist tactics, as well as bribery, not to mention the malicious means of lying and deception found in the bag of tricks of imperialism, Zionism, and the colonial powers to pave the way for the aggression against Iraq.
O glorious Iraqis, O dear Arabs, O faithful Muslims, O free men and honorable persons throughout the world. The aggression that has been launched on Iraq, the courageous, proud, holy warrior, faithful, and patient country, is unprecedented in history. The entire history of mankind never records such an alliance in which the United States as well as two big powers participated -- not to mention several other countries, 30 in number -- against the holy warrior, courageous, and patient Iraq, whose population does not exceed 18 million people. It is an evil rancorous, malicious, and atheistic alliance against the bastion of faith and principles, against the center of freedom where the call for justice and fairness is made.
Over the past month, the United States and its allies, along with the Zionist entity, which has taken part in the aggression from the beginning, launched savage and destructive raids on the Iraqi people, on their economic, scientific, cultural and service property, and also on their religious centers and the sites of ancient civilizations in Iraq.
These raids are unprecedented in history in terms of the enormous firepower used and in terms of the means of killing and destruction used in a manner that contravenes the United Nations Charter, the false international legitimacy, and the new world order, which they wanted to use as an order for U.S.-Atlantic hegemony over the world.
The United States and the partners in the evil alliance, the planes that fire their missiles from a distance, and the long-range missiles, have dropped huge quantities of bombs and explosives on women, children, and old people in all Iraq's cities and villages, and even on the nomad bedouins in the desert.
 
Allied Assaults
 They struck in a premeditated manner mosques, churches, schools, hospitals, civilian factories, bridges, main roads, telephone, electricity, and water centers, irrigation dams, cultural centers and sites in the country. They hit targets that have no connection any way whatsoever with the military effort or the military confrontation arena of which they have spoken.
Their latest crime was the ugly and dirty crime of the premeditated bombardment of a civilian shelter. They killed and burned hundreds of women, children, and old people. The aim of this unjust aggression was very clear, namely to proceed with the process of destruction that they desire and to punish the proud, free, and struggling Iraqi people, because they have chosen the road of freedom, independence, and glory, and have rejected humiliation, disgrace, and submission to the will of imperialism and Zionism.
The United States and its allies have waged a dirty and cowardly war against a courageous and faithful people. The history of peoples and nations and their fate are not decided by the material possessions of states and ruling regimes. How many strong and rich empires throughout history have fallen because they pursued the road of evil, cowardice, injustice, and decadence. This is the fate of tyrannical America and its decayed systems. It is the fate of Zionism and all the imperialist forces by the will of God.
Iraq has triumphed in this duel. It has triumphed because it has remained steadfast, courageous, faithful, proud, and strong willed. It has triumphed because it has maintained principles and the spiritual values inspired by the true religion of Islam and its noble heritage. Its material losses in this battle, despite their enormity, are small compared to its spirit of determination, its firm belief in principles, and strong determination to continue the course of renaissance and progress.
O dear Iraqis, O honest Arabs, O Muslims who truly believe in Islam, O honest and free men of the world. Proceeding from this firm and right feeling and this assessment of the nature of the showdown, and in order to rob the evil U.S.-Zionist-Atlantic alliance of the opportunity to achieve their premeditated goals, and in appreciation of the Soviet initiative conveyed by the envoy of the Soviet leadership, and in compliance with the principles outlined in leader President Saddam Hussein's initiative on Aug. 12, 1990, the Revolutionary Command Council has decided to declare the following:
 
Iraqi Demands
 First, Iraq's readiness to deal with Security Council resolution No. 660 of 1990, with the aim of reaching an honorable and acceptable political solution, including withdrawal. The first step that is required to be implemented as a pledge by Iraq regarding withdrawal will be linked to the following:
A. A total and comprehensive cease-fire on land, air, and sea.
B. For the Security Council to decide to abolish from the outset Resolutions 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, 677, and 678 and all the effects resulting from all of them, and to abolish all resolutions and measures of boycott and embargo, as well as the other negative resolutions and measures that were adopted by certain countries against Iraq unilaterally or collectively before Aug. 2, 1990, which were the real reasons for the gulf crisis, so that things may return to normal as if nothing had happened. Iraq should not receive any negative effects for any reasons.
C. For the United States and the other countries participating in the aggression, and all the countries that sent their forces from the region to withdraw all the forces, weapons and equipment which they have brought to the Middle East region before and after Aug. 2, 1990, whether in land, seas, oceans, or the gulfs, including the weapons and equipment that certain countries provided to Israel under the pretext of the crisis in the gulf, provided that these forces, weapons, and equipment are withdrawn during a period not exceeding one month from the date of cease-fire.
D. Israel must withdraw from Palestine and the Arab territories it is occupying in the Golan and southern Lebanon in implementation of the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly resolutions. In case Israel fails to do this, the U.N. Security Council should then enforce against Israel the same resolutions it passed against Iraq.
E. Iraq's historical rights on land and at sea should be guaranteed in full in any peaceful solution.
F. The political arrangement to be agreed upon should proceed from the people's will and in accordance with a genuine democratic practice and not on the basis of the rights acquired by the Sabah family. Accordingly, the nationalist and Islamic forces should primarily participate in the political arrangement to be agreed upon.
 
Reparations to Baghdad
 Second, the countries that have participated in the aggression and in financing the aggression undertake to reconstruct what the aggression has destroyed in Iraq in accordance with the best specifications regarding all the enterprises and installations that were targeted by the aggression and at their expense. Iraq should not incur any financial expenses in this regard.
Third, all the debts of Iraq and countries of the region -- which were harmed by the aggression and which did not take part in the aggression, either directly or indirectly -- to the gulf countries and to the foreign countries that took part in the aggression should be written off.
Besides, relations between the rich nations and poor nations in the region and the world should be based on justice and fairness in such a way that puts the rich nations before clear commitments regarding the realization of development in poor nations, and thus removes their economic sufferings.
This should be based on the saying that the poor have a share to claim in the wealth of the rich. Moreover, the duplicitous approach pursued in handling the issues of peoples and nations should be halted, whether this approach is being pursued by the United Nations Security Council or by this or that country.
Fourth, the gulf states, including Iran, should be given the task of freely drawing up security arrangements in the region and of organizing relations among them without any foreign interference.
Fifth, to declare the Arabian Gulf region a zone free of foreign military bases and from any form of foreign military presence.
Everybody must undertake to observe this.
This is our argument, which we declare before the world, clear and shining against the traitors and their imperialist masters.
Our basic source of confidence, in addition to our reliance on the one and only God, will remain to be our great Iraqi people, our valiant and struggling armed forces, and those who believe in the path that we have chosen in fighting oppression and the oppressors.
Victory will certainly be realized against the oppressors in the coming days, as it had been certain in past times. God is with us. May the despicable be damned.
The Revolutionary Command Council. 29 Rajab 1411 Hegira, corresponding to Feb. 15, 1991.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Baghdad's Position;
Iraq Deals for First Time With U.N.'s Pullout Call

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The proposal presented today by Iraq marks the first time that Baghdad has mentioned a "readiness to deal" with Security Council Resolution 660 of Aug. 3, which condemned the invasion of Kuwait and demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
The statement also contains the first Iraqi use of the word "withdrawal" in connection with that resolution, though nowhere does the statement mention Kuwait. That omission leaves open the possibility that the Iraqis might be considering a partial withdrawal. 
 President Saddan Hussein has in the past drawn a distinction between what he calls the 19th province of Iraq, which encompasses most of Kuwaiti territory, and a part of the Rumaila oil field and two strategic islands that Baghdad has moved to incorporate into the province of Basra.
The proposal does not explicitly say Iraq will withdraw even if its long list of conditions are met. Rather, it expresses Iraq's "readiness to deal with" the resolution demanding withdrawal, according to the Arabic text of the transcript, which uses the verb "tamul," meaning "to consider seriously."
 
Issued by Command Council
 In explicitly using the word "withdrawal" and linking it to Resolution 660, today's proposal in one sense went further than a proposal by Mr. Hussein on Aug. 12, which offered his Government's most extensive statement of conditions that could lead to a resolution of the crisis. The August proposal had referred only to "the formulation of arrangments for the situation of Kuwait."
Unlike the Aug. 12 proposal, which was issued in the name of Mr. Hussein and read for him on television, the statement today was attributed only to the Revolutionary Command Council, which Mr. Hussein heads.
In dozens of interviews and public statements, both Mr. Hussein and his top aides have rejected the notion of any Iraqi withdrawal. At one point before the war began, Mr. Hussein said that for Iraq to leave Kuwait would be the same as having the United States relinquish Hawaii.
Today's proposal both includes and excludes demands made on Aug. 12. For example, it repeats the demand that Israel withdraw from "Palestine and the Arab territories it is occupying in the Golan and southern Lebanon." On the other hand, it omits a suggestion in the Aug. 12 declaration that the coalition forces be replaced with an inter-Arab force under the auspices of the United Nations.
 
New Condition Added
 The proposal also adds a number of conditions not included in the August declaration. Iraq is now specifically saying its withdrawal depends on the abrogation of Security Council resolutions against Iraq approved since its invasion of Kuwait, including those imposing a global embargo and holding Iraq liable for war damages and economic losses because of the crisis.
In its newest position, Iraq is also demanding a comprehensive withdrawal of the 28-nation coalition aligned against it, including the troops, weapons and equipment they brought to the region, presumably including American-made Patriot missiles that have largely neutralized Iraqi Scud missile attacks on Israeli targets.
Iraq, Iran and the Persian Gulf nations would be responsible for determining future security arrangments for the region, which would be declared a zone free of foreign military bases, the proposal said.
In a speech a year ago, Mr. Hussein first demanded the withdrawal of American vessels from the gulf, and the withdrawal of foreign forces from the region has been one of his favorite themes since the current crisis began. Today's proposal adds a new element: The forces and weapons would have to leave the region within a month of a cease-fire.
 
No Schedule for Pullout
 The proposal does not, however, give a deadline or schedule for the removal of Iraqi troops and equipment from Kuwait.
In addition to rejecting the Security Council resolution that holds Iraq responsible for war damages, the Iraqi proposal for the first time states that the allies should write off the foreign debts of Iraq and its allies in the region, presumably Jordan and Yemen.
The proposal repeats Iraq's demand that Kuwait's political future be determined by democratic process, and that the Sabah family should not automatically return to power. But it is sufficiently vague that it does not rule out the possibility that the Emir and his family could return.
On the negative side, since the proposal does not include the word Kuwait, it might also reflect Mr. Hussein's hope that the people of Kuwait would choose to merge with Iraq.

HEADLINE: NEW DATA SUGGEST NATION'S RECESSION COULD BE SLOWING

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In a report hinting that the economy's decline may be bottoming out, the Government said today that industrial output fell much less in January than in the two months before.
Output was down four-tenths of 1 percent last month after declines averaging three times that much in November and December. 
 At the same time, prices received by producers edged down one-tenth of 1 percent over all, but rose five-tenths of 1 percent when energy and food were excluded, a rise that was more than twice the increase in that category in December. The overall change in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods was also firmer than the month before, and the prices report was taken by economists as a further indication that the worst of the recession might have passed. [Page 35.]
 
Interpreting the Signals
 "There is now embryonic evidence that the rate of decline in economic activity has slowed," declared Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "The continuing fall in industrial production is clearly serious," he added, but is markedly less worrisome than in preceding months.
In December, production dropped a revised 1.1 percent, nearly double the decline of six-tenths of 1 percent initially estimated by the Federal Reserve Board. The November decline now stands at 1.6 percent, a slight change from earlier estimates of 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent. With the January drop, industrial production has fallen for four straight months.
An upturn in car and truck assembly was the main factor limiting the January slide in the index that measures the output of factories, mines and utilities, the Federal Reserve stated.
 
More Autos Being Made
 Output climbed to a still-depressed seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.4 million cars last month, but this was significantly above December's total of 5 million, analysts noted. It was also below recent selling rates, which implies that in the months ahead the automotive sector will be a positive force in the economy rather than a drag.
"The question this raises is whether the worst is behind us," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., referring to the overall output report. He said the recession, though likely to continue for another few months, would become increasingly less severe with the help of the recent decline in interest rates, oil prices that have dropped from their highs after the August invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and a weak dollar that helps make American goods more internationally competitive in price.
The Federal Reserve also reported that utilization of industrial capacity fell five-tenths of a percentage point last month, to 79.9 percent, the lowest level since January 1987. Still, the latest decline was about half the 1.1 percentage point drop in December, providing another tenuous sign that the downturn in the economy might be starting to lose momentum. The rate for factories alone also fell five-tenths of a point in January, to 78.8 percent, the lowest since September 1986 and 2.5 percentage points below its 1967-1990 average.
 
 Concern About Interest Rates
 Some analysts thought the hefty rise reported today in the so-called core inflation rate of producer prices might jeopardize further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, but others said the central bank would continue to push interest rates down. The core rate is calculated excluding food and energy. The optimists pointed to two price increases last month that were unlikely to be sustained -- 2 percent for cars and 5.9 percent for alcoholic beverages.
The price rise in alcoholic beverages, a record, was thought by some analysts to reflect increases imposed at the first of the year under cover of a rise in taxes. Taxes themselves are not included in the index.
Analysts also found encouragement in another part of the prices report, the decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in the price of goods at the intermediate stage of production, generally two steps short of retail shelves.
 
 Broad-Based Decline
 The production data showed that when motor vehicles and parts were excluded, output fell six-tenths of 1 percent, slightly less than in the preceding three months. All major market and industry groups fell last month -- except for mining, which was unchanged -- but in most cases the declines were markedly less severe than in December.
Output of consumer goods eased one-tenth of 1 percent, business equipment eased two-tenths and materials fell five-tenths while construction supplies tumbled 1.8 percent, twice the December decline.
Factory output fell four-tenths of 1 percent last month after a 1.4 percent drop in December, with durables and nondurables both falling by four-tenths. Utilities, which are heavily affected by extremes in weather, had a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent after a 1 percent increase in December that had initially been estimated at 1.9 percent.
Since October, output of consumer goods other than motor vehicles has fallen about 1.25 percent reflecting declines in clothing, energy products, appliances and furniture, the Federal Reserve stated.
 
 Computer Production Drops
 Business equipment other than vehicles fell five-tenths of 1 percent, mainly reflecting a big drop in computers and other information-processing equipment, a decline that unnerved some analysts. Mr. Richards noted that capital spending on office automation had been holding up relatively well and he said he hoped this decline was temporary.
While production firmed for motor vehicle components, the output of basic metals, especially steel, fell again and the output of chemicals eased. Textiles, however, rose somewhat and energy materials were virtually unchanged for the second straight month. Output of construction supplies has now fallen more than 7 percent since summer.
The Index of Industrial Production, which covers roughly one-third of the economy, now stands at 106.5 percent, nine-tenths of a percentage point below the level of January 1990.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 0.1% in January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Prices at the wholesale level edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in January, the Labor Department reported today, as a big drop in energy costs helped provide a bright spot for an economy troubled by war and recession.
The department said the decline in the Producer Price Index last month occurred in spite of a record jump in the cost of alcoholic beverages as producers raised prices to coincide with higher Federal taxes. 
 Increases in the index normally show up with only a short lag in the Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes at the retail level.
 
Heavily Influenced by Oil
 The January decline followed a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent in December. The results in both months were heavily influenced by falling gasoline prices. Oil costs, which had jumped sharply after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, have been coming down in recent months.
Wholesale prices, discounting changes in food and energy, were up five-tenths of 1 percent in January, compared with a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Analysts said much of the January rise reflected a record 5.9 percent increase in the cost of alcoholic beverages.
The drop of one-tenth of 1 percent in wholesale prices translated into an annual rate of decline of 1 percent, the Labor Department said. That compares with a 5.6 percent increase in wholesale prices in 1990, the biggest rise in nine years.
 
 Big Drop in Gasoline

The January decline in wholesale prices was led by a 10 percent drop in gasoline costs, which followed an 8.6 percent drop in December. The price survey was taken before the war with Iraq began on Jan. 17. Since then, oil traders have pushed world energy prices down even further, reflecting an opinion that the Iraqis no longer have the ability to damage oilfields in Saudi Arabia.
Because of the price declines since the war started, analysts said energy prices should fall even further in February.
The overall energy index was down 2.5 percent after a drop of 4.7 percent in December. Also holding down prices was a surprising drop of three-tenths of 1 percent in food costs.
Prices of home heating oil fell 6.2 percent in January. But an index that measures the costs of electric power rose 2.5 percent, and natural gas prices were up three-tenths of 1 percent.
Many economists had been expecting food prices to rise in January because of a freeze that damaged fruit and vegetable crops in California. Fruit prices did jump 12.7 percent, but vegetable prices fell by 17.6 percent as ample supplies in Florida offset the effects of the California freeze.
 
Effect of Liquor Tax
 While Federal taxes on beer, wine and liquor went up in January, this increase is not measured in the Producer Price Index because it is paid to the Government and not to producers. But manufacturers used the opportunity of the tax increase to raise their own prices, the Labor Department said.
The various changes left the index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 121.9 in January, meaning that a selected group of goods cost $121.90 in January, compared with $117.60 a year ago.
While wholesale prices rose at their fastest pace in nine years in 1990, analysts are looking for a significant easing of inflationary pressures this year.
In addition to falling energy costs, analysts cited the recession as a factor that would hold down inflation because sluggish consumer demand would keep a lid on price increases.
"With demand as weak as it is, companies, even if they wanted to, could not pass price increases along," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch. "We don't have to worry about inflation in 1991 at all, and we probably won't have to worry about it in early 1992."
Donald Ratajczak, head of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, said he expected wholesale prices to increase only about 1 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Syndication Gain Is Seen For Networks

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In a setback for Hollywood studios and producers, the White House today signaled its support for proposals to end restrictions that prohibit television networks from syndicating the programs they broadcast.
In a letter responding to questions from a member of Congress, the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, clarified the Administration's position and strongly backed the idea that the 20-year-old rules should be repealed. 
 In a month, the Federal Communications Commission plans to decide whether to repeal the rules, and it could significantly change the political balance in what has been an intense lobbying battle between Hollywood and the networks. Although the issue has little or no direct impact on viewers, it will ultimately determine who will control the $3 billion market for television reruns.
 
 Limits on Network Power
 At issue are what are known as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, imposed in 1970, which prevent broadcast networks from owning rerun rights to the prime-time shows they acquire. The rules were imposed after an antitrust case that had been brought against the networks, and they were intended to prevent the networks from abusing their control over the prime-time audience.
Preserving the rules has been a priority of Hollywood studios, which argue that the networks could use their access to the prime-time viewers to exert a stranglehold over producers. In the early 1980's, the F.C.C. proposed repealing the rules, but the Reagan Administration blocked the effort.
The networks, along with a growing number of economists and government officials, contend, however, that the rules are out of date and no longer serve any public purpose.
The White House and leading members of Congress have tried to keep out of the recent debate, although the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission both submitted briefs to the F.C.C. urging repeal of the rules.
But that appeared to change earlier this week, when President Bush's top economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, issued the Economic Report of the President. The report included a paragraph immediately cited by those supporting repeal of the syndication restrictions. The report said that Government limits on ownership and syndication of programming "are generally an ineffective means of addressing any problems of market power" and added that the Government should stay out of decisions that determine which companies can provide services within an industry.
 
 A Heated Response
 Short as it was, the paragraph prompted a heated response from Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America. After a flurry of meetings, the White House press office issued a statement on Thursday saying that the matter was before the F.C.C. and that the White House had no comment.
But the White House stance was reversed again today, with the letter by Mr. Sununu. In the letter, to Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, who wanted to know where the Administration stood, Mr. Sununu wrote that President Bush "has made equally clear his opposition to picking winners and losers -- to regulatory or other policies that favor or protect particular competitors at the expense of competition." He added that he hoped the F.C.C. would decide the matter "with full recognition of the high costs to consumers" of government interference.
 
 A Strong Statement

Network officials declined to comment on the record, but they made it clear they viewed the letter as a strong statement in their favor.
Barbara Dixon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Valenti, said the Motion Picture Association of America would not comment.
Proponents of repeal have long hoped that the White House would take a stand because doing so would strengthen the hands of those at the F.C.C. who favor repeal. The five commissioners have not indicated their views, but their statements suggest they are divided. Two members, Alfred C. Sikes and James Quello, clearly favor significant relaxation. Two, Sherrie Marshall and Ervin Duggan, appear to want to preserve the rules in large measure. The fifth member, Andrew C. Barrett, has given no indication of his position.

HEADLINE: Subway Ridership Drops 4.3%; Fare Rise Could Come in Spring

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Subway and bus ridership dropped so sharply in the last 13 months that transit officials say they may be forced to seek a fare increase as early as this spring.
The officials, who released ridership figures yesterday, said they had expected some bad news mirroring the weakened economy. Ridership is considered an excellent barometer of economic conditions. 
 But they said the 4.3 percent ridership drop on both the subways and buses in 1990 proved far steeper than anticipated. It was the first decline since ridership began a steady climb in 1983, a particularly disturbing development because billions of dollars were spent to rebuild mass transit in the 1980's with the main purpose of attracting riders.
The ridership figures reverted to approximate 1985 levels -- an average weekday level of 3,329,000 on the subways and 1,283,000 on the buses.
The preliminary figures for January, the officials said, were almost as gloomy: a 3.9 percent drop in the subways and a similar loss in bus riders. The Transit Authority had anticipated only a 1.4 percent drop in subway riders for last month.
The decline in the city mirrors the situation on the region's commuter railroads. With fewer people working and shopping, fewer people are taking mass transit, officials said. And because the transit agencies have already made significant cutbacks, it will be even more difficult to decide what to cut next to make up for the unexpected loss of revenue, they said.
"We are in a much more serious situation than we expected to be in just two months ago," said David A. Winfield, executive vice president of the Transit Authority, which operates the subways and buses. "We are in a position where we are required to provide certain levels of service in existing schedules and commitments to service and reliability, and our ability to change these levels is limited."
Mortimer L. Downey, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said the Transit Authority could be left with a deficit of $130 million to $140 million in its $2.9 billion budget for 1991. Fare collection was $61.4 million below budget in 1990.
Contributing to the deficit is a drop in city subsidies, also a result of the weakened economy. The Transit Authority's share of taxes on certain real-estate transactions in the city dropped 27.6 percent, or $32.9 million, last year. The authority anticipated $90 million in revenues from the tax in 1991, but receipts to date are running 40 percent behind projections, or $35 million to $40 million for the year.
Mr. Downey said even a 10-cent fare rise to $1.25, which would raise about $10 million a month, would fail to close the deficit. "A year isn't, unfortunately, 14 months long," he said.
Any fare increase would need approval of the M.T.A. board, to which the Mayor and the Governor make appointments. Peter E. Stangl, who is expected to take over as M.T.A. chairman soon, has said an increase is likely.
The Transit Authority uses a formula that indicates subway ridership drops by 1 percent for every 10-cent fare increase. Bus ridership typically drops by twice as much, transit officials said, because bus trips are more discretionary.
Mr. Winfield said a 10-cent increase might not be enough.
"Now that the issue is more pressing, whereas a 10-cent increase might have been adequate under the assumptions made two months ago, under what we're looking at now, things are more severe," he said.
Joseph G. Rappaport, a spokesman for the Straphangers's Campaign, an advocacy group for subway riders, said the Transit Authority was shirking its responsibility by linking declining ridership to unemployment.
"It just ain't so," he said. "They're just not doing a good enough job to retain their riders."
Mr. Rappaport said more innovative programs, like monthly passes, and basic improvements, like better signs in stations, are needed.
"What the Transit Authority doesn't need is another increase in the fare coupled with Draconian service cuts," he said.
Transit officials said fare evasion, which grew sharply last year, played only a minor role in the lower ridership figures, officials said. Last year the percentage of fare evaders to paying riders rose steadily to a high of 7.4 in August. By December, the rate dropped to 5.5 percent.
Transit officials say there is a strong correlation between the job market and ridership figures. "In many ways, the transportation indicator is almost a leading indication of the economic data because we can get the figures more quickly than the Labor Department," said Eugene Spruck, an economist with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the PATH system between the two states.
For instance, employment in finance, insurance and real estate in New York City declined by 2.1 percent in 1990, for a total decline of 5.5 percent since the market crashed in 1987.
Reflecting that decrease, the number of passengers taking PATH trains to the World Trade Center station declined by 2.9 percent through last November, Mr. Spruck said.
In its latest figures, New Jersey Transit, which operates buses and trains, reported that passenger revenue from July to November of last year was 1.3 percent less than had been expected and that PATH ridership declined .6 percent system-wide from January through November.
A recent survey by the Long Island Rail Road indicated that many of its regular riders were among those hit by cuts in the real estate and financial services industries, said Susan McGowan, spokeswoman for the commuter rail line. The number of passenger trips on L.I.R.R. trains dropped 4 percent to 72.4 million in 1990 after a slight increase in 1989 that brought ridership to 75.4 million.
"Those people are losing their jobs and therefore not taking our train to work anymore," she said.
In the middle of last year, the L.I.R.R. made internal budget cuts of 3 percent, has imposed a wage and hiring freeze and in March will reduce some train service for a savings of $2 million.
Metro-North, the commuter railroad serving Connecticut and several New York counties north of the city, actually increased ridership by 1.1 percent last year, said Howard R. Permut, vice president for planning and development at Metro-North.
But in January ridership declined by 1.5 percent over January 1990. Mr. Permut said the railroad had projected a 1 percent increase in ridership for 1991 and that every 1 percent drop in riders translates into roughly $2.5 million lost revenues.
"With the economy being so bad, people aren't coming in to the city as much," he said. "They aren't coming in to go shopping or go to the theater or have dinner, and if they've lost their job, they aren't coming in to work."

HEADLINE: Wielding New Studies, Landlords Ask Albany to Undo Rent Laws

BYLINE: By IVER C. PETERSON

 BODY:
With rents slipping and vacancies on the rise, a loose coalition of landlords and university housing experts is preparing a challenge to New York's 43-year-old system of rent regulations, which is facing renewal this spring in Albany.
Studies and papers challenging the underlying justification for the law have been prepared over the last few years, arguing that the rules, which control everything from rent increases to the frequency of paint jobs, benefit well-to-do renters most, let housing deteriorate, and cost the city taxes. 
 Every three years, when the rent rules come up for renewal, landlords appear in Albany fighting to have them repealed. But this time, they are hoping that their academic backers and the current housing slump will give new force to their argument.
And even if they are not able to kill the system -- which they admit they are unlikely to do -- they hope that an unusual circumstance this year will give them a chance to weaken the rules.
"I don't think we have ever had a more opportune time to structure major changes in the rent regulation system," said John J. Gilbert 3d, head of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's biggest landlord group.
 
Survey Not Performed
 The unusual circumstance is that a crucial housing survey was not performed. For the rules to be renewed, the state must find, every three years, that the city is still in the grip of the housing availability crisis first declared in 1947 when the law was passed -- that is, that there is a rental vacancy rate below 5 percent.
But last year the Census Bureau was too busy with the national head count to do its three-year vacancy survey for the city, which is due on April 1. The most recent survey, covering a sampling of 19,000 apartments, was done in 1987. It found a vacancy rate of 2.46 percent.
Since then, real-estate brokers have been reporting what many pleasantly surprised newcomers to the city have found -- that renting an apartment is no longer a frenzied competition among would-be tenants in which owners offer "take it or leave it" terms. More vacant apartments has meant that many tenants now are able to choose among vacancies or bargain lower rents.
The city and the state, without proof of a continuing emergency, favor extending the law for only one year. Landlords hope they can use that interim to weaken it.
Defenders of the law maintain that, while it may not perfectly fit today's market, there is still no reason to attack its underlying purpose -- limiting rent increases and regulating relations between landlord and tenant.
 
Armed With Studies
 "There are imperfections in the system, and inequities," conceded Alexander B. Grannis, chairman of the State Assembly's housing committee. "But the flaws are not of a magnitude that mandates dismantling the whole system to get at them."
To strengthen their case, landlords have gone to Albany armed with studies. Among them are the following:
*A study by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that the rent rules may benefit rich New Yorkers more than poor ones. In poor neighborhoods, some landlords are already charging less than they are legally entitled to, while in Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods, rent regulations save affluent tenants hundreds of dollars a month over what they would pay for similar apartments at market rates, the study found.
*A study by the chairman of the Hunter College Planning and Urban Studies Department comparing New York rental housing with that of other cities found that the rent rules reduced incentives to maintain housing so much that New York buildings had, on average, more broken boilers, outmoded wiring, cracked walls and other problems than other cities' buildings did.
*A study by the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick concluded that the city would collect $370 million more a year in real estate taxes by dropping protections for tenants earning over $40,000 a year, since the taxable value of the buildings these renters live in would rise with higher rents.
 
Defenders Dismiss Studies
 The Harvard and Peat, Marwick studies were paid for by Mr. Gilbert's group, and defenders of the rent laws dismissed them.
"I would not expect the landlords to commission a report that didn't support their position," Assemblyman Grannis said. "It's like the cigarette company research that spent years telling us tobacco wasn't responsible for sickness."
Mr. Gilbert and other landlord representatives acknowledge that the chances that the system would be allowed to die are extremely slim.
Rent controls are an emotional issue with a huge constituency, and for many politicians, the issue is simply taboo. Nearly three million people -- about 40 percent of the city's population and a huge voting bloc -- live in the city's roughly one million rent-regulated apartments. Buildings with fewer than six rental units are exempt from the law, as are thousands of unsold co-op and condominium apartments that have been turned into rentals in the current market slump.
The Dinkins administration, with its political ties to neighborhood groups that most strongly defend rent protections, had asked for the law's renewal, without amendments, said Valerie Jo Bradley, assistant housing commissioner for public affairs.
 
Deregulations Sought
 Some members of the Republican-controlled Senate, which refused to grant the one-year extension last year, are thinking of voting to agree to it this year in return for changes in the vacancy-rate survey that would test whether rent controls help the rich.
Landlords' groups, aware that opposition is strong, are determined to use this bending of the rules to seek some changes.
They would like the most expensive apartments, once vacant, permanently deregulated. Alternately, they would like means tests used to reserve vacant lower-rent apartments for tenants with lower incomes.
They are not seeking, the landlords insist, that any of these changes be applied to apartments now occupied.
 
Rules Favor Long Tenancies
 There are about 840,000 rent-stabilized apartments in the city, whose maximum rent increases are set annually by the Rent Guidelines Board. Another 155,000 rent controlled apartments, whose tenants must have been in residence since 1971, have increases figured on a one-by-one basis using a system which takes operating costs into account. These units become rent-stabilized when they are vacated.
In the Harvard study of rent stabilized apartments, Henry O. Pollakowski, a researcher at the Joint Center for Housing Studies and editor of The Journal of Housing Economics, used figures from the 1987 vacancy survey to conclude that, outside Manhattan's richest neighborhoods, stabilized rents and market rents are about the same, so rent rules produce very little benefit.
His study shows that the difference in rents between similar regulated and market-rate apartments in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens amounted to less than $40 or $50 a month. But in the wealthiest parts of Manhattan, the Upper East and West Sides, he found that stabilized rents were consistently far lower than rents for similar apartments offered at market rates.
Rent regulations favor long tenancies, so that the longer a renter stays, the more slowly the rents will rise. Poor and working class people tend to move more often, while the middle class generally enjoys more stability in employment and stays put.
In the South Bronx, where Mr. Pollakowski found an average family income of $26,200, 59 percent of the apartments were stablized. Their rents were only $39 a month different from comparable market rate housing.
 
'Rather Large Subsidies'
 But on the Upper East Side -- Mr. Grannis's district -- the average income was over $40,000 and 83 percent of the apartments are stabilized. There, rent-stabilized tenants paid, on average, $337 a month less than they would have for comparable market-rate apartments, the study found.
"What I found is that there are these rather large subsidies in the affluent Manhattan locations and in the rest of the city rent stabilization is pretty much a wash," he said.
Meanwhile, Peter Salins, head of the Hunter College Urban Affairs Department, used Federal housing studies to show that New York rental units are in much worse shape than in other cities, even old ones. He blames rent regulations for discouraging owners from maintaining their properties.
"On every index of housing quality -- all of which are related to maintenance -- New York fares badly," he wrote in a recent article. "Twice as many apartments in New York have cracked walls, broken plaster, holes in the floor and exposed wiring than other American cities. A quarter of New York apartments have broken heating systems, compared with less than 10 percent in other American cities." He found that in Chicago, for example, housing was better maintained than in New York.

HEADLINE: Governor Urges New Water Cuts By Californians

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 15

 BODY:
In his first, rather cautious response to the drought gripping California, the state's new Governor today called on all communities to cut their water use by half, created a "water bank" to transfer water to the neediest areas and asked the Legislature to establish a $100 million drought fund.
But the Governor, Pete Wilson, stopped short of invoking emergency powers to take sterner measures, saying he preferred to allow the local authorities to act first. 
 "I will not kid you," Mr. Wilson, a Republican, said at a news conference at the Capitol. "A drought of this magnitude will change the way we live. It will cause inconvenience for certain. It will cause anxiety, and it will cause some very real pain and some very real economic hardship."
 
'Pray It Rains'
 His specific response to the politically charged issue was a measured political one. It was praised as judicious by the local water districts that had lobbied against the state's taking control of drought actions, but was criticized as timid by others.
"His plan is to hope everybody saves water, spend some money and pray it rains," said State Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg, a Democrat from Sacramento who is a legislative expert on water. "There is not much new here."
In Los Angeles, Bob Gomperz, spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the wholesaler that supplies half the water used by 15 million Californians, said the agency supported the Governor's "judicious" action in leaving it up to local bodies to respond to the drought. The water district, Mr. Gomperz said, was preparing for even steeper cutbacks than the 31 percent reduction that is to go into effect on March 1.
Mayor Karen Humphrey of Fresno, in the hard-hit agricultural Central Valley, called the Governor's package too little. "His response is not an emergency-type response," she said, "but we clearly have a crisis."
Among the proposals Mr. Wilson rejected was one from some water experts for a statewide limit of 300 gallons a day per household. Enforcement would have been extremely difficult since many urban areas, including Sacramento, lack water meters.
Instead of setting a specific limit, the Governor asked local water districts to restrict use, leaving it to them to impose their own standards on customers.
 
Water Meters Lacking
 The steps came against a backdrop of growing desperation over the drought, now in its fifth year, which is putting farmers out of business, threatening major industries and raising fears of devastating fires this summer.
The Governor acted at the end of another week of bad news for California's farms and cities. On Thursday, the state's largest supplier of water, the Federal Central Valley Project, announced it was cutting deliveries to farmers by 75 percent.
State officials reported today that water conditions were worse than at this date in 1977, the driest year in modern California history. Precipitation is about one-fourth of average, the snowpack is 15 percent to 20 percent of normal and the crucial spring runoff from the Sierra Nevada is expected to run at only 35 percent of normal.
Mr. Wilson, in office only about a month, acted on the recommendation of a "drought action team" he created two weeks ago. He said the "likely scenario" was that most localities would have to reduce water use by half.
The full extent of possible cutbacks will not be known until the rainy season ends in the first half of April; it remains possible that heavy rains and snows could still relieve some of the pressures.
But Mr. Wilson, a former Mayor of San Diego, made plain that he was prepared to act "if local agencies are not coping." Under the state's Emergency Services Act, the Governor can declare a state of emergency in case of flood, fire, riot or other disaster, giving him power to suspend state regulations and laws, commandeer private property and take other extraordinary steps.
"I will not hesitate to assume emergency powers if such powers become necessary to protect Californians from the worst effects of the drought," he said.
 
Voluntary Transfers Are Urged
 For the moment, he offered plans to encourage voluntary transfers of water from where it is abundant. The new water bank would buy water from "willing sellers," pool it in reservoirs, largely through the state's vast system of aqueducts and canals, and resell to areas most in need.
The most obvious source of such water is farmers, particularly rice farmers in Northern California, who enjoy historic legal rights to cheap water and whose supplies cannot be arbitarily reduced. The state is negotiating with the farmers to pay them more for their water than they would make on their crops.
The Metropolitan Water District, a powerful independent agency whose 51-member board is appointed by the 27 agencies that feed off it, had previously disclosed plans to set up a water bank of its own to buy water for Southern California. But the district said today that while it had the right to buy such water it would abandon its plan and would not compete with the Governor's state water bank. The district acknowledged that the Governor, under his emergency powers, could have blocked independent water buying.
Mr. Wilson also asked the Legislature, which is in special session to deal with an equally grave fiscal crisis, to create a $100 million drought fund. The money would be used to offer loans and expertise to localities to find and conserve water, to increase fire-fighting ability and protect wildlife against the severe effects of the drought.
The Governor directed the state Department of Fish and Game to do "everything human possible" to maintain fish and wildlife populations. This was expected to include drilling wells in wetland areas and transporting fish to deeper waters downstream.
The threat of fire is of special concern, particularly since many of the military forces and equipment normally used to fight fires, which are chronic in the arid West, have been deployed to Saudi Arabia.
 
Seizing an Opportunity
 Karen Garrison, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, called Mr. Wilson's plan an "opportunity to make a major overhaul of a system that got us here in the first place, a system that rewards waste and discourages conservation."
"The current crisis is the result of bad management in the past," she said, "and we're still relying on short-term decisions that basically drain our reservoirs to meet demand."
Steve Stroud, director of public works for Merced, a city of 56,000 in the Central Valley, said his city was one of many that would have problems instituting rationing.
"In areas where you rely on surface water, you have a clear sense of how much you have," Mr. Stroud said. "Cities that rely on ground water, like Merced, never really know the exact volume of water on hand."
Another problem, he said, is that roughly two-thirds of the Merced Water District customers are billed on a flat rate because they do not have water meters.

Map/Chart: "Drought Update"
Most of California is supplied by these water systems. Their status led to the drought plan announced by Gov. Pete Wilson.
State Water Project -- Cut water to farmers Feb. 4. Continues to supply reduced levels to to urban users. Expects to meet only 35 percent of urban and industrial requests this year.
Central Valley Project -- Cut back supplies to farmers 75 percent on Thursday. On Jan. 31, had on hand 51 percent of normal water supply.
Colorado River Project -- Expects normal deliveries this year; Federal court order may reduce deliveries by up to 25 percent in future years.

HEADLINE: White House Rebukes Israeli Envoy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In an unusually blunt statement, the White House criticized the Israeli Ambassador today for making public complaints about United States economic aid that it characterized as "outrageous and outside the bounds of acceptable behavior by the ambassador of any friendly country."
On Thursday, in an interview with Reuters, the Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, expressed disapproval of Washington's delay in granting $400 million in housing loan guarantees for resettling Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israel. He also complained that his country "has not received one cent in aid" from the allied coalition to compensate it for losses from Iraqi Scud missile attacks. 
 Mr. Shoval's comments and the Administration's reaction brought to the surface strains in the United States-Israeli relationship that had been submerged by the Persian Gulf crisis. By not retaliating against Iraq despite repeated attacks, Israel had won Administration praise for its restraint. The stationing of Patriot missile batteries in Israel manned by the United States personnel appeared to rebuild strong political and emotional ties between the two countries.
 
Maintaining Good Relations
 The Administration seemed to want to rebuke the Israeli Ambassador personally without fundamentally harming its relationship with a nation it considers critical to the war effort. The White House statement said President Bush had sent Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir a message expressing his unhappiness with Mr. Shoval's statements. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d protested to Mr. Shoval personally on Thursday.
Referring to the housing-loan guarantees, Mr. Shoval, who arrived in Washington late last fall, was quoted as saying, "We sometimes feel we are being given the runaround."
The Administration agreed in principle to the loan guarantees in October, but delays have arisen because of concern that the money may be used to settle Soviet Jews in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank despite Israeli insistence that this will not happen.
The White House statement today rebuking the Israeli envoy said: "Public statements made yesterday by Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval criticizing the United States are outrageous and outside the bounds of acceptable behavior by the ambassador of any friendly country. The Secretary of State made this clear to the Ambassador yesterday, and the President protested to Prime Minister Shamir by cable this morning. We deserve better from Israel's ambassador."
Mr. Shoval said he had no comment about the White House statement. "About the Reuters interview, I'm not going to say I wasn't quoted correctly," he said. "But I will say that if everything I said was seen, you would have seen that most of my comments were praising the state of Israeli-U.S. relations."

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Mother Is Charged With Abandoning a Newborn

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A newborn boy was found on a trash bin at a convenience store in Brooklyn yesterday, and his 28-year-old mother was arrested, authorities said.
The single, unemployed mother was identified by the police as Paula Winker of the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. Ms. Winker, of 1516 67th Street, was charged with abandonment and endangering the welfare of a child, said Officer Fred Weiner, a police spokesman.
The five-hour-old boy was discovered yesterday morning by a store employee, wrapped in several blankets. The store is a few blocks from Ms. Winker's home.
A spokesman for Maimonides Medical Center, Michael Heller, said the baby was in "fine condition" yesterday.

HEADLINE: Grammys: Not a One-Night Stand

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
This is Grammy Week in New York, and although the 33d annual Grammy Awards ceremony doesn't take place until Wednesday night at Radio City Music Hall, festivities ranging from a charity benefit at the Waldorf-Astoria to free concerts in the subway stations have been under way since last Tuesday.
On Monday, Grammy-inspired shows will be offered in nightclubs around town and on Wednesday, the invited audience at Radio City will celebrate at the New York Hilton before going off to nightclub parties. 
 Sinead O'Connor announced last week that she was boycotting the show because she thought it too commercial, but many of the top names in pop music are expected to be in town: Bonnie Raitt, Sting, Phil Collins, Harry Connick Jr., Gloria Estefan, Quincy Jones and M. C. Hammer to name just a few.
This will be only the fifth time that the Grammy show has been in New York, the last time in 1988; most of the shows have been in Los Angeles, the headquarters of the 8,000-member National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which gives the awards.
In these times of budget angst, the city is hoping the star-studded show and its trappings will be a boon. As Edwin M. Cooperman, who heads the city's Grammy host committee, put it in welcoming academy members the other day:
"Your talent enriches our lives every day. Your presence here this week invigorates city life. You're also going to pick up a few checks in restaurants, hotels, nightspots and stores -- and that'll mean a lot to the city's economy."
 
Wide Range of Estimates
 Just how much is hard to judge. Mayor David N. Dinkins, who proclaimed Feb. 12 to 20 Grammy Week, suggested it would bring in $30 million, the amount said to have been raised by the 1988 Grammy event. Ken Sunshine, his special executive assistant, called the guess conservative. And Mr. Cooperman, who is chairman and co-chief executive of American Express, estimated Grammy-related spending at $60 million, noting that this year's events go on for nine days, while those in 1988 lasted only three.
Hearing of the $60 million estimate, Michael Greene, the president of the academy, said, "It makes us wonder why exactly it is we're coming here and losing all this money when New York is making out like a bandit."
Mr. Greene said bringing the show to New York cost the academy and the production company an extra $1.2 million to $1.8 million, in part because of moving its staff from the West Coast and keeping it here for more than two weeks. He declined to give the total cost of the event or even to say how many members of the academy live on which coast.
Despite the costs, however, Mr. Greene didn't sound unhappy to be here. "New York City is a music center for performers and record companies," he said. He spoke of the vibrancy of New York's "jazz, classical and Latin music communities, not to mention rap, pop and rock," and said: "Bringing a show to New York is revitalizing. Los Angeles is a little bit more laid back than New York. There's a little different buzz, spirit."
 
6,000 Visitors
 Publicity people for the event report that some 6,000 visitors, mostly music-industry members of the recording academy, are staying at the New York Hilton Hotel, which plans to roll out a red carpet all the way to Radio City, three blocks down the Avenue of the Americas, for the post-Grammy party.
More than 1,000 performing artists were said to be staying in hotels around town, their bills paid by various recording companies. That does not include the performers in the show, a glittering array that will include Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Billy Idol, Tommy Tune, Tony Bennett, David Crosby, the Judds and some classical celebrities, like Placido Domingo and Kathleen Battle. Garry Shandling will be the host of the extravaganza, which will present 77 awards. The producer is Pierre Cossette.
Support for Grammy Week was enlisted by Mr. Cooperman and other business and civic leaders, who arranged perquisites for Grammy visitors -- free tickets to some Broadway shows, for example, discounts in restaurants and 20 cars and vans with drivers.
The benefit at the Waldorf-Astoria on Tuesday raised $600,000 for Musicares, a foundation created by the academy to provide drug and alcohol rehabilitation and other services to its members.
Later in the week several artists, including Melba Moore, took part in talks, workshops and performances at La Guardia High School in Manhattan, where opportunities in music and recording were discussed. And Wadleigh Junior High School in West Harlem was chosen for a program to help disadvantaged, inner-city students. Among other things, the school is receiving musical instruments donated by the Warner Music Group so students can start their own band.
 
Subway Concerts
 On Monday night, various clubs plan Grammy Week programs with support from record companies and other sponsors. For instance, an RCA Country Night is scheduled at the Lone Star Roadhouse, featuring Matraca Berg and Bernie Leddin, and a Rhythm-and-Blues Night with Gerald Albright, Bobby Lyle and Paul Jackson Jr. at the Village Gate is to be presented by Atlantic Records and Gilbey's gin for the benefit of the Harlem Boys Choir.
Free concerts have been scheduled at subway sites including Grand Central Terminal, Times Square and Penn Station and also in Bloomingdale's. Starting at 9 A.M. today, for instance, performers in the main concourse of Grand Central will be Caleb Arruda, guitarist, followed by Joel Dallow, cellist, then the Irish dancers Half Moon Sword and Freelance Folk, a vocal group.
The host committee's logo, an apple enclosing a G-clef, has been popping up in store windows, newspaper advertisements and even under ice; a 30-foot version along with a 30-foot Grammy logo (depicting a gramophone) were painted and iced over at the rink at Rockefeller Plaza. It was there that Mayor Dinkins proclaimed Grammy Week.
"The Grammy Awards will focus the attention of music lovers throughout the world on New York, as some of the brightest stars of the music industry converge on our city," he said. Then, noting the economic impact, he added, "Now, that's music to all our ears."

HEADLINE: Vacationers Sticking Closer to Home

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Travel agents and tour companies are forecasting sharp increases in vacation and leisure travel within the United States and to Canada this spring and summer as Americans cut back on bookings to Europe and other destinations they would normally reach by air. In many cases, they will substitute trips by car, bus, train and ship for airplane travel.
The shift became apparent after the start of the Persian Gulf war on Jan. 17. It follows the earlier twin shocks of a recession and higher oil prices that began to affect travel plans, as well as other consumer planning, late last year. Steven Alesio, a senior vice president of the American Express Company , said, "There is clearly a major shift from Europe to the Caribbean and the United States destinations of Hawaii, California and Alaska." 
 George C. Guenther, immediate past president of the National Tour Association, a group of packaged tour operators, and the president of Talmage Tours in Philadelphia, said: "We have never in recent years had such an expression of interest in U.S. and Canadian travel as we are seeing at this very early point in the year. I believe that trend will continue."
 
Honeymoon Plans Change
 For example, Peter Rusnak, a commercial real estate developer in Washington, is planning to go to Hawaii on his honeymoon in April instead of France and England as originally planned. "It's primarily because of the situation in the gulf," he said.
Within the continental 48 states, motor-coach tour operators expect significantly bigger advance bookings for March and April. Amtrak said reservations were much higher than they were last year. Mississippi River steamboat bookings are expected to be the best ever.
"The consensus for the spring and summer is pretty good," said Preston Robert Tisch, former chairman of the Government Affairs Council of the Travel Industry Association of America and the president of the Loews Corporation. "There is more competition and more choices."
The prime element behind the rush to domestic travel by land and sea, rather than air is the fear of terrorism or other violence stemming from the Persian Gulf war. "It's basically the war," Mr. Tisch said, adding that spring and summer bookings at the Loews Hotels in the United States are up 10 percent over 1990.
 
Many Are Afraid to Fly
 Many Americans are afraid to leave the country or even fly within it, experts in the travel industry say. A trans-Atlantic fare war broke out this week among some international airlines, stemming largely from the declining bookings for spring and summer European flights by Americans.
Adding to the uncertainty over foreign travel is the large number of State Department advisories telling Americans of danger. Currently, 73 countries including Cyprus, Romania, Colombia and Thailand, are on the list.
"People feel safer closer to home," said Lorraine Schechet, the president of Equinox Travel in Manhasset, L.I. "The cancellations that have come in are mostly European cancellations."
Cynthia Newman, the president of Waters Travel Service in Washington, said: "We're getting many calls about the national parks. A lot of people are waiting to see what happens."
Many of those planning to stay in the United States do not want to fly. Last week, most of the major domestic airlines held a half-fare promotion for tickets that are good for travel for as much as almost a year ahead.
Patrick Murphy, the vice president for operations of Mayflower Tours in Downers Grove, Ill., said: "We are looking at 1991 to be a good, strong North American travel year. We have over 2,100 confirmed passengers for April 1991, which is 51 percent over April last year."
Similar opinions are being voiced by representatives of some of the nation's major tourist destinations. "It looks good and we're pretty optimistic," said Mark Northington, research director of the Louisiana Office of Tourism.
Long-distance buses are not the only form of surface transportation luring domestic travelers. Advance train bookings for April and May are showing big increases.
"Calls to our reservation sales offices are substantially up over last year," a spokesman for Amtrak, Clifford Black, said. As people started making plans for spring and summer vacations, inquiries to the national passenger railroad rose last month to 3.1 million from 2.7 million in January 1990, an increase of 13.6 percent.
And the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, which runs the Delta Queen and Mississippi riverboats on the Mississippi River, has the highest advance reservations in its history, Patrick Fahey, the president, said. Its bookings in the last three weeks have jumped 30 percent over the 1990 level to $3.5 million.
"There's a security that people feel in sailing in their own waters," Mr. Fahey said. "We're hearing it over the phones."

HEADLINE: Gas Savers That Belie Their Name

 BODY:
When the price of gasoline increases, as it did in the weeks before the Persian Gulf war, motorists often look for ways to reduce their fuel consumption. Not surprisingly, companies that sell bogus gas-saving devices try to take advantage of that situation.
The Federal Trade Commission has recently warned consumers to be particularly skeptical about three advertising claims: 
 *That a device can improve fuel economy by 12 to 25 percent. The Environmental Protection Agency has tested more than 100 so-called gas-saving devices, the trade commission said, and found only a few that improve mileage and none that do so significantly. Some devices attach to a car's ignition system, others to the engine. Still others contain a liquid similar to antifreeze.
*That a device can result in savings of three to four miles per gallon. So many variables affect fuel consumption, the trade commission said, that the average driver has no way of accurately measuring the savings attributable to the device itself.
*That a gas-saving device is approved by the Federal Government. In fact, the commission said, no Government agency approves such devices for cars.
If a consumer is not satisfied with a product, the F.T.C. suggests asking the manufacturer for a refund. If the company's refuses, call a local or state consumer-protection agency or the Better Business Bureau.
The commission also accepts complaints, and although it does not handle individual cases, a pattern of possible violations could warrant further action. The commission's main office in Washington can be reached by calling (202) 326-2222. It also has 10 regional offices.

Creating Illiteracy in New York

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
Illiteracy already threatens to turn much of New York City's population into refugees, wandering jobless through the information age. Mayor David Dinkins's administration now plans to cut about $7.5 million from the New York Public Library and a few million each from the Queens and Brooklyn systems. That's small change in the world of high finance, but for the libraries it could mean death.
Services for children are already taking casualties. Next on the chopping block are the programs that taught reading to nearly 5,000 adult illiterates last year. All city programs must bear the burden of fiscal austerity; but the amounts needed for the library system are so small -- and the consequences of reductions so grim -- that philanthropy could make a decisive difference. 
 The New York Public Library, which covers Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx, is the best known. It gets private money, but chiefly for its research libraries; the branch libraries are about 1 percent privately funded. The Queens Borough Public Library and the Brooklyn Public Library receive similarly slight private support.
The libraries still suffer the effects of the 1970's fiscal crisis. With the new cuts, their staffs, already lean, would shrink further. New book purchases have been put off. Hours have been cut; many young people have no quiet place to study.
A visit to the branch in Flushing, Queens, demonstrates the value of what may soon be lost. This branch is the busiest building in the Queens system, which in turn is the busiest system in the nation. One in three visitors is a new American, thirsting to learn more about his adopted country. The neighborhood outside is a riotous collection of shop signs in other languages; inside, the pageant of new Americans stirs the soul.
Chinese, Korean and Spanish voices color the air as patrons wait to check out their precious cargo of books, some in their native tongues. Their children pore eagerly through open books, following the voice of an adult reader. Adults, poised prayerfully over workbooks, sit with instructors in the basement literacy center.
This library and others like it have become settlement houses. Workers who have hidden illiteracy for decades are losing their jobs to the recession and coming in to retool, to learn how to read a newspaper, how to get a driver's license, how to study for college entrance examinations. Neighborhood businessmen come for free seminars on how to run their operations, teenagers for information about AIDS.
Even in these difficult times, the city would do well to restore what money it can. Corporations and individuals could help support the small but vital branch libraries. Libraries are being cut back nationwide. But this city of immigrants bears a special responsibility. This is also a center of wealth, with the means to save this precious asset.

HEADLINE: If Iraq Really Wants Peace

 BODY:
Is Iraq's sudden offer to withdraw from Kuwait a desperate grab for peace, or is it, in President Bush's words, a "cruel hoax," a ploy to throw the impending ground war off schedule? In the end, it doesn't make any difference. If Saddam Hussein is finally serious about wanting to end the Persian Gulf war, he knows how to say so clearly -- starting tomorrow when the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, goes to Moscow.
The terms of Friday's Iraqi proposal are, if anything, worse than before. About the only new element in the proposal is the suggestion that Saddam Hussein is now willing to negotiate, on his terms; it offers not the slightest reason for the allies to budge. 
 The Soviets greeted Baghdad's offer with "satisfaction and hope," and President Mikhail Gorbachev urged Western leaders to delay the ground war until the new Moscow talks conclude. Most other allies were quick to dismiss Baghdad's offer.
Still, Iraq's words inevitably look different to different members of the allied coalition opposing Saddam Hussein. Mr. Bush is concerned that Iraqi diplomatic maneuvering not hold up achievement of his goals. Allies in the gulf and in Europe fear unsettling consequences of an intensifying war and expanding aims on their home fronts.
By saying for the first time that he's prepared to leave Kuwait, but linking that to a series of unacceptable conditions, Saddam Hussein could be trying to arouse false and divisive hope. By moving now, he could also be trying to capitalize on widespread sympathy over civilian casualties. And his offer comes just as the allies are intensifying air, artillery and battleship bombardment in preparation for ground assault. This would seem an opportune moment for him to seek a settlement.
Baghdad's offer does nothing to promote genuine negotiation. In return for an ambiguous promise to withdraw, Iraq wants not only an immediate cease-fire but also cessation of U.N. economic sanctions and withdrawal of U.S. and other forces. For the allies to accept that would be to acquiesce in Iraq remaining a threat to Mideast peace.
Iraq also tries to link its withdrawal to an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. That linkage is as unacceptable to Arabs in the coalition as it is to Israel. And Baghdad wants the establishment of an "authentic democracy" in Kuwait. What an added arrogance: Saddam Hussein, after sacking and savaging Kuwait, still wishes to dictate who takes over when he leaves.
In the end, these points may be intended as a list of Iraq's desires and not as conditions for withdrawal, in which case Iraq can raise them later. If Saddam Hussein wants peace, there are two things to do now: First, make clear that there are no conditions attached to his commitment to get out of Kuwait. Second, start getting out.

HEADLINE: Iraq's Ploy: End Game or Dead End?

BYLINE: By Winston Lord; Winston Lord has been Ambassador to China and director of the State Department's policy planning staff.

 BODY:
The announcement yesterday of Iraq's willingness to withdraw from Kuwait coupled with conditions yet to be sorted out is a classic case of good news, bad news.
The good news is that Saddam Hussein is clearly hurting. For the first, time, he has specifically cited a U.N. resolution and concretely agreed to vacate Kuwait. His earlier formulations were adamant that Kuwait was his 19th province and that he would never give it up. After months of aborting all efforts to implant even the principle of withdrawal, he is pregnant for the first time. He has also granted us the favor of relegating the thorny issue of civilian bombing casualties to the inside pages. 
 This reversal can only be explained by a calculation that his military machine and his national infrastructure are crumbling -- and, along with them, the morale of his troops and the stamina of his people. Thus, he has vividly confirmed the accuracy of this week's Pentagon estimates of the destruction of his military assets.
The bad news is that the Iraqi statement as it stands is a ploy, if not a hoax. It is designed not for peace but for venting the pressures on him and dividing the international coalition. He has piled on extra conditions for withdrawal. He has not formally renounced his annexation. He has avoided the other stipulations of U.N. resolutions.
He is working in concert with a Soviet Union that is fast sliding back to its cold war opportunism, and an Iran that provides parking space for his planes and considers Washington a mightier Satan than Baghdad. So far, the rest of the coalition seems to be holding fast. But pressures on our Moslem partners will mount. The Chinese will be unhelpful. The French will be mischievous.
The Bush Administration's immediate response has been right on target. It has moved swiftly and energetically to punch holes in the statement while continuing to pummel Iraqi forces. If, as is likely, the Hussein move is strictly another cynical maneuver, we have avoided the slippery slope of a premature cease-fire. No doubt Washington is busy firming up our friends and serving notice to the vexatious intermediaries (while correctly, if insincerely, "welcoming" their efforts).
This is also the best approach to determine if Saddam Hussein is looking for a way out. Now is the time for third parties to strip away all conditionality from the Iraqi withdrawal, obtain agreement on the remaining parts of the U.N. resolutions and consign other issues to a delinked aftermath. While this process unfolds, we can -- and should -- hold off any ground offensive while unflinchingly prosecuting our air attacks. And only if the diplomatic minuet succeeds should we consider a cease-fire for the sole purpose of returning Iraqi forces home.
The tough issue for the Administration is what to do if, in fact, these remote contingencies prove real. Do we settle for the implementation of the U.N. resolutions while leaving Mr. Hussein in power with much of his arsenal intact? The correct answer is a reluctant yes. "Reluctant" because the Middle East, and the world, would be much more secure without a heavily armed Saddam Hussein. "Yes" because we really have no other choice. Besides, the outcome would constitute a significant victory.
Neither the American people nor the international alliance would tolerate a rejection of our own and the U.N.'s stated aims. To topple Mr. Hussein and completely eradicate his military power would require a ground war with all its certain horrors and horrendous uncertainties. Such a campaign would be supportable if he maintained his manifestly obstinate stance.
But if he is prepared to meet the world community's objectives, the only possible advocates of continued fighting (in addition to the Israelis) would be the Kuwaitis, Saudis and British -- and even those governments would find it extremely difficult to stay the course. Americans would not be willing to purchase a larger victory, however desirable, at the cost of much heavier casualties and international opposition.
Furthermore, the result, while leaving significant residual dangers, would be a singular triumph. Since Jan. 16, the U. S. has been pursuing one official objective, implementation of the U.N. resolutions, and two unofficial ones, the destruction of Iraq's offensive capabilities and the removal of Mr. Hussein. We would have achieved the first goal with minimal casualties. Any follow-on actions, such as diplomacy on Arab-Israeli questions, would be consistent with our prewar policies and in the interests of lasting security.
As for our two unstated goals, we have not done badly. The beauty of the aerial campaign is that it simultaneously weakens Mr. Hussein and his strengths under the legitimate cover of evicting his forces from Kuwait. U.S. officials state that we have severely crippled his weapons of mass destruction and eliminated much of his conventional armaments.
In the war's wake, we should work with others to embargo arms shipments to Iraq and all Middle Eastern trade, including components, in missiles, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. And we should seek Israeli agreement to negotiate toward a nuclear-free zone in the region.
As for Mr. Hussein, it is not self-evident that he would survive a unilateral withdrawal. How popular or secure can a leader be who brings down upon his country international ostracism, embargoes, devastation of his nation and military defeat on top of giving up all gains from a previous bloody eight-year war? Will the ordinary Iraqi citizen, surveying the desolate landscape, or the average Iraqi general, surveying the wreckage of weapons, find solace in some vague hopes for Palestinian justice? And whatever the official rhetoric of interested nations, their leaders will know who won and who lost, and will draw the appropriate conclusions.
If nevertheless Mr. Hussein does weather yet another appalling miscalculation and defeat, he will surely be a much weaker threat than he was on Aug. 1. We can work with others to contain him and construct a more stable region. To be sure, as alliances shift and opportunism breaks out, our challenges will be daunting.
How do we promote lasting security in the gulf? What are the trade-offs between the reassurances and the resentments fueled by a continuing U.S. presence? How do we contend with the specters of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction? What is a fair distribution of financial burdens? How do we lessen the regional rage harbored by the deprived against the affluent? What constitutes genuine domestic stability for moderate Arab regimes? How do we tackle the virulent Arab-Israeli enmity that exacerbates the area's manifold tensions? What are the implications for American defense and economic policies?
We will confront such an agenda from a position of great prestige and power. The U.S. would have created and led an unprecedented international coalition and, with modest casualties, forced an aggressor to yield his spoils. Having thus won the war, we could feel confident about winning the peace.
A ton of dust has yet to settle from yesterday's Iraqi announcement. The odds remain that we are watching much ado about nothing, that we will not face the policy choice outlined here. But if we do, let us consider it good news, not some "nightmare scenario." Let us not allow the best to be the enemy of the good.

HEADLINE: Don't Use Export-Import Bank for Arms Sales

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a senior staff employee of the United States Export-Import Bank from 1964 until 1987, where my duties included liaison with other Federal agencies, I am deeply disturbed by reports that the Administration is considering requiring the bank to revert to financing exports of United States military equipment and services. My concern stems from the bank's experience in fiscal years 1966 through 1968, when it was made a major participant in the export of weapons, in part because of budget constraints caused by the Vietnam War, and in part because of the balance-of-payments problem then. 
 In fiscal year 1966, the bank authorized loans of $134 million to finance military sales to Australia, $110 million for such sales to Britain and $237.7 million for weapons sales to "miscellaneous countries," not otherwise specified. During the following 12 months the comparable figures were $159.7 million, $435 million and $353.1 million. The amounts for fiscal year 1968 were $50 million, $100 million and nil.
The drop to zero in fiscal year 1968 resulted from a series of articles in The New York Times derived from interviews with Department of Defense officials who were elated that they had been able to tap into the bank's resources to finance these exports, limiting their department's role to a repayment guarantee of the bank's loans.
The articles provoked extended Congressional hearings, where the technique was referred to as "backdoor financing" and an evasion of the appropriations process. The result of these hearings was legislation in March 1968 (Public Law 90-267), which imposed a limit on the amount of weapons sales to developing countries, followed that October by Public Law 90-269, which imposed an outright ban on Export-Import Bank financing of military equipment sales to developing countries.
Much has changed since 1968, including the development of a more serious Federal budget crisis. In the mid-1960's the bank's authorizations were equal to about 12 percent of United States exports; last year they were equal to less than 2 percent.
With United States exporters of commercial goods desperate for export credit support, the Administration should conserve its severely limited resources to support exports that contribute to development of markets abroad for United States goods and services. If exports of military equipment are deemed to be in the national interest, clearly the responsibility for such transactions should rest with the Department of Defense. After all, that agency is supposed to know about strategy and the legitimate needs for weapons of other countries.
Also, retaining the responsibility for such transactions in the Department of Defense will make the information on amounts, types of weapons and buyers available to Congress and the public through the authorization and appropriation process.
The Export-Import Bank should not now, when commercial goods exports are perhaps the only bright spot in our bleak economy, be used to assume the risks of financing nonproductive military exports, with the associated risks of subsequent political backlash. Debt relating to military procurement is the easiest kind not to pay, particularly when the buyer is asked to join the supplier country in military action, for example, Egypt and the United States, and earlier, Egypt and the Soviet Union.
Since leaving the bank I have been with a consulting organization that analyzes the export credit agencies of other countries -- counterparts to the Export-Import Bank. This has enabled me to see how many of these agencies have gotten into serious political and financial difficulties by supporting exports of military equipment. For example, the British export credit agency some years ago was heavily involved in supporting military sales to the Kwame Nkrumah Government in Ghana. When that Government changed, its successor sought to repudiate the arms-related debt, with resulting financial losses and claims payments.
Arms sales, by their nature, are highly political and noncommercial. Military equipment doesn't generate cash flow for debt service, a serious problem in most developing countries. The financing of such exports cannot be based on the commercial considerations that govern export credit agencies, including the Export-Import Bank.
The Export-Import Bank deserves to be supported in its commercial export finance functions; financing military exports is an inappropriate, unprofitable and unpromising role for it.

HEADLINE: Why Ban Alcohol Ads on the Cable Car?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
San Francisco's action to ban alcohol advertising on buses, cable cars and streetcars (Advertising column, Jan. 24) is a triumph of emotion over reason, since no connection has been established between alcohol advertising and consumption, let alone alcohol abuse. That has been the consistent finding of the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services and independent researchers. We believe the action is not a trend, contrary to your portrayal, since we know of very few local governments that have taken such action. 
 In our view, the action does show concerns about alcohol abuse, which we share, and which we are helping fight by spending tens of millions of dollars on research and on programs to encourage responsible drinking and prevent underage drinking.
Banning ads is not only misdirected but also raises concerns about free speech and ignores the benefits of advertising. Ads provide information, foster competition and allow the introduction of new brands. They also provide badly needed revenue. We believe the San Francisco Municipal Railway will be hard pressed in the current economic climate to make up the $760,000 in revenue it loses.
We think society would be better served through the hard work of education and strict law enforcement, which we support, to continue favorable trends of reductions in alcohol abuse.

HEADLINE: CUNY's High School Plan Looks Backward

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposal by the City University of New York to put pressure on city high school students to take a set of traditional academic courses specific to a particular multiple-choice Regents examination is backward looking (news article, Jan. 24). The proposal ignores the efforts of the most innovative and thoughtful high schools in the city to de-emphasize rote learning and promote independent inquiry and study. These schools have learned that Regents exams and standardized tests do not adequately measure an effective school or student learning. 
 The proposal renews emphasis on standardized tests and traditional curriculums that have been discredited by city, state and national educators looking for more effective ways to educate young people. Worse, it is another put-down of minority students. It reinforces the view that they are deficient and can't meet the university's standard. We can only ask CUNY officials and the Board of Education: Stop before you do this.
Ask yourself: why do so many African-American and Latino children not take the Regents? Even a cursory study will show that these children from their first day in kindergarten are informed that intellectual pursuits are not for them. Look at their schools, their teachers, their homes, and instead of asking how to keep them from higher education, ask how to make it possible for them to attend college and to graduate.
Don't be satisfied with the view that you must protect the institution and what may be outdated standards of scholarship and knowledge, by erecting more barriers against the victims of racism and economic injustice. Look at the schools where kids pass the Regents and ask if it's a coincidence that they are populated by mostly white, middle-class children. We must be more creative than this proposal suggests, or we will inherit a world even more divided by race and class.

Dollar Rises on Iraq's Offer And U.S. Economic Reports

BYLINE: By Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday after Iraq's conditional offer to withdraw from Kuwait and a Government report that raised concerns about inflation.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $364.40 an ounce, down $3.80 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $363.50, down $4.15. 
 Iraq's offer sought to link an Iraqi withdrawal with an Israeli pullout from Arab territories, a democracy to replace the rule of emirs in Kuwait and forgiveness of Iraqi debts.
Jack Adkins, analyst for Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago, said traders were buoyed by the peace proposal, even though it carried weighty political baggage for the United States.
"The sentiment is that maybe there would be a peace settlement soon," Mr. Adkins said.
 
 Effect of Economic Reports
 The dollar also rallied following release of Government reports showing wholesale prices edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in January, while the country's trade deficit fell to its lowest level in seven years in 1990.
Mr. Adkins said another report saying consumer prices rose 6.1 percent in 1990 -- the fastest pace since 1981 -- indicated the threat of inflation had not disappeared. He added that some traders believed this report might cause the Federal Reserve to postpone further easing of interest rates to bring the economy out of a recession. Lower interest rates push down the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities less valuable.
Stephen Flanagan, vice president of Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., said the low trade deficit figure released by the Commerce Department "reinforced a bullish sentiment that developed in the New York market" following active foreign trading.
In Tokyo, where trading had ended before the Iraqi report, the dollar fell to 129.66 yen, down 0.09 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher, at 130.40 yen. In New York, it settled at 130.50 yen, up from 129.67 yen on Thursday.
 
 Decline for the Pound
 In London, the British pound fell to $1.9680, from $1.9805 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9670 to buy 1, less than Thursday's $1.9795.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4777 German marks, up from 1.4665; 1.2692 Swiss francs, up from 1.2570; 1.1528 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1523; 5.0320 French francs, up from 4.9950, and 1,110.50 Italian lire, up from 1,103.25.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $365.25 an ounce, from $368 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $364.85, from $367.75 late Thursday. The gold market in Hong Kong was closed for the New Year holiday.
Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $3.84 an ounce, from $3.81 late Thursday. On the New York Commodity Exchange, silver was at $3.780, down from Thursday's $3.826.

THE NEXT CENTURY
By David Halberstam.
126 pp. New York:
William Morrow & Company.
$16.95. 
 Americans are living at a moment of serious introspection about our purpose as a nation. The cold war Communism against which many of us defined ourselves for 45 years is dead. Environmental crises lie on the horizon. Economic competition comes from nations increasingly confident in their abilities and strengths. A decade of profligate debt has endangered our future. The wall between successful and struggling Americans has grown higher. Conditions in many families, schools and cities deny millions of young people the chance to reach their full potential. This new set of circumstances creates doubt about government's ability to meet human needs adequately, and it challenges Americans to develop a positive vision for the nation based on today's reality.
In short, we need a new way of thinking about where the nation can go in the future. The earnest search for a new national ambition, though, is too easily diverted by bitter nostalgia for the postwar days when, as David Halberstam puts it in "The Next Century," "We were rich and confident in a world that was poor and pessimistic." In a world that we can no longer dominate by size or power, the fate of the United States is inextricably bound up with the destinies of the rich nations of Western Europe and the Pacific Rim and with the poor nations of Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and what is still, for the time being, called the Soviet Union.
Mr. Halberstam would appear to have spent his whole career in preparation for thinking about this emergent world. Reporting from Eastern Europe in the 1950's, covering the crisis of American aspirations in Vietnam in the 1960's and dissecting the Japanese confrontation with the American automobile industry in the 1980's, he has been on the scene at each stop along the road to the world we see before us. In "The Next Century," he weaves memories, ideas and insights from his life's work into a concise warning about the bad habits we have introduced into American life, and he offers fresh hope for our ability to overcome them.
Mr. Halberstam's is not the only book published recently to scour the past for hints about the future, but it is the shortest and the best. It refreshingly avoids the familiar litany of cold statistics -- trade and budget deficits, S.A.T. scores, foreign ownership -- that supposedly demonstrate America's declining competitiveness. Mr. Halberstam's book is instead about people, and he introduces us to individuals from his various journeys who remind us that the answers to our questions will come not only through conversation with one another but also through exchanges with those in other nations who face similar questions.
In Poland, for example, the journalist Andrzej Wroblewski describes to Mr. Halberstam the new world confronting his country: "The question is how well, how democratically, we will use that time in which we try to catch up. Do we use it to scapegoat others -- do we feel sorry for ourselves and blame our conditions on the Communists and the Jews -- or do we accept responsibility for it ourselves . . . and accept the fact that it will take a great deal of very hard work to catch up?"
In Japan, Mr. Halberstam finds, the successful pursuit of prosperity brings problems similar to the ones the cold war victory has posed for Americans. As a retired Japanese Government official explains: "For forty years we were single-minded in our purpose. We were the greyhound chasing the hare. Now the hare that we chased has disappeared. So who are we and what are we next after the hunt? . . . We put aside almost all our political and social issues because we were dealing with things that seemed much more pressing. Now that we have attained economic success we need these other values, and we lack them, and we are not sure how to find them."
Poland, Japan and the United States traveled very different paths from the end of World War II to the present moment, but those paths now converge. Poland shook off the last great military empire. Japan sublimated its misguided imperial dreams into economic ambition. As for the United States, Mr. Halberstam traces its evolution from the 1954 decision by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gen. Matthew Ridgway not to risk hundreds of thousands of troops by intervening in Vietnam at Dien Bien Phu. "This was a nation still in touch with its limits, a democracy, not yet an empire," Mr. Halberstam writes. But a decade later, he continues, as our involvement in Vietnam deepened and we failed to pay for it, we appeared to lose some of the "shared truths" on which a democracy functions. Now we face our successes and our limits all at once, and along with Poland, Japan and other nations we search for a positive purpose in the world, a way to make the most of our potential on our own terms, without defining ourselves in opposition to enemies at home or abroad.
Mr. Halberstam's is one of the few books to recognize that the challenge facing the United States is not finding a scapegoat for our economic blunders but making the most of our physical and mental capabilities, improving our productivity in an open, democratic structure. He pinpoints our failures in education, sees we are practicing "the politics of anxiety and uncertainty rather than the politics of confidence" and urges us to judge ourselves by our own norms of what "a harmonious and decent society" should be.
He seems to be saying that we have a choice. We can follow the path set in the 1980's and continue to fight over the diminishing supply of money and power, dividing ourselves, in the larger world, along national borders and, at home, along lines of class and race. Or, if we take Mr. Halberstam's insights to heart, we can recognize that there is no substitute for quality and no replacement for unity at home and cooperation abroad.

UNEQUAL EQUITIES
Power and Risk in Japan's Stock Market.
By Robert Zielinski and Nigel Holloway.
246 pp. New York:
Kodansha International. $21.95. 
 A popular school of thought holds that many distinctly Japanese corporate traits -- the rarity of takeovers, the payment of low stock dividends, the bonding of companies into keiretsu, industrial groupings linked together by cross-shareholdings -- are a product of cultural forces peculiar to Japan. The market is seen not as a forum where Adam Smith's invisible hand can work its sometimes rough magic, but something akin to a financial tea ceremony, a cultural institution that reflects the harmonious soul of "Japan Inc."
With careful research and a clear-eyed view of what motivates businessmen, Robert Zielinski and Nigel Holloway, in "Unequal Equities," go a long way toward shattering that myth. In the process, their refreshing look at the ways of corporate Japan demonstrates how the hard rules of finance, rather than the fuzzy virtues of company songs, lifetime employment (available to only a fraction of Japanese workers) or many other famous management techniques, have been key to its competitive prowess.
As Mr. Zielinski, an American stock analyst in Tokyo, and Mr. Holloway, an English business journalist, make clear, Japanese managers have long regarded finance -- obtaining capital in abundance and as cheaply as possible -- as critically important. The main difference between them and their American competitors is that they succeeded in shaping their stock market to satisfy their needs while imposing few demands, such as the payment of high dividends. Indeed Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway present a relatively simple thesis: Big corporations have rigged the Japanese stock market.
The book's most provocative pages describe how Japanese managers achieved this. The story, as Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway tell it, really begins with the American occupation of Japan after World War II. One of the key aims was to break up the zaibatsu, the family-controlled holding companies that dominated Japanese industry and had cooperated with the militarists. The occupation authorities dissolved the holding companies of groups like Mitsubishi and distributed their shares to the public.
As a consequence, when the Tokyo Stock Exchange reopened in 1949 individuals owned almost 70 percent of the shares. Companies were forced to pay high dividends, and they were vulnerable to takeover attempts.
Japanese corporations, according to Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway, responded shrewdly. They began a campaign to buy themselves up slowly, displacing the individual shareholders. The companies, moreover, knit themselves into networks by acquiring one another's shares. Today Japanese corporations own 70 percent of the shares listed on the exchange, and Japanese executives demand of one another not a quick buck but what managers most want: growth. (On Wall Street, by comparison, individuals or their proxies, mutual funds and pension funds, still own more than half of the publicly traded shares.)
The result? Japanese listed companies pay approximately half the level of dividends that their American competitors pay, retaining capital for new investments. Shareholders in Japan who want higher payouts simply do not have the power to demand them. And, as Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway point out, major Japanese companies are almost immune from unwanted takeovers because friendly shareholders in the form of other companies would never sell to an interloper.
In addition, it is much easier for Japanese companies to raise capital by selling new securities within these corporate circles. American companies slashed their equity by a half trillion dollars in the past decade as they resorted to leveraged buyouts and other such schemes to enrich shareholders. Japanese companies strengthened themselves by issuing new shares during this period, raising 70 trillion yen, or about $530 billion at current exchange rates.
A company like Sony, for instance, was able to capture CBS Records and Columbia Pictures, as well as develop its high-tech gadgets, because of its financial position. According to Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway, Sony pays one of the lowest dividends of any company in Japan. Nonetheless it has raised more capital over the past few years than all but one other Japanese company.
Alternatively, Mr. Zielinski and Mr. Holloway show what might happen to an American company like I.B.M. if it were Japanese and did not face shareholder demands for quick returns. The computer company could save $2.5 billion a year by paying a Japanese-sized dividend and could plow the cash into research and new equipment. Instead of using its capital to buy back its shares, as it does now to keep the price up, I.B.M. would be raising another $2 billion every year by selling new securities.
These illustrations can be repetitive, but they make this insightful book readable. Still, what "Unequal Equities" lacks are the voices of Japan's top executives. As any journalist in the country knows, getting them on record can be devilishly difficult. But it would have added to the book's authority had the authors got some Japanese managers to verify the book's conclusions, or at least discuss them.
Another shortcoming of "Unequal Equities" is that it was published before last year's stock crash in Japan had run its course. The system the authors describe depends on constantly rising share prices. So far, however, Japan Inc. does not seem to have missed a beat. In some ways this fact even strengthens the arguments in the book, suggesting that the stock market is a tool, not a reflection, of Japan's corporate health.
Ultimately, "Unequal Equities" will perform an important service if it enlarges the stunted debate over how industrial policy might revive American competitiveness. Too often this discussion starts and stops with the idea of the Federal Government selecting, and then aiding, particular industries. A better understanding of how corporate Japan takes advantage of its financial markets would inject a note of realism into this debate, while raising serious questions about how the United States economy is served by Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Last-Minute Bargains

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
IT used to be that people who usually took a winter vacation in the Caribbean made their reservations before Thanksgiving. But this year, when the Caribbean Hoteliers Association met in Bermuda two days before the Persian Gulf war began, they saw a clear impact of the recession in the United States. The hoteliers were quick to say that tourists were still coming, but that they were not putting cash on the line until just a couple of weeks before departure.
"The state of mind is 'I don't want to lock myself into anything,' " said James Camissa, a travel industry consultant in Miami. He said this reluctance existed before the gulf war and the recession, though both have intensified it. 
 Despite the hoteliers' protestations that travelers were arriving, even if booking late, many places are hurting for business. Richard A. Ellis, senior director of Caribbean marketing for Liberty Travel-GoGo Tours, pointed out that February and the first three weeks of March were "the sacred cows" of Caribbean travel -- "the equivalent of Christmas week to retailers" -- and that airlines and hotels did not normally discount their prices for these weeks. Not so this year.
Rick Mazza, president of the Travelsavers chain of 1,900 travel agencies, said he estimated that business was off 30 percent from last winter, which "wasn't that great" either. He said that normally difficult air space could be found, as were "prices that are real bargains."
 The discounts take many guises: Some provide free dinners with a hotel room; some say a day or two extra is thrown in. The prices of some air-hotel packages dropped the week after Christmas and now they sound like the price for either the room or the air trip, but not both. "We won't see prices like these again for four or five years," said Steven Heydt, a senior vice president of GoGo Tours.
Not all the islands are wide open; smaller islands that get a steady European trade, for instance, say things are normal or nearly so, and the Virgin Islands, having made big investments since Hurricane Hugo devastated St. Croix in 1989, are pretty well booked. A spokesman for Pan American, John Ruzich, reports few empty seats to the Virgin Islands in February and March.
American Express offices report that they are getting word of new discounts daily. If any advance-purchase requirements have remained, they are eliminated for packagers or travel agencies that are important to the airlines; if there is an empty seat or room, it is for sale.
The steepest discounts may be yet to come. Cruise lines, with their aggressive last-minute discounting, have succeeded in taking away business from island hotels, according to agents and industry analysts. Some hotels still say they are adhering to their high-season rates, hoping to get the best profit they can while the north is still cold. Travel industry experts say that after next month, discounts could get very deep indeed.
Here are some last-minute deals in the Caribbean and the Bahamas:
Aruba . GoGo has two types of programs for the Caribbean. One gives a 20 percent discount on the combined cost of room and air fare. At the newly opened Hyatt Regency on Aruba, for example, GoGo offers a price of about$1,062 a person for seven nights in a standard double room and round-trip air from New York on American Airlines with midweek flights. The full price would be $1,274 a person, the company says. The other programs, "fly free" packages, also include hotel and air but the traveler pays only the cost of the room at standard rates. At the same Hyatt Regency, that deal applies to rooms classified as deluxe, which are $315 a night, or $1,102.50 a person for seven nights. The lowest published midweek round-trip air fare, on American, is $434 a person, GoGo says, so on any program to Aruba, the saving is that much. Hyatt said its new hotel was 80 percent occupied in mid-February, and that there had been a rise in reservations at the start of the month, at the time special prices began to appear in the area. In the Northeast states, Liberty Travel sells GoGo packages; elsewhere they are widely available from travel agents.
Bahamas. The 31 hotels in the Nassau-Cable Beach-Paradise Island complex in the Bahamas reported a busy January. Bob Volk, executive vice president of the Bahamas tourist group, said a survey showed people wanted places they could get to quickly. However, he said that 10 to 20 percent of the rooms were available for February, particularly in midweek. Weekends are filling up by Thursday, he said.
The Merv Griffin Paradise Island hotels have so many deals going it is hard to sort them out. A package of three nights, with two in a room, including air fare from New York, is offered by three hotels: the Paradise Paradise Beach Resort, where the lowest per-person price is $379; the Ocean Club Golf and Tennis Resort, where the starting price is $559, and the Paradise Island Resort and Casino, where it is $429. Resorts International offers these packages, which are available through travel agents.
The Club Paradise, an all-inclusive program where the guests stay at the Resort and Casino, has a three-night package that includes round-trip air fare from New York. This starts at $859 a person with two in a room, and includes three meals, a $100 credit toward drinks, golf and tennis. Three nights at this time of year, without air fare, is listed at $799 a person in the winter edition of 1990-91 Hotel & Travel Index, a travel agent's reference book.
Until April 6, Liberty-GoGo is offering a "dine free" package of three days and four nights in the Britannia Tower section of the Paradise Island Resort and Casino. The guest gets dinner each of the three nights, selecting from the nine restaurants in the hotel. With air fare included, two in a room, this is $559 a person. Extra days are $95.
Barbados The Heywoods Resort on the west coast, is offering a package of three nights for $549 to $649 a person, depending on the location of the room, or seven nights for $774 to $999, including round-trip air fare from Kennedy International Airport. The hotel's regular room rate alone starts at $480 a person for three nights and $1,120 for seven.
At the Regency Cove Hotel, in Hastings on the south coast, a package that includes air fare from New York starts at $485 a person for three nights and $623 for seven nights. The 15 percent charge for tax and service is also included. The standard room rate, with the 15 percent, is $120 a person for three nights and $281 for seven.
 Guadeloupe and Martinique. These French islands are usually full at this time of year, and indeed this is the case with the Novotel, a place that is popular with Europeans. But other hotels reported on Jan. 31 that 10 percent to 30 percent of their rooms were available for the end of February. The islands' tourist authorities are offering special air fare-hotel packages using seats on Sunday charter flights from New York. Round-trip fare and seven nights in an economy hotel cost $819 a person with two in a room; a standard room is $959; a first-class room is $1,055 and a deluxe room $1,265. Comparisons are tricky, but one of the hotels offering the air-fare-room package at the $1,265 rate usually offers double rooms at $251 to $380 a night for two people with breakfast, which is also included in the package. Information: (212) 661-4546 or (800) 765-6065.
Jamaica. Sunburst Holidays offers a number of three- and seven-night packages to Jamaica, air fare included. On the lower end, at Doctors Cave Beach Hotel, three nights are $484 a person from New York and seven nights are $724. The regular room rate is or $270 a person for three nights and $630 for seven. At the high end is the Half Moon Golf, Tennis and Beach Club outside Montego Bay where the package is $736 a person for three nights and $1,322 for seven. The least expensive rooms are room $445 a person for three nights and $1,075 for seven. Sandals Ocho Rio, one of the island's popular all-inclusive resorts, is $1,434 a person for seven nights. The lowest regular seven-night rate there is $1,175, not including air fare. Sunburst Holidays, (800) 666-8346 .
Puerto Rico. This island, a traditional last-minute choice, provides examples of good package prices. A round trip on American Airlines from New York and other East Coast cities, and three nights at the El San Juan Hotel and Casino, which is on the beach, costs $599 a person with two in a room. The same deal, at La Concha, also on the beach in San Juan but less fancy, is $349 a person. For those who want to squeeze the full four days out of the three hotel nights, flights leave as early as 7:30 A.M. and the return can be close to midnight, on a two-and-a-half-hour flight from New York. Both are GoGo packages.
St. Barthelemy. About half of the hotels at small, expensive St. Barthelemy report having no space, but there is only 50 percent occupancy at other places: the Tropical, the Manypany, La Presqu'ile and Baie de Flamands. The Manypany was offering a "late impuse buyer" price for the rest of February that was 15 percent off the regular rates: $1,295 a person for seven nights in a deluxe ocean-view room with daily American breakfast and one dinner included, based on two in a room. In the first two weeks of March, this would be $1,120 a person. More information: (800) 847-4249.
St. Kitts-Nevis. Island Resort Tours in New York has three programs for St. Kitts that include air fare. One, for three nights at the Fairview Inn, on the west coast north of Basseterre, is $649 a person for three nights and $883 for seven nights, with a free eighth night if desired. The room portion represents a 25 percent discount off the regular rates, the company says, and includes an air fare that only travel companies offer. At the Frigate Bay Beach, a three-night package is $639 and seven nights $844, representing a 29 percent discount on the rooms, Island Resort Tours says. And at the Bird Rock Beach Resort, on a hillside near Frigate Bay, three nights is $659 and seven nights is $891, a 20 percent reduction off the regular room rate. These prices include a 7 percent hotel tax and 10 percent service charge. Island Resort Tours, (800) 527-5982, or (212) 545-8475.
St. Martin. In French St. Martin, a building boom has raised the number of hotel rooms to 3,000, and a spokesman said that meant there will be space for the second half of February. Hotel owners there said they were interested in filling those rooms and might offer concessions if people called to inquire. One hotel, L'Habitation, said it had a special offer available for the rest of February and March. The package, called a Winter Quick Escape, provides for room and breakfasts for three nights, one dinner, a car rental for two days and a $25-a-day allowance toward food and beverages in the hotel's restaurants. The price for this, with two people to a room, is $509 a person. The rate listed in Hotel & Travel Index for the type of room in this package for this season is $300 a night. This package is available from Mondotels in New York, (800) 847-4249. Both Pan Am and Continental said they expected to have seats to St. Martin.
U.S. Virgin Islands At St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, Stouffer's Grand Beach Resort has a seven-night package, including air fare, for $895 a person on the basis of two in a room. Mr. Heydt of Liberty Travel said that normally this GoGo package would cost $1,250 a person.
On St. John, the GoGo "fly free" package can be used at the Virgin Grand Hyatt in rooms of any category. The rooms run from $275 to $450 a night with two in a room, Mr. Heydt said, and the lowest air fare would be $488 a person.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
The Boys of Summer Play Ball Forever, for Collectors

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Baseball memorabilia became a major-league collectible in the 1980's when the prices paid for bats, balls, uniforms, locker keys, rings, pendants, press pins and the ubiquitous palm-sized cards soared. Now, fans of artifacts relating to the boys of summer -- especially Honus Wagner, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson -- expect even higher prices at the sale next month of one of the most important baseball collections ever formed.
Assembled over the last five years by James C. Copeland, a California sporting-goods retailer, the collection of 873 items or groups of items is to be auctioned on March 22 and 23 at Sotheby's in Manhattan; the sale is estimated to bring from $5 million to $7 million. 
 Dominated by baseball cards, Sotheby's auction -- its first sale in the United States devoted to sports memorabilia -- includes photographs, programs, game tickets, autographed baseballs and bats, and World Series press pins -- emblematic credentials, specially designed for games dating from 1911 to 1989. The catalogue evokes more than a century of games, mostly through photographs on baseball cards that depict players poised to swing, equipment in hand, looking into the sun.
"Seventy percent of the lots in the collection are baseball cards," says Dana Hawkes, who heads Sotheby's collectibles sales in New York. The cards, issued at first by tobacco companies and today mostly by Topps, the bubble-gum producer, were packaged with candy, cereal, soft drinks, sausages, milk, ice cream, cookies and Red Heart dog food.
 The boom began slowly in 1969 when the first conventions for baseball collectors were held in New York and California.
"This was a closet-collecting type of hobby," said William Mastro, a Chicago collector-dealer who is a consultant to Sotheby's on the Copeland sale. "Until the mid-1970's, most adult collectors did not talk about what they were doing -- baseball cards were what kids collected. The popularity of other baseball collectibles runs in cycles. At one time it was press pins. Then came World Series programs. Right now, there is a real fervor for jerseys -- baseball players' uniforms."
Alan Rosen, a dealer in Montvale, N.J., recalled recently how the field expanded dramatically in the late 1970's. "In 1975, there weren't 50 dealers in the country," Mr. Rosen said. "Today, there are 25,000 to 35,000."
Prices rose -- and then declined. "The 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card went from $3,000 in 1979 to $500 in 1981 when the recession hit," Mr. Mastro said. "Prices began to rise again in 1984, and now that card is worth over $10,000."
Mr. Copeland began to collect the way many people do. According to Mr. Mastro, "He walked into a baseball convention five years ago with his son Rick and saw all those cards he knew from his youth. Most people who collect today are not interested in the sport itself, because it focuses so much on money. The game was more personal back in the 1950's and earlier. Ball players were accessible. They walked over to the edge of the stands and signed autographs."
Collecting intensified again in the late 1980's, spurring some record prices at New York auctions. Babe Ruth's brass locker tag from Yankee Stadium, engraved with his name and the number 3, brought $7,150 at Phillips in 1987. Last December, Sotheby's sold a bat autographed by Lou Gehrig, possibly in 1935, for $27,500. At Christie's on Jan. 26, an 1866 Currier & Ives print, "The American National Game of Baseball," was sold for $44,000.
The costliest items are multicolor portraits of Honus Wagner, the legendary Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop. Issued by tobacco producers in 1909 and 1910, the cards are scarce because Wagner opposed smoking and objected to his name being linked to cigarettes, which were advertised on the back of the cards. Only 40 of these cards remain.
Mr. Mastro said he has handled a dozen Honus Wagner cards. The finest examples, which are in near-mint condition and have crisp corners and no discoloration, had been packaged with Piedmont cigarettes; only two are known to exist. Mr. Mastro said he bought the card for $25,000 in 1986 and sold it a year later to Mr. Copeland for $110,000. Sotheby's estimates that it will bring as much as $150,000.
A less rare version of the Wagner card, advertising Sweet Caporal cigarettes, was sold to Mr. Mastro in a 1989 auction for $115,000, the highest price paid to date for any baseball item. The sale was organized by Lelands, a Manhattan auction house specializing in sports memorabilia.
The most valuable item in Mr. Copeland's collection is the group of 160 World Series press pins. It is expected to bring $250,000 to $300,000.
For millions of collectors, nostalgia continues to fuel the pursuit of baseball memorabilia. One lifelong fan, trying to explain this fascination, asks: "Why baseball? Why not marbles? Why not tennis? Why not football? It's the only game I know of where the object is to get home -- safely."

HEADLINE: SECESSION OF THE SUCCESSFUL

 BODY:
I believe America's class problems are real; however, Reich's article describes the symptoms, not the problems. The separation of classes is a result of the inability of current systems to cope with the complexities of the 1990's. Take education. Why are public schools so poorly managed and structured?
Or safety, another big issue. Why is crime, which often establishes the boundaries separating the elite from the rest of the world, so rampant? Could it be a function of a justice system that paroles criminals too early, or that our country has no substantial gun-control laws? What about the decline of productivity, which steals real wage growth from the middle class?
These are the problems we face. Their causes have little to do with the proliferation of health clubs and home fax machines. We must solve the structural flaws in our system. In doing so, we will give the bottom four-fifths of our society hope for pulling themselves up toward the top.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: 712 Fifth Avenue;
High Hopes, and Vacancy, for a 4-Building Complex

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
"BATTERED" is a word used by architects to mean sloping walls. The 712 Fifth Avenue project, at 56th Street, has been battered in more ways than one.
No. 712 was begun in the heat of the mid-80's and has opened in a market that is becalmed. There have been two major designs: a sloping version and the current straight-sided tower. There have been three development teams: David S. and Jean W. Solomon, G. Ware Travelstead and the Taubman Company. There have been at least four plans: apartment house, hotel, combination apartment-hotel and, finally, office building. 
 Now the 53-story skyscraper is again in the public eye as the new Henri Bendel store is readied for its opening there in a few weeks. Bendel will occupy much of the tower's base, as well as two restored landmarks and a companion structure on Fifth Avenue. The interiors of all four buildings are woven together behind their different facades.
Most of the rest of the 545,000-square-foot building is empty. Six office tenants, including the Taubman Company's New York operation, have taken space on seven floors. Leases are pending on four other floors. Some 386,000 square feet are vacant.
The developer has high hopes, however.
"We fully believe that this is a unique, superb building in a location that is arguably second to none," said Christopher Tennyson, vice president for corporate affairs at the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which took over the project last year from Solomon Equities of Manhattan.
"We recognize the difficulties of the market at this time," Mr. Tennyson said, "but we are very confident that this landmark building will have a distinguished future."
An "intense level of security" is one of the features, said Jeffrey A. Lichtenberg, executive vice president of Peter R. Friedman Ltd. of Manhattan, the leasing agent. Asking rents range from $50 to $65 a square foot.
Taubman's optimism is shared by the Solomons, who were involved with the project from its outset in 1983.
"Through this period of re-evaluation by many tenants," Mr. Solomon said, "the smaller ones or the ones who want to have a particular presence are looking for a high-quality location and consolidation, rather than big floors in lesser locations." At No. 712, most floors are 9,800 square feet.
Mrs. Solomon said the "ideal tenants" had always been seen as "companies looking for a Fifth Avenue presence: financial companies, investment banks, New York headquarters for international companies." The roster already includes Christian Dior and Grand Metropolitan, the British conglomerate.
Just what role the Solomons now play seems to be a matter of interpretation. They maintain that they own part of the project. The Taubman Company emphasizes that it has "responsibility for the ownership," which does not directly contradict the Solomons' assertion. Both sides say that Taubman is running the development.
In a Sept. 27 memorandum, Robert C. Larson, vice chairman of the Taubman Company, said, "David and Jean Solomon have withdrawn as partners in 712 Fifth Avenue" and "neither the Solomons nor their associates will have any ongoing involvement."
Asked to elaborate last week, Mr. Tennyson furnished a statement signed by Mr. Solomon on Sept. 19 saying Taubman "now has full authority for the ownership, management and operation."
And Mr. Lichtenberg, the leasing agent, said, "The Solomons have zero to do with it."
In an interview Feb. 1, Mr. Solomon said: "In a reworking of all of our deals -- but, in specific, this one -- we have sold an interest back to the Taubmans and still have an ownership interest in the venture. The relationship is very clear. They will become the operating partner of the project. We're very proud of what we accomplished. We still have a significant economic stake in the venture."
Controversy is nothing new at 712 Fifth Avenue. Two elegant, five-story buildings on the site -- the former Rizzoli Building at No. 712 and the former Coty Building at No. 714 -- had attracted preservationists' attention but were not landmarks. The original plan was to replace them with a new structure of similar scale to serve as the tower's base.
"The battered wall came out of that," said A. Eugene Kohn, of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the Manhattan architectural firm that designed the skyscraper. "The tower sloped back as part of a gesture to Fifth Avenue."
But a year after the Solomons and Mr. Travelstead had begun the complicated and costly process of assembling the site, trouble emerged in the most unlikely form.
In December 1984, Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian, announced his finding that the windows at No. 714 had been designed by Rene Lalique, a French master of glass design, for the Coty perfumery that long ago occupied the building.
Within two months, both the Coty and Rizzoli buildings had been given landmark status, leaving the developers feeling ambushed. Not only were they prohibited from demolishing the two five-story buildings, they also were obliged to get approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for their tower, on the ground of its appropriateness in relation to the landmarks.
In May 1985, the commission approved the battered-wall design, which also preserved the front 50 feet of both landmarks, meaning that the tower was squeezed farther back off Fifth Avenue than originally planned.
"ONCE you had a deep base, the sloped tower didn't make sense," Mr. Kohn said. "It would have made the upper floors so small that they wouldn't have worked. Plus, with an office building, the idea of maintaining the same floor size all the way made sense."
The Solomons returned to the landmarks commission in 1987 with revised plans, showing a straight, slender shaft.
Then the office market dropped dizzyingly, leaving the Solomons with not just 712 Fifth Avenue to worry about, but also 1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Avenue.
Last year, when Solomon Equities announced the deal with Taubman, its chief financial officer, Warren A. Schad, said: "This transaction allows us to free up our financial resources in order to devote them to our projects on the West Side of Manhattan."
The Solomons' interest in both projects is "close to 100 percent," Mr. Solomon said. "Some institutional partners," about whom he would not be more specific, have a stake between 5 and 10 percent, he said.
The 36-story Seventh Avenue tower, at 49th Street, has 570,000 square feet. At the moment, the only tenant is the law firm of Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Wehyer, with 150,000 square feet. "We have three leases out for about 140,000 square feet," Mr. Solomon said. He identified the prospective tenants as a textile, computer and entertainment company.
No. 1585, a 42-story tower between 47th and 48th Streets, has 1.3 million square feet of space. For now, the sole tenant is the law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn, which has 426,000 square feet, with an option for an additional 180,000.
"We have another major law firm, with a lease out for final review, for 120,000 square feet," Mr. Solomon said. "With the next deal, we'll be over 50 percent leased, which we like to believe is pretty positive in this market."
He said a 450,000-square-foot lease with an insurance company was "in the formative stages" and that almost all of the retail space on Broadway was in negotiation. Tenants would include a restaurant, a book store and a "high-quality" record store.
"These are very difficult times," he said, "but the quality of what we've got is sending people to look, talk and negotiate."

Concorde Cuts

 BODY:
Concorde service is being cut because of the war in the Persian Gulf and the economic recession. British Airways has reduced the number of flights by the supersonic airliner between New York and London and Washington and London. In addition, Air France has postponed a plan for additional flights on the Concorde on its New York-Paris route. The British Concorde's daily runs between New York and London were reduced Feb. 7 to one from two and the three weekly Washington flights were suspended. Air France had intended to add a second Concorde flight between New York and Paris four days a week from March to June and from September to December. The airline now hopes to add these flights in September. Air France does not fly the Concorde to Washington.

Inflation In Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By RUTH E. GRUBER

DATELINE: BELGRADE

 BODY:
Despite a big currency devaluation two months ago, prices in Yugoslavia remain considerably higher than they have been in past years.
Indeed, prices of food, clothing and other goods have gone up so much that residents of the Slovenia republic, which borders Italy and Austria, routinely go across the border to shop. 
 While Yugoslavia has been suffering from runaway inflation for several years, it was not apparent to visitors because the currency, the dinar, was constantly being devalued.
Tough economic reform measures instituted a year ago, pegging the dinar to the German mark, have pushed prices up to American and Western European levels. The government tried to counter the inflation two months ago by devaluing the dinar by 28 percent.
While inflation has been slowed, most prices still seem to have at least doubled or tripled, particularly prices paid by tourists. The handknit sweater that cost $50 to $80 a couple of years ago is now more than $200. A simple lunch can easily cost over $10 -- and it costs nearly $5 a minute to direct dial the United States. (Yugoslavia is one of the few countries in Europe that are not plugged into the A.T.&T. or other direct-dial United States phone systems.)
Even more confusing for visitors is the fact that, along with stabilizing the exchange rate, last year's economic reforms also revalued the dinar, slashing four zeroes from the former rate to create new dinars, making 10,000 old dinars worth 1 new dinar.
Today one dollar equals about 13 new dinars, or 130,000 old dinars. And bills in both denominations are still in circulation.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Find Loans With Lettuce

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
MILDRED LAWRENCE had just pushed her shopping cart past the bananas when Jim Beaulieu approached her. "Did you know that we have a bank here?" he asked. "It's open seven days a week."
Mr. Beaulieu is assistant manager at the new branch of Burritt Bank in the Finast supermarket at the Tri-City Plaza in Vernon. The 420-square-foot branch is open daily from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M., and its staff members go out into the supermarket aisles to suggest to shoppers that while they are picking up potatoes, they might also open a checking account. 
 Mrs. Lawrence, who lives in South Windsor, told Mr. Beaulieu, "I might stop for a C.D."
 
Plans for More Branches
 Other banks in Connecticut have provided some services in stores, said David Tedeschi, communications officer for the State Department of Banking, "but Burritt is going about it a little differently" by hiring an outside company to guide it and by offering a wide range of services. .
Burritt, based in New Britain, established the Vernon branch by working with International Banking Technologies, a company from Georgia that has set up such small but aggressive operations in supermarkets around the country. The Vernon branch is the first project in New England for International Banking Technologies, but Burritt already plans to open three other such branches in Connecticut.
Burritt officials said that bank branches in supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular, because they are economical for banks and convenient for customers. But they said such branches must offer more than the limited services, like check cashing, that banks began offering in supermarkets in the 1970's, and they must be promoted, operated and staffed differently from traditional branches.
"When we started," in 1983, "there were fewer than 100 supermarket banks in the country," said John W. Garnett, executive vice president of International Banking Technologies. "Today there are more than 850."
Mr. Garnett said his company set out to "build a better mousetrap," and has now established about 350 bank branches in supermarkets. The concern works with banks and retailers, designs banks to fit the stores and helps banks with marketing, promotion and staff training.
People are used to seeing a bank building, Mr. Garnett said. "When they see such a small facility, you have to talk to them about it. Supermarket bank staffs are small and versatile. Each employee does all the functions. They spend time in the aisles soliciting new business.
"In traditional banks, 95 percent of the people who walk in are customers. In a supermarket, the large majority of people bank somewhere else."
 
A Loan on Sunday?
 A supermarket branch is "a sales platform" for a bank, he said.
Ross C. Fritschler, Burritt's vice president for sales and marketing, said: "If I were opening a free-standing bank in Vernon, I'd market it to the people of Vernon through direct mail, newspapers and radio. But I'm marketing this branch to the customers that Finast already has."
With the aid of International Banking Technologies, Burritt trained its Vernon staff to talk with shoppers, Mr. Fritschler said. "People ask questions like, 'Can I really get a loan on a Sunday?' The answer is, 'Yes, you can,' "
Shoppers are visiting the branch, which is tucked between Finast's pharmacy and customer-service desk.
"People wheel their carts right in," said the branch manager, Linda Michaud. "Last night, we had a cart jam."
Mr. Beaulieu said: "The first week, we opened 29 accounts. And by the second week, I'd say our business doubled."
A few shoppers have arrived confused. One came to complain about the fat content of some meat and another to collect a lottery prize.
"We walked them over to customer service," said Ms. Michaud.
 
'A Great Idea'
 Several people in the aisles said the bank branch will be helpful.
"I shop here a lot," said Mrs. Lawrence. "It's a great idea."
And the store's manager, William Haberern, said he was going to buy a certificate of deposit. "It's very hard for a person like myself to get to a bank," he said.
But Delta Dubuc of Vernon said she did not think she would start banking at the supermarket. "I think a lot of people will go for it," she said. "But my bank is right down the street, and I've gone there for years."
Nor did Arthur Supernor of Tolland expect to bank among the canned goods. "I run a business," he said. "I do a lot of banking, and I wouldn't come down here and fight the parking lot."
Mr. Garnett said International Banking Technologies' research shows that 46 percent of the customers approached by bank personnel in a chain of Virginia supermarkets did sign up for a banking service.
Burritt, which has 12 offices in Connecticut, is scheduled to open a branch in March in the Edwards supermarket in Southington. The bank also plans to put branches in Finast stores that are expected to open next year in West Hartford and Bloomfield. Both Edwards and Finast stores are part of First National Supermarkets, which is based in Windsor Locks and has 64 food stores in New England and New York.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Bryn Mawr;
Study of City Problems Has Become Hot Major

DATELINE: BRYN MAWR, Pa.

 BODY:
The Thomas Auditorium is filled on Tuesday and Thursday mornings when the introductory-level course meets for Bryn Mawr College's Growth and Structure of Cities major. Any of the 95 students who arrive late for the class, called "The Form of the City," miss their chance for one of the 90 seats available and must sit in the aisles or on the floor in front.
"This subject is seeing a very strong surge in popularity," said James Wright, the acting head of the cities department. "The number of majors has doubled in the last four years." 
 "The Form of the City" is the second-largest introductory course taught at Bryn Mawr. The introductory biology course has the largest enrollment.
"Most urban programs have experienced rapid increases in recent years," Professor Wright added. "Their directors all ascribe these increases to new concerns among the students that lead them into commitments to careers in social service."
Students and faculty members alike speculate on the reason for the 20-year-old department's recent vogue.
 
 'Cities Have Not Been Repaired'
 "Urban problems really must be solved," said Sophie Lillie, a junior cities major from Austria. Michael Lewis, the lecturer for the introductory course, agrees. "Despite the dearth of jobs and urban renewal, cities have not been repaired," Mr. Lewis said. "In fact, they are worse off than ever if the last census can be believed."
Natasha Seaman, a senior cities major from Elkins, W.Va., who plans to enter the field of social work after graduation, nodded in assent. "It satisfies my social consciousness, and fulfills my desire to understand the more symbolic nature of the physical environment of cities," Ms. Seaman said.
The program is interdisciplinary, but does have a second required course -- "Survey of Western Architecture." Majors must then choose two of four urban-studies courses and must specialize in two of three tracks -- urban history, architecture and planning or social science analyses of the city. Electives come from the departments of anthropology, art history, economics, geology, history, political science and sociology.
"I think it's fine to have a lot of traditional majors, as Bryn Mawr does, but it's vital to have an interdisciplinary option too," said Elizabeth Scott, a senior geology major from Durham, N.C., who has taken many cities courses. "Life is interdisplinary. The more I learn about geology, the more specialized it is. But the more I learn about cities, the more the world opens up."
 
'Important to Be Marketable'
 Ingrid Johnson, a cities minor from Livingston, N.J., noted, too, that "with the tightening job market, it's important to be marketable in many different areas, and being a cities major or minor certainly achieves that aim."
She added, "I want to go into politics, and cities will help me so much in understanding the infrastructure."
"Our majors go all over," Professor Wright said. "Law, historic-preservation, architecture, landscape architecture, business, teaching, architectural history, urban planning and regional science, to name some of the more popular fields. And they come from all over too -- we have more Haverford majors than any other department." Bryn Mawr has an academic exchange program with nearby Haverford College.
The program has also become the focus for students who wish to go on to architecture school, especially because Bryn Mawr's classes in architectural drafting are run under its auspices. "Students now see architecture as the most socially conscious among the professions," Professor Wright said.
But the most compelling reason for the department's success seems to be its vitality.
"Philadelphia is our laboratory," Mr. Lewis said. "The first week, to shake up our students, we send them in and have them walk 30 blocks of the city. Then we send them in to look at open spaces, like the Italian market. This major is all about life."

HEADLINE: 2 Grants for Disadvantaged Students

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
TWO Westchester school districts are the first beneficiaries of a $10 million fund from the estate of DeWitt Wallace, the founder of the Reader's Digest in Chappaqua who died 10 years ago.
Over the next three years, more than $600,000 will be available from the new DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Westchester Fund of the Westchester Community Foundation. The money will benefit disadvantaged students in the Peekskill and Mount Vernon school districts. 
 The grants follow an extensive study of county school districts by the White Plains-based Westchester Community Foundation, an affiliate of the New York Community Trust in Manhattan that serves the Westchester community and its donors.
Initial grants from the fund, the largest of its kind in Westchester, will let a Mount Vernon elementary school extend its black cultural heritage program and will permit fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade students in Peekskill to participate in a wide-ranging cooperative program between a school and the community.
 
Roots and Pride
 In Mount Vernon, children drawn from all six grades at the predominantly black Cecil H. Parker Elementary School participate in a special curriculum that teaches them about their black ancesters and seeks to raise their cultural awareness and pride.
The program, now in its sixth year, has helped students improve their academic performance and their self-image, said the school's principal, Mary D. Spells.
"We had to be a very strong people to survive the institution of slavery," Janette L. Wilson, a first-grade teacher participating in the program, said she has told her classes. "Our people had to have faith and belief in themselves. Today, we need to dig back to those strengths."
As part of that process, students are taught history and learn stories, many of which, Mrs. Wilson said, derive from an oral tradition. "I tell them of the "griot," the official storyteller of the tribe," Mrs. Wilson said. "I tell them, 'Yes, perhaps Africans didn't write books, but they carried on a rich oral tradition.' The fact is there were universities in Timbuktu and an empire in Mali, and even little children can understand that."
 
Principles to Abide By
 Mount Vernon students in the program abide by seven Swahili principles, or nguzosaba, which promote umoja or unity; kujichagulia, or self-determination; ujima, or collective work and responsibility; ujamma, or cooperative economics; nia, or purpose; kuumba, or creativity, and imani, or faith.
Among other benefits, children in the program have begun to "see their future in a sound way," Mrs. Wilson said, and learn to share "without the natural competitiveness you expect.
With the help of the Wallace grant, which provides $125,000 for each of three years, the program, now focussed on 150 students considered to be "at risk," is being expanded to reach more of the school's 623 students.
 
Adopting a Peekskill Class
 In Peekskill, a districtwide program to enhance school and community relations has a variety of components, from an "Adopt-a-Class" plan for local businesses, to an "Adopt-a-Spot" unit in which students elect to adopt a street, a building or an area of the city to care for.
"The community wanted to be more involved in the schools, and the schools wanted to be more involved in the community," said Peekskill's Superintendent of Schools, Salvatore J. Corda. "It's a collaborative effort, and it's neat." The Wallace fund has provided $78,000 to the school district for each of three years.
One group of fifth graders is conducting research on a historic cannon in the city and running the city's maintenance program for it, including planting flowers.
"History often takes place in a vacuum," Mr. Corda said. "Here, kids are learning about a local cannon that two men, one black, one white, lugged across the hills to the Hudson." The cannon, Mr. Corda said, "prevented a British warship from picking up Major Andre -- so West Point was saved, Andre was captured and Benedict Arnold was picked up."
 
How a Business Works
 In another project, the Paramount Theater in Peekskill has adopted one sixth-grade class, involving the students in producing shows. Students act as ushers, count receipts and assist actors and staff members.
"They are seeing how a business really works," Mr. Corda said. "To tell kids to stay in school so they can get a better job is remote. This way, we are showing them that to run a business, you must know how to count money, and you must watch your receipts."
The DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Westchester Fund identified the two districts with the help of the Westchester Community Foundation, which studied the needs of school districts in the county. Once a group of districts had been selected, each was asked to submit a proposal and two were selected.
 
Grants to Teachers Set
 The fund will also award $500 grants to individual teachers in the two districts to underwrite classroom or schoolwide projects of their own design.
An award of $25,000 has been granted to the Westchester Education Coaltion to enhance collaboration between cooperating public schools and local college faculty members, with a particular emphasis on providing better learning experiences for student teachers.
The designation of a special fund for Westchester, said Christine DeVita, president of the Dewitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, reflects her organization's determination to earmark a certain amount of money for the local area as national priorities are developed.

COLLECTING FLIES
 A new entry in the world of collectibles is the fishing fly. Compleat anglers as well as people who never go near the water are indulging a passion for acquiring these sprightly little objects, says to Alan Liu, author of "The American Sporting Collector's Handbook," published in 1976 by Winchester Press and revised in 1981. He will give a free talk on the subject Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. at the Fox Lane Middle School, on Route 172 in Mount Kisco.
 "There was no market for this three or four years ago," said Mr. Liu, who suggested one reason for the surge in popularity was that fishing flies were relatively cheap. Prices range from $25 to $250 at the entry level to collecting; as one approaches connoisseurship, prices reach $750 to $1,000.
 For the last few years there have been sufficient devotees to inspire an annual dinner and show at the Rye Town Hilton each March, sponsored by the Theodore Gordon Fly Fishers, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Manhattan. Mr. Liu regards Theodore Gordon as the father of American fly-fishing. "When he died 50 years ago, his flies were saved by friends -- keepers of the flame," Mr. Liu said. "He was a bachelor with no family to carry on the tradition."
 Gordon flies represent the upscale side of collecting, selling for as much as $10,000. While some vintage flies are in the used category, most have never been sullied by a trout's innards.
 Determining the authenticity of a Gordon fly is done by the signature, said Mr. Liu, "like recognizing the brush strokes and colors of a painting." Quality of materials, the angle of the feathers, the hooks -- all identify the maker, many of whom are women attracted to fly-tying as an art.
 Antique flies can be spotted by hooks that are no longer made, or by feathers from rare birds, which are available only on a black market. "Indian crow, toucan, bustard and heron feathers were used during the golden age of fly-tying in Victorian England but they are illegal now," said Mr. Liu.
 His talk will be part of the monthly meeting of the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a conservation organization. Call 666-5727 for more information.
 
A STONY POINT ARTIST
 Page Simon, a Stony Point artist whose work goes on display today at the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack, comes from a talented family, but she is its only visual artist. (Her cousins, Carly, Lucy and Joanna Simon, have achieved fame in the music world while her father, Henry Simon, was the book editor of the PM newspaper.)
 The major portion of this exhibition is devoted to Ms. Simon's semi-abstractions of natural and figurative forms. The brightly colored pencil drawings on highly textured paper are sometimes embellished with watercolors. Another group features color studies of the female nude, and a third section is composed of computer-generated images, a field in which Ms. Simon has worked and taught for several years.
 The gallery, at 82 North Broadway, is open weekends from 1 to 5 P.M. A public reception will be held for the artist from 1 to 5 P.M. today. Admission is by donation of $1. Call 358-0774 for more information.
 
CREDIBLE EDIBLES
 Leftover carrot tops, ginger roots and avocado seeds are the components of a "Garbage Gardening" workshop for five- and six-year-olds at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx on Saturday.
 From 10 A.M. to noon the children will learn how to propogate humble kitchen scraps into credible edibles, by planting them in little greenhouses made of cardboard, plastic and florist's wire. The children will take their miniature gardens home to nurture into maturity, along with appropriate instructions.
 A second workshop, for children 7 to 10 years old, will be held on March 9 from 10 A.M. to noon. Children meet in the Greenschool of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. The fee for either session is $12, and reservations must be made by calling 212-220-8982.
 
A NEW AGENDA
 Richard N. Gardner, a former United States Ambassador to Italy, professor of international law at Columbia University and co-chairman of the Aspen Institute project on "The U.S. and the World Economy," will be the speaker at a meeting of the Forum for World Affairs on Tuesday. His topic is "A New Agenda for Soviet-American Cooperation: Political and Economic Dimensions."
The event is being held at the Texaco offices in White Plains, at 2000 Westchester Avenue. A reception begins at 6:15 P.M., with the speech and open discussion at 7 P.M. A $10 admission fee includes snacks and dessert. Call 203-356-0340 for reservations.
 
HALL'S TRIO AT CAFE
 John Hall, a singer, songwriter and guitarist who was recently elected to the Ulster County Legislature, will appear with his trio at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling on Friday at 9 P.M.
 In the last 15 fifteen years, Mr. Hall has recorded 11 albums featuring his own songs with lyrics written by his wife, Joanna. He has toured the country with a variety of artists, including Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, the Silver Bullet Band and Taj Mahal.
 Accompanying his performance on accoustic guitar, keyboard and synthesizer will be Rob Leon on bass and Peter O'Brien on drums. The cafe is located at on Route 22 and admission is $15. Call 855-1300 for reservations or more information.
 
A GREBU RETROSPECTIVE
 Once seen, the paintings of Devis Grebu are not easily forgotten. The Romanian native, who is now a county resident, has perfected his formula of scattering comic, folksy images across a surreal world, while making a rational statement about a particular issue affecting the planet. The viewer looks, then looks again with expanding curiosity into the context, the technique and the impishness of the artist.
In 1989, Rizzoli published an elegant collection of his cartoons, paintings and illustrations, "Devis Grebu: Through an Artist's Eye" ($37.50). Now a retrospective exhibition of Mr. Grebu's output can be seen at the White Plains Library Gallery, at 100 Martine Avenue, through March 3. Gallery hours are Monday through Thursday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Friday from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.
 
SEE THE WOODPECKERS
 A tour of the "Woodpeckers of Westchester" exhibition, plus a walk along the Greenburgh Nature Center trails to view woodpeckers in the wild, begins at 10 A.M. on Saturday. The center is located on Dromore Road off Central Avenue.
 The exhibition consists of dioramas, charts, maps, graphics and live birds and will remain on display through April 21. It focuses on the woodpecker's unique abilities as a carpenter and its diet of insects, which serves as a protection for trees, houses and the occasional picnic. A number of sub-species are highlighted: the flickers, pileateds, sap-suckers, downy, red-headed and red-bellied, for example.
 An exhibition of related paintings, prints and photographs is also on view. Admission is $2. Call 723-3470 for more information.

THE ECONOMY

 
Washington and London, at Odds in the Air
 
All's fair in love, war and international airline negotiations. Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines. The dispute is "not about knocking Pan Am or T.W.A. out of business altogether," he said. He also urged timid Americans to resume traveling abroad; those who don't risk losing business, he said. What British Airways actually seeks are broader operating rights in the United States, said American analysts. Problem is, that sort of deal might normally take a year to work out; T.W.A. and Pan Am need agreements within a few months.

Oddball Salary Inequities
 
When Babe Ruth was asked, about 60 years ago, why he deserved $80,000 when President Hoover only made $75,000, Ruth's legendary response was, "I had a better year than he did." A week ago, Roger Clemens signed a four-year contract giving him a record average of $5.4 million a year; President Bush draws $200,000. Clemens won 21 games, holding opponents to an average of less than two runs a game. George Bush showed quick reflexes in the Persian Gulf but bobbled the tax issue. So Clemens did have the better year. But 27 times better? Enough so that the cost of a single Clemens victory more than covers Bush's salary for an entire season? And the President certainly outplayed, say, Jeff Parrett, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, who recently settled for $855,000 after winning five, losing 10. Memo to team owners wanting to economize: draft George, the former Yale baseball captain, when his Washington contract is up.
 
Alcohol-Fed Inflation
 
Economists have found another fuel to blame for increasing wholesale inflation. A record 5.9 percent jump in alcohol prices raised the core inflation rate in January by five-tenths of 1 percent. Higher alcohol taxes do not figure into producer prices, but many manufacturers took the chance to raise their own prices. Some economists said that, even after accounting for liquor costs, the rising core rate would keep the Federal Reserve from easing further. "The Fed will rest on its oars for at least a couple more weeks," said Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The broader inflation rate, including food and energy, fell one-tenth of 1 percent, as oil prices declined.
 
Golden Arch of Catfish?
 
McDonald's believes it has found a recipe for Southern success: The Crispy Catfish Sandwich, a 2.3-ounce patty with lettuce and tangy sauce on a bun. McDonald's plans to sell it at 214 outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee. Restaurants that specialize in catfish are hardly trembling. Don Buckner, general manager of Hall's on the River in Winchester, Ky., described McDonald's seafood sandwiches as "block pieces of fish" -- suitable for someone who would otherwise have a quarter-pounder. His $9.95 all-you-can-eat catfish dinner includes vegetables and hush puppies, he added. No hush puppies at McDonald's, said a spokeswoman, convinced that Southern customers will accept french fries.
 
Competition for Cellular Lines
 
All that static on the cellular phone lines is coming from aggrieved duopolists. The Federal Communications Commission decided on Wednesday to allow a new form of mobile service in six cities, including New York. Radio dispatch companies for taxis and delivery services will be able to squeeze thousands of other customers into their narrow slices of the radio spectrum. Cellular services that have flourished under rules allowing only two in each city could find competition heating up. Analysts doubt the new service, to be offered initially by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., will match cellular's flexibility and features. But the cellular industry called the decision unfair and threatened a fight.
 
Production Declines Ease
 
The slump in industrial output continued for a fourth month in January, but the decline was a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent after much steeper drops in the two previous months. Some economists said the report hints that the worst of the recession is past. But industries used only 79.9 percent of their capacity, the least in four years.
 
In Brief
 
A seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in already lean business inventories in December gave economists hope that any increase in demand would result in higher production.
 
Citibank, long aloof and superior, has decided to join the automated teller machine masses. Its machines will become part of the Cirrus network, sharing access with machines from 7,200 other banks and financial institutions.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
George Ball Steps Down
 
When the big boys on Wall Street are suffering, a guy who tried to play with them but failed is truly in trouble. George L. Ball resigned as chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bach Securities last Wednesday, felled by his loss of $308 million in less than nine years as the firm's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Ball tried to transform a humdrum brokerage firm into a glamorous, global investment bank, throwing around millions to hire star financiers. When the Prudential Insurance Company of America lost patience with his prodigal ways, he responded with what he called a "light cruiser" strategy, fighting only those competitive battles that he believed the firm could win. The losses continued, however, and Mr. Ball finally gave up his command.
 
Carter Hawley Hale Goes Under
 
The real markdowns at Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. last week were on "junk bonds" and common stock; the largest department store chain on the West Coast, parent of the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium names, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Carter Hawley Hale story was another 1980's tale of efficient wealth transfer from bondholders, long-term investors and employees -- whose 45 percent stake in the company is now nearly worthless -- to lawyers, investment bankers and the usual short-term profiteers. In its efforts to fight off a takeover attempt led by the Limited Inc. chain in 1987, Carter Hawley Hale had taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Little was left, therefore, to improve the stores. Competition and a slack American economy did the rest.
 
Auto Makers in Decline
 
The Ford Motor Company has cut back, streamlined production and improved efficiency enough to almost rival the Japanese. But its fourth-quarter loss of $519 million confounded its mission to keep profits flowing even when a recession strikes. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.62 billion, giving the industry its second-worst quarter ever. Analysts were understanding, saying that auto companies can face no worse combination than a recession and higher energy prices. As James P. Womack, an auto industry authority at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "You can't take a 25 percent hit on volume and make much money in any business."
 
In Brief
 
A Federal bankruptcy judge approved the sale of 67 Eastern Airlines takeoff and landing slots and five gates at Washington National Airport to Northwest Airlines for $35.5 million. The Justice Department blocked a bid by United Airlines for antitrust reasons.
 
U S West Inc. agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine ever, for violating the agreement that broke up the Bell System.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Germany's High-Cost East
 
One weekend last fall, a carnival on East Berlin's Alexanderplatz was so dreary that visitors had to ask to make sure it was taking place. On the Kurfurstendamm in West Berlin, meanwhile, every evening brought out raucous crowds lingering well past midnight. German officials said last Tuesday that giving eastern Germany much to celebrate will prove far more costly than they had thought. With a turnaround nowhere in sight, the Government approved $3 billion in emergency aid for cities and states. Economists say that rebuilding the eastern regions will cost the Government nearly $100 billion this year, more than $1 trillion over the decade. Traditional Eastern European export markets have evaporated, factories are closing and residents are leaving for the West. Germany's bind might well pinch relations with the United States. The cost of aiding the easterners makes Germans more reluctant to lower interest rates in support of the dollar or finance the war in the Middle East.
 
Trouble With the Trade Deficit
 
The trade deficit is heading in the right direction for the wrong reasons. The gap shrank to $6.3 billion in December, better than most economists had expected. Imports fell 7.9 percent, as the recession curbed America's appetite for foreign goods. But exports slipped also, by 2.1 percent, auguring ill for one of the economy's few healthy areas. "We can't count on that sector as much in the months ahead," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. As foreign economies slow, not even a weaker dollar is sufficient to stoke overseas demand.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
America's Recovery Takes the Lead

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Markets around the world rallied last week, but the roar was loudest in the United States. The Standard & Poor's 500 index hit a record high and the Dow Jones industrial average finally recouped all that it lost after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August.
Though the European, Japanese and other markets in the Far East rose, most of them are still lagging far behind America's recovery. One explanation is simple. Wall Street did not fall nearly as far as other markets after the invasion of Kuwait. 
 More important, however, in the opinion of many analysts, this divergence reflects the different individual economic cycles that now mark the global economy. The big recoveries have been in countries that are in the midst of recessions, like the United States, Great Britain and Canada. In these countries, the onset of recession brought down interest rates and fostered hopes of further rate declines and a quick economic recovery. This has made their markets very attractive.
On Wall Street, for example, the S.&P. 500 is now 14.54 points, or 3.8 percent, above its pre-crisis Aug. 1 level. The Dow is 1.2 percent over Aug. 1. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index is up 7.2 percent for the year and is just 1.8 percent below its Aug. 1 level of 2,339. In Toronto, the stock exchange's composite index has jumped 7.7 percent in 1991, most of that rise coming this month. The index is now just 1.8 percent below its Aug. 1 level of 3,569.15.
The markets where the Persian Gulf losses have not been regained are in Continental Europe and Japan. In Germany, the DAX Index of 30 shares is up 9.5 for the year. It jumped 3 percent Friday after the Iraqi announcement of a willingness to withdraw from Kuwait based on conditions that the United States rejected a few hours later. But the stock market index is still 19.1 percent below its Aug. 1 level of 1892.89.
In France, the CAC-40 index of blue-chip stocks is still 14.8 percent from its pre-crisis level. Spain's market is down 12.9 percent. In Italy, the Banca Commerciale index is still 23.3 percent under Aug. 1. And the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo is still 17.8 percent from its pre-crisis level.
Although optimistic analysts are now talking about the coming economic recoveries in the United States, Britain and Canada, in Continental Europe, excluding Germany, they speak of being at the beginning of the downward side of the economic cycle. This could eventually mean recession, a situation that usually is a drag on their markets.
While the European slowdowns are accelerating -- France could be on the brink of a recession right now -- recessions have not yet taken hold. This means interest rates are not falling quickly. And the recent hike in interest rates by Germany has made it harder for France and other countries to lower rates to stimulate their economies and perhaps extend the market rallies.
Germany, however, is a special case.
Although German business confidence has held steady and the German economy is the strongest by far in Europe, its high interest rates make its equity market less attractive. The uncertainty about the rising cost of the unification of Germany is also adding risk to investment there.
In Japan, interest rates remain high, keeping some investors on the sidelines. But there are signs that the economy is slowing, and analysts expect that interest rates will begin to decline soon, boosting the market.
In Europe, the earnings of many of the companies that dominate the stock markets are very sensitive to the level of interest rates and the health of the economy. About 60 percent of the capitalization in Continental markets is in manufacturing companies. Of this, about two-thirds is in highly cyclical areas like automobiles, according to Michael Howell of Salomon Brothers in London.
The long fall of the dollar has devastated business for European exporters and crunched the earnings of companies with operations in the United States. "The United States," said Mr. Howell "is exporting its recession to Europe."
"I think there is more bad news to come," said Paul Feldman of Goldman Sachs & Company in London. He said he expects a round of "awful" earnings reports.
Such views are helping to hold down the European markets.
Another difference in the two rallies is the performance of cyclical stocks, like construction companies. In the American and the British markets, these stocks have matched or outperformed the market as a whole in several instances in the last two weeks. This buying reflects the feeling that interest rates are coming down and that the recession will end soon, making the companies' stocks a good buy.
But in Germany and France, the cyclical stocks have not performed as well during the same rally, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. Automobile stocks have underperformed the market significantly in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Construction and machinery stocks have also lagged in Germany.
Then there's France. Cyclical stocks there outperformed the market over the last two weeks. This could reflect a belief that French interest rates will come down soon and that the French cyclical stocks are becoming a good buy, just like in the United States.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Foreshadowing A Short Recession

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The stock market's reputation as an economic seer looks like it is about to get another boost. The American recession, which seemed so fierce only a couple of months ago, now seems to have eased as the new year began.
It now appears likely that the last few months of 1990 were the worst of the downturn, and that the economy could start growing as soon as the second quarter of this year. 
 Last week, hopes for both peace and prosperity propelled the Standard & Poor's 500 to a record high. The Dow Jones industrial average moved up 103.96 points, to 2,934.65, and is 65.10 points from its own record, set on July 16.
For the world economy, an American upturn would be a very welcome thing. The outlook for the British recession is not nearly so rosy, in part because British policy makers are caught in a bind between trying to protect the pound and pulling out all the stops to revive their economy. And there are signs of economic softness in Japan and Germany, the other big engines of world growth. By letting the dollar fall, the Fed has exported some of the American weakness.
If this recession is to end in short order, it will be a tribute to the power of a unified expansionary policy in Washington. The war is serving as an economic stimulus, and that will be especially true if most of the costs wind up being paid by others, as the Bush Administration has promised. The Federal Reserve, and bank regulators, are also doing all they can to ease credit and get business moving again.
The retail sales figures last week provided the first solid evidence that things did start to pick up a bit in January. Over all, they were down 0.9 percent. But they were flat without autos, and up a bit if both autos and gasoline were excluded.
The auto makers, almost drowning in red ink, have responded to their problems by cutting production more than prices, hoping to make decent profits on the cars they can sell. That strategy may be more widespread than previously appreciated, and could help to explain the report that producer prices, excluding food and energy, rose a surprising 0.5 percent in January. It also could slow any increase in consumer spending.
While there now are good reasons to think the recession is nearing an end, there is another case to be made. The best that can be said for January's industrial production figures, for example, is that the decline was smaller than in previous months.
And, even accepting that the recession is nearing an end, it is possible to fear that stock prices have risen too far on hopes for peace, just as they fell too far on fears of war before mid-January. Since Jan. 16, the Dow is up 17 percent, and it is rare for runs like that to continue unless they start with the market sharply undervalued.
This run did not, and while falling interest rates have improved valuations, Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch estimates that Treasury bond rates would have to fall to about 7.4 percent, from close to 8 percent now, to justify these prices.

HEADLINE: Managing;
A Matter of Supplier-Customer Trust

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Sherwin-Williams Inc., the big paint company, recently let executives from Sears, Roebuck Inc. help select the people who would service the Sears account. "We and Sears already had joint sales and product-turnover goals, so it made sense to jointly select the people who can make those goals happen," said T. Scott King, a vice president of sales for Sherwin-Williams.
The Digital Equipment Corporation often helps its smaller customers put together corporate image programs in their communities. "They are buying our product, so anything we do to help them be successful makes sense," said Joseph D. Codispoti, Digital's media relations manager. 
 The Xerox Corporation and the General Electric Company, which buy from each other all the time, now send people to each other's in-house training sessions, too. "To really focus on customers' needs, you must understand more about them than how they use your product," said Wayland R. Hicks, Xerox's executive vice president for marketing and customer operations.
Throughout the 1980's, customer partnerships were defined solely in terms of products. But by working together on technologies and processes, many suppliers and customers came to trust each other enough to share schematics for products, sales forecasts and other information once considered proprietary. And many discovered that discrepancies in the ways they handled invoicing and deliveries -- far more than product constraints -- prevented them from doing even more joint business, such as dealing with each other overseas.
As a result, companies are now broadening their definitions of customer partnerships to include office procedures, training, even hiring. "If you assume the goal of staffing, training or any other internal process is to better respond to customer needs, then it makes sense to help the customer participate in those processes," said David Ulrich, professor of executive education at the University of Michigan's School of Business, who has written extensively on the subject.
That may be so, but corporate executives have been slow to act on the concept. "Only lately have we shifted our emphasis from transactions to relationships," said James P. Baughman, G.E.'s manager of corporate management development. "That means feeling that we and the customer are part of one system, not two."
G.E. is striving hard to reach that utopia. Over the last six months, several G.E. divisions have invited customer teams to join sessions of Workout, a training program that G.E. developed to decrease internal red tape. Those sessions enabled one G.E. division to shave more than a week off delivery times by letting major customers enter their own orders into G.E.'s data system. Another division eliminated about six monthly reports to a customer when, in Workout sessions, the customer admitted to throwing them away. Yet another is now working with customers to find the point at which their need for quick access to spare parts intersects with G.E.'s need to reduce inventory costs.
Xerox, too, has been using a team approach -- albeit a less formal one -- to smooth its interactions with major customers. For example, its executives have been meeting with executives from the Bechtel Corporation with an eye toward better understanding Bechtel's ordering and accounting systems. One result: Xerox has stopped sending Bechtel paper invoices for each order, conforming to Bechtel's preferred method of being billed electronically, once a month. "Sometimes, going after small irritants in systems is as important to meeting a customer's needs as major design changes in products," said Mr. Hicks.
Of course, no supplier gives customers a guarantee that every "small irritant" will be abolished. But customers report that being asked for their input has value in itself.
R. Gene Richter, executive director of corporate procurement for the Hewlett-Packard Company, says his suppliers often ask him to recommend people whom they might hire to manage the Hewlett-Packard account. None has let him participate in the hiring decision and only about 25 percent of the people he recommended got hired. But the suppliers invariably explain why talks with the other three-quarters did not work out. "I realize my advice is taken seriously," Mr. Richter said. "And that alone makes me feel warmer to the person they do hire."
 
 
BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS, STEP BY STEP
 Collaborations between customers and suppliers are not always directly tied to business systems. Sometimes, they just involve sharing expertise.
Xerox, which won the Malcolm Baldrige corporate quality award in 1989, has sent its people to help several customers install quality assurance processes. The question of Xerox products rarely comes up.
"A corporate president who invites you to talk to his management team will continue to think of you as a partner, not just another vendor," explained Wayland R. Hicks, Xerox's executive vice president for marketing and customer operations. "And not only that -- our customers might provide us with a way to reach their customers."
Similarly, Frank M. J. LaFasto, the Baxter Healthcare Corporation's vice president of human resource planning and development, holds team-building sessions for some hospitals that buy Baxter's products.
"Hospitals are dealing with all kinds of cost constraints and economic challenges," said Mr. LaFasto, co-author of a book on teamwork. "Helping them manage their businesses more effectively gives us a better sense of security about our own business."

HEADLINE: Last Thing Democrats Need Is to Change Nominating Process

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As we head into the 1992 Presidential campaign, the Democratic Party is facing an uphill fight. If George Bush's war in the Persian Gulf goes smoothly, he will have lots of the momentum he calls "big mo." 
 In this situation, the last thing the Democratic Party needs is to get bogged down in reforming the nominating process, as Tom Wicker proposes in "Why Democrats Lose" (column, Feb. 6). While that process is certainly convoluted, it is not haphazard. In the end, the candidate who has emerged from the primaries as the Democratic nominee has been the strongest, most representative and electable candidate in the field -- with two exceptions, neither of which was under our control.
In 1968 Robert F. Kennedy won the California primary and was on his way to the nomination -- when he was murdered. In 1972, Edmund Muskie appeared to have the nomination in hand -- until he was destroyed by Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks."
We can't prevent assassinations or crimes. All we can do is put our would-be candidates through the test of a national primary campaign. This test weeds out candidates who are too narrow in their geographical (or ideological) appeal or who have fatal character flaws. Given the intense personal scrutiny associated with recent campaigns, this test of character is essential.
Of course, the primary test has become a marathon, as Michael S. Dukakis properly called it. And there may be a few outstanding candidates who are deterred by the excessive agonies of this marathon. But looking ahead to 1992, no one is going to beat George Bush by making televised speeches from a Senate office or a governor's mansion.
Our candidate will have to campaign in all 50 states, making the case that Mr. Bush is neglecting America's deep economic and social problems while he dreams about a new world order abroad.
In 1992 -- perhaps more than ever before -- a successful spring primary campaign will be essential to a successful fall general election.
The open primary system produced Ronald Reagan and George Bush on the Republican side. There is no reason to believe it cannot produce a strong Democratic candidate, now and in the future. Let's concentrate on the candidates and on the issues, not on the distraction of nomination reform.

HEADLINE: Social Security Tax Policy: A Democratic Issue for '92?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders are considering a new political offensive based on a proposal to cut the Social Security taxes of most workers by a small amount while increasing the payroll taxes of high-salaried workers.
The proposal is not likely to become law, since it faces an almost certain Presidential veto and is even opposed by some influential Democrats. But it could be the focus of the political debate over domestic policy in the next two years, allowing the Democrats to revive what party leaders see as the most effective weapon in their political arsenal: the argument that they are the benefactors of ordinary Americans, while President Bush, with his support of a cut in the capital gains tax, is the patron of the wealthy. 
 One Democratic strategist said: "The President wants to reduce taxes on investment income by wealthy people, and Democrats want to reduce taxes on earned income by working people. How's that for a slogan going into 1992?"
The proponents of the Social Security plan, a reworked version of the one offered late in 1989 by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said it would make the tax system fairer and cost the Government no revenue. Opponents said it would turn the Social Security system more into a welfare program rather than the retirement insurance program it was meant to be.
 
Opposition From Chairmen
 Despite the interest of the Democratic leaders in Congress, the tactic faces a large and possibly insurmountable obstacle: opposition from the Democratic chairmen of the tax-writing committees, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois. Unless these chairmen can be brought around, the issue may never get a full airing.
Democratic leaders also maintain that the Robin Hood approach of taking money from the well-to-do and giving a tax break to the less affluent would be good for the economy during a recession. Lower-income workers would be more likely to spend the money and give the economy a lift, proponents maintain.
But Mr. Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Mr. Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, could squelch the party leaders' plans. Social Security legislation must pass through their committees, and they have the ability to block consideration of measures they oppose.
Senator Bentsen said he thought the proposals being worked on by the leaders "would endanger the Social Security system." They would further stretch the relationship between the amount of taxes workers paid and the size of benefits they received on retirement, and thus "make it more into a welfare system," he said.
 
A 'Six Pack' Tax Cut
 A spokesman for Mr. Rostenkowski said the Congressman was wary of "tinkering" with Social Security, fearing that once the matter was raised steps might be taken that were politically attractive but bad policy. "He thinks it's not worth it just to give people a tax cut that's worth what, a six pack a week?" the assistant said.
With Congress in recess and most lawmakers out of town this week, top staff members worked on a variety of Social Security options.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said in a telephone interview that he intended to press the idea of reducing Social Security taxes for most workers but had not settled on a specific plan. "I definitely favor the concept," he said.
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, is said to be pushing the idea behind the scenes. And the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, has indicated that he could support a plan if it did not cost the Government money.
The Bush Administration adamantly opposes what the President has repeatedly called "messing with Social Security." Many Republicans in Congress favor lowering the Social Security tax rate, but few if any support raising the amount that high-income workers pay.
 
The Tax This Year
 This year, workers and their employers will each pay a Social Security tax of 6.2 percent of their wages up to $53,400. They will also pay a Medicare tax of 1.45 percent on wages up to $125,000. No payroll tax will be paid on wages above the cutoffs.
One plan being considered would abolish the wage ceilings altogether and use the revenue from the additional taxes to lower the Social Security tax rate by about three-fourths of a percentage point. The effect would be to cut the taxes of about 95 percent of all workers, those with wages below $53,400 a year, by about $7.50 for each $1,000 earned. A person with a salary of $40,000 would get a tax cut of $300.
But workers with higher wages, and their employers, would each pay an additional $62 in taxes for every $1,000 earned above $53,400 a year and $76.50 for each $1,000 earned above $125,000. Someone with an annual salary of $200,000 would pay $10,176 more in payroll taxes than under the current law.
Another plan under consideration would raise the Social Security wage cap to the same level as the Medicare tax, $125,000. The money raised would allow the payroll tax rate to be reduced by about half a percentage point and would save the worker with a $40,000 salary about $200 a year in taxes.
 
Support for Moynihan Plan
 The groundwork for the strategy of pursuing a lower Social Security tax for most workers was prepared last year. The Democratic leaders felt they gained substantial advantage during the budget talks by attacking proposals for a capital gains tax and placing Mr. Bush on the side of the wealthy.
At the same time, a plan to lower the Social Security tax rate offered by Senator Moynihan gained surprising support. The Moynihan plan, which would not have raised the wage ceiling to compensate for the reduced tax rate, was opposed by leaders of both parties in the Senate, mainly on the ground that it would have cost the Government as much as $50 billion in lost revenue. But under a procedure requiring 60 votes for passage, the plan fell only 6 votes short, losing by 54 to 44.
Senator Moynihan said he hoped to join forces with the Democratic leaders this year. "This is our issue, and we're going to take it to '92," he said in an interview.

HEADLINE: In Crowded Japan, a Bonus For Babies Angers Women

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
With its crowded roads, overstuffed commuter trains and cramped housing, Japan would hardly seem to be in need of more people. So when the Government recently started telling the Japanese to bear more children, many people, especially women, became incensed.
The focus of their irritation was a soon-to-be-offered "reward" of 5,000 yen, or $38, a month for each child of pre-school age, and twice as much for a third child, the centerpiece of a spreading campaign to combat a birth rate that has plummeted to its lowest level in history.
 
'Trying to Be Equal'
 The baby bonuses were inspired by officials concerned that at the current rate, Japan's population will decline after the turn of the century, causing labor shortages, sluggish economic growth and higher tax burdens to support social services for the elderly. 
 Countering their view are feminists and family-planning experts who find it absurd to be concerned about underpopulation. "I don't understand why the Government is worried," said Shizue Kato, the 93-year-old head of the Japan Family Planning Association.
She added: "In my view, we should tell the women of Japan they are wonderful women, they have reduced the birth rate so rapidly. After all, they are only trying to be equal with the men of this country."
Indeed, women generally see the Government's population drive as a test of their freedom. Typical is Rie Fujinishi, a 29-year-old homemaker who struggles full time with housework and the care of a 3-year-old son, and is envious of her friends who work, go out to lunch or vacation in Hawaii.
"I really have to laugh," Mrs. Fujinishi said of the new baby bonuses. "The Government's thinking is so simplistic. They figure if they pay a little money, the mother will have another baby, just like a machine. I won't be influenced by it. My freedom is more important than 5,000 yen."
 
The Long Work Day
 Many experts are troubled by the reasons cited by Japanese women who decide to postpone marriage or have only one or two children, if they have any at all. Many Japanese women say they are in effect revolting against a system stacked against them.
They complain about the high cost of education, the lack of day care, the scarcity of decent or affordable housing and the physical and emotional burdens of raising children when their husbands work from early morning until they stagger home on the last subway train toward midnight.
"It's not a militant thing, but we're seeing a kind of 'women's revenge' in this country," said Shigemi Kono, director general of the Institute of Population Problems at the Health and Welfare Ministry. "Women are showing their disenchantment with what marriage in Japan has become."
Declining birth rates are a feature of all modern industrial societies, including other rapidly developing nations in Asia where work opportunities are opening up for women and social security systems are taking the place of children caring for their aging parents.
But no other country in the world has experienced the steady and rapid drop in birth rates that Japan has seen over the last two decades. In 1989, the fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman is expected to bear, fell to 1.57, and Mr. Kono said it is expected to drop still further.
 
Late Marriages
 The causes of the drop in the birth rate, not to mention the debate and concerns it has provoked, offer a lesson in how increasing wealth has not brought increasing happiness among the Japanese.
Today two-thirds of the men and a third of the women do not marry until their 30's. Only in Sweden do people marry later, but unlike Sweden and other places, Japan is a country where unmarried couples almost never live together.
Women say they are more interested in careers, education and the attractions of a single life style. They complain about living in tiny apartments, about the drudgery of marriage to demanding husbands who do not help at home, and about the near impossibility of mixing work and motherhood.
"Sometimes I admit I'm very lonely," said Kay Suzuki, a 32-year-old unmarried office worker. "But I just can't imagine quitting my job. My boyfriend finally gave up trying to get me to marry him. He was a typical Japanese man. He didn't want a partner, he wanted me to be his mother."
Every expert has an opinion, it seems, about why the trend is occurring. One scholar recently suggested that sports, video games and other diversions were robbing men of their libido. Others bemoan the absence of places for men and women to meet and go off together.
 
A Throne Goes Begging?
 Humorists note that even so eligible a bachelor as Crown Prince Naruhito, the 31-year-old son of the Emperor of Japan, is having trouble finding a bride -- and future empress -- because few women of high social standing are willing to surrender their freedom to the imperial family.
The plummeting birth rate is cited darkly by ultranationalists, who speak of sapping Japan's "ethnic vitality." One publication warned in all seriousness last year that at the current rate, Japan's population would decline to 45,000 by the year 3000. The population now is more than 123 million.
The Government warns more persuasively of a shrinking tax base and skyrocketing demands for government services, especially for the elderly. But officials fear that promoting births would remind people of the coercive 1930's campaign to "breed and multiply" for the good of the Japanese empire.
"It's a difficult problem that threatens the future of our social welfare system," said Saburo Toida, chairman of a Parliamentary committee on the low birth rate last year. "Of course, we can't tell people to 'breed and multiply,' but we can make a better environment for people to have children."
 
Extension of Day Care
 Accordingly, the Government will soon start its program of family subsidies for each pre-school child and also increase subsidies for day-care programs. The Government also plans longer hours for 23,000 Government-supported day-care centers, with some to stay open until 10 P.M.
Local governments are going further, offering their own subsidies and campaigns. Yamaguchi Prefecture in rural western Japan recently launched "Operation Stork," with television commmercials and postcards bearing slogans like, "Get a brother (or sister) for your child."
Most public surveys show that Japanese are unmoved by such steps. The Government has responded by showing some appreciation of the complex nature of the problem, and it has suggested steps to improve housing, encourage maternity leaves and permit men to come home earlier from work.
But few think these ideas will materialize soon. Not the least of the problems is the view that husbands in Japan work long hours and weekends, not simply because of job pressures but because they enjoy the companionship of male colleagues more than what many now commonly call "home service."
 
'Silent Resistance'
 Feminists say men's attitudes are improving but that deep-rooted cultural traditions die hard.
"The problem is that our entire social system fails to accommodate mothers with babies," said Yuriko Marumoto, a physician, working mother and feminist, who sees the low birth rate as reflecting a "silent resistance by women" to the male-dominated system.
Dr. Marumoto is also one of a small band of women who have spoken out against the Government's bonuses as a repressive response devised by males.
"Our politicians and business leaders only go home late at night," she said, taking time out from her work at a maternity hospital. "They don't know how kids are raised, or what family life is like. Our political system is controlled by men who know nothing about the kitchen or the home."

HEADLINE: Wallet of Ideas: New Yorkers Suggest Ways to Save the Budget

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
New Yorkers are not known for their reticence. Ask them for their views on how local government could do a better job of reducing its budget deficit and they respond vehemently, cynically, and sometimes, with solutions.
The New York Times asked 30 citizens, some prominent, others not, to reflect on the imminent prospect of service cuts and tax increases. 
 None relished the idea of paying more for less. But many also spoke of a sense of civic despair that went beyond current fiscal straits, a collective fear that the stark measures ahead do not cut to the heart of problems they see every day, situations that often defy common sense.
If there was one theme, it was that the city's faltering economy requires more than mere tinkering with the status quo. Robert Hayes, an advocate for the homeless, called for a local public works project mirroring the social programs of the Great Depression.
Housing, or the lack of it, was a widely shared concern. So was education. But like Americans everywhere, New Yorkers consider government part of the problem, not of the solution. Few disagreed with Deidre Sullivan, a writer whose word associations with state and city government were "annoyance, bloat, waste and sluggishness."
Or with Edward W. Hayes, the former Bronx assistant district attorney who was the inspiration for a character in Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities." He suggested, "You could shoot every tenth bureacrat as a warning to the others."
Former officials, understandably, offered less radical proposals. Ralph J. Lamberti, the former Staten Island Borough President, favored introducing sports betting in O.T.B. parlors to raise revenues and avoid another tax increase. "We constantly read that millions and millions of dollars are bet on the Super Bowl," Mr. Lamberti said. "Instead of having the local bookies get all the money, we could have the revenue."
And Susan Brownmiller, the author, voiced a view shared by just about all but the happy few: "Tax the filthy rich."
These are some of the comments:
 
David R. Jones
President of the Community Service Society

A large part of the city's crisis can be attributed to failure at the state level. The Governor's proposed budget would slash aid to urban localities. Losses to New York City would add $600 million to the city's deficit, already approaching $2 billion. This is an abdication of responsibility by state leadership at a time when the city cannot be forced to take any further measures in budget cutting.
I favor cutting expenditures but also increasing revenue, including taxes. We need to revisit taxation possibilities, such as a surcharge on incomes over $100,000. I'm supportive of a New York City Council suggestion that we revisit a possible commuter surcharge.
We need to revisit areas of waste we all know about. Costs of school custodial services are notorious, and so is the use of vehicles by city employees. We should also look at some giveaways, such as tax credits and real-estate tax abatements over the last decade aimed at attracting business, which paid no dividends as promised to city taxpayers.
 
Paul Gorman
Vice president at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine

What government should do is stop treating people like passive recipients and start offering support for courage and creativity.New York is an urban wilderness that has to be settled. Instead of throwing homesteaders out of abandoned buildings and maybe squeezing them into a shelter, the city ought to give them an award for their initiative and the resources to finish the job.
 
Barbara Ann Teer
Founder and head of the National Black Theater
 The economy of New York City is based on culture and the arts. The arts have to be subsidized. They can do this through a government agency, or entrepreneurly or by expanding corporate funding. Long range, we're talking about educating children so they will grow up to be supportive of the arts and buy tickets.
 
Gordon J. Davis
Former New York City Parks Commissioner

Immediate needs on budget and tax strategy should be coordinated at the highest levels of the state and city to avoid working at cross purposes. A long-term suggestion is the creation of a regional development bank, on the model of the World Bank, that would take up the slack in jobs by rebuilding airports, highways, bridges, parks in New York.
 
Beth Anderson
Life-sciences teacher

I hear a lot of things about hiring a lot of police. If you do that, more money has to go to them. Then you will be arresting more people and putting more people in jail, and it doesn't seem to me that that is an investment New York City or New York State should be making. We need to teach kids not to get involved in things that police will later have to stop.
We need to look at finding ways to have people help each other more, for example putting homeless people into the available empty apartments that exist in the city. We need to find ways to lower rents so people can afford to live in the newer empty buildings.
 
Julia Rivera
Executive director of ASPIRA of New York, which promotes education and leadership for Hispanic youth

Times of crisis are an opportunity to rethink the tax component. The Hispanic community cannot afford these heavy blows. We'll be suffering another generation of students whose lives will be lost.
 
Herbert P. Rickman
President of New York Pride, a nonprofit group, and former special assistant to Mayor Edward I. Koch

Slash the overburdened bureaucracy. Encourage volunteerism. Engage seriously in the battle against the underground economy. Street vending is estimated to cost the city $3 billion in taxes every year. Do more to promote the arts, particularly the motion picture industry. Start selling the city as a tourist mecca. Tourism is the one industry that could help turn around the economy, but basic amenities are lacking: facilities to cash foreign exchange, information in foreign languages, necessities like public toilets.
 
 Marlene Swartz
Artistic director, SoHo Repertory Theater

We should set priorities having to do with quality of life. When I see cops wasting time busting a street musician or a peddler and yet I can't feel safe on the subway, it makes me furious.
One way to help might be ask artists or athletes who have risen up from New York City to donate a certain percent of proceeds to a specific cause, the way Paul Simon helped provide medical care for kids in welfare hotels. The money would have to be for a particular need. If you gave it to the city, it would just go into some bureaucratic hole.
 
Sam Rhee
 Director of the Korean Banking Center at Citibank's branch in Flushing, Queens

Real-estate taxes are too high. You penalize the mom-and-pop stores that stay open 24 hours. In the long run we must bring in some investment firms from overseas -- Japan and Korea and Taiwan and Hong Kong. If we have tax abatements or some kind of incentive, we can bring more business in.
 
 Mac Wellman
Playwright

Lots of people are making lots of money in New York and we all know it and it's not being taxed. Tax the rich. A novel idea. What's been going on for 15 years is soaking the poor to make the rich richer.
 
Ralph J. Lamberti
Former Staten Island Borough President and now senior vice president of behavioral sciences at Staten Island University Hospital

The four East River bridges should be transferred to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The authority then can float bonds, with the revenue coming from a toll on these bridges. That way you can have a reduction in the city's budget for the maintenance and operation of the bridges, but still get the work done.
We should have sports betting in New York City, in the O.T.B. parlors. Instead of having the local bookies get all these millions and millions of dollars, we could.
You already have every tax imaginable, and raising them can get you to a point of diminishing returns. Lowering taxes in some cases will actually generate more revenue.
 
William Tucker
Author of "The Excluded Americans: Homelessness and Housing Policies."

The quickest thing the city could do to deal with the budget crisis would be to abolish rent control. That would allow the city to jettison the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and eventually save more than $1 billion a year. Rent control has caused landlords to abandon buildings and stopped builders from making investments in housing. If the city abolished rent control, people would buy these abandoned buildings and there would be an avalanche of private investment from builders.
 
Richard I. Beattie Jr.
Lawyer and former Board of Education member
I think we're shortchanging the future with the Governor and the Mayor taking too much out of education. There are a couple of different ways to address the problem. You can raise taxes, cut expenditures, or use deficit financing. And there's the fourth, which is a combination of cuts and taxes.
 
Sister Barbara Lenniger
Executive director of a transitional housing program for homeless women and children in the Bronx

 I would put money into affordable low- and moderate-income housing with preventive services to prevent addiction, to build up families. If I could cut, it would be in the Federal defense budget. I would rather build houses to shelter people than build bombs to kill people.
 
Ira M. Millstein
Lawyer and a member of Governor Cuomo's Council on Fiscal and Economic Priorities
 I'm in favor of higher state personal income taxes. I know it's not a popular thing to do. But I'm not in favor of raising corporate taxes and chasing businesses out. And I am in favor of maintaining a level of services that will keep businesses here. And there shuld also be a gas tax increase.
 
John Wang
Consultant in Asian-American marketing and former head of the Chinese-American Local Development Corporation

The government and private sectors have never seriously assessed or tried to channel the contributions of immigrants as an economic development resource. The development of immigrant communities as markets would stimulate business expansion and create additional employment and new tax resources. There's also new opportunity in the 1990 Immigration Act. The law provides 10,000 immigration visas yearly to individuals who invest $1 million or more in new businesses, employing 10 or more workers. If New York took steps to attract only 10 percent of such investors, it would mean $1 billion more for the economy.
 
Robert Hayes
Chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless
If I had one wish, it would be the creation of a mass public-works program. If New York is being crushed by the need to provide general services like sanitation and infrastructure repair, that could really work. At the same time it is being strangled by an increased welfare burden. You could strike at both of those problems by getting people into jobs.
 
Deidre Sullivan
Writer

When I think of city and state government, I think of annoyance, bloat, waste, sluggishness. Dealing with most local government offices is a real pain in the neck. Business is not a golden child, but the private sector can serve as a role model for instilling competitiveness and verve in government.
 
Angelo Falcon
President of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy
 What I don't see happening at all is a critical evaluation of how the city does its business. Part of this critical re-examination has got to be a strengthening of institutions in poor neighborhoods. This is an opportunity to raise the issue of redistributing the city's wealth, because some can manage cutbacks better than others. There is a connection between poverty and racial tensions and an unfair distribution of services and city resources that fall along racial lines.
 
Susan Brownmiller
Writer

I'm horrified at all the proposed cuts in services. What we've got to do is tax the filthy rich. I think we should go with a one-year emergency surcharge added to the city taxes: one percent if your annual income is above $200,000 but below $300,000; two percent if it's above $300,000 but below $400,000, and so on, up to $1 million. I'm convinced that this would wipe out the deficit. But it would have to be on the gross income, and extended to the people who live outside New York City but work here.
 
Edward W. Hayes
Lawyer and former assistant district attorney in the Bronx
 Cuomo's budget is good because he relied on cutting costs and raising taxes. He pushed back on localities the idea that they also have to cut costs, particularly in the school system, where it is possible.
I would favor a limitation on the terms of legislators. If congressmen and state legislators did not look to get a lifetime job, they would have a whole different attitude to managing the business. Or, you could shoot every tenth bureaucrat as a warning to the others.
 
Roy Friberg
Recovering heroin addict with AIDS who tries to get addicts into drug treatment
 There's a lot of exorbitant waste as far as welfare is concerned. When I see putting people in welfare hotels instead of putting them in an apartment where the rent is a lot less, I see the waste.
You're going to need to start funding more drug programs. Unless you deal with that problem, New York City is not going to get any better. You've got professional "boosters" who will shoplift to pay for drugs. You've got drug-related murders, neighborhoods taken over by drugs. Your drug money is not going back to the city. It's affecting every segment of society.

HEADLINE: Bank Losses Worst in 50 Years, But No Danger to System Is Seen

SERIES: Banks Under Stress/First of five articles: The Legacy of Excess

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT with JOHN C. FREED

 BODY:
As Congress begins debate on one of the most extensive series of changes ever proposed for the nation's banking system, there are clear signs of serious illness at many banks -- large as well as small. But experts say the system itself does not appear in danger of collapse.
The banks are suffering more from losses on bad loans than at any time in the last 50 years -- the amount sharply accelerating in the first nine months of last year. Federal regulators expect 180 banks to fail this year -- banks whose average size is much larger than those that failed in recent years. Nevertheless, the problems do not approach those of the early years of the Depression, when the collapse of 7,000 banks before the national bank holiday was declared in March 1933 helped shatter the economy. 
 By contrast to the savings and loan industry, which is essentially broke, the banking industry earned a profit of $14.7 billion in the first nine months of 1990, despite the increase in loan losses. And to absorb future losses, the banks have a record $218.2 billion of capital and $52.3 billion of other reserves. Capital, in this sense, means stockholders' equity or, more simply, the difference between what a bank owns and what it owes.
 
A Large Bank's Fall
 The state of the banking system is now a matter of heightened public interest following the collapse in early January of the Bank of New England and several reports of losses and dividend cuts at other banks. The problems are typified by the troubled history of a little bank in White River Junction, Vt., for example, where the 1980's temptation to seek ever higher profits from real estate helped bring the institution to its knees -- or by a similar story in New Hampshire at a bank that had been in business since 1830.
Attention is also being drawn to the system by the Administration's attempt to broaden it, by giving banks the powers to do business nationwide and to make it easier for them to enter the insurance and securities businesses. The proposals would not help solve a bank's immediate problems with bad loans, but they could eventually help make the banking industry more profitable, specialists say.
"We certainly don't have a banking crisis in the sense that the country as a whole has a problem," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "But in certain areas of the country there is real stress," he continued, adding that bank problems will worsen if the recession is more severe than he expects or if it lasts beyond midyear.
The troubles among larger banks are clearly shown on the F.D.I.C.'s most recent list of banks that it sees as vulnerable to failure or requiring close supervision. At the end of 1990, that list, which is not publicly available, included 1,046 banks with $408.8 billion of assets, or 12.1 percent of the industry total. A year earlier, at the end of 1989, there were 1,109 banks on the problem list, but their assets were only 7.1 percent of the national total, or $235.5 billion. The list changes every quarter as the condition of some banks improves while other banks deteriorate or fail.
 
 Stocks Down Sharply
 Among the nation's 10 largest banking companies, all continue to be rated as "inherently sound" with ratings of a middle grade or higher, according to Thomson Bankwatch, a bank rating firm based in New York City. But sharp declines in the stocks of those companies -- many are down more than 50 percent in the last 15 months -- are a reminder that investors and analysts see problems that the banking companies may not yet have acknowledged in their financial reports.
Indeed, for 8 of the 10 largest banking companies, industry analysts estimate that losses on loans -- particularly risky loans for commercial real estate and leveraged buyouts -- are well in excess of the reserves set aside by the banks to cover those losses.
Bankers dislike the private estimates of loan losses, because the losses for similar kinds of loans may vary widely from bank to bank.
"We make sure our reserves are consistent with the risk characteristics of our portfolio," said John F. Kooken, vice chairman at the Security Pacific Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest banking company, based in Los Angeles. "There are a lot of checks and balances in the mechanism for setting reserves," he added, noting that the bank's loans are studied by outside auditors as well as banking regulators.
 
Loan Troubles
Large Banks Cut Dividends
 Even if banks deny that loan losses are as severe as analysts estimate, they acknowledge that problems exist. Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover have all cut their dividends in recent months, and others have reported large increases in their delinquent loans.
Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said recent increases in loan problems among larger banks "are especially alarming because they are showing up at the earliest stage of the recession but are already much greater than at the end of the 1981-82 recession."
Financial statements filed with the F.D.I.C. by the banks on Sept. 30, the most recent available, show that through the first nine months of 1990, commercial banks in the United States charged off as a loss 1.36 percent of their outstanding loans, compared with only 56-hundredths of 1 percent in 1982, the last year of the most severe recession since World War II.
Loans that were seriously delinquent equaled 2.65 percent of all bank assets on Sept. 30, up from 1.85 percent in 1982. In loans in this category, no payment has been made for 90 days or more or full payment is no longer expected. In a recession, when more borrowers default, the banking industry normally doubles its write-offs of bad loans; so analysts now expect losses to remain high for many months.
 
Problems Shift to the Northeast
 A New York Times analysis of the Sept. 30 data shows a geographic shifting of banking industry problems away from oil-producing states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana to the Northeastern region, where the troubles are rooted in declining real estate values.
More than one in five Northeastern banks reported a loss, according to the September data, for the first nine months of 1990, compared with one in nine for the rest of the country. Many of the worst problems in that region have occurred at savings banks, including Goldome in Buffalo and several in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, that ventured outside their traditional business of collecting consumer deposits and making low-risk home loans and investments and into commercial real estate.
The Times study of the financial reports filed by the nation's 12,926 banks identified 252 that were in weakened condition, either because of a low level of capital or unusually large amounts of seriously delinquent loans. Inclusion on these lists does not mean that all 252 banks are going to fail, but it is regarded as matter of serious concern.
 
Oil Collapse Jolted Southeast
 Most of the weakly capitalized banks are in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, where many banks are still suffering from losses in the late 80's, following the collapse of oil prices in 1986. Troubled banks in Massachusetts and Connecticut dominate the list of banks with large holdings of seriously delinquent loans.
The F.D.I.C., whose list of "problem" banks has many more names on it than 252, has complete access to bank records and can examine the quality of individual loans. It does not publicly identify problem banks, though depositors may request an annual financial statement from their bank or may write to the F.D.I.C. to obtain a copy of quarterly reports filed by any bank with federally insured deposits.
Measuring the health of banks depends mostly on the value of the loans they have made and how that value is figured. Since there is no stock exchange to determine the value of bank loans, their worth is always open to debate.
If it is assumed that the loans would be sold immediately, their price would be sharply lower than their face amount and banks would realize large losses. An alternative, preferred by bankers, is to assume that the loans will not be sold, and that losses would be recognized only when a default occurred or became likely.
 
Realty Woes
Banks Are Forced To Take Losses
 The steep decline in real estate markets in the last two years has led bank examiners to conclude that many bank loans backing those projects have also declined in value. They have forced banks to write off many loans as a loss and build their reserves to cover future losses.
But in the last few weeks, in response to complaints that strict accounting practices were closing off the supply of new loans to the economy, regulators have shown signs of adopting easier accounting rules. These rules could reduce the losses and reserves required of banks.
"We don't want the environment bankers face to be more difficult than it has to be," said Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency.
To measure whether a bank can withstand a siege of bad loans, analysts and regulators pay close attention to the bank's capital to absorb the losses. For many banks, the capital cushion is now thin. But the industry as a whole has more than $6.50 of capital for each $100 of assets, or more than double the minimum standard for financial safety set by regulators.
 
Two Key Ratios Studied

Two important warning signs that analysts look for are the ratio of a bank's capital to assets and the ratio of bad loans to assets. Experience suggests that an average of at least 30 percent of banks with capital of less than 3 percent of assets will fail within two years, and that 60 percent with less than 1.5 percent will fail in that time. Warnings sound, too, when a bank has more than 8 percent of its assets in nonperforming loans.
Texas still has more insolvent and weakly capitalized banks than any other state, but problems are abating there, with fewer banks reporting losses and delinquent loans declining. In the Northeast, despite its problems, relatively few banks have accumulated enough losses to push their capital below 3 percent. But the number of banks reporting losses is growing and their holdings of delinquent loans are rising faster than in any other region of the country.
 
Customer Losses
Leading Concerns Look Elsewhere
 The temptation to plunge into commercial real estate lending was especially strong for many of the country's largest banks. They had been hurt when top-rated corporations, beginning in the 1960's, started to bypass American banks to get funds from foreign banks or the securities markets, where interest rates were lower.
"Twenty years ago we would have had major credit commitments and outstanding loans to companies like Du Pont and TRW," said Edward Brandon, chief executive at the National City Corporation, a Cleveland-based banking company that has been hurt in commercial real estate but remains profitable and well capitalized. Without those top-flight borrowers "banks have been forced to seek other borrowers, which inevitably means making riskier loans."
Still, bankers and analysts alike repeat that for all the unfavorable trends, the great majority of the nation's banks are faring well.
 
A Stress on Growth
 A leading cause of bank problems, said James McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting group, is "a reliance on growth to cover up other failings, whether it is a high level of expenses, a recent acquisition that cost too much, or unprofitable operations."
Because real estate loans carried higher interest rates than other business loans, they seemed attractive. Many banks increased their commitment to these loans by 20 percent or more from 1986 through 1989.
"The most seductive trap in banking is growth," said John G. Medlin Jr., chairman of the First Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C. "It looks so good while it is happening, but the real costs do not become apparent until later."
Mr. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, said many leading bank executives ignored warnings issued by his office as long ago as 1985 that standards for real estate loans were slipping.
"There are just too many bankers who forgot or ignored some fundamental precepts of the business," he said. "They put too many of their eggs into the basket of commercial real estate, and now they are paying the price."
 
Insolvencies
Most Are in Texas And the Northeast
 The compilation of the Sept. 30 bank data shows the following:
Twenty-five banks, with assets totaling nearly $13.5 billion, had the weakest capitalization in the country. Their losses had eaten away at capital to the point where they were insolvent and owed more to depositors and other creditors than the value of their "hard" assets, like loans and investments. Fourteen of the 25 have since closed.
Texas accounted for 13 of the insolvent banks, reflecting in large part the economic problems that hit the state and the region after the 1986 fall in oil prices. Five banks in the Northeast are in that category, including three F.D.I.C.-insured savings banks that are the only ones on the list with more than $500 million of assets -- Goldome, with headquarters in Buffalo; the Maine Savings Bank of Portland, and the New Hampshire Savings Bank of Concord.
The largest insolvent bank is Goldome, which has nearly $10.3 billion of assets. Under close scrutiny of regulators it has been steadily shrinking its business. It has sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.
Thomas A. Cooper, chairman of Goldome, said the negative capital position was not necessarily a death knell. "Capital is extremely important, and regulators are right to demand that banks keep their financial condition strong," he said. But he noted that accounting practices show Goldome's weakness but "do not reflect our strength, which is the value of our consumer business."
By allowing Goldome to stay in business despite a lack of capital, Mr. Cooper said, regulators gave the bank time to cut expenses by 40 percent. He noted that the company returned to profitability in the last half of 1990.
 
Insufficient Capital
 Another 166 banks, with assets totaling $55.8 billion, had capital equal to less than 3 percent of their assets, the minimum set by regulators. For 61 banks, capital was less than 1.5 percent of assets.
While Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana account for 92 of the banks with capital below 3 percent, they are relatively small institutions, with only one having assets above $500 million. Nine of the 10 largest banks in Texas have either failed or been acquired in the last few years, leaving only the smaller banks with lingering problems.
In the Northeast, which to the F.D.I.C. includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and the 10 states to the north, there are fewer undercapitalized banks, but they are much larger than those in Texas. The weakly capitalized banks from the region included 11 with more than $1 billion of assets, including the $13.2 billion Bank of New England, which was taken over last month by the F.D.I.C., and the $5.9 billion American Security Bank, a unit of MNC Financial, a Baltimore company that owns the Maryland National Bank. To raise cash and strengthen its bank units, MNC recently sold its credit card business.
The largest savings banks reporting weak capital were also in the Northeast, and included the Meritor Savings Bank of Philadelphia, now known as the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, with $5.6 billion of assets, and the Dollar Dry Dock Bank of New York, with $4.6 billion. Both Meritor and Dollar Dry Dock have been selling branches and taking other measures to reduce expenses.
 
Bad Loans
 There were 118 banks, with total assets of $68.8 billion, that had more than 8 percent of their assets in nonperforming loans. The industry average for such loans on Sept. 30 was only 2.65 percent. But earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 1990, not yet compiled by Federal regulators, showed continued rapid increases in nonperforming assets in the Northeast and some evidence that California was beginning to experience the same problem as real estate prices there turned down.
Eight percent is a red flag to regulators and analysts, warning that additional loan losses are likely.
Northeastern states account for 68 of the banks with nonperforming loans above 8 percent. Two of the largest are the $9.3 billion Midlantic Bank in Newark and the $5.2 billion European American Bank in New York. Midlantic has been trying to improve its condition by reducing its size and selling assets, while European American has relied on a fresh capital investment by its European owners, led by ABN AMRO Holding of the Netherlands.
 
A Bank's Fall
Poor Management And Realty Losses
 The brief but troubled history of the Valley Bank in White River Junction, Vt., is an example of how the temptation of high profits from real estate lending and poor management can bring a bank to its knees.
When Valley Bank was established in early 1987, there was still enough spark in the New England real estate market for the founders to expect to match the high profits and rapid growth of many other New England banks.
"There was great pressure to generate earnings, and in that process the principles of lending got put on a back burner," said Joseph J. Greco, who was named Valley Bank's president a month ago. "The supply of credit for real estate deals from banks and savings banks far outstripped the demand. If you were the new bank on the block, like Valley was, you did not get the more sound, reputable businesses. You had to take the second tier."
By Sept. 30, the costs of those policies were clear: heavy loan losses had reduced Valley's capital to only $508,000, or 1.23 percent of assets. With the real estate market still falling, Valley is stuck with 49 percent of its assets consisting of loans backed by commercial real estate projects.
 
Looking for Capital
 As recently as a decade ago, commercial real estate loans accounted for only 5.8 perent of bank assets, and many bankers refused to consider such loans at all. Or they would require personal guarantees from developers as well as a solid business plan, with tenants lined up before construction began. But such lending grew rapidly in the 80's and reached 11.9 percent of assets by last Sept. 30. At 2,836 banks, commercial real estate lending accounted for more than 15 percent of all assets. And at 123 banks, the figure reached 40 percent.
"In retropect, it was probably not the best time for this particular venture to have been started," Mr. Greco said. But now that the mistakes have been made, he added, the bank is trying to recover what it can from the bad loans "and look everywhere for more capital."
The rush to participate in the 80's real estate boom claimed victims far older and better established than Valley National. The New Hampshire Savings Bank in Concord, for example, was founded in 1830 as a mutual-type bank owned by its depositors. But in 1982 it converted to a shareholder-owned company and soon became an aggressive lender on real estate. Losses on bad loans wiped out the $58.6 million of capital the bank had at the end of 1988 and left it insolvent, owing $38.8 million more to depositors and creditors than the estimated value of its assets.
Whatever else is done, most experts agree that the banks must return to sound lending practices, even if growth is sacrificed. In the best of times, the difference between healthy and weak banks is small. Operating on average with only about $6.50 of capital for every $100 of loans and investments, banks are extremely vulnerable to relatively small losses on loans, which can be enough to wipe out much of their capital.
"This is a business where you can be right 95 percent of the time, and still be in serious trouble," said Mr. Seidman of the F.D.I.C.
Next: The bank run
 
 
WHAT THE CHARTS AND LISTS SHOW
 The charts are based on balance sheets and income reports from 12,926 banks as of Sept. 30, 1990, the last period for which such data are available. All the banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
A computer-assisted search of those records identified banks that were insolvent, or had a small amount of capital relative to their size, or had a high amount of nonperforming loans. Banking experts regard low capital and large holdings of nonperforming loans as two key indicators of a troubled bank.
Banks on the insolvent list were those with negative capital-to-asset ratios, meaning that the amounts they owed depositors and other creditors were greater than the value of their "hard" assets, like loans and investments. Eighteen of the 25 banks on this list have since closed.
The Low Percentage of Capital to Assets list includes banks whose equity capital had shrunk to less than 3 percent of assets. Equity capital represents the amount that a bank's assets exceeds what it owes to depositors and other creditors.
 
Nonperforming Loans

And the banks on the Nonperforming Loans list were those with more than 8 percent of their assets tied up in loans that are delinquent by 90 days or more, or so troubled that the bank does not expect repayment in full.
The appearance of a bank on these lists does not mean it will fail. But bank regulators regard it as a clear sign of serious trouble when a bank's capital-to-assets ratio falls below 3 percent or when bad loans climb to more than 8 percent of assets.
The chart covering the nation's 10 largest banking companies compares the amount of capital and reserves they reported on Sept. 30 with outside analysts' assessments of the losses banks are likely to suffer on their loans. Bankers count on the reserve for loan losses as a way of setting aside money to cover bad loans, but many analysts say those reserves are not enough to cover the losses that banks will actually face.
For 8 of the 10 largest banking companies, the losses based on assumptions used by analysts exceeded the banks' reserves and left the institutions with less capital than their financial statements showed on Sept. 30. Two companies, J. P. Morgan & Company and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, appeared to have reserves greater than losses assumed for their loan portfolios. Of course, the actual loss on those loans will vary widely from bank to bank, and could disappear for many loans if the economy and real estate markets improve.
 
Estimates of Losses
 Based on past experience, analysts assume the losses average 10 percent for loans to highly indebted companies; 20 percent for all kinds of commercial real estate; 50 percent for delinquent loans to less-developed countries; 25 percent for all other kinds of loans so delinquent that bankers call them nonperforming, and 1.5 percent for all other kinds of loans. Those losses are then subtracted from the company's loan-loss reserves and existing capital.
The bankers counter by saying that the analysts' estimates are exaggerated. Even if all those losses materialized, they would probably occur over a period of time, during which banks could build up reserves from profits, the bankers say. Citibank officials add that the analysts' estimates are wrong because they do not recognize the full extent to which the bank company has already written off troubled loans.

Meant for the Stomach, Really Taken to Heart

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Back when the West was wilder, it was deadly dangerous to insult another man's horse. An unkind remark could start a gunfight.
These days, disputes are settled by lawyers, who are better paid than the old gunslingers, if not as quick to get results. And Westerners are no longer so defensive about their horses.
But watch what you say about their vegetables. 
 Under a bill pending in the Colorado Legislature, those who unfairly "disparage" food products could be sued. In short, if you have something bad to say about peas or carrots or for that matter T-bones, you had better have a good explanation.
Do people have a beef with beef? Why the need for protection for food? Is "anti-veggieism" on the rise? If so, was it set off by President Bush's intemperate remarks about broccoli?
The sponsor of the bill, State Representative Steve Acquafresca, says there was no specific incident that called for urgency on this matter. Rather, he said, he detected "a general trend in this country to unfairly and inaccurately disparage perishable food products."
Around the state, some people are wondering about the scope of such a law. Kelly Myers, a grocer in Palisade, acknowledged that he had sometimes complained to producers about small bananas and overripe tomatoes.
"Am I safe?" he asked. "Could they come after me for saying these things?" The bill has caused a lot of snickering. But Mr. Acquafresca, who is an apple grower, said, "I don't think there is anything funny about producers' being victimized by these unfair, disparaging statements."
As one example, Mr. Acquafresca cited the Alar scare two years ago, which raised concerns that apples were unsafe to eat because of the preservative sprayed on them. The fears proved exaggerated, but not before apple prices plummeted.
The measure, which would give agricultural producers the right to sue those who make "reckless and unfounded claims" about food, passed the State House of Representatives and now goes to the Senate.
Under the legislation, "any producer of perishable agricultural food products who suffers damages as a result of another's disparagement" of those products "may bring an action for damages."
Colorado's agriculture industry, which ranks second only to tourism in economic importance to the state, has strongly supported the bill.
Brad Anderson, vice president of the Colorado Cattle Feeders Association, said the bill would also provide a remedy for some of the unkind things being said about beef.
The average person now eats 71 pounds of beef a year, he said, down from 100 pounds per person 15 years ago. He said inaccurate claims about red meat were largely responsible for the decline.
"With this bill, if someone claims that beef is unhealthy, which isn't true," he said, "then we have a mechanism to file a lawsuit."
As an example of a possible suit, Mr. Anderson noted that a health food store in Boulder had recently advertised that beef "should be sold in drug stores," because it contains residue from the antibiotics given to cattle.
Jerry Kopel, a State Representative from Denver, voted against the measure. "This is very silly," he said. "It's not going to help the food industry. And it could discourage people from doing legitimate research on products."
Other opponents say it violates the First Amendment. Representative Jeanne Adkins, a former publisher, warned that newspapers could be sued for carrying the views of those who disagree with food producers.
David Miller, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Colorado, said his group would be studying the bill.
"My immediate reaction," he said, "is that you can't stop a Legislature from enacting silly legislation."
But Kevin Simpson, a columnist for The Denver Post, concluded that fruits and vegetables had simply "had it up to here" with disparaging remarks.
"It's bad enough they get cored, mashed, ground and pitted," he wrote. "You think they appreciate being defamed?"

HEADLINE: Daily News Strikers Hopeful Over a New Round of Talks

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
On the second day of new do-or-die talks between striking Daily News unions and senior executives of the newspaper, strike-weary workers expressed hope yesterday that a negotiated settlement in the four-month-old strike would finally be reached.
But most workers interviewed said that while they would welcome a settlement, they were also relieved that the paper's fate would be decided soon, no matter the outcome. 
 "I think everybody thinks it will be settled soon," said Nancy Stedman, an assistant features editor and member of the Newspaper Guild. "It would be the happiest moment of my life. This whole thing has been like watching somebody die of cancer."
The new signs of life were detected on Friday, when the leaders of the paper's nine striking unions met in a joint session with senior executives of The News and its corporate parent, the Tribune Company of Chicago. It was the first time that the publisher of The News, James Hoge, and the chief executive of the Tribune Company, Charles T. Brumback, had met face-to-face with all the union leaders.
 
More Than 2,000 Employees
 William J. Usery, Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration, who was invited by both sides to mediate the dispute, began holding talks yesterday at noon with the pressmen's union. He met separately with union and management representatives and also held several joint sessions with them that lasted for a total of more than two and a half hours. The Newspaper Guild president, Barry F. Lipton, whose union was scheduled to take up negotiations after the pressmen, said he thought the talks were likely to last all night.
Mr. Usery said on Friday that the paper's fate could be decided in days.
Both sides agree that there has been little negotiation amid the bitter accusations that have been exchanged during the strike, which involves more than 2,000 employees.
News officials have contended that they have tried to negotiate with the unions, while the union leaders have maintained that The News has refused to bargain in good faith.
But yesterday James Willse, the executive editor, struck a conciliatory note, "I think everybody is encouraged that there is at least some movement," he said.
 
'If I Had My Friends Around Me'
 Some workers said the strike was demoralizing for their colleagues, themselves and their families. Some live on unemployment checks, borrow from relatives or pay rent with money from union strike funds. While some have found permanent jobs, others have picked up part-time work, unwilling to surrender the hope that they will return to their jobs.
For some, the hardest part has been marching in front of the newspaper's East 42d Street headquarters -- and watching colleagues cross the picket lines or replacement workers assume their jobs. "A lot of people in my department crossed," Ms. Stedman said. "It would have been a lot easier to picket if I had my friends around me."
At the Newspaper Guild headquarters on West 44th Street, where strikers often gather, the mood was decidedly wait-and-see yesterday.
"I think everyone thinks this is good," said Pat Wallace, an editorial clerk. "We got Brumback to come. I've never seen him around any union talks."
 
Somewhat Skeptical
 But Tom Pennacchio, the secretary and treasurer of the Guild, refused to comment on the negotiations at the Waldorf-Astoria. "The pressmen are meeting," he said. "In the parlance of negotiations, they're up first."
A striking feature writer, Monte Williams, said management tactics -- like the hiring of permanent replacement workers -- had fundamentally undermined the collective bargaining process. She said she was hopeful but somewhat skeptical that the negotiations taking place would be fruitful.
"It could be a management ploy, or it could be a genuine attempt to negotiate," she said. "If it's the latter, great. But taking into account the company's abhorrent actions in the past, I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a ruse so that the company could say -- in court -- that it negotiated in good faith."
If the talks fail, the unions and management would probably meet again in court, with the outcome over issues like severance pay and other closing costs likely to hinge on whether unions and management had tried -- in good faith -- to save the newspaper.
Jim Farber, a pop music critic for the newspaper, said, "We'd love there to be a settlement. Sometimes, I think, it's got to close. But I do have a sense that newspapers are kind of like Jason in 'Friday the 13th' movies. You can stab them, bleed them to death, they just keep coming back."

HEADLINE: Town's Good Reputation Has Become Its Problem

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.

 BODY:
Every day Lynn I. Miller looks through his office window at the Loyal Order of Moose and watches buses from big cities pull up across the street and disgorge drug addicts, alcoholics, people with AIDS and welfare families who need everything.
"You see them getting off the buses and they don't know where to go," said Mr. Miller, administrator of the Moose lodge here, a chapter of the national fraternity. 
 For several years, the word has been out on inner city streets and in rehabilitation clinics in places like Philadelphia and New York that Williamsport is a good place to try to pull one's life together. Sixty people a week sign up for social services, and the recovering newcomers now represent about 10 percent of Williamsport's 33,000 residents. Longtime residents call them "the influx people," "the recovery people" and, when fear looms largest, "walking time bombs."
 
Town Ahead of Others Its Size
 While thousands of rural communities around the nation have also begun to grapple with homelessness, violent drug crimes and the AIDS epidemic, this town tucked in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains in north central Pennsylvania has been battling these typically urban problems for years.
Williamsport first became a recovery center in the early 1970's, when alcoholics and addicts, almost all of them white, moved into the city as part of the final phase of a treatment program conducted by a private organization in nearby Allenwood. The concept was that recovering people living in squeaky clean Williamsport, the birthplace of Little League baseball, would find it easier to stay away from the people, places and activities that they associated with their addictions.
Inevitably, some settled here and established a growing support network, which, in turn, attracted more people who were trying to recover from addictions. Gradually, the population of newcomers began to include many blacks, adding a racial aspect to the growing tension felt by longtime residents.
 
10 Recovery Meetings a Night
 At last count, more than 80 single-family homes had been converted into rooming houses, and every night there are at least 10 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous groups in crowded church basements and other rooms.
The population of recovering people grows as quickly as the names on a chain letter. "It all started with my cousin, a crack addict, who came here in 1987 after he did a rehab program," said Eugene Way, a 40-year-old recovering crack addict who is black and used drugs for 24 years. He comes from West Philadelphia and has nine children by five women.
"Back then we were looking for him to die any day, but he came here and it worked for him," Mr. Way said of his cousin. "It worked for my brother in 1988, it worked for my two nephews in 1989, and that's when I came. Now about 15 of my friends are here, and more are coming and some bring families."
Mr. Way said the people of Williamsport "have good reason to be afraid," but he added that the newcomers "have a good track record; we don't do crime no more and it's part of our N.A. therapy to be totally self-supporting, to do volunteer work and be productive."
Mr. Way said he has organized three neighborhood crime watch programs to help improve community relations. But the former car salesman added that he planned to return to Philadelphia this month, primarily because he had failed to find a well-paying job here. He partly blames the poor economy, but says hostility to newcomers is also a cause.
 
Financial Aid and Cool Greeting
 The extraordinary influx of downtrodden people in Williamsport, near Interstate 80 and about 90 miles north of Harrisburg, follows what by now is an established pattern. The newcomers often arrive fresh from drug and alcohol treatment programs, with little money, ill health and criminal records, according to a Bucknell University study made public last year.
The first thing many do is sign up for general assistance, a state program that provides up to $100 a month for a year to a recovering addict. The Federal Government provides an additional $90 a month worth of food stamps. Mothers with children sign up for Federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
The newcomers get a decidedly cool greeting in this tidy city, whose skyline is dominated by church steeples and whose residents live and breathe Little League baseball and revel each August in the Little League World Series. Nestled at the foot of Bald Eagle Mountain at a bend in the west branch of the Susquehanna River, Williamsport grew in the 1880's through the efforts of logging magnates who spared no gingerbread in building a town filled with Victorian-style architecture.
It is now a struggling city, however, where the largest employers are two hospitals and an aircraft engine factory. The once-fanciful homes appear drawn and gray and the commercial buildings downtown have not been spruced up since the 1950's and 1960's. Yellow ribbons and miniature American flags, festooning trees and store windows, provide the most noticeable splashes of color on a winter day.
Blacks bear the brunt of the city's hostility toward the newcomers, in part because they stand out, Mr. Way said. Williamsport was 99 percent white until about 1985; now the black population is estimated at 5 to 10 percent.
But there is also a racist component, best exemplified by fliers, periodically posted on telephone poles, that advertise meetings of the Ku Klux Klan.
 
Heckling and a Court Fight
 While people are reluctant to speak openly about any hostility in the community, there have been some conflicts.
"I've been heckled by a lot of people at Burough Council meetings and I've gotten threatening mail that they're going to burn us down," said Craig Snyder, director of Stepping Stones Recovery Center in Montoursville, a town adjacent to Williamsport.
In late 1989, Mr. Snyder successfully fought in court to block the city's efforts to zone his seven-year-old halfway house out of business. He said a third of residents of Stepping Stones, where recovering men live while they make a transition back into normal living, are from the Williamsport area.
Public officials and scholars have studied the phenomenon of Williamsport's newcomers but because records for the past decade rarely hold information about how long a person has lived here, these experts have not reached any positive conclusions about the effect of newcomers on social services and crime.
Social services are indeed stretched to the breaking point, said Jenny S. Thorsen, associate director of Lycoming County United Way in Williamsport, but she noted that among the beneficiaries are many native Williamsport people who have lost jobs or homes or need medical assistance.
Residents are worried about crime more than ever, but the crime rate was actually higher in 1979 -- before the greatest wave of newcomers -- than it was last year, said Police Chief William F. Miller. "There is a lot of fear in this community," he said. "Every crime that's committed, everybody wants to blame it on the influx people, but it's not true."
Medical services have undergone the greatest strain. Officials at the 300-bed Williamsport Hospital and Medical Center calculate that the state reimburses the hospital only 18 percent of the cost of caring for indigent patients.
As a result, last year the hospital closed its infectious diseases clinic because it was overwhelmed with 27 new AIDS cases. Three of the patients were local residents and the rest were from places like New York, Newark, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and even San Francisco. For similar reasons, the hospital also closed its family practice clinic and is now considering closing its entire outpatient clinic to new patients.
"We're struggling to survive," said Robert E. Mr. Kane, administrative director of ambulatory care services.
 
One Hospital Takes All
 Because the state's aid does not cover the cost of services, all private doctors in Williamsport have also stopped taking medical assistance patients.
Only one hospital in Williamsport, the 272-bed Divine Providence Hospital, continues to serve anyone, regardless of their ability to pay.
All the local elected officials have said they want to reduce the tide of needy people, but there are sharp divisions on how to do it.
"We've got to crack down on housing codes and zoning to control these people," said Steven M. Confair, a Republican member of Borough Council. "You would evict them, and as far as I'm concerned, they can go back to Philadelphia or New Jersey."
Others, including Mayor Jessie L. Bloom, a Democrat, want to improve social services for local people and others who are serious about recovering and, at the same time, deal firmly and swiftly with anyone who causes trouble. "It's a problem we have to address," she said. "We can't send these people away."

HEADLINE: Saddam's Signal;
Underneath The Theatrics, A First Hint Of Concession

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
STRIP away the conditions, the flowery language and the hoopla surrounding the latest Iraqi peace overture and what you are left with is a core fact: Saddam Hussein flinched.
More than six months after invading Kuwait, and after a month of pounding by an international army, the Iraqi President finally uttered the word "withdrawal." To be sure, he surrounded that concession with a forest of conditions designed as much to disguise his weakness as to probe what sort of payoff he might be able to get for giving back that which he never should have taken. But a concession it was. Nevertheless, it is far too early to pronounce this the beginning of the end of the crisis. It is a new phase, though, in which Saddam Hussein's steely gaze has given way to a certain groping for the exit. 
 It is instructive, at this turning point, to reflect on the reasons for the Iraqi overture, because President Hussein's offer punctured many myths about this conflict and spoke many unintended truths.
The first myth is the one peddled by various Middle East experts that President Hussein believes he can win by losing -- that even if he is driven out of Kuwait in a ground war all he has to do is inflict thousands of casualties on the coalition forces and he will be hailed as a hero at home and in the Arab world for having defied the West.
No one seems to appreciate what nonsense that is more than Mr. Hussein. He knows you don't get to be a hero by elegantly losing. You get to be Gen. George C. Custer or, at best, Gamal Abdel Nasser after the 1967 war, when his stature was radically diminished.
Mr. Hussein seemed to be telling the world last week that he understands that having ruined his country's economy, put its armed forces through a meat grinder and isolated Iraq as an outlaw state, he more than ever needs something to show for it. No one needs to explain to him that one doesn't retire gracefully as the leader of Iraq: there is no Santa Barbara on the Euphrates. The law of the land is rule or die, and unless he brings something back from this war he will indeed be in peril.
The image of Iraq as a battle-hardened warrior state is also largely a myth. For the most part, its eight-year war with Iran took place on battlefields far from Baghdad and other cities. Thanks to Iraqi oil money and Arab gulf aid, life went on normally in Iraq throughout its war with Iran and a new and relatively pampered middle class was even born. Iraq was never an austere North Vietnam, and it has never been asked to withstand the levels of deprivation now being meted out.
This is one way to explain the wish list President Hussein attached to his peace overture -- including a demand that an Iraqi pullout be linked to an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories and a demand that the countries participating in the war against Iraq must "undertake to rebuild what the aggression has destroyed." President Bush dismissed that list as a "cruel hoax," and added for good measure that the Iraqi people should now try to oust Saddam Hussein from power.
Another thing that the Iraqi leader's overture highlights is that the course of battle, and not anything that happens around a negotiating table, will define both this conflict and its aftermath. He clearly made this offer because he is losing the battle on the ground.
The bombing last week of a hardened shelter in Baghdad, in which several hundred Iraqi civilians were hiding unbeknown to the American command, was a tragic event, and one the Iraqis tried to exploit in order to generate sympathy. But it is important to distinguish between how the Iraqi leadership wants the West to think about that tragic bombing and how they themselves probably thought about it. It had to have been a sobering event, or, as one senior Administration official put it: "Don't forget, that was only one of several command bunkers we hit that night. The message to the Iraqi leadership was that 10 feet of concrete didn't protect anyone."
In other words, it probably was not a coincidence that the Iraqi overture, signed by the entire Revolutionary Command Council, came less than 48 hours after that bombing. Just as it was not an accident that the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, finally agreed to withdraw from Beirut in August 1982 only after a wild day of Israeli bombing demonstrated to him that the Israelis were prepared to be as ruthless as he was.
Wars take their grisly toll, and after men finish denouncing their enemies as cruel and cowardly, after they vow revenge before the television cameras, they quietly add up their losses and reconcile themselves with certain realities. It has always been thus. There is not likely to be any charity here, or time-outs. From the start of this conflict the choices for President Hussein were clear: war or the bazaar. President Hussein chose the battlefield and now he wants to go back to the bazaar. But he missed the turn.
That is why the prize for ironic quote of the week goes to the unidentified Iraqi official who said to the Associated Press in Baghdad: "Why is the United States attacking again when we have offered them a way out?" Mr. Bush is not looking for a way out. He is looking for a military victory, because American officials are convinced that only on the basis of a total victory in which Saddam Hussein emerges a clear-cut loser in the eyes of his own people and the region at large will any of their postwar political goals be achievable.
Even the Soviets, who apparently helped elicit the latest Iraqi offer through the visit to Baghdad last week by their envoy Yevgeny M. Primakov, were initially enthusiastic, but after a closer reading, noticeably cooled toward the initiative. That seemed to suggest that until Mr. Hussein comes up with something more concrete -- say a partial withdrawal from Kuwait and then an appeal for some compensation -- he is unlikely to fracture the coalition. The Soviets want to demonstrate some independence, but they won't isolate themselves from their Western financial backers to save Saddam Hussein if he isn't ready to save himself.
It was no accident that the pro-American Arab states, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, were also quick to denounce the Iraqi offer as a sham. They understand that if Mr. Hussein were let off the hook now, he would emerge from this war with part of his army still intact, and seething with revenge. The Arabs still standing with America do so not as some favor to Mr. Bush, but because they know the rules of their world: You take a ride with the tiger, you gamble and bid for power, and there is no mercy for the loser.
Their steadfastness, interestingly, comes after a week in which many analysts were predicting that the tide of Arab public opinion was now turning decisively in favor of Mr. Hussein. Actually, there seemed to be a general bewilderment in the faces of the pro-Iraqi Arabs interviewed on the streets of Amman, or firing their guns in celebration in Baghdad, after the Iraqi peace offer. Was this a triumph they were celebrating, or the familiar ride with a pretender who tempted the fates and was now telling them to dismount?
The image of the Arab world is of a land of romantic hazy dreams, where men don't know how to calculate their own interests and where politics defies the laws of gravity. It is anything but. What Saddam Hussein reminded everyone of last week is that the laws of gravity also apply to him. That is not at all to say that the battle up to now has been easy or that America and its allies will be able to rest easy when it is over, or that power alone can redefine the Middle East. Many troubles lie ahead. It simply means that for everything there is a season and this is the season of war and it will be defined by the logic of war.

HEADLINE: The Region;
Should Suburbia Help Foot the Bill For Connecticut's Urban Poor?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THE thousands of commuters who drive in from the suburbs to the offices of the big banks and insurance companies here don't linger in the desperately poor neighborhoods they must cross to get to work. The thousands of poor people who live here -- more than 22 percent of the city's population is now on welfare -- depend on the property taxes paid by those companies, where few of them are able to find jobs.
While suburban residents and their political representatives have managed to insulate themselves from the problems of the cities, a recession and a statewide budget crisis here and elsewhere in Connecticut are causing some to say that the old relationships may have to be redefined, with the suburbs playing a more supportive role. Last week's proposal by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of a sweeping reorganization of the way Connecticut raises and disperses state funds has local officials bringing new calculations to the dispute. 
 The central argument, articulated by a new generation of aggressive city officials including Raymond Eugene Shipman, the City Manager of Hartford, and Douglas Rae, the Chief Administrative Officer of New Haven, is that such cities can sink into bankruptcy and in turn pull the suburbs down with them.
 
Homelessness and AIDS
 Officials here say that between 100 and 150 people a month, uprooted by layoffs and needing economic assistance, are drifting from across the region into a city already stretched to care for its own and facing a projected shortfall of $50 million in a $440 million budget. Over just the last year, the number of people receiving welfare benefits has grown by an estimated 14 percent.
New Haven, similarly overwhelmed by rising homelessness and the AIDS epidemic, is considering selling bonds to meet day-to-day operating expenses. Bridgeport, the state's largest city, has flirted with bankruptcy. Stamford, whose downtown prospered in the 1980's office construction boom, has found itself overbuilt with real estate prices and property tax collections falling.
Mr. Shipman, who became Hartford's City Manager last September, argues that the suburbs should have to help support the increasing numbers of the poor, and he has proposed a series of changes that have not been well received outside the city line, to say the least.
Mr. Shipman believes, for example, that commuters -- but not residents -- should pay a 1 percent wage tax to City Hall. He has also suggested razing three of the city's oldest public housing projects, which he calls "inhumane warehouses," and relocating the 1,000 families affected into housing scattered around the region.
<> <> The proposal last week by Mr. Weicker to overhaul the state's entire system of raising and spending money adds new elements to the disputes between city and suburb. The plan, which would be based around the creation of a 6 percent income tax on wages and a nearly 50 percent reduction in the 8 percent sales tax, seemed almost designed to drive a further wedge into already uneasy urban-suburban dynamics.
Mr. Weicker, facing a $2.4 billion shortfall in tax revenue, proposed resolving problems with a 16 percent increase in taxes, or about $836 million, and about $1.1 billion in spending cuts; the balance would be raised through borrowing. Some programs affecting local government would be eliminated, while in other areas, existing funds would be distributed differently.
<> <> Some of the biggest cuts, if enacted by the state legislature, would be felt in the cities, including a $50 million reduction in the amount of money available for subsidized housing construction. A program that helps financially strapped families with rent payments would be halved. A $580,000 fund that helps nonprofit housing developers meet expenses would be eliminated.
But the new distribution formulas would hit the suburban towns hardest. New methods of dividing up state education money, for instance, would cut state aid by more than a third in some wealthier towns, and the money would instead go to the cities. For example, Hartford's biggest suburb, West Hartford, would see state aid fall to $7.5 million next year, compared with nearly $11 million this year. Hartford's share would rise to $149 million from $138 million.
 
Pleasing No One
 The proposals appear to please no one. Suburban officials say the cuts in state aid would be devastating, and city officials say the new money will still not be enough.
"We would drown closer to the surface of the water, but we'd still drown," said Mr. Rae in New Haven, which would get a nearly 10 percent increase in state money next year.
Officials in many smaller communities say that while they may not have the scale of problems faced by the cities, their budgets have been just as strained. They need all the resources they can marshal to try and retain local services.
The debate over the Governor's income tax proposal could prove the most divisive factor of all. State lawmakers say that the state's poorer urban areas, all of which have predominantly Democratic delegations to the state legislature, would have the most to gain from an income tax, or the least the lose.
The suburban communities, which are far wealthier and in many areas of the state heavily Republican, are more likely to question whether getting more state money is worth the price of an income tax.
"The wagons are being circled," said Richard D. Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut law school who specializes in state and local tax issues. "I'm afraid it's going to touch off the usual suburb-city, beggar-thy-neighbor policy."
Mr. Pomp agrees with officials like Mr. Shipman and Mr. Rae that the only long-term answer to Connecticut's periodic border wars is some form of regional authority similar to the county governments Connecticut abolished in the 1960's. He said he has little hope that such changes would actually occur.
What has changed, he said, is that Mr. Weicker, in proposing a budget that would increase taxes on the wealthiest residents, has introduced the question of fairness into the debate over the fate of the cities. Even if nobody much likes the short-term results, he said, the basis of the arguments could well shift.
"Maybe Weicker will have the ability to break with the past on this," Mr. Pomp said. "That's a reason for hope."

A New Source of Money for the City, but at What Price?

 BODY:
BALANCING the budget, on time and under sound accounting principles, has been an article of faith in New York City since 1975, when it nearly went bankrupt from borrowing billions to pay for operating expenses.
Now Felix G. Rohatyn, one of the architects of the plan that rescued the city, has suggested that New York may be better off borrowing than making draconian cuts to balance its budget next year. 
 Mr. Rohatyn, a senior partner at the Lazard Freres investment firm, is chairman of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, known as M.A.C. and set up in 1975 to borrow money for the city when it was shut out of the credit markets. He estimates that M.A.C. could realize as much as $400 million a year for the next three years for the city by refinancing bonds and postponing the payment of principal for up to 18 years.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and other critics view Mr. Rohatyn's offer as an invitation to the sort of deficit financing that caused the fiscal crisis in 1975. She said it was "too seductive" and could discourage city officials from making tough fiscal choices.
Following are excerpts from interviews by Josh Barbanel with Mr. Rohatyn and Miss Holtzman.
 
'Just Too Seductive'
Bond Ratings Would be Lowered
 Q. Any homeowner knows that if you borrow against your house to pay today's bills, you could get in trouble in the future. Is the city heading for trouble under your plan?
FELIX ROHATYN: No. When a homeowner gets into difficulties because either he's being laid off or his income is being cut back, he can go to the bank and stretch out his mortgage, stretch out the principal payments. That is a perfectly classical way to finance and has nothing to do with the suggestion of open-ended deficit borrowing for operating expenses.
I don't believe that this is deficit financing, and no business person I know would define this as deficit financing. I also believe that it is consistent with generally accepted accounting principals. It is a method of dealing with a temporary downturn by deferring the pay down of debt that might be too rapid at this point.
Q. Is it possible for Mayor Dinkins to solve the city's problems without any special help or deficit financing?
A. Well, until additional cuts were imposed by the state, I thought they were capable of doing it. But if this economy continues to be weak, then it's questionable whether the city can close its budget gap next year solely with taxes and layoffs without inflicting really dramatic long-term damage to the economic and social structure of the city.
Q. So will the corporation be able to step in and solve the city's problems?
The reason I raised the question of M.A.C. possibly helping would be to deal with what I hope to be a temporary cyclical deficit that will occur over and above the structural deficit as a result of the, hopefully, temporary depression. Even that we couldn't do alone; it would have to be part of an overall city plan.
M.A.C. refundings would benefit the city over a period of two or three years. There could be other temporary measures, wage deferrals by municipal unions, surcharge or other methods of reducing costs or increasing revenues.
But as I said earlier, I don't think any of this is meant to suggest by any way, shape or form that I would in any way support open-ended deficit financing. M.A.C could be an important part of alleviating the cyclical deficit, but cannot in any way play a major, or any kind of a role in dealing with a permanent deficit.
Q. So how much could M.A.C. provide?
A. With the city facing a deficit of perhaps $3 billion to $3.5 billion next year, M.A.C. could do no more than help with 10 or 15 percent of that.
Q. You are an adviser to Governor Cuomo, who recently asked you to stay on as corporation chairman. If your plan gives the city more money, wouldn't that make it easier for the Governor to cut aid to the city?
A. I know people find it hard to believe that there aren't conspiracies, but it isn't the case here. In 15 years as chairman of M.A.C., I have tried to help the city and the state, and if that is defined as conspiring with the Governor or trying to influence the city, I plead guilty.
 
Money From M.A.C.
Just Like Streching A Mortgage
 Q. Mr. Rohatyn has likened the city to a homeowner in deep financial straits who goes to a bank and seeks to stretch out the payment of his mortgage. Do you agree?
ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN: If a homeowner did this, and he wanted to borrow for other things, like keeping a business going or paying for his kids' college education or doctor bills, the banks wouldn't lend him more money. The proposal is premised on a catastrophic scenario for New York City. We are not there yet. I'm not going to say that there are not severe problems. They are severe and they are serious. But that doesn't mean that the budget can't be balanced without resorting to deficit financing.
We have to examine how this could be done without decimating the city. We would have to take greater advantage of attrition, and find more budget relief through productivity improvements. Only 5 percent of the budget closing measures are productivity improvements. We estimate that between $150 million and $200 million could be found through a much tougher attrition program, not replacing people who resign or retire, or leave city employment.
Q. Mr. Rohatyn said that he remains opposed to deficit financing, but is prepared to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the city's operating budget by stretching out the terms of M.A.C. bonds.
A. That is precisely what deficit financing is. Rolling over the deficits from year to year will simply impose additional burdens on New Yorkers for years to come. Let me give you an example. In the fiscal crisis, the city accumulated an operation deficit of $4 billion that was rolled over. Here we are in 1991 still paying roughly $250 million to $300 million a year of interest to pay off the accumulated deficits of 1975 and prior years.
That could, more or less, offset the entire state cut for education, and allow us to avoid layoffs and serious school cuts next year. We are talking about serious adverse consequences to New Yorkers.
Q. Wouldn't the Rohatyn plan be worth it, to avoid severe disruptions in city services?
A. While it may provide some temporary relief, it could have some very serious consequences.
For one thing, it will cause a downgrade of the city's bonds. We have been told and the public has been told that any deficit financing will cause a downgrade of the city's bonds. That will mean that many people, particularly institutional investors, who now buy city bonds will not be able to do so. That will be extremely disruptive, to say the least.
Q. Could the city have trouble selling its bonds?
A. We may have difficulty selling the bonds we need. That could have a drastic impact under the capital budget, on the city's ability to repair schools, bridges and roads. Interest rates will become much higher and the spending on debt service will compete with spending on social programs.
I want to give you an example of how interest on the city's debt aversely affects the city's ability to pay for other necessary services. The interest on the debt is going to increase from $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion in 1992. That means almost half of the budget gap the city has identified in 1992 is due to the increase in debt service. We have been piling more interest on more interest on more interest. Right now, we are having to cut back on other services because of these interest payments.
Q. Would the M.A.C. plan take the pressure off Mayor Dinkins to balance his budget?
A. It just becomes too seductive. I would hope the answer is no, because the adverse consequences of deficit financing are just far too serious. I don't think that we should give up hope that the city administration will balance its budget in a responsible manner.
 There is no reason not to demand of the city that it come up with a credibly balanced budget. We are still five months away from the final adoption of a budget for 1992. There will be plenty of time.

Fallback for the Jobless Has Little to Fall Back On

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BY providing income to jobless people for a temporary period, the unemployment insurance program is designed to be the first line of defense when jobs are cut in a business downturn.
But while the present recession deepens and joblessness rises, there is mounting concern that the unemployment insurance program may not be up to the task. 
 The program is so starved for administrative funds that it cannot be run properly; less than half of those out of work are receiving jobless benefits compared to 75 per cent of those who became unemployed in the mid-1970's; few of those unemployed longer than six months get any benefits and severe cuts have been taken in programs that have shown some success in removing from the unemployment rolls those people who remained jobless for long periods.
"In its totality, unemployment insurance is the weakest it's ever been going into a recession," says Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group.
Under the program, the Federal Government levies a special tax to cover administrative costs, and states set eligibility requirements for workers, determine the level of benefits to be paid and collect taxes to pay for those benefits.
In the week ending Jan. 26, the latest period for which figures are available, more than 3.9 million people received unemployment checks nationwide in a 36 percent jump over the same period in 1990.
The most visible signs of the system's problems are the long lines of impatient people waiting to be served in offices that dispense jobless benefits across the country and the long waiting periods -- in some states as long as seven weeks -- that applicants endure before receiving their first unemployment checks.
The delays are the result of a failure by Congress to allocate enough money to maintain an adequate staff to process claims, even though a Federal trust fund created to run the program is overflowing with money. Instead, the trust has been used to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Last month the Bush Administration announced it was seeking an additional $100 million from Congress for administrative costs. But governors and other critics of the Federal effort say this is only about half the amount that is needed.
Discussing the sharp reduction in the number of people receiving benefits, analysts account for the change in a variety of ways.
During the 1982 recession, a number of states ran out of money to pay unemployment benefits and, faced with borrowing from the Federal Government, many tightened eligibility requirements for the program. As the power of unions has waned, workers have lost an agent that often insured they were aware of unemployment benefits and applied for them. With the population shifting to the West and South, where states provide lower levels of such benefits, more unemployed workers do not even bother to apply.
It is not surprising, some analysts say, that benefits are paid to two-thirds of those people who are out of work in Massachusetts, where payments can run as high as $423 a week, while such benefits are paid to only 17 per cent of the jobless in Virginia, where the maximum is $198 a week.
The biggest cause for the decline appears to be changes made in 1981 in the formula that causes the payment of benefits to extend beyond the 26-week period.
As a result of these changes, these extended benefits are currently available in only two states, Alaska and Rhode Island.
In contrast, these benefits were available in all 50 states during the 1975 recession.
The Department of Labor predicts that another eight states will be paying extended benefits before the recession ends.
In addition to scaling back the unemployment insurance system during the 1980's, the Administration and the Congress sharply cut back its companion, the employment service program, which is intended to help laid-off workers find jobs.
Because of cutbacks in Federal financing, the employment service staff has been reduced from 30,000 in 1981 to about 17,000 today.
Yet, a recent study by the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Reasearch, a private research foundation, found that those out of work for more than 20 weeks and who used the employment service found jobs an average of six weeks faster than a similar group that did not use the agency.
"These days when you want activities that are budget-neutral, our evidence suggests that if you give more money to the employment service, you could save so much in employment insurance benefits that the program would pay for itself," said Louis Jacobson, a senior economist at Upjohn who conducted the study.
 
A Legacy of Anti-Tax Mood
 But if the tax-cutting mood of the 1980's prompted a scaling back ofboth the employment service and the unemployment insurance program, that same anti-tax sentiment is also preventing a consensus on how to fix some of the system's problems.
For example, many governors feel the lack of extended benefits, whose costs are shared by the Federal and state governments, produces hardships for many of those who remain unemployed for a long period.
But a concern over the fiscal and political repercussions of seeking tax increases to help pay for these benefits has kept many governors from pushing for them.
"If we make it so that extended benefits trigger on easier, there are some states that will have to raise taxes," said Raymod C. Scheppach, executive director of that National Governors' Association.
"Politically that's very difficult."

Why America Still Hates the Words 'Energy Policy'

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
SINCE the election of Ronald Reagan, the nation has approached energy policy in the same ambivalent way it has approached sex education: some people think it is indispensable; others think it is none of the government's business. A silent majority appears to grudgingly agree that something is needed. But in Washington the attitude often seems to be, Do we really have to talk about it in public?
One of the most surprising things about the war in the Persian Gulf, and the third oil crisis in less than 20 years, is how little it has done to shake this complacency. As Brooks B. Yeager, a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, put it, oil policy and the oilfield war are "eerily disengaged from each other." 
 Last week the Bush Administration's draft energy strategy leaked out, perhaps as a trial balloon, and experts in the field found it more remarkable for what it does not say than for what it does.
The plan could still change before it goes to Congress, which will probably happen this week. But in its preliminary form the draft evokes the Reagan years. The emphasis is not on conservation but on the supply side, with calls for pumping oil in areas previously off limits for environmental reasons and for deregulating pipeline operators and electricity producers.
Electricity, in fact, is heavily stressed, with a continued Federal commitment to nuclear power. But electric companies do not use much oil, and besides, said Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, they use the thick, heavy stuff that no one else wants. "That oil, even if it's displaced, is not going to power your automobile," she said.
Mr. Bush's plan would make it easier to build natural gas pipelines, but at present, gas is in surplus. He would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, but that, say the experts, would only delay the decline of American oil production, not stop it.
 
Playing the Market
 Energy policy, to the extent that it exists at all, is still driven by what Peter C. Beutel, an oil analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., calls a Republican mantra: "The Market Is Our Policy."
But Adam Smith's invisible hand has increased dependence on imports by choking domestic production. In the late 1980's domestic production declined sharply as an OPEC price war made Texas and Oklahoma wells uneconomical. At the same time, demand kept rising. Imports made up 31 percent of demand in 1985; now they make up nearly half.
A year ago the Department of Energy seemed poised to propose steps to modernize everything in America that uses energy, to do the same work with less. Adm. James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, said last summer that the one area in which consensus existed was for higher efficiency. But the draft of the Bush plan includes very few of those options.
In a way, Mr. Bush has replaced energy policy with foreign policy; the problem of expensive oil went away when the bombers went in. Some people favor a more direct approach to oil, however. Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, complained that an energy policy should not have to rely on "fragile coalitions and the prosecution of a war."
 The war could conceivably push Congress into demanding more from the Administration. Congress has 80 energy bills waiting, some paralleling Mr. Bush's plan. Congress may also try a new windfall-profits tax, although it seems unlikely any oil company would earn enough to pay it in 1991. Higher on Congress' agenda is raising the efficiency standards for automobiles, which were introduced after the first oil shock in 1973 but are now at a plateau of 27.5 miles per gallon. A proposal by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, which passed the Senate last year but not the House, would raise the standard to about 40 miles per gallon in the coming decade. Congress seems inclined to approve some sort of increase.
But paradoxically enough, the war with Iraq, having insured at least for now a steady supply of oil, might contribute to the national complacency. Since the bombing started, the price of gasoline, the barometer of public mood, is back down. The American Automobile Association said on Feb. 12 that the nationwide average price of a gallon of regular gasoline at a self-serve pump was $1.164, down 1.9 cents for the week and 20.7 cents since the peak on Dec. 18. Subtracting for inflation and recent tax increases, the price is near a record low.
Crude oil users may also feel lulled again. At this time last year, West Texas intermediate crude was selling for more than $22 a barrel; on Friday it closed at $20.88.
With an allied success in the gulf, the complacency could become even more ingrained. But the United States would still be confronted with the impediments it has always faced in energy policy.
Perhaps chief among these is the schizoid role of oil in this country. Around the world a power struggle rages between consumers and producers, but as J. Robinson West, of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm, pointed out, this country has both consumers and producers. A tax that a consuming nation might impose on itself to hold down demand would be opposed here by producers because it would damage their market. A tax to stimulate production would be opposed by consumers, who can buy oil more cheaply from abroad.
<> <> Joseph Stanislaw, an energy expert who works in Paris for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said that France had an easier time developing an energy policy, cutting its oil dependence sharply along with its ratio of energy use to economic production, because there is not much in the way of an energy production industry to complicate the argument. "They have no natural resources with which they can deceive themselves," he said. Furthermore, the American system of government is federal, not central. The French, said Mr. Stanislaw, are "used to more authoritarian control and centralized government."
 
A Thousand Axes
 In the United States, "energy policy" is sometimes a rubric for a thousand axes to grind and oxen to gore. "It is hard to differentiate what is being done because it makes sense and what is being done because the policy helps someone," said Michael C. Lynch, senior research associate at the Washington International Energy Group, a consulting firm. For example, many people think ethanol is the ideal substitute for foreign oil, he said, but most of them make the corn from which the ethanol would be produced.
And many of the tools that would be needed for a policy "have either been specifically rejected or are unavailable," said James R. Schlesinger, who served as Secretary of Energy from 1977 to 1979. Further tax subsidies to drillers are nearly impossible at a time of huge deficits, he said, and taxes to dampen consumption are out of the question "partly because of the budget stalemate, and partly because of the President's renewed pledge with regard to no more taxes."
Internal squabbling does not help, either. Oil companies bad-mouth natural gas, a potential competitor, saying that it has a history of shortages and price volatility. Natural gas producers complain about coal, which is too dirty, they say. Coal producers, with supplies so abundant and technology so advanced that big price swings are difficult to imagine, speak derisively of price and supply volatility in both oil and gas. And the nuclear industry is off in its own corner, haughty and despised.
In the midst of all this, Americans may not know how to get it, but they know what they want. "Americans see cheap, abundant, reliable energy as a biblical and constitutional entitlement," said Paul Hilliard, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. "If you're born in America and you don't have cheap energy available at any time, day or night, then somebody is beating up on you, and the government ought to fix it."

War and Recession Speed Up the Airlines' Flights to Oblivion

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
FOR America's airlines, the friendly skies are a distant memory. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, the jump in jet fuel prices, economic recession and fears of terrorism have added to the industry's angst. United States carriers lost $2 billion in the last quarter of 1990, and analysts expect them to lose another $1.5 billion or so in the first three months of this year. More than 25,000 airline workers have lost their jobs. Eastern Airlines finally folded last month, and others are clearly on the endangered list.
"The airline industry isn't in a recession," said John Meyer, an economics professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. "It's a depression." 
 The industry's current problems are accelerating the Darwinian process of sorting out winners from losers in a deregulated environment. At stake is the future shape of the airline industry in the United States and the level of competition that will remain to benefit travelers by maintaining service and restraining prices.
Clearly, the winnowing process is already well advanced. Many of the newcomers spawned by the Carter Administration's deregulation, like People Express and Air Florida, are long gone, and several established carriers are in dire straits. Among them are Pan Am and Continental, both temporarily shielded by the bankruptcy code.
But today, the industry and the Government are confronting a series of critical issues: How much further, how rapidly and under what conditions should the industry's consolidation continue? Should foreign airlines be allowed to buy control of weaker American carriers to keep them flying and thus foster domestic competition? How can competition be increased at airports where single carriers are dominant?
To address these matters, the House aviation subcommittee held hearings in early February. Last week, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner huddled with about a dozen airline experts, mainly consultants and academics, to discuss the industry's problems and its future.
The worry is that the number of big national airlines in the United States could be reduced to as few as three -- United, American and Delta -- surrounded by a handful of regional carriers like Southwest and Alaska Airlines. And the airlines in the middle -- like Pan Am, T.W.A., Continental and USAir -- could be squeezed out, threatening the benefits of competition that deregulation was intended to encourage.
The latest signs of industry consolidation and the Government's concerns about the loss of competition came last week. USAir announced Monday that it was laying off 3,585 workers as a means of reducing costs to try to survive the current slump. And on Friday, the Justice Department succeeded in blocking the purchase by United of Eastern's takeoff and landing slots at Washington's National Airport. The Justice Department contended that the purchase by United would violate antitrust laws because it would give United too dominant a presence in the Washington area. Instead, a Federal bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the Eastern assets to Northwest.
The policy debate under way, for the most part, is not about re-regulating the airlines. There have been drawbacks to deregulation, including the sharp climb in fares on less-traveled routes, especially flights of less than 500 miles, and the end of service to some rural communities. But analysts agree the drawbacks are far outweighed by the benefits of increased service and lower fares (one study said they were down 17 percent, adjusted for inflation, nationwide).
So the current debate centers on how to maintain and expand competition. In today's market there are considerable advantages for the biggest airlines.United and American have computerized reservation systems in travel agencies that feed them travelers; they have globe-girdling frequent-flyer programs, and they control a huge number of takeoff and landing slots.
Yet the possibility of reducing the number of national carriers to three or four is a matter of concern even for the champions of deregulation. "Some further consolidation is inevitable and healthy," said Dan Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House, a consulting firm in Boston. "Having three carriers compete in one market is fine. But if you have the same three in all markets around the country, there is a risk they will not compete as vigorously as they should and that you lose the benefits of deregulation."
One answer is to allow foreigners to buy America's struggling middle-sized airlines. Under current law, foreigners cannot control more than 25 percent of the voting stock of an American airline. (In January, Mr. Skinner ruled that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines could buy a stake of up to 49 percent in Northwest, but only 25 percent of the voting shares.)
Many airline experts contend that it is time to change the law to permit up to 100 percent ownership of United States airlines by foreign buyers. The proposal has some support in Congress, but it will be controversial. Proponents of allowing foreign control say that two conditions should be attached: the buyer should not be state-owned, and the foreign airline's home market should be as open to American airlines as the American air travel market is to them. The most likely overseas buyers: British Airways, Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways.
"We'd surely wind up with more, stronger airlines in America if we opened up to foreign investment," said Thomas Gale Moore, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
The big American carriers are just as eager to break into lucrative air travel markets abroad as the foreigners are to buy into the United States market. Indeed, the Transportation Department's rejection last week of a plan by British Airways to slice fares by one-third on some trans-Atlantic routes was an effort to pressure the British Government into approving the sale of routes to London's Heathrow airport by Pan Am and T.W.A. to United and American, respectively.
Another method of encouraging competition is to deal with the aspects of air travel that are untouched by the deregulation of fares and routes -- airlines' access to airports. Because no airports have been built since 1976, the established carriers have been able to negotiate long-term leases at airports. And when an airline is the dominant carrier at an airport, it can keep rivals out. One study found that airlines charge higher fares and take in 27 percent more revenue at airports where they dominate traffic than where there is effective competition.
It is an airport-by-airport issue, and it is not only the big three carriers that hold dominant status: in Minneapolis, Northwest is the big airline; in St. Louis, it is T.W.A. To increase access to airports, experts recommend privatizing airports and auctioning landing slots.
"We should deregulate the airline industry entirely to insure the benefits of competition, not leave some anti-competitive protections in place," said Joel Bleeke, a director of McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm. "The danger lies in partially deregulating an industry. That was the real lesson we learned from the savings and loan debacle."

HEADLINE: Horse Racing;
Tracks Working To Lure Crowds

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
You can get more than a $2 bet if you go to the race track these days. You can get a concert, a picnic, a short "horse course," a long lecture, an umbrella, a T-shirt, a chance to pet a pony, a chance to meet a jockey, breakfast at Belmont, breakfast at Santa Anita, free admission sometimes at Gulfstream Park, a family fair, a playground for the kids and a briefing on how to place the bet you might not have placed if you had stayed home.
At Aqueduct this holiday weekend, you can even get a chance to pick the jockey who will win the most money and, in a manner of speaking, to take home a piece of his purse. 
 Horse racing is unveiling all these capers because it is beset by new threats. Its grip on the public fancy and fortune is being pierced by offtrack betting, television betting, satellite betting, commingling betting, casino betting, state lotteries and many other forms of betting that do not require anybody to drive to the race track and watch a horse.
So the push is on: bring the people back to the horse.
 
Fighting to Survive?
 "It's do-or-die," said Alan Balch, whose company directs all marketing and promoting for Santa Anita in California. "We have to keep developing fans, or there won't be any. We have to develop their interest in coming to the race track, or we'll lose them to betting away from the track. And we can't count on people stumbling in."
"We've got to get people back to the track," said Joe Tanenbaum, the director of communications at Gulfstream Park in Florida. "We're trying to establish a racing presence."
"There aren't enough heroes in the sport," said Richard P. Brown, the vice president for marketing of the New York Racing Association. "Racing has to introduce more people to the sport, and to educate them. Racing has no choice. It's got to face the competition."
Brown personifies the urgency of the problem. He was signed by New York's race tracks June 29 after a career in advertising, and he is now their main strategist in the struggle to find and keep racing fans.
 
Betting on Jockeys
 One of New York's lures is the Aqueduct Jockey Jackpot Challenge, which appeals directly to people's purses. They more or less bet on the jockey, not the horse.
"We started it a couple of weeks ago," Brown said. "Seven weekend days, ending on this holiday weekend. You get a ballot with 10 jockeys listed, and you vote for one or write in somebody. Every time he wins a race, that's 10 points; second place, 5 points, and so on. At the end of the day, all the people who picked the leading jockey share in his earnings.
"Well, let's say his horses win $60,000. The jockey's share is usually 10 percent of the purse. So, he earns $6,000 that day. But we set a minimum of $7,000, so all the people who picked that jockey share in the $7,000.
"The first weekend we tried it, attendance was up by 1,600 over the year before. The next weekend, 1,800. And remember, attendance has been down by about 13 percent this winter because of the recession and the war in the Middle East."
Brown acknowledged that spot promotions might be only tactical, and said:
"Racing has to introduce more people to the sport, but it also has to educate them to know the sport. That's why we have the newcomers' guide and the horse course and things like that. But we have to research this and find out what the public really wants."
In New Jersey, the public wanted Sunday afternoon racing and approved it in a referendum in November. When the Meadowlands held its first Sunday program two weeks ago, with long-sleeved T-shirts as gifts and strolling musicians, children with parents were admitted free and the attendance nearly doubled to 20,103.
"The main thing," said Balch of Santa Anita, "is to show people the racing environment isn't threatening. Attendance reached a peak of 33,000 a day in 1984. Now, it's down to 22,000. That's a steady decline, and it started when the state lottery began in '85. The next blow, we delivered ourselves: satellite wagering. Now, you can get nonstop action without ever coming to the track."
To counterattack, Santa Anita began serving breakfast at the finish line (as Belmont and Saratoga and other tracks have also done). It gave gifts. It staged jockeys' volleyball matches. It set up a playground in the infield for children, and theme parties for their families.
"We've had 5,000 people in the infield for the Family Fair," Balch said. "Pony rides, clowns, theme parties for St. Patrick's Day and Halloween and other holidays. And the kids' playground goes back 50 years. Very elaborate. Kids tend to grow up here. We're starting clubs, and field trips for schools."
 
Coaxing the Cautious
 He paused, and said: "But the first time you say 'race track' to a school administrator, he says, 'Now, wait a minute.' It takes time."
Gulfstream Park in Florida staged a Family Day last Sunday, and counted 1,800 children. They met a jockey, a trainer and a horse, and cavorted in the petting zoo near the paddock.
"The children may not come back as customers," Tanenbaum said. "But we're establishing a racing presence in the home. We've given caps, tote bags, umbrellas, lots of things. As a result, people came to the track who weren't hard-core."
"Did they come back?" he asked, getting to the bottom line. "We don't know. But that's the idea."

3 Big Companies Quit Career Fair Over War Protest

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
After being notified of possible anti-war protests on campus, two major manufacturers of defense equipment - the Raytheon Corporation and Pratt & Whitney - decided not to attend the annual career fair at the University of Massachusetts last week. And representatives from Exxon, who arrived Tuesday night, left the fair before noon the next day after having learned that demonstrations were taking place.
 A spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation, would not say whether the protest influenced the decision but said "many factors," including current economic problems and the tight job market, were considered. 
 Representatives of Raytheon, which manufactures the Patriot antiaircraft missile, could not be reached for comment.
 A spokesman for Exxon, Les Rogers, said, "It wasn't the nature of the demonstration, it was the fact that there was going to be a demonstration and the company didn't want to expose its recruiters to any harm." The protest did not affect the company's efforts, he added, because recruiters began getting in touch with students in September.
 
'An Open Campus'

 Joan M. Stoia, director of the university's Mather Career Center, said she called company representatives last week after learning of plans by anti-war groups on campus to protest their participation in the fair.
 "This is really a new thing and we felt we should let them know," she said. "We have no objection to students protesting. This is an open campus."
 About 15 protestors held placards and distributed anti-war literature outside as the fair continued on Wednesday in the campus center auditorium. Raytheon and Pratt & Whitney were scheduled to interview more than 40 students, Ms. Stoia said.
 Ms. Stoia said she told company representatives about the protest "as a courtesy." She said Pratt & Whitney executives said they would hold their interviews at their offices in East Hartford, Conn., and Raytheon representatives said they would review resumes.
 "We had no intention of stopping recruitment sessions," said the spokesman for the protesting group, Marc Kenen, a graduate student in education from Belchertown, Mass. "We wish they did come. It would've given people a chance to ask them questions about the issues we're raising."
 Representatives from about 50 companies attended the fair to speak with students and accept resumes.
 
'They Overreacted'

 Student reaction was divided over the protests.
 Stephen Robbins, a senior engineering major from Amherst, said he was disappointed that the companies withdrew and he supported the students' right to protest.
 "They overreacted," he said of the companies. "For them it was probably a choice to go with what was easier" by interviewing at home.
 Carla Ranhand, a junior communications major from Rockville, MD, said the protest made sense.
 "I think they had a right to protest, just the way our campus is so divided over the war and how people feel about it," she said.
 But Kimberly Broderick, a graduate student in linguistics from New York City, said the protest was unfair to students seeking jobs with those companies.
 "You should have the right to be recruited by them and to see them on your campus rather than having to travel," she said.

HEADLINE: Why Punish Reservists' Families?

 BODY:
Operation Desert Sword has exposed an embarrassingly outdated support system for families of reservists and National Guard members suddenly called to active duty. There is hardship enough in sending them off to war, perhaps never to return. To add financial distress is inexcusable.
Federal laws do provide substantial protection. (Some state laws provide more.) They guarantee re-employment when the war is over. Pay for enlisted men in a combat zone is tax-exempt, and partially so for officers. Military health benefits cover all dependents. Interest rates on mortgages and credit-card and personal loans are capped at 6 percent for the duration of service. 
 But this safety net has many holes. Reservists' families don't get dental care under the military health plan. Students called to active duty are dunned for repayment of student loans if they don't notify the lender in time. Discharged servicemen are eligible for 13 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits; civilians get 26 weeks. And service families are protected against eviction only if their rent is less than $150 a month. Congress is about to raise it to $1,200, but its failure to act sooner shows gross neglect.
Representative G. V. Montgomery of Mississippi, chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, has taken the lead in rectification. His bill would, among other things, upgrade unemployment benefits, defer repayment of student loans when students leave for military duty and generally improve veterans' benefits.
One worthy provision would revise military life insurance, linking benefits to age instead of rank. But, like the unemployment insurance proposal, this one is headed for the budget buzz saw. The budget law puts no ceiling on Persian Gulf war spending, but any new legislation that applies to all servicemen -- not just to those in Operation Desert Sword -- may be counted in the Pentagon's regular budget, and the cost would have to be offset by other cuts. Hopefully, such strictures won't block humane reform.
 Representative Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, raises the most difficult question of all: How do families cope when their income is suddenly cut to military pay? He wants the Government to make up the difference, up to $40,000.
That may seem generous, but high-earners, with bigger homes and bills, often have bigger money problems when they are called up. The Sanders plan for reservists sounds fair, and would cost only $11.4 million a month, but it has one glaring flaw. It would shortchange full-timers on regular military pay, and there is no equitable way to even out the difference.
Large companies commonly make up their employees' wage and salary losses, and some provide family counseling too. Smaller firms often can't afford to do anything. Senator Edward Kennedy proposes $50 million for counseling and child care. Meanwhile, private and nonprofit organizations like the Red Cross are offering assistance. In New York City, Consumer Advocates, a fuel cooperative, has arranged with local oil companies to supply heating oil free or at a discount to families who have lost income.
Even so, some reservists' families are forced onto welfare -- a scandalous humiliation for the wives and children of men risking their lives in service. The reserves and National Guard are essential to the gulf war, and their importance will grow in the post-cold-war years. Their personal concerns deserve better than they have gotten so far.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Missing Agenda: Poverty and Policy" (front page, Jan. 27-29) highlights the national agenda, but omits the important effort of the community health centers that were started, along with Head Start, in the first poverty program of 1965. 
 Twenty-five years later, 600 community and migrant health centers at 2,000 clinic sites are providing primary health care to six million people. That the poor get sicker and the sick get poorer remains true. This program, which has reduced mortality and morbidity, should be expanded for the more than 30 million uninsured Americans.
The George Bush-Jack Kemp strategy of entrepreneurial capitalism and empowerment will simply not work if a person is disabled by sickness.

HEADLINE: GULF WAR SETS OFF CRISIS FOR GERMANS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 14

 BODY:
War in the Persian Gulf has thrown Germany into a crisis of confidence and direction.
Only a short time ago, buoyed by the euphoria of unification, Germans considered themselves to be, in the words of Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin, "the happiest people on earth." Today, deeply uncertain of what role they should play in the gulf and in future world conflicts, they find themselves searching for a political identity.
In Washington, London, Paris and other allied capitals, there has been much grumbling in recent weeks over Germany's perceived reluctance to help the anti-Iraq coalition. German leaders have been assailed as self-absorbed, niggardly, and ungrateful for four decades of Western support. 
 When Chancellor Helmut Kohl pledged a $5.5 billion contribution to the allied war effort at the end of January, some coalition leaders felt that the pledge had been given grudgingly and late.
 
Anti-Militarist Lessons

"Whatever you get out of them, you really have to squeeze it out," said a pro-American diplomat based in Bonn.
Since the end of World War II, Germans have had the principles of pacifism relentlessly drilled into them. Schoolteachers and schoolbooks have emphasized the absolute supremacy of the rule of law, the unacceptability of war, and the need for Germany to become a thoroughly anti-militarist nation. Many people here have evidentally learned those lessons well.
Antiwar demonstrations are held every day in German cities. Several leading politicians have urged the United States to call a halt to its campaign against Iraq. And in January alone, more than 7,000 German Army reservists applied for conscientous-objector status to avoid possible service in the Middle East. That is more than applied during all of last year.
Chancellor Kohl has taken pains to point out that the 18 German planes sent to defend Turkey from possible attack do not carry enough fuel to allow them to fly into Iraqi airspace. He has refused to pledge explicitly that the planes would be sent into action if Iraqi jets attack Turkey.
 
Cynicism on War Motivations

The harsh criticism that Germany has received has puzzled many of its political leaders.
"When Germany was united in 1990, there were many fears that we would one day become a militaristic power," President Richard von Weizsacker said in a recent speech. "Now, at the beginning of 1991, Germans are being criticized for not wanting to take part in a war."
Many Germans are instinctively skeptical when they hear that a particular war is being fought for a just cause. They remember that their country was led to catastrophe twice in this century by leaders using that argument. Even some members of the Parliament in Bonn say they are fully persuaded that there can be no such thing as a just war.
Cynicism over the true intentions of governments has been fed here by the ever-widening scandal of Germany's arms exports to Iraq. Hardly a day passes without another appaling revelation about one German company or another.
 
Arms Sales to Iraq
 The current issue of the magazine Stern reports that in 1980 and 1981, a consortium of at least nine German concerns headed by the engineering and construction giant Thyssen Rheinstahl Klauseln built a plant south of Baghdad at which poison gas and biological weapons were developed. Thyssen reportedly won the $1 billion contract after pledging in writing that its corporate policy was to "boycott Israel economically and have no relations with Israel."
Another magazine, Der Spiegel, reported in this week's editions that a Cologne-based construction company called Strabag has sent about 70 shipments of equipment to Iraq since August, when the United Nations declared a trade embargo against the Government of Saddam Hussein. The shipments were said to have included tools, spare parts, chemicals for purifying water and even 500 gas masks.
Revelations like those feed the widespread belief here that all wars, and particularly the one being waged against Iraq, are fought for the benefit of small political and industrial cliques. That sentiment, though far from unanimous, has permeated the political process.
Chancellor Kohl has said that when the gulf war is over, he will seek to amend the German Constitution, which now strictly limits the circumstances under which German troops can be sent into combat. But he has not said what kind of amendment he will propose, and his political adversaries say they will resist all such efforts.
Last week, the Kohl Government issued a new declaration tightening control over arms exports, but it fell far short of what critics have been demanding. Mr. Kohl and his senior advisers have refused to support proposals that would ban German arms exports to countries outside the NATO alliance.
The debate over whether Germany should take a more politically active role in the world, and perhaps even a militarily active one, is muffled for the moment because few politicians want to be seen as bickering while a war is underway.
But commentators forsee a period of reflection and self-criticism here once the conflict is over.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Peter Sellars Digs Up 'The Cabinet'

BYLINE: By KARRIE JACOBS; Karrie Jacobs, who writes frequently on design in the arts, is writer-at-large at Metropolis magazine.

 BODY:
What has he done now? The enfant terrible, the precocious one, the spiky-haired iconoclast: What has he done?
Most articles about the director Peter Sellars begin this way. Perhaps those aren't the exact words, but the question is always implied: What has this brat pack of one done? Which of Western civilization's most sacred cultural monuments has he desecrated this time? 
 In a roller-coaster ride of a career that began while he was still a student at Harvard University in the late 70's, in which he was made director of the Boston Shakespeare Company at age 25 and the American National Theater at the Kennedy Center in Washington at 26, Mr. Sellars achieved notoriety for, as Arthur Koestler would put it, intersecting matrixes. His favorite conceit has been to uproot classical operas and transplant them to contemporary settings. He staged "The Marriage of Figaro" in Trump Tower and "Don Giovanni" in Harlem. In doing so, he found a way to attract an audience to Mozart for whom opera previously had begun and ended with "Einstein on the Beach."
"That was my 20's," says Mr. Sellars, who is now 33. He thinks that his last season of Mozart will be this summer at Glyndebourne, in Britain, where he is planning a production of "The Magic Flute" set in 1990's Los Angeles.
So what has he done this time?
Mr. Sellars has written and directed a movie, a silent movie, very loosely based on the 1919 German Expressionist landmark film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." With the backing of an independent producer from Munich, Rainer Mockert (the producer of the television versions of Mr. Sellars's Mozart operas recently broadcast on PBS's Great Performances series), Mr. Sellars has been shooting a low-budget ($3.5 million) production scheduled to be screened this summer at Cannes.
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is best remembered for how it looks; its set was a painting in three dimensions, at times compressed to seem like two, a vivid depiction of a madman's world view. In it, the arrival of a carnival act consisting of a doctor and his somnambulist is followed by a series of murders.
"The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez" is not a remake; it isn't faithful to the plot of the original, but rather to its spirit. At the heart of this movie project is one strong, lucid idea: that the ghastly disconcerting setting of the original movie -- a world of fearful contrasts between darkness and light, a world where all the angles are wrong -- is not so different from present-day New York City.
For five weeks in November and December, Mr. Sellars and crew shot on location around lower Manhattan, New Jersey and Westchester County. Mostly the movie was filmed in the vicinity of Wall Street.
The plot concerns Matt (played by Peter Gallagher) and Cathy (Joan Cusack), two young, successful stockbrokers whose personal and professional lives are, along with the economy, crumbling. They have a series of increasingly bizarre encounters with Dr. Ramirez (Ron Vawter) and Cesar the somnambulist (Mikhail Baryshnikov), who, in Mr. Sellars's story, are not a mad carnival sideshow operator and his homicidal performer, but a pair of disheveled street people. Ruth Male czech, best known for her work with the experimental theater group Mabou Mines, plays Cathy's mother, and Michael Kirby, who plays Cathy's father, is one of half a dozen members of the Wooster Group (another innovative troupe) who appear in the film. The score consists of two pieces, "Harmonielehre" and "Harmonium," by John Adams, who composed the music for Mr. Sellars's "Nixon in China" and his new opera, "Kling hoffer." The music is sometimes insistent and rhythmic, at other times melancholy.
As in the original "Caligari," directed by Robert Wiene, madness is the theme of "Dr. Ramirez." "Nothing in New York is more maddening than the way things are," observes George Tsypin, the film's set designer.
 Mr. Tsypin has collaborated with Mr. Sellars regularly since they staged "The Count of Monte Cristo" at the National Theater in 1985. Currently, Mr. Tsypin is designing the set for "Klinghoffer," which Mr. Sellars will bring to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in September and which was inspired by the hijacking of the Achille Lauro. Mr. Tsypin has also created the sets for JoAnne Akalaitis's production of "Henry IV," currently in previews at the Public Theater.
Trained as an architect in Moscow, the designer immigrated to this country 10 years ago. For him, the everyday features of New York City are both visually compelling and possess an almost talismanic quality. The look of "Ramirez" is the product of Mr. Tsypin's fascination with the New York vernacular (also a recurrent theme in Mr. Sellars's screenplay) and a desire to depict a specific variety of urban hell -- that of the white collar. Mr. Sellars wrote his original screenplay two years ago in response to the stock market crash of 1987. "What was so eerie," Mr. Sellars says, "was to get there and find all these empty offices."
When shooting for the movie began in the financial district, desolation was indeed what they found. In one office building they used, Mr. Tsypin recalls, "there were huge empty floors and everything was in place," including office equipment.
 Much of the set design for "Ramirez" was actually "anti-design," according to the designer. It was a matter of using what New York has to offer. The narrow streets of the financial district, as he points out, are full of the weird angles and odd perspectives for which "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" was famous. And the contrast between the tidy 9-to-5 environment inside the office buildings and the disorderly world of the homeless, who, after office hours, huddle on the buildings' heating vents, became the film's leitmotif.
The most important thing Mr. Tsypin had to do was come up with a way to reveal the inner world of the characters, which, in another movie, could have been conveyed through dialogue.
"Every place becomes this trap," he says. "Not only are they trapped spatially, they're trapped in color. Every location has its own color which is completely overwhelming." The loft where Cathy lives, for instance, is entirely painted a deep shade of blue. "Like van Gogh colors, really vibrant, but mad and suffocating."
On Beaver Street near Bowling Green, is a loft in which the walls have been painted gold. This is, in fact, the loft where Mr. Sellars once lived, that he subsequently sublet to members of the Squat Theater, and then to a series of Chinese exchange students. It is now Dr. Ramirez's loft. The rich, shimmering shade of gold was Mr. Tsypin's doing. The garbage all over the floor -- root beer cans, crumpled newspaper -- was, it seems, left behind by the exchange students.
It is the final week of shooting. While the cast and crew finish lunch, Mr. Sellars stands amid the wreckage of his former home (he now lives in Southern California), his arms folded tightly across his chest. He is rewriting. In theory, "Ramirez" does have a script. But every day, in response to the qualities of the location, in response to mood, Mr. Sellars changes everything.
"Of course it throws everybody off," Mr. Tsypin allows. "It creates unbelievable tension."
By the time the cast returns, Mr. Sellars knows what he wants. First, he shoots a scene with Mr. Gallagher. Matt, the confused stockbroker, his tie perpetually askew, has a lot in common with the philandering husband the actor played in "Sex, Lies and Videotape." Mr. Sellars, behind the camera, instructs Mr. Gallagher -- who is spying on Ramirez -- about how to creep along a wall: "Don't be so much on the floor of this room," he suggests. "Be thinking about the next room."
 The director moves fast. He shoots maybe two takes. Three at the most. He believes that he will wind up using the first take in most cases because he gets the most genuine reactions from the performers the first time around.
Then Mr. Baryshnikov does a scene. He is made up as a derelict, his face dirty and bruised, his hair dyed dark and matted. He is dressed in a blue sweatsuit and he is barefoot. No one should have to walk barefoot on a floor like this. Especially not Mikhail Baryshnikov.
"Slow. Beautiful." Mr. Sellars alternates instruction and praise as the dancer creeps along the wall. "Slow. Beautiful," he repeats.
"What happened is once we started to work, things took their own course," says Mr. Sellars. "What's interesting is to get something to grow really organically, in film terms, that has nothing to do with the written word."
The script was really a list of visual ideas, ways of illustrating the awfulness that Mr. Sellars sees in Wall Street life. If the script is expendable, and there is no dialogue, is there a plot? And if there is a plot, will anyone be able to follow it?
"I'm not terribly interested in that, by and large," Mr. Sellars says. "I mean, sure, I think there's a plot. What's surprising is that a plot emerged from all this. But, you know, obviously we're frying bigger fish."
Which fish?
"What it's like to live now."
The last day of shooting is clear and cold. The location is the Brooklyn Bridge. One lane is partly blocked to accommodate the camera truck and equipment. The scene being shot is of Cesar carrying Cathy along the narrow catwalk that runs directly beneath the wooden pedestrian walkway in the center of the bridge. The most dramatic event of the day's filming involves throwing several dummies, doubles for Cathy, off the bridge. All of this was in the script. Then Mr. Sellars decided to do a scene that wasn't.
"I just realized when we were on the bridge that the point of the movie had nothing to do with the bridge, and I wanted to get off the bridge very quickly," he says.
In late afternoon, shortly before sunset, the crew sets up at the edge of the East River, on the Manhattan side, just north of the South Street Seaport. The shore is covered with debris including four or five cars, some half-submerged, others upside down as if they had been driven straight off the F.D.R. Drive, which looms overhead.
Mr. Sellars begins to set up a shot in which Cesar finds Cathy's body, and is joined by Matt. The two sit on some rocks, looking strangely companionable and sad.
The sun is disappearing and the sky is every bit as color-saturated as one of Mr. Tsypin's sets, all magenta and orange. While waiting for the lights to be set up, the actors perform a scene that was not in the script and will not be in the movie, either. A little improvisation. Mr. Baryshnikov, in a ratty purple sweater, and Mr. Gallagher, his business suit in disarray, stand on either side of Ms. Cusack. And Mr. Baryshnikov starts to teach Mr. Gallagher to dance. With Brooklyn, beautifully illuminated by the last rays of sunlight, as their backdrop, they do what looks like a soft-shoe, Mr. Baryshnikov making up the steps and Mr. Gallagher following. They are starring in their own silent movie, one the camera has missed.
Finally, the lights are set up, Mr. Sellars directs one more scene, and "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez" wraps.
Unlike such movies as "Wall Street" and "Working Girl," which are about speed, power and upward mobility, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez" is about slowing down, perhaps about stasis. It's about how the downward slope of the economic spiral looks and feels.
So what has he done now?
Assuming that the wordless performances, the urban imagery and the music truly articulate his ideas, Peter Sellars has made the first Wall Street epic of the recession.
"I think we spent the 80's rushing around," Mr. Sellars says. "And now we have to live with it. I think this movie is about living with it."

HEADLINE: Mourners Recall Wagner as Man Of Subtle Grace

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Friends, loved ones, old political allies and ordinary New Yorkers remembered Robert F. Wagner yesterday as one of the city's most popular and pivotal mayors, a quiet man of conscience and probity who led New York through some of the most sweeping changes in its history.
Under the soaring Gothic vaults of St. Patrick's Cathedral, some 700 mourners -- public officials, dignitaries from yesteryear and scores of people who simply knew and admired him -- gathered for a funeral Mass and a final round of tributes for the city's 102d Mayor, who died of heart failure at his Manhattan apartment on Tuesday at the age of 80. 
 There was no parade of politicians to the pulpit and no extensive review of Mr. Wagner's three terms as Mayor from 1954 to 1966 -- a feat matched only by Fiorello H. LaGuardia and Edward I. Koch -- or of his later service as Ambassador to Spain and emissary to the Vatican.
But William Cardinal Baum, a Vatican official who conducted the Mass and read a message of condolence from Pope John Paul II, spoke of Mr. Wagner's service to the nation and the church. And one of Mr. Wagner's sons, Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former deputy mayor and president of the city's Board of Education, gave a brief, moving eulogy on the warmth, kindness and wit of a man he called remarkable.
 
'With Grace, With Humor'
 "He accomplished things subtly," Mr. Wagner said of his father, "sometimes so subtly that people didn't realize what was happening. He accomplished with grace, with humor, with ability to build consensus. He brought New York City into the modern age. He saw the transformation of New York City, which was a great national city, into the pre-eminent city in the world."
Mr. Wagner said his father had jotted down some thoughts in the last weeks of his life. "It was some advice, I think probably not for the officials here, but probably for his sons," Mr. Wagner said, and he read the jottings: "When in danger, ponder. When in trouble, delegate. And when in doubt, mumble."
Mayor Wagner in fact was known as a man of caution and reticence, who often addressed problems by naming study commissions, and whose deliberate, methodical approach was sometimes derided by critics as a failure to respond forcefully to major economic and social changes.
But as others outside the funeral recalled, Mr. Wagner accomplished a great deal in an era of dramatic upheaval in New York, clearing slums and building public housing, fighting for state and Federal aid to the city, holding down transit fares, granting collective bargaining rights to municipal unions and quietly integrating city government with more black and Hispanic appointees to reflect a changing city population.
Joseph A. Califano, who was President Johnson's domestic affairs adviser, recalled Mr. Wagner as an ardent advocate of programs for the poor and disadvantaged. "He was the mayor who was most willing to try the Great Society programs," Mr. Califano said. "Part of what he did was empower minorities."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, arriving with his wife, Mathilda, praised Mr. Wagner. "He was a very underrated man in his own time, a superb conciliator and consensus-builder," the Governor said on the cathedral steps. "We've known him a long, long time, and our respect and admiration for him grew over the years."
Mayor David N. Dinkins and former Mayors Koch and John V. Lindsay attended, as did a host of former city commissioners and politicians, including Carmine G. DeSapio, whose Manhattan Democratic organization was crushed in 1961 when Mr. Wagner, a lifelong Democrat, won his third term at City Hall despite its opposition.
Mr. DeSapio offered no comment, but his presence seemed a gesture of civility often lacking in today's rough-and-tumble politics. Indeed, Mr. Wagner's funeral itself appeared to many to represent the passing of an era of simpler, more civil times.
When Mr. Wagner was Mayor, New York was "a safe, secure, happy city that I was proud to live in -- and now I can't wait to leave," said Alan K. Brown, a tax accountant and one of many people who attended because they admired the man.
Herman Badillo, a former Congressman, Deputy Mayor and Borough President of the Bronx, said: "Mayor Wagner cared about the city. He started me out in politics. I was the first Puerto Rican commissioner to be appointed in New York history."
After the funeral, at which John Cardinal O'Connor spoke and Robert Merrill sang "Ave Maria," six police officers carried Mr. Wagner's polished mahogany coffin to a hearse, and a cortege carrying family members -- Mr. Wagner's wife, the former Phyllis Fraser Cerf; his sons Robert Jr. and Duncan, and others -- drove to a cold windswept hillside in Calvary Cemetery in Sunnyside, Queens.
There, under the blowing bare branches of a plane tree, traditional prayers were recited and Mr. Wagner was buried beside the graves of his father, United States Senator Robert F. Wagner, and mother, Margaret, and first wife, Susan Edwards Wagner, and not far from the grave of New York's Governor Al Smith.

HEADLINE: Hachette Is Paying For Its Hubris

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
If high fashion has a soul, it is French. Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel -- the biggest names in couture hail from Paris. And when the French talk fashion, people listen, or so goes the thinking at Hachette S.A., the giant French publisher whose European magazines include Match, Elle and Tele 7 Jours. When it brought Elle magazine to the United States in 1985 -- the first part of what was to be a major push outside Europe -- Hachette dismissed market research.
"In the Bible, Jesus said: 'If you love me, you will follow me," said Regiz Pagniez, the debonair French publications director, who created the Elle look and works in New York at the company's budding American arm, Hachette Magazines Inc. "We have the same thing. Readers can't tell us what is necessary. We have to give them examples." 
 But Elle's following has flagged, and Hachette's entire United States foray has had some costly setbacks. At Elle, newsstand sales have fallen as its formula, critics say, has grown tired. Woman's Day, the biggest of 12 titles picked up by Hachette in its 1988 purchase of Diamandis Communications Inc., has been ransacked by the competition.
Hachette is now scurrying to give both magazines a fresh face, which means shrinking the oversized Elle and trading in a homey tradition at Woman's Day for a more contemporary cover look. With a hint of nostalgia, Daniel Filipacchi, the chairman of Hachette Magazines, which now has 15 titles, says: "There has always been a cake on the cover. One day it is red, one day it is yellow and one day it is blue, but it is always a cake."
Despite deep pockets and its standing as the world's largest magazine publisher, Hachette has had difficulty transporting its success to the United States, an illustration of just how tricky creating a global presence -- that universal ambition of media mavens -- can be. The industrywide advertising slump is not the only problem. Magazine executives and analysts claim that Hachette has been undermined by market miscalculations and by the same arrogant attitude that it demonstrated in the Elle start-up:
* Hachette, critics say, mistakenly assumed it could operate in the United States as it does in France, where it owns not only magazines but also interests in the companies that distribute them. But Hachette broke an unspoken code in America, where publishers have not historically owned wholesalers, when it spent $15 million last year to purchase control of the Imperial News Company, a magazine wholesaler on Long Island. Less than 10 months later, it sold Imperial back to its original owners at a loss, claiming that it was effectively driven out of business, and filed a $100 million lawsuit. "It was a fiasco," admitted Didier Guerin, a long-time Hachette executive who oversees Elle and Elle Decor, two of the 15 magazines.
* Hoping to pay down debt assumed in the Diamandis purchase, Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of Hachette S.A., decided to sell Woman's Day in an auction, a technique he had used successfully in France but that investment bankers and managers discouraged him from using because of weakening magazine prices. When bids came in far shy of the asking price, Hachette was forced to yank the magazine off the block, a blow to its credibility and to its advertising, which dwindled. "All our problems stem from Woman's Day," Mr. Filipacchi said.
* Hachette has been unable to keep some of the highly visible and successful executives who came with the Diamandis purchase, leading some in the industry to conclude that the French did not understand how to manage top-flight talent. Among the recent departures: Peter Diamandis, the chairman of Diamandis, and his longtime associate, Bob Spillane; Elle's publisher, Anne Sutherland Fuchs, who became publisher of Vogue; the editor of Woman's Day, Ellen Levine, who joined Redbook, and the Elle Decor editor, Lou Group, who went to House Beautiful.
Mr. Filipacchi dismisses the criticism. Can a media company realistically go global? "To doubt that is to say that you cannot sell Coca-Cola in Russia," he scoffed.
Despite the distress, Hachette Publications appears to be in decent shape financially. Last year, it had cash flow of $60 million on sales of $550 million -- enough to cover debt payments from its purchase of Diamandis. But problems would have arisen next year if not for a $150 million infusion from its corporate parent last November, which it used to pay down debt.
For Hachette S.A., venturing into the United States was consistent with a currently popular premise that any media company wanting to prosper in the next century must be global and diversified to survive as advertising dollars move from print to other forms of media. A big believer in the vision is Hachette's 63-year-old chairman, Mr. Lagardere, who owns the largest racing stable in France, and with his family, controls a 51 percent interest in Hachette and in Matra S.A., the French munitions manufacturer.
Taking over Diamandis was a delicate proposition. Peter Diamandis had bought 19 magazines from CBS Publishing Inc. in 1988 for $680 million in a leveraged buyout. He had given his top 29 executives shares in the new company, Diamandis Communications Inc., and plenty of room to maneuver.
The sale to the French for just 12 of the original 19 magazines for $712 million six months later, made several executives into millionaires, and at high risk of leaving Hachette once their payouts -- staggered over several years -- were completed. Indeed, after collecting the last 10 percent of their payout in December, two of the top executives left: Ms. Fuchs, who had moved to Elle from Woman's Day, and Ms. Levine of Woman's Day. Several industry executives believe that Ms. Fuchs and Ms. Levine each earned $3 million.
The temptation to leave may have been heightened by the changing nature of the enterprise, which some executives say shifted from freewheeling to somewhat bureaucratic. Certainly that quickened the exit of Mr. Diamandis, who had stayed on as chairman of Diamandis after the acquisition. "The problem was that Peter had a taste of being an entreprenuer," Mr. Filipacchi said. "It would have been different if we had bought his company straight from CBS."
Mr. Diamandis is contractually obligated not to comment on Hachette, but several executives said that he smarted when Hachette insisted he close Memories, a nostalgia magazine he started. The last straw, however, according to one executive, was when Hachette decided to rename Diamandis Communications. The French management had bristled when they realized that the Diamandis name was still being used.
Mr. Diamandis was even madder and left in September, about $30 million richer. The name was changed to Hachette Magazines the next day. David Pecker, the chief financial officer of Hachette, is the sole remaining executive from Diamandis.
Dissatisfaction at some of the other publications escalated when all publishers began reporting to Mr. Guerin after Mr. Diamandis resigned. One executive who left the company believes that Mr. Guerin antagonized some executives by keeping tighter tabs -- asking for memos and reports -- than Mr. Diamandis. Mr. Guerin denies any conflict.
Meanwhile, the tension at Elle, which eventually was incorporated into Hachette Publications, was mounting. Newsstand sales, the impulse buys that are the clearest indicator of reader interest, dropped 16 percent in 1990, while those of Vogue declined by only 7 percent. Several critics feel the magazine has become too predictable, while Vogue, under its new editor, Anna Wintour, has rebounded and stabilized.
Mr. Pagniez, who works closely with the team of five photographers who do virtually all the work for Elle editions worldwide, argues that the magazine's photography and styling are more subtle and less shocking than they once were. He attributes the decline in figures to the recession.
Elle is being downsized slightly this spring. But the new look may be perceived as a sign of trouble. "If they're downsizing, it is probably realistic from Elle's point of view, but among the magazine community, people look upon it as an acknowledgement that Elle has peaked," said Midge Richardson, editor in chief of Seventeen.
Elle, however, is doing well compared with Woman's Day, which was highly vulnerable to a market downturn. Critics say Mr. Diamandis was slow to recognize how competitive the newsstand business would become.
And putting Woman's Day up for auction was no solution. "We would have taken $200 million, but the highest bid was $125 million," Mr. Filipacchi recalled.
Hachette's advertising pages plummeted 21 percent last year to 1,407 pages, while Family Circle's were down only 16.5 percent. The departure of Ms. Levine compounded a morale problem at Woman's Day. One editor at a rival publication says Hachette had trouble replacing Ms. Levine because publishing executives believed Woman's Day was still for sale.
Several editors said they also were concerned that the culture at Hachette was too "foreign" for them to feel comfortable. One was surprised at being asked, "How good is your French?"
Hachette's challenge is to blend comfortably into the American publishing landscape.
 
ONE LESS STAR ON ELLE'S MASTHEAD
 For Anne Sutherland Fuchs, her new job as publisher of Vogue is nirvana. "Vogue is the Metropolitan Museum," said Ms. Fuchs, who until December was the publisher of Hachette's Elle. "It's an institution. Elle was a five-story art gallery. A very pretty gallery, but an art gallery."
No one is saying how much Conde Nast Publications, which puts out Vogue, is paying Ms. Fuchs. But money could hardly have been the only draw. Her stock in Diamandis, which was bought by Hachette, was worth $3 million. And she was making nearly $400,000 a year as Elle's publisher, associates say.
Ms. Fuchs was the first woman to become publisher of a major national magazine when she took that title at Woman's Day in 1985. Hachette moved her to Elle after it bought Woman's Day from Diamandis in 1988. Ad pages have since ballooned.
The 43-year-old executive is a compulsive worker for whom even socializing is serious business. She is out with her husband, Jim Fuchs, a former Olympic shot putter and now an executive recruiter, five nights a week. One associate recalls watching Ms. Fuchs disappear into the dining room at a dinner party to change the place cards so that she could sit next to a prospective advertiser.
And her sales strategies have sometimes been both daring and controversial. When Hachette introduced Elle in the United States, the magazine was only taking upscale advertisers. Ms. Fuchs started taking ads for inexpensive products like drugstore cosmetics to gain market share.
Some advertisers were not happy. Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Estee Lauder Inc., complained to Peter Diamandis, Ms. Fuchs's boss, that Lauder ads were not in sufficiently prestigious company.
"I wrote two numbers on a piece of paper: $1 million and $2 million," Mr. Diamandis recalled. "I told him Estee spent $2 million in Vogue, which takes all those categories. I said that before he complained, he should spend more in Elle."
Then last year, Ms. Fuchs offered new advertisers a 10 percent discount, which some executives thought weakened Elle's leverage. When she left Hachette, Daniel Filipachhi, the head of Hachette, said Elle, which had just raised rates 9.3 percent, would eliminate the discounts. But, as one company executive said, "If Hachette eliminates the 10 percent discount, then new advertisers would be paying a 20 percent increase over last year. It won't work."
And how will Ms. Fuchs keep Vogue's lead over Elle, which has about 900 fewer advertising pages a year? "In a soft economy, people don't want to take risks. They know that Vogue delivers," she said.

HEADLINE: Fears of War And Recession Put Pressure On the Psyche

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
STEVE ROBERTS said he often feels like a counselor on wheels. "I hear everything," said the driver for Diamond Cab Company in Bloomfield, "from the mundane to the incredible."
Lately, he said, many of his customers were unusually gloomy. One man was depressed because he lost his job at Pratt & Whitney and did not feel that he could give his children what they need. Others shared their anxieties about the war in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Roberts said, and some dreamed about leaving Connecticut and moving to a place less affected by the recession. 
 "It's a down, down time," he said. "And for a lot of people, it really hurts."
The economic problems in Connecticut are real enough. Housing prices have plummeted. Office buildings stand empty. Layoffs have become common. In December, unemployment was 4.7 percent, up from 4.0 percent a year earlier, according to the State Labor Department. Nonbusiness bankruptcies in the state more than doubled in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, compared with the previous year; the number of filings was 4,521, up from 2,973. Consequently, many people have become unusually gloomy, said a variety of watchers of the public mood. Mental health professionals said that financial problems were leading to symptoms like low self-esteem, anger, addictive behavior and lack of concentration. "In the past, people's problems usually had to do with a crisis at home or substance abuse," said Stephen Witty of Bethel, a psychotherapist and business consultant. "More and more, I'm finding that the stress they're feeling stems back to the economy and whether or not they are able to make tuition or mortgage payments."
Under the amber lights of Bennigan's, a bar and restaurant in the center of Stamford's financial district, a bartender, Dave Havey, said he had seen his customers' mood change. Not long ago, "yuppie whiz kids in Armani suits would sit at the bar boasting about deals, promotions or how much money they made," he said. But the atmosphere has become more somber, he said, and people often talk nervously about their employers' plans to reorganize and restructure.
"People are afraid they might be getting sacked," Mr. Harvey said, adding that the bar also seemed quieter since many people were sitting and watching television coverage of the war. "Nobody's in much of a partying mood."
Vicky Spiro Smith, coordinator of the Connecticut Self Help and Mutual Support Network in New Haven, a referral service for support groups, agreed that international events are taking a psychological toll. "It's a very devastating time to begin with," she said. "Then we have this war on top of it." The Connecticut Psychological Association reported that calls for referrals are up 43 percent from a year ago. Requests for help have also increased at the state's Info Line in Waterbury, which runs a 24-hour crisis-intervention and suicide-prevention service for 41 towns. The assistant director, Angelica Medina, said many of the calls are triggered by concerns about jobs and finances "and an overwhelming fear of the unknown."
Connecticut has lost 19,700 jobs since 1989, 12,000 in manufacturing, said the director of communications for the State Labor Department, C. Richard Ficks. The closing of Bloomingdale's in Stamford, Sage-Allen in downtown Hartford and several Ames department stores throughout the state, he said, contributed to the loss of 4,000 retail jobs.
Enid Sherry of Guilford said the declining optimism about the economy and the general uncertainty about the war were the two main reasons she was forced to close her business, Enid Sherry's Fine Linens and Lingerie, in Guilford Center.
Until a few months ago, she said, her store buzzed with customers, including many women executives who bought imported bed and table linens, silk robes and peignoirs. By the fall, she said, business began dropping. Once the war began, she said, "I knew it was all over for me."
Some residents of the state, like Leroy and Margaret White of New Haven, must cope with economic hardships and their concerns for relatives deployed in the Middle East. Mr. White, a builder, said that until last year, he and his small crew had more business than they could handle. Now, he said, requests for the single-family homes that he builds have halted, forcing his family, including five children, to live on the $24,000 that his wife earns as a school administrator.
 
'It Will Pass'
 In addition, the Whites' 30-year-old son, Roy, is an Army lieutenant now stationed in the Middle East. To overcome the hard times, said the couple, the family members are relying on each other for support.
"The kids are scared and keep asking us when everything is going to get back to normal," said Mr. White. "And we keep telling them that it is a storm we all have to weather. It will pass. It will pass."
The ranks of unemployed professionals has also burgeoned in the last few years, as corporations cut away at middle management, and mergers and acquisitions eliminate thousands of jobs in the region.
"The typical profile of an executive is someone who takes charge and makes things happen," said Cynthia Trapani, president of the Connecticut Consultation Services in Stamford. "And to take that away is to take away someone's identity, structure and self-worth."
Ms. Trapani and other employment counselors said that with so many people out of work, the shame of being jobless has been reduced. In the last two years, she said, large numbers of unemployed people have turned to open forums run by local churches and synagogues, to help each another with job searches and with emotional stress. Fairfield County now has 13 executive support groups.
Robert King, a former corporate financial officer and one of the founders of an executive support group in Stamford, said its participants range from 40 to 60 years old and come from a variety of professional backgrounds.
"It's a place to share ideas, relax and realize that you're not alone," he said.
 
'Spinning Out of Control'
 Mental-health professionals said some people affected by the recession have found solace through a statewide network of support groups that address issues like substance abuse and panic disorders.
Others are voicing their worries over the airwaves. On a recent call-in show on radio station WPKN in Bridgeport, one listener from Milford lamented: "We're living in a world where there are so many massive problems, and nobody seems to know what to do about it. Things seem to be spinning out of our control."
But others, like Ms. Sherry of Guilford, seemed to be taking things in stride. She said she was not sure what she would do after she shut the door to her Water Street shop for the last time.
"My customers seem to be more worried about that than I am," said Ms. Sherry, who is also an interior designer. Though initially saddened by having to close, she said she decided that her situation was a sign that other opportunities await her.
"What can I say?" she said, standing next to a wardrobe that once held lace camisoles. "Life is a circle."

HEADLINE: More Debtors Seeking Protection in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE word bankruptcy comes from banca rotta, or broken bench, a term used in 14th century Italy where merchants conducted their business seated on benches. When a merchant failed to meet his financial obligations, the other merchants broke his bench over his head.
There are a lot of broken benches around today. Bankruptcy filings at the United States Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, which serves Westchester and Rockland Counties, increased to a record 1,364 last year, up from 978 in 1989. If January, when an additional 146 filings were recorded, is a portent, this year could also set a record. 
 "Filings are being made right across the board," said Kenneth Freda, deputy clerk of the Bankruptcy Court. "They range from small businesses to large businesses and to consumers, including professional couples, who are all seeking protection. We have six people in this office and we could use 10 to handle the increased traffic."
 
Locally, Individuals Predominate
 Bankruptcy filings in the court include those under Chapter VII, which covers businesses that want to liquidate; Chapter XI, which allows businesses to keep operating; Chapter XII, for farmers, and Chapter XIII, for individual debtors.
In the White Plains court, the majority of bankruptcy filings come under Chapter XIII, said Eric Charles Kurtzman, a lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy law. "Many cases in this court involve young families who are struggling to get out from under a mountain of debt, brought about by using too many credit cards," he said.
Mr. Kurtzman said the latest bankruptcies frequently involved people who were very well off until recently. "For example, one professional couple living in northern Westchester recently filed for bankruptcy even though the husband, who is a lawyer, earns $120,000 a year," Mr. Kurtzman said. "But their problem was that the wife, who also earned a high salary, lost her job and then they started falling further and further behind making payments on the $350,000 debt they had run up on six credit cards."
He added that bankruptcy petitions were now filed by people from all walks of life: from 22-year-olds unable to pay car loans to elderly citizens burdened with high medical bills.
Mr. Kurtzman, who is 37, is a partner and founder of the law firm of Kurtzman & Haspel. It is one of the few full-service law firms in the local area that has its own department specializing in bankruptcy law and creditors' rights.
"Bankruptcy law was a relatively obscure specialty when I began my law career nine years ago, as a clerk for U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Roy Babit," he said. "Then only a few of the largest firms had bankruptcy departments. But I've always been interested in the power of bankruptcy law and the restructuring of debt."
Now the economic downturn has created a boom for bankruptcy lawyers. Mr. Kurtzman's firm, headquartered in Nanuet, has an office in Manhattan and recently opened a third one in Ramsey, N.J.
"Changes in the bankruptcy law in 1979 have made it easier to file for protection," Mr. Kurtzman said. "It doesn't have the stigma it once had. I'm a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for the Southern District of New York and as such I administer 60 to 80 cases a month and I see everything.
 
'Most People Are Honest'
 "Most people, I've found -- at least 98 percent -- are honest. They file for bankruptcy because they are pushed to the limit. Divorce and matrimonial problems are the root of a lot of trouble, but credit card debt is what sends most people over the edge."
April is the cruelest month for debtors, Mr. Kurtzman said, because of the demands for payments of bills acquired during holiday buying sprees.
"Credit card companies start demanding payment in earnest and our phones start jumping off the hook with people wanting to know how they can stop collection agencies from hounding them," he said.
"I still recommend that they try to contact the financial institution that issued the credit card, to try to reach a settlement on the debt. But unfortunately the credit card companies will usually refuse. They find it cheaper to give the case to a collection agency."
 
Some Debts Still Must Be Paid
 In most cases, he said, the advantage in filing for individual bankruptcy protection is that it automatically stops any foreclosure proceedings on property the debtor owns.
"I'm not saying that everyone with credit card debt should file for bankruptcy protection," he said. "It should only be considered as an alternative. It's not a way to discharge all debt: Taxes have to be paid first and student loans have to be paid. Alimony and child support have to be paid and lawyers are paid up front."
Bankruptcy has a number of disadvantages. "Anyone filing for bankruptcy protection can't file again for another six years." Mr. Kurtzman said. "And bankruptcy remains on credit reports for 10 years, which affects an individual's credit rating."
But credit card debt, Mr. Kurtzman said, will continue to plague consumers unless Congress forces banks and credit card lenders to reduce the 16 percent to 18 percent interest charges. These, he believes, are excessive.
"Consumer debt keeps the credit card companies and the banks afloat," he said. "But personal bankruptcy is a problem that has been created partially by the economy and the consumer, by lending institutions who are more than happy to absorb some bad debt in return for the 18 percent interest they get from consumers who are not in danger of default."
 
No Jump in Bankrupt Businesses
 Business bankruptcies, surprisingly, don't jump during a recession.
"The reason is that in hard times it's tougher to start a new business," Mr. Kurtzman said. "So there are fewer to go broke the way new businesses do in the first one or two years of operation, and you see fewer of them going into bankruptcy."
Mr. Kurtzman was the trustee in the liquidation of the Charles and Lillian Brown Hotel in the Catskills, a business that was liquidated and its assets sold. But he said that in most business bankruptcy proceedings, under Chapter XI, the overextended borrower engages in what is known as restructuring. Creditors are paid a fraction of what is owed them and the business is allowed to keep operating under court protection.
"Bankruptcy has become widely used as an accepted financial tool," he said. "Restructuring of a debt gives a corporation or an individual a fresh start. The concept is as old as the Bible, which decreed that in a jubilee year all debt should be forgiven."

HEADLINE: Corporate Books Move to Retail Shelves

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: ELMSFORD

 BODY:
CORPORATE histories, those glossy tomes once written solely to flatter the chairman of the board, are no longer destined to end up unread on warehouse shelves. Instead, some are selling well in retail bookstores, generating profits for a growing number of companies.
Roy Benjamin is the chairman of the 37-year-old Benjamin Company here, publishers of scores of corporate histories and business anniversary books. One reason for their success, he suggests, is that the editorial quality of the sponsored books is now equal in many cases to that of the best trade books on the market. 
 "Business happens to be a very popular topic today," Mr. Benjamin said. "There's especially a lot of interest in reading about the people who developed successful companies. So a well-written, well-illustrated corporate history has not only tremendous value as a marketing and public-relations tool, the dollars it makes from retail sales is the icing on the cake."
And those dollars can add up.
 
A Nice Profit for Goodyear
 Take the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company book, "The Goodyear Story," which recounts the company's growth from a small provincial concern into the world's largest tire company. It has earned Goodyear a nice profit since it was published by Benjamin in 1983.
"It's a timeless book, illustrated with about 150 color and black-and-white photos from the company archives," Mr. Benjamin said.
Eventually more than 75,000 copies were distributed by Kent State University Press as trade books, with cover prices of $19.95 for hardcover and $12.95 for soft cover. "Who bought them?" Mr. Benjamin said. "Libraries and business students, mainly, who used them as supplementary textbooks."
 
How Companies Use the Books
 Other copies were distributed to employees, retirees and Goodyear dealers, he said, and some were sold to stockholders at discounted prices.
Companies use their books in many ways, Mr. Benjamin said, from recruiting college graduates to promoting the company to customers and stockholders.
Corporate histories take a lot of work, he said, requiring a search of the corporate archives. His company spent 18 months on the anniversary book for McCormick & Company, the spice concern.
John W. Felton, vice president of corporate communications at McCormick in Hunt Valley, Md., said the company wanted more than a corporate history when it decided to celebrate its 100th anniversary with a special book.
"We thought the concept of combining significant company historical references with a tasty recipe for each important time period would create a more appropriate book for a food company such as ours," Mr. Felton said. "So with the Benjamin Company we were able to create a cookable corporate history: '100 Best Recipes for 100 Years From McCormick.' The book's been a great success, both with our employees and our customers."
Other Benjamin clients that have sold their books to a wider market include Kraft Foods, Remington Arms and Parker Pen.
"What those clients have in common is that all their books were good enough to be distributed to a wider audience," Mr. Benjamin said.
Consumers bought more than 600,000 copies of Kraft's anniversary book, "The Kraft Cookbook,"which has an easel-back binding so the cook can read recipes easily, giving Kraft a profit of more than $1 a book, Mr. Benjamin said.
 
25,000 Extra Copies
 When Mr. Benjamin and his brother, Ted, who is the company president, think a sponsored book has enough merit to stand on its own, they print about 25,000 extra copies for trade distribution, Roy Benjamin said. The Benjamin Company offers such books to trade publishers, which means, he said, that the sponsoring company not only earns royalties from the sale but free publicity as well.
One of the most successful Benjamin titles to be handled in such fashion is "Do's and Taboos Around the World," done for Parker Pen. The book, a reference guide on the gift-giving protocol in 96 countries, was originally packaged with a Parker pen-and-pencil set.
"Parker wanted a book they could market with their pens for gift and sales programs," Mr. Benjamin said. "Since about 80 percent of their business is generated abroad and they have numerous offices overseas, they felt a book dealing with manners and mores abroad was very appropriate for them."
Since its first printing, "Do's and Taboos" has sold 100,000 copies. It has been translated into Japanese, German, French and Finnish.
 
Profit and Publicity
 Eugene G. Rohlman, Parker Pen's manager of marketing communications, said the book had earned a handsomeprofit and about $1 million worth of free publicity for Parker Pen. The book was also acquired by John Wiley & Sons, the trade publisher; in addition to a $9.95 paperback, the publisher has also successfully distributed a hardcover version selling at $19.95 in bookstores.
Other books appearing in bookstores, Mr. Benjamin said, include those his company produced for the 150th anniversary of Remington Arms, a DuPont subsidiary, including the "Remington Historical Treasury of American Guns," books on skeet shooting and trap shooting and a wild game cookbook. The books were sold to bookstores by Grosset & Dunlap.
"How to Protect Your Business," originally published for the Better Business Bureau in 1968 and now in its eighth version, is distributed to bookstores by Prentice Hall.
This aspect of the value of sponsored books was virtually unknown, Mr. Benjamin said, when he and his brother formed the company in 1953. "We pioneered the concept of using books to achieve business objectives and meet budget requirements," he said.
"Now anniversary books have become popular with associations," he added, citing the National Football League's "First 50 Years," the major baseball leagues' "This Great Game" for their 100th Anniversary and the National Association of Broadcasters' "Cavalcade of Broadway -- 38 Years." Books like these usually become classics, Mr. Benjamin said. "They have a long life."
Although the corporate history and anniversary books are the fastest-growing segment of the Benjamin Company, reprints are its bread and butter, Mr. Benjamin said.
"Many are cookbooks," he said, "which are the favorite of sponsors in the food industry because they feature recipes that use the products. They have a long shelf life and because they're constantly used, the sponsor's name is never forgotten."
 
Part of a Package
 He cited as an example the cookbook the Benjamins produced for B&B/Benedictine Liquor's anniversary, based on the recipes of great American chefs. "The book, packaged with each B&B product, is being offered as a premium with purchase," Mr. Benjamin said.
Such books cost the sponsoring company from $5 to $15 a book, depending on such factors as research, art work and production. The average order is 60,000 to 70,000 books. The Benjamin Company uses a cadre of freelance writers, designers, home economists and dietitians who, working with 25 staff employees, bring out six to 12 titles a year.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Begin the Meal With Authentic Borscht

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
FYODOROFF boldly proclaims in neon that it is both a Russian and an American restaurant. But diners would be foolish to choose a sirloin steak or steamed lobster when the likes of pelmeni, vareniki, shashlik Karsky and chicken Tabaka are as rare as rubles on Long Island.
The brand-new Fyodoroff adds an air of elegance to a strip shopping center on Glen Cove Road in Carle Place. Its bold-white exterior highlighted with silhouettes of towers and onion domes, hunter-green and burgundy marquee and valet parking are not the norm in this land of outlets, clearance centers and carpet stores. 
 Inside, Fyodoroff is even more sumptuous. Its Winter Palace-style foyer of mirrored walls, marble floors and luxuriant floral arrangements is a mere preview of the dramatic dining room.
The large room is romantically illuminated by candelabra on every table, tasteful chandeliers and glowing murals of festive folk celebrations. Although Fyodoroff is not decorated in spare Soviet style, it is authentically Russian. Owners, chefs, patrons and many of the waiters hail from the Soviet Union.
On a recent Saturday night, our waiter told us to relax and enjoy what might be a four-hour dinner. His advice was right on target. Although the leisurely pace might irritate Americans planning a movie, another appointment or early bedtime, Russian diners make a night of it.
Dinner at Fyodoroff is more than a meal. Large groups of friends gather for a spirited Russian evening. In the early hours, a trio played laid-back American jazz classics. Later, it was joined by five brass musicians, and diners crowded the dance floor. When the band took a break, a seven-piece gypsy troupe sang, danced and played. There was even a magician to top off the festivities.
As might be expected, food is secondary in this exciting, convivial nightclub atmosphere. Nevertheless, some of it, especially the Russian choices, merit attention.
Begin the meal with borscht. It is not a one-note beet bonanza, but rich with meat, cabbage and other vegetables. But wild-mushroom soup and clear chicken broth were timid.
Yes, there is caviar. Beluga is $33 an ounce, Osetra is $31, and two ounces of salmon's red caviar is $12.50. We enjoyed the red in tandem with thin, yet fluffy, pancakes and sour cream for $15.
More economically priced and equally good starters were the pinwheels of cold, flavorful flank steak stuffed with cheese, garlic, ham and bacon with a zingy horseradish accompaniment, and cold Georgian eggplant topped with a savory mixture of ground pecans, herbs and spices.
A hot appetizer featuring bits of sturgeon mingled with onions and mushrooms in a creamy wine sauce was delectable, if diminutive and overpriced at $11.95. Better buys are the menu's two salads, tossed green at $6.50 and Black Sea at $8.55. Both are large enough for two or more, impeccably fresh and zesty with lemon. The Black Sea has a bonus of feta cheese and six jumbo shrimp.
At entree time, aim at the low end of the price scale. Pelmeni, $7.50, light-as-air dumplings encasing a juicy meat filling, and vareniki, $8.50, gossamer lovelies stuffed with sour cherries and enriched with side offerings of sour cream and tangy cherry sauce, are Soviet satisfiers.
Other Russian bellringers were the shaslik Karsky, a swordful of tender lamb chops and vegetables; beef stroganoff, and chicken Tabaka. A baby chicken is bathed in vermouth, lemon juice and a hefty dose of garlic and is then flattened and fried under a press. The zippy marinade and a bowl of fresh fruit accompany the juicy chicken.
Most of the American offerings sampled were routine, and chicken Kiev spurted herb-colored stringy cheese rather than butter.
There was no liquor license at the time of this writer's visits. When it is granted, alcoholic beverages will include Russian beer and wines.
Fyodoroff gets a good rating for food, but an excellent for fun. So gather a crowd, put on your dancing shoes and enjoy an exciting European evening on Long Island.

 BODY:

SOVIET SOCIAL PROBLEMS
Edited by Anthony Jones, Walter D. Connor
and David E. Powell.
Illustrated. 318 pp. Boulder, Colo.:
Westview Press. Cloth, $52. Paper, $19.95. 
 Soviet scholars and journalists, now freed under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost to write about subjects that had been taboo or heavily censored for decades, have been publishing detailed exposes about everything from officially committed crimes of the past to the country's large array of present-day social problems. As a result, Western Soviet specialists, who once had to scrounge for data, can barely cope with the new torrent of information. "We are still trying to sort out and understand all that we are hearing," the editors of this accessible collection acknowledge.
Most of the topics analyzed by the 16 contributors to "Soviet Social Problems" -- crime, drug and alcohol abuse, ecological calamities, juvenile delinquency, poverty and failing educational and health systems -- will be familiar to American readers. "If, indeed there is any kind of convergence between the U.S. and the Soviet Union," notes Paul Hollander, a professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, "it can be found in the realm of social problems." But for Soviet citizens, the shock of learning about their society's ills has been profoundly unsettling and threatening, and many of them tend to associate those social problems with Mr. Gorbachev's reforms -- so much so that in a recent Soviet public opinion poll, the majority of Soviet citizens ranked the reforms considerably below food shortages, crime and environmental abuse in importance. As Louise I. Shelley, a professor at the American University's School of International Service, points out in her thoughtful essay on crime, such public attitudes may cost Mr. Gorbachev "the support he needs for his economic and political reforms."
By putting their contemporary findings in a historical context, the book's contributors show how the Soviet Union is only now beginning to grapple with problems that Western industrial societies have struggled with for decades. Many Soviet policy makers and intellectuals -- but certainly not all of them -- are eager to learn from Western experiences and practices. In his analysis of the growing problem of Soviet drug abuse, for example, John M. Kramer, a professor of political science at Mary Washington College, reveals that in 1988 the United States Drug Enforcement Agency responded to a request from Moscow to train Soviet officers to combat drug trafficking. (American readers may wonder how much Soviet authorities can actually learn from the D.E.A.) And the study of Soviet pollution problems by Marshall I. Goldman, the associate director of Harvard University's Russian Research Center, suggests that the independent environmental movement in the Soviet Union could benefit from Western experience.
Perhaps the gravest question raised by this book is not whether there are policies to solve these problems, but where any Soviet leadership will find the resources to rebuild a failing health care system, clean the despoiled environment or increase pensions that currently leave most retired citizens near or below the poverty level. Thus Anthony Jones, a fellow at Harvard's Russian Research Center, maintains: "The material resources that the schools so desperately need are unlikely to be forthcoming from an economy that worsens year by year." The new policy of encouraging privatization of services may be a partial solution. But as Walter D. Connor, a professor of political science at Boston University, emphasizes in his treatment of the social justice issue, this approach collides with deeply ingrained Soviet attitudes about equality and hostility to privilege.
Even though this book is written by scholars and primarily for scholars, it raises very large and troubling questions of general concern. As much as any other factor, the social problems of Soviet society will determine the kind of political system that eventually prevails in the Soviet Union and whether the country will survive as now constituted. Only five years ago, most of this book's contributors probably would have emphasized political and ideological differences between the Soviet Union and Western democracies. Now, they encourage us to think about common problems and interests. In this respect, the book is a good omen for post-cold war scholarship on the Soviet Union.

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
By William S. McFeely.
Illustrated. 465 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95. 
 Frederick Douglass stood well over six feet tall under a mass of wiry hair that, as it gradually whitened, imparted to his broad, powerful features and intense gaze qualities of unforgettable charisma and prophecy. Self-taught, he became one of the 19th century's greatest orators, its fearless combatant for the civil rights of African-Americans and the rights of women, publisher and editor of one of the abolitionist movement's most influential newspapers, The North Star, and author of three autobiographies, the first of which, "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass" (1845), compared in contemporary impact with "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "The Communist Manifesto." Black people called him the Great Frederick, the personification of their hopes for citizenship. Republican Party bosses, waving Douglass at election time, fretted lest he finally decide, in a surfeit of rage, to denounce their stealthy accommodation with Southern white supremacy. Douglass ended his remarkable life of public service in 1895 on his estate overlooking Washington, shaken but clinging fast to the conviction he had expressed several months earlier that "race, in the popular sense, is narrow; humanity is broad."
William S. McFeely, the Richard B. Russell Professor of American History at the University of Georgia, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Ulysses S. Grant, achieves a detailed, finely written portrait of the imposing 19th-century leader in his biography, "Frederick Douglass." But Mr. McFeely's is ultimately a rather puzzling portrait as well.
Born into slavery in Talbot County on Maryland's Eastern Shore in 1818, Frederick Bailey (a patronymic believed to have derived from a Muslim ancestor named Belali Mohomet) knew little of his mother, Harriet, and nothing about his father except that he was white. He was shipped back and forth between masters in Baltimore and the Eastern Shore, of whom one was kind but most classically feckless, cruel or indifferent, sometimes all three. Somehow, Douglass's strong sense of himself survived. Making good his escape on the second try in September 1838, the 20-year-old (he thought he was 21) came out of slavery literate (thanks to the wife of one former owner), socially adroit, a skilled ship's caulker, and pledged to marry a devoted, dark-skinned woman he had met in Baltimore named Anna Murray -- free-born, illiterate and five years his senior.
With a new name (chosen from Walter Scott's "Lady of the Lake"), having settled in New Bedford, Mass., Frederick Douglass took a sudden, irreversible turn to celebrity on a Monday evening in August 1841. The place was a Quaker barn on Nantucket Island; the occasion, a meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, with William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, among others, speaking. That single-minded audience might have cheered wildly simply because a black fugitive from bondage was able to speak, whether or not he spoke well. A reasonably articulate fugitive slave was just what the movement had long needed.
Douglass proved from that moment on to be an arresting orator, with a voice capable of marvelous modulation and of such power as to be able to blast into silence proslavery rowdies who often threatened to set upon abolitionist audiences in Ohio and Indiana backwaters. Growing in confidence, Douglass's independence of mind soon troubled white abolitionists, who urged him to stick to slavery anecdotes and leave the thinking to Garrison and Phillips. "Give us the facts," one of them commanded, "we will take care of the philosophizing" -- a racially charged incident Mr. McFeely apparently thinks too well known to comment upon.
The author moves engrossingly through the details of Douglass's early life, offering the fullest explanation to date of why it may be impossible to solve the mystery of Douglass's tangled paternity (although Thomas Auld, a former owner, remains the leading candidate). Other Douglass scholars have underscored the strong formative role of women in his life (until she was sold, Grandmother Betsy, along with the white surrogate mothers Lucretia Auld, the wife of Thomas Auld, and Sophie Auld, Lucretia's Baltimore sister-in-law), but Mr. McFeely has made vivid the connection between their furtive kindness and Douglass's precocious feminism. Douglass seems always to have been much more at ease with intelligent women than with men in the public sphere, perhaps because of his insecurities about paternity, professional standing and racial condescension -- insecurities masked by gracious regality but sometimes betrayed by sudden spleen.
Mr. McFeely clearly believes that psychology is as essential to biography as sex is to a good marriage. He serves up a lot of both sex and psychology, although sometimes with a speculative zest that, in a biographer less certified in his craft, might seem unwarranted. The alleged homosexuality of the infamous Eastern Shore "nigger-breaker" Edward Covey -- into whose clutches the young Frederick fell with fateful consequences -- seems forced. The recurrent speculation about the domestic tensions between Douglass and his wife also has an overwrought quality. In the matter of complexities of color in the marriage, Mr. McFeely may be off the mark in stating flatly that Douglass decided not to settle in England after his celebrated 1846 speaking tour because Anna and "his dark children could never be at home in this foreign country." Surely, other more compelling matters of service to what abolitionists called "the work" dictated Douglass's decision. Douglass's numerous friendships with white women also troubled contemporaries. But as Mr. McFeely wryly observes, "No self-respecting reform movement is complete without a scandal." Mr. McFeely legitimately places the burden on the reader to decide whether or not Julia Griffiths, the indispensable English helpmate on The North Star, and Ottilia Assing, the German social reformer who comforted him in Hoboken, were Douglass's lovers (Assing committed suicide when Douglass remarried).
Mr. McFeely portrays Douglass as cantankerous, excessively solicitous of his dignity and prone to equate the marginalized economic and political interest of the mass of African-Americans with his own vision of racial progress. Personalized in this manner, this biography veers away from the large sense of Douglass's life. "His dream, his fantasy," Mr. McFeely writes, "was that each person should be his or her own Moses and confront Pharaoh on equal terms." But what Mr. McFeely sees as Douglass's fantasy came from a profound belief in an evolving American democracy, one in which he saw his own private and public life to be representative and galvanizing.
To be sure, the principal characters, editorials, speeches, debates, policy decisions and public-service achievements are all there: Douglass at the historic 1843 Buffalo Convention of Colored Citizens, debating the wisdom of the "Call to Rebellion" issued by the fiery Henry Highland Garnet, a direct descendant of Mandingos; Douglass at the epochal 1848 women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., applauding the feminist "Declaration of Sentiments," the only male present who endorsed Elizabeth Cady Stanton's female suffrage resolution; Douglass emerging stunned from a secret conference with John Brown in Chatham, Ontario, on the eve of the raid on Harpers Ferry; Douglass lamely explaining away President Ulysses S. Grant's failure to invite him to the White House with the other members of the commission to investigate annexation of the Dominican Republic. And the story of Douglass's beleaguered, yet not wholly ineffective, service as United States Minister to Haiti in 1889-91 -- with powerful New York shipping interests and an insufferable American admiral scheming to provoke an incident to force the cession of a base to the United States Navy -- has not before been as cogently related.
The relative absence, nevertheless, of the highs traditionally associated with this life, the muffling of the active voice of Douglass, is the result of Mr. McFeely's tendency to decouple Douglass from his race (there is little interaction with other African-Americans), to follow his progress through the eyes of white contemporaries and, finally, to measure his shortcomings by late 20th-century standards.
 An example of this may be found in the relating of Douglass's confrontation with the slave-breaker Edward Covey. After six months of regular beatings, the young Douglass finally resisted Covey's attempts to subdue him. "Whence came the daring spirit necessary to grapple with a man who, eight-and-forty hours before, could, with his slightest word have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm, I do not know; at any rate, I was resolved to fight," Douglass later wrote in "My Bondage and My Freedom."
Covey was humiliated. In relating the Homeric barnyard fight with the sadistic overseer from lecture platforms and in his three autobiographies, Douglass clearly intended it to serve as a powerful metaphor for the individual's struggle against tyranny. In the rolling periods of the mid-19th century, Douglass proclaimed that "he is whipped hardest who is whipped oftenest" -- that slavery was more fatal as a state of mind than as a physical predicament. But his moment of epiphany with Covey is not only rendered curiously flat dramatically, but Mr. McFeely reproaches Douglass for diminishing the role of ordinary black folk from the parable's significance. "In isolating himself in order to point the moral," Douglass downgraded the "heart of the story" -- that two other slaves had refused to help Covey (a point, moreover, Douglass did make).
The famous "Open Letter" to his former master Thomas Auld, in which Douglass presents a searing eight-page indictment of his Stygian life as a slave, leaves Mr. McFeely puzzled because of inaccuracies -- Auld's house was not an "elegant dwelling," nor did Auld turn out Grandmother Betsy "like an old horse to die in the woods." "But why," asks Mr. McFeely, "did he misrepresent Auld's actions?" This seems a stunning solecism on the part of Douglass's biographer, given the patent and potent propaganda intent of the "Open Letter."
This angle of vision derives from Mr. McFeely's conclusion that Frederick Douglass was a leader flawed by an unreasonable belief that exceptional ability and public service placed him above the common run of black people. Among the problematic results, then, is an insufficient sense of Douglass's white-hot anger upon discovering that his amiable white traveling companion during his 1846 British speaking tour had been given exclusive charge of their funds. As well, the sufficient cause is rather misplaced for Douglass's adamant opposition to the attempted subordination of the issue of Negro slavery to white working-class emancipation, or, after publicly making the common servitude connection in Britain, Douglass's refusal to pursue it. How Mr. McFeely can suppose that Douglass and most abolitionists could have embraced a labor philosophy at once repugnant to their upper-class supporters and fraudulently propounded by antebellum Southern sociologists is not clear.
By judging Douglass from the perspective of the 20th century, by seeing him as misguided for holding to the success ethic of "The Self-Made Man" (his favorite post-Civil War lecture), for embracing European culture (and a white second wife), for justifying American imperialism in Haiti, for pushing party politics at the expense of the black labor movement, and for dogmatically opposing outmigration of Southern black farmers, Mr. McFeely obscures the truth that Douglass's views were shared by much of the contemporary African-American leadership. Unlike many of them, Douglass spoke out against racial separatism until the end. Mr. McFeely illustrates the troubling incongruences in Douglass's private and public life by writing of a Washington social affair, "Never was . . . incongruence . . . better displayed than when Frederick Douglass went to Kate Chase Sprague's elegant place in the city to play croquet, while his son-in-law was in her employ as a stableman." It is a telling comment, indeed, about the society Douglass refused to lose faith in.
It was not because he was estranged from his people that Douglass behaved as he did. Rather, it was because the racial realities of his times increasingly mocked his statesmanship, ultimately leaving him, as they did other African-American leaders, with little more to fight with than an Enlightenment creed and exemplary personal dignity. The Great Frederick died in 1895, as Mr. McFeely notes, seven months before the Great Accommodator, Booker T. Washington, delivered his Atlanta Compromise address, in which the civil rights of African-Americans were bargained away for the chimerical prospect of economic advancement.

HEADLINE: How Manufacturers Increased Productivity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"American Revival in Manufacturing Seen in U.S. Report" (front page, Feb. 5) states that the Commerce Department sees a revival of American manufacturing and attributes it to a "wrenching contraction of payrolls and plants." An important point has been overlooked. There has been an amazing increase in productivity, but it did not stem primarily from job cutbacks. Instead, it reflects aggressive actions by many manufacturers to re-engineer their businesses by:
* Simplifying and streamlining the flow of materials and information across entire enterprises.
* Speeding machine changeovers and setups, running small lots, reducing inventories, slashing product movement and improving quality.
* Breaking down "walls" between departments to foster a teamwork that does things right the first time.
* Integrating equipment, systems and people, so everyone has the right information at the right time to perform better.
* Responding faster to customers, in minutes, not hours, days or weeks.
These techniques have reduced inventories to the point where the customary inventory overhang is not present in this recession, making the United States economy better positioned for fast recovery.
You point out, correctly, that white-collar productivity is a drag on overall productivity. It's now time to apply to the office those business re-engineering principles that were so successfully applied in the factory in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Revival of Water Sports in New York City Deserves a Boost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Roger Starr's "Reading History on Harbor Waves" (Editorial Notebook, Feb. 9) is a decorative though fragmented account of the past grandeur and hopeful revival of New York City's historic waterways. By contrast, a glimpse of New York City's waters as they are today shows that the steam towboats and floating grain elevators rotting in awesome maritime graveyards have been replaced by fleets of sleek racing shells, kayaks and canoes.
These water sports represent a growing recreational movement sprouting from the ashes of the last Victorian-era boathouses destroyed by arsonists and the misguided zeal of Robert Moses.
From the late 19th century to the early 20th, New York City was a mecca for water-sports enthusiasts, boasting as many as 31 boathouses in 1905. The hundreds of thousands of regatta spectators along its banks were displaced by the same economic hardships and social changes that forced the demise of the city's maritime-based industries.
Today, to participate in rowing, kayaking or canoeing in New York, you have to do your homework on and off the water. Organizations representing these sports have been lobbying city and state authorities for municipal facilities to serve as a base for providing low-cost access to these sports for city residents, particularly urban youth, and as a requisite for Mayor David N. Dinkins's appeal for an Olympic festival -- and eventually, the Olympic Games.
At the very least, we should be able to break upstate New York's monopoly on the Empire State Games. But with budgets at all-time lows, such visions seem further from reality, without alternative funding, for a city shamefully underusing its waterfront.

HEADLINE: Beef Producers Burdened by Growing Criticism

DATELINE: LOST CABIN, Wyo.

 BODY:
While modern cattle ranchers like Rob Hendry use helicopters and computers, much of their work is still done on horseback and by hand. That serves as a harsh reminder in this town where the temperature has hit 40 degrees below zero of how hard it still is to make money in the cattle busines.
But the extreme weather and constant manual labor do not bother Mr. Hendry, who raises about 2,000 cows and 100 bulls on 150,000 acres 70 miles west of Casper. He even shrugs off a decade of financial difficulties like low beef prices, high interest rates and the collapse of land values. 
 What most bothers Mr. Hendry now, as a businessman who is barely keeping his corporation profitable, are the growing attacks by doctors and environmentalists that have led to fundamental changes in his industry. Some of those changes, while wrenching, seem to be paying off, however, with beef prices making a comeback.
 
 Many Negative Attacks

"We've been attacked by any number of organizations," said the 33-year-old rancher, labeling many of them "just a back-door approach to get rid of the cattle industry" by "negative people."
Some of the harshest criticism came from a recent study linking red meat and animal fat to colon cancer.
"If you step back and look at the data," said Dr. Walter Willett, a Boston-based researcher who directed the study, "the optimum amount of red meat you should eat should be zero."
Health experts have also linked the fat and cholesterol in red meat to heart disease. The meat industry says such studies are inconclusive, and that they were done when beef contained more fat than it does today.
Even so, the accusations have hurt. "Per-capita consumption has been dropping for some time," said Bob Budd, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. Americans ate an average of 68.9 pounds of beef in 1989, down from 94.5 pounds in 1976, American Meat Institute data show.
And while beef prices do not fluctuate wildly with bad news, as oil prices do, the decline in consumption has put pressure on prices, said Tom McDermott, vice president of information for the National Livestock and Meat Board in Chicago.
 
Balancing Supply and Demand
 Forced to respond, the beef industry has firmed up prices by shrinking production to bring supplies in line with demand. It is also raising leaner cattle in response to the health concerns. That is the case at Mr. Hendry's Clear Creek Cattle Company, which now produces leaner beef because it changed the type of bulls that are bred with cows.
Mr. Hendry is the third generation of his family to run the ranch, started by his Scottish immigrant grandfather in 1912. Today, the Hendry ranch consists of what was once nine separate spreads. It is a patchwork that stretches 50 miles by 36 miles at the furthest points, in a section of Wyoming where the outlaw Butch Cassidy once hid.
In addition to aggressively promoting leaner and healthier cuts of beef, producers are also financing industry efforts to promote beef consumption and to dispute health and environmental charges.
Four years ago, the Beef Industry Council started a multimillion-dollar promotional campaign featuring celebrities like Cybill Shepherd and James Garner. It has since been revised to feature inhabitants of towns like Paradise, Tex., and Manhattan, Mont., as illustrations that beef is "real food for real people."
 
Prices on the Rebound
 These efforts seem to be working. The price of a 500-pound calf, like those Mr. Hendry sells, had plunged by $78 between 1980 and 1986. But between 1986 and 1990, prices rose by $171, to $516 each, according to Cattle-Fax, a Denver-based industry research group.
In an average year, Mr. Hendry sells about 1,950 calves to feedlot operators that fatten them for slaughter. Buyers view the cows on videotape transmitted to some 900 sites nationwide via satellite. Winning bidders arrange for truck shipment. The current price is about $1 a pound. If it were to drop by just 10 cents a pound, Clear Creek would be in trouble.
For now, however, the ranch is making money. It operates as a corporation, paying Mr. Hendry just $850 a month for his labor. The corporation also owns and provides the ranch house he lives in rent-free, plus grocery money. If Clear Creek makes a profit, the money goes back into the business.
 
Environmental Pressures

Aside from the economic and medical pressure on beef producers, environmental concerns are beginning to have an influence. The National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group in Washington, has charged that overgrazing is a major cause of deteriorating productivity of Federal lands in 10 Western states. A 1989 report by the federation asserted that more than 68 percent of the 174 million acres held by the Bureau of Land Management were in unsatisfactory condition.
Critics also say ranchers pay too little to the Government to graze their herds on bureau lands. A move to increase grazing fees more than fivefold died in Congress last year.
These moves are especially threatening to Western ranches, like Clear Creek, which are often a patchwork of privately held and leased Federal land. In Clear Creek's case, about 66 percent is leased from the Federal Government.
 
Big Part of the Economy
 Pressure on the beef industry touches a large part of the economy. According to industry and Federal Government data, the nation's 1.3 million cattle operations grossed $36.7 billion in 1989. Meat packing and processing employed more than 225,000 people, and related industries use cattle byproducts to make shoes, candles, insulin, medical sutures, piano keys, glue and yogurt. And 50 percent of the country's corn production is used to fatten beef and other livestock.
In an industry that is perceived by many to embody basic American values, the attacks are especially difficult to stomach. A generation ago, ranchers were not under fire from anyone.
"That's all new," said Jim Hendry, 66, Rob's father. Like many Western businessmen, he sees himself building the West, not tearing it down. "We have no reason to hang our heads over what we have done," he said.

HEADLINE: Troubled Banks and the Role of the Press

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
On Jan. 4, The Boston Globe had a front-page article under the headline, "Damaging Loss Expected for Bank of New England." The newspaper reported that during the day the troubled bank would announce a large loss for the fourth quarter of 1990, which would effectively wipe out the equity of shareholders and make the bank insolvent. The Globe report was correct. The bank announced it would post a $450 million loss. The newspaper report led to a brief run on the bank. The run ended after the Government took over the bank on Sunday, two days later.
The Globe's part in the run on the Bank of New England, most analysts agree, was typical of the role played by the media in recent months in shaping public attitudes toward or confidence in many banks. Newspapers, magazines and television tend, as always, to be messengers of bad news when the news is bad. But the bankers do not seem to be blaming the messenger for their troubles. 
 There have been some cases of misleading and inaccurate reports. One case caused a brief run on the Old Stone Corporation, a banking company in Rhode Island. The run ocurred in late January after Cable News Network did a story on the closings of state-chartered banks and credit unions in Rhode Island, using an Old Stone bank branch as a backdrop. But unlike the 45 credit unions and banks in Rhode Island that were closed, Old Stone, which is federally insured, was not in trouble. CNN broadcast an apology a few days later for using the Old Stone footage.
In another case, a small Massachusetts bank, the Granite Cooperative Bank, experienced a rush of depositor withdrawals after The Boston Herald included the institution in a list of the 10 "worst banks" in the state, which the paper published on Jan. 8, based on a list provided by a bank-rating service in Massachusetts. The bank did not belong on the list, and The Herald printed a correction.
Yet Federal authorities are less concerned by factual mistakes, which they say are comparatively few, than by the interpretation of the news by reporters and editors, which they say can inordinately magnify public worries about the banking system. John LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, cites the "temptation" in the press to draw parallels between the banks' problems and the savings and loan crisis. "I think that is dangerous," Mr. LaWare said. "We're far from having a general collapse of the banking system. It's nothing like the S.& L. situation."
Some press critics reply that the real weakness of the media's coverage of the banking crisis is that it has been too cautious and too late in detecting problems. "Reporters and editors have been so sensitized to bend over backward not to fan up a panic that we have paid a price for it," said Ellen Hume, executive director of the Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard.
Ms. Hume and others do find what they consider disturbing journalistic similarities between the problems of the banking industry and the savings and loan debacle. In both cases, the press and Government regulators seem to have been too slow in recognizing the full extent of the problem. And in the banking crisis, as in the savings and loan crisis, a result could eventually be a higher cost to the American taxpayers.
"The press should be aggressively reporting these issues because they have a major impact on taxpayers," said James Barth, a professor at Auburn University and one author of a recent House Banking Committee study on the industry. "It is the Government's role to instill public confidence by demonstrating that they are on top of the problems of the banks and doing something about them."

HEADLINE: Forecasters Projecting Rosy View

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A majority of the nation's forecasters are insisting that the current recession will end by August, basing their optimism on the behavior of past recessions. By their own acknowledgment, however, the forecasters are playing down the special troubling features of this recession that could prove them wrong.
The big rise in stock prices in recent weeks has reinforced the forecasters' view that this recession, the ninth since World War II, will be among the shortest, lasting less than a year. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which polls 50 prominent forecasters each month, shows that their consensus prediction in February is for healthy economic growth beginning in the third quarter -- assuming the Persian Gulf war ends by April 1. 
 "People are behaving as if there is something objective out there making the Dow Jones industrial average go up, but it's just animal spirits," said Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science. "The forecasters are taking the average length of the four mildest recessions since World War II and assigning it to this recession."
 
 A Different Kind of Recession

By sheer chance, the optimists may turn out to be correct. In fact, the consensus forecast has had an uncanny knack for predicting the beginning of past recoveries. But Mr. Samuelson and other economists contend that the outcome of this recession is harder than others to forecast -- and perhaps is unpredictable -- because it departs radically from the postwar norm in three main features: the huge quantities of unpaid bank loans, the resulting crisis for the nation's banks and the cutback in lending.
Economists say they do not know whether the lending cutback stems mainly from the reluctance of banks to lend and risk more problem loans or from the reluctance of consumers and businesses to borrow and spend during hard times. Whatever the dynamics, the economy cannot move from recession to recovery without a revival of lending and the increased spending that loans make possible.
"We know that the credit stringency problem exists, but it is nearly impossible to anticipate whether it is a major obstacle to recovery or a third-order problem," said Stephen McNees, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who has studied forecasting trends.
 
Blind Spot Acknowledged

The nation's forecasters, acknowledging this blind spot, issue their forecasts anyway, saying in effect that they have no choice. Most are economists employed at brokerage houses, banks and corporations, and their forecasts are churned out for customers and top management. Investment and business decisions are hard to make without an educated guess about the economy's future, and the forecasters provide this service. The problem is that their widely published predictions help to shape not only a customer's view of the economy, but also the public's.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., the investment house, is among the optimists, and his weekly forecasts are mailed to many in the media as well as to investors.
"My ultimate job is to forecast the economy's impact on the stock and bond markets, to help people make money," he said. "So far, I have stressed that the Federal Reserve is committed to getting us out of a recession by lowering interest rates, and that drives up stock prices.
"What I have not discussed is whether the Fed's commitment will work. If the Fed gets the Federal funds rate down to 5 percent and the economy is not only not improving but still deteriorating, then I'll switch my forecast and we'll get out of stocks. But I will have served my customers well."
 
Shifts in Federal Funds Rate

The Federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other, determines the level of many other short-term rates, including interest rates for auto loans and many mortgages. The Fed has been reducing the funds rate by a quarter of a point at a time since last fall, and on Feb. 1 drove down the rate by half a percentage point, an unusually large amount, to its current level of about 6 percent.
"The thing that really turned the corner in terms of forecasting optimism was that Feb. 1 move by the Fed," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
But some economists argue that even if interest rates get low enough to revive lending, the recession still might not end this summer, or even this year, for that matter. They cite problems like the weak real estate and construction markets, a sharp decline in consumer spending in recent weeks, and the growing budget deficit, which makes the Government unwilling to spend for public works and other projects that stimulate economic activity.
"My feeling is that the recession will be deeper and will last longer than the consensus forecast believes," said Edward S. Hyman Jr., a vice chairman of the investment house of C. J.Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
 
 View of Bush Administration

By contrast, the consensus forecast, which is shared by the Bush Administration, draws heavily on past experience. The past teaches that recessions usually end when falling interest rates revive consumer spending and inventories of unsold goods are slim. Low inventories mean that when spending starts to grow again, production can be quickly stepped up and people rehired, without having to wait for stockpiled merchandise to be sold.
Consumer confidence also played a role in most of the eight other recessions since World War II, and the consensus forecast assumes that confidence will rebound once the Persian Gulf war ends. Surveys show that consumer confidence fell sharply after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, and as confidence declined, so did spending. The consensus forecast also notes that exports have remained strong, helping to keep industrial production from falling too sharply.
Perhaps most important from the optimists' viewpoint, the recession will reach its first birthday in the third quarter, and that is roughly the average length of the eight previous recessions. Only two ran more than one year: the recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82. Each lasted 16 months.
 
 Historical Argument Challenged
 But that does not mean this recession will parallel the earlier experiences, said Professor Robert Hall, a Stamford University economist. "There is no basis in historical experience for knowing how long or deep a recession will be," he continued. The art of forecasting often involves splitting the difference between expectations of a quick and vigorous upturn and a prolonged and severe recession, Professor Hall added.
Recessions usually require the gross national product, or the total value of newly produced goods and services, to shrink for at least six months. So far, the G.N.P. has contracted at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The optimistic consensus forecast holds that the economy will shrink by a much smaller 1.3 percent in the current quarter and that by the second quarter growth will have risen to zero. In the third quarter, the recession will end as the G.N.P. expands at an annual rate of 2 percent, the optimists predict.
Whatever the guesswork involved, the consensus forecast has accurately pinpointed the beginning of past recoveries, said Robert Eggert, publisher of the Blue Chip survey of forecasters.
 
 Failure to Predict Recessions
 But the consensus view has been much less accurate in predicting the onset of a recession. The majority of the forecasters in the Blue Chip survey, for example, failed to recognize the 1981-82 recession until February of 1982 -- eight months after it had started -- although they accurately predicted that the recession would end in the fourth quarter of 1982. The same majority failed to recognize the current recession until October.
"The reason is that the economy's basic tendency is to expand, not to contract," said Saul Hymans, director of forecasting at the University of Michigan's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics. "So you have a better reason for saying that a recession will end soon -- for paying attention to the average length of previous recessions -- than you do paying attention to the average length of expansions."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Israel;
Israel Rules Out Palestinian Talks Until War Ends

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said tonight that Israel would not be willing to discuss any new regional peace initiatives until the war in the Persian Gulf ended and the new order of the Middle East became clear.
In the meantime, he said, Israel needs billions of dollars in new economic assistance for the repair of damage caused by Iraqi missile attacks and for the resettlement of Soviet Jews. That money should be provided with no political strings attached, the Prime Minister added. 
 "I've never heard that the assistance of the United States for the absorption of the Soviet immigrants in Israel is conditioned on political steps we will take or not take," Mr. Shamir said in an address to visiting Jewish leaders. "It was not so in the past, and I hope very much that it will not change in the future."
The latest allotment of American financial aid, $400 million in loan guarantees for immigrant housing, is being held up, apparently because of Israel's policy of expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 
U.S. Asks for Details
 Washington asked Israel to provide detailed information on settlement costs and plans before the guarantees would be issued, apparently to insure that no American money would find its way to the West Bank. Recently, the Government did turn over a report.
But last week, two opposition members of Parliament released a report of their own, quoting Housing Ministry figures, showing that the Shamir Government intended to increase the Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza by 50 percent in the next three years with the construction of 12,000 housing units.
The Government report had not even hinted at such plans, and officials here said they were certain the legislators' report had angered the White House just when deliberations on the loan guarantees seemed to be concluding.
Then, late last week, Israel's Ambassador in Washington, Zalmon Shoval, complained that the United States was holding up the aid. For that he received an extraordinary, angry public rebuke from the State Department.
 
Levy to Visit Washington
 Today, the Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minster David Levy would visit Washington in the near future to try to straighten matters out.
In any case, Mr. Shamir said tonight, Israel needs money -- lots of it and soon. The missile attacks and the added military costs caused by the gulf war are costing Israel at least $3 billion, officials say.
Iraq fired two more missiles at Israel on Saturday night, the 14th attack since the war began Jan. 17. Iraq asserted today that the missiles had hit Israel's nuclear weapons plant at Dimona, in the Negev. The Israeli military said one of the missiles had fallen in the Negev but had caused no casualties or damage. Military censorship regulations prevent publication of the precise point of impact.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Soviet Union;
IRAQI AIDE ARRIVES FOR MOSCOW TALKS

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, arrived early today for talks with Soviet leaders about Baghdad's highly conditional offer to discuss a withdrawal from Kuwait.
Soviet officials depict the talks as possibly Iraq's last chance to avert a ground war. 
 Mr. Aziz arrived here shortly after midnight and made no comment on the situation in the Persian Gulf. "I will talk to you if possible after our meetings with our Soviet friends," he told reporters after traveling from Baghdad via Iran.
The visit by Mr. Aziz has become the focus of intense interest in the Soviet Union and abroad since Friday, when the Iraqi leadership issued its statement about Kuwait.
Western leaders of the alliance fighting Iraq in the gulf rejected the proposal as a propaganda tactic, while Moscow suggested that it might contain elements that could be shaped into a political settlement.
 
Visit Seen as Last Chance
 All sides agree that whatever elaboration Mr. Aziz brings will probably be Iraq's last chance to avert a ground assault by the United States-led forces. Western leaders have insisted that Iraq can stop the war only by withdrawing unconditionally from Kuwait.
Soviet leaders and spokesmen made no new comments on the gulf today, but the suspense over the Aziz visit was evident in commentaries like one by Georgy Shmelev of Tass, the official press agency, who wrote on Sunday: "The forthcoming negotiations hold a special significance for the world. Some observers even believe that they are 'the last chance,' 'the last effort' to forestall an all-out war in the Persian Gulf."
In their talks with Mr. Aziz today, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh hope to discern whether Iraq's statement on Friday represented an opening bid to end a war that has already inflicted heavy damage on the Iraqi military and economy.
The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly L. Churkin, said on Saturday that the Iraqi offer as it stood was burdened with conditions that "could render it meaningless." The conditions included demands that all foreign forces withdraw from the gulf, that Israel withdraw from occupied Arab lands and that Iraq be paid compensation for war damage.
But Mr. Churkin said the main point from the Soviet standpoint was that the Iraqi leadership had publicly spoken for the first time of withdrawing from Kuwait. "We hope that this announcement can become the starting point for peace, and will not be fruitless," Mr. Churkin said.
 
Insist Iraq Accept Resolutions
 Since launching their latest mediating effort a week ago, the Soviet Union has steadfastly insisted that Baghdad adhere to the United Nations resolutions demanding an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, and Mr. Churkin emphasized that this would be made clear to Mr. Aziz.
That position has prevented estrangement between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. Representatives of the European Community welcomed the Soviet diplomatic initiative after meeting on Saturday with Mr. Gorbachev.
Moscow's effort has also included talks between Soviet leaders and the Foreign Ministers of France, Iran and Kuwait, and Mr. Bessmertnykh has had telephone conversations with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition. Reports from Washington said Mr. Gorbachev also had written to President Bush.
The Soviet effort is thought to derive from several motives. Chief among them is a general alarm over the possibility of a massive ground war near the Soviet Union's southern border. On the domestic front, opposition to the war has become a rallying cause for the military and the newly invigorated conservative forces, and Kremlin leaders also fear that a prolonged conflict could fan passions in the large Muslim populations of the Soviet Union.
The Kremlin is also thought to hope that even if the current mediating effort fails, it will help boost Moscow's standing in the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Small Business Adapts to Lean Times

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
When Richard Mecaskey bought the Reliable Auto Paint and Supply Company last April, the former steel company executive figured that his new venture in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights was recession-proof. The tougher things get, he was told, the more inclined people would be to take their cars to the repair shops, like those served by Reliable, instead of buying new ones.
It has not worked out that way. Not only are consumers holding back on new purchases, but renovations and repairs are being put off, and those that are being done are frequently paid for more slowly. One result is that the small businesses on the economic frontline are shifting at least some of their woes to companies like Mr. Mecaskey's by falling behind on payments for supplies or services. 
 In response, Reliable is greatly reducing inventories, working overtime to find new customers, hounding its clientele to pay more promptly, and generally, in Mr. Mecaskey's anxious assessment, eking out a "hand to mouth" existence.
Economists have more anecdotes than statistics, but they suspect that experiences like Mr. Mecaskey's might be afflicting many more small businesses than in the recession of the early 1980's. That recession was notable for its effect on big manufacturers, particularly those competing with large European and Japanese companies helped by a strong dollar. This time, collapsing real estate prices and regulatory pressures on the nation's banks make life much more difficult for smaller concerns.
"The small-businessmen's primary financing options -- bank loans based on their business prospects and home mortgages based on the value of their homes -- have been shut down," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. He said the impact has been clearly measurable in the construction sector, where DRI's computer models attribute a 25 percent drop in housing activity to a lack of financing.
Retailing and other segments of the service economy that have also been small-business bastions appear to be experiencing hard times far more than in the early stages of the previous recession.
"The current recession is having much more effect in areas where small businesses dominate," said Thomas A. Gray, chief economist for the Small Business Administration.
Economists caution that it is difficult to verify such assertions or, if they are true, to make useful projections based on them about the economic outlook. Small businesses are by their very nature tough for researchers to accumulate data on, and few academics study them.
 
 One-Third of the Work Force
 It is estimated that more than a third of the nation's workers are employed by businesses with fewer than 100 employees and that 15 million businesses have five or fewer employees. Small companies supply products and services to every major industry and are often also the primary distribution channel for multinational corporations.
In general, economists say, small companies in those segments of the economy affected by a recession contract more quickly than bigger ones, but small businesses rebound sooner once a recovery begins.
Most experts assume that small businesses are more prone to cash-flow problems in tough times because of the more informal nature of their operations.
"Smaller business people tend to have more personal relationships with their customers," said Tim Andrews, president of CPA Affiliates Inc., a network of accountants in Ohio. "They often have trouble refusing to extend credit because it's hard to take off the personal hat and put on the business one."
That has been the experience of Thomas Green Jr., who runs a consumer electronics sales and repair shop in the small Northern California mountain community of Chester.
As new-equipment sales have slowed and customers have delayed picking up VCR's and other devices left with him for repair, Mr. Green has taken a number of belt-tightening steps. He has pared the number of new televisions he stocks from 15 to 3, has switched his advertising in the local newspaper from displays to small classified notices, and has charged supplies on his Mastercard instead of paying immediately to conserve cash.
Mr. Green said he had even gone to small claims court to deal with a friend who had "developed amnesia" about his bill. But he is reluctant to sell equipment brought in for repairs that has become long overdue on being picked up. "I don't want that kind of reputation," he said.
Even small businesses for which demand remains steady have run into problems in the recession as their customers slow down payments.
J. R. Dietl, owner of Medical Repair Specialists Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., said that he had many customers asking him to repair ambulance equipment, but that many had been unable to stick to his 30-day payment terms. With numerous municipal accounts falling up to 90 days behind, he has begun to demand that private customers pay cash on delivery, slowed down paying some of his bills and laid off one of two office workers.
"The farther away customers are, the slower they are to pay," Mr. Dietl said. "They figure we can't afford to come after them."
Super Millwork Inc., a Long Island window distributor with annual sales of about $20 million that has laid off about 20 percent of its work force, has taken a tough stance in credit negotiations with new customers, said Sanford M. Lavitt, the majority owner and president.
"A big percentage of our customers are 30 days late or more in paying, but we have to pay our window suppliers before they will deliver," Mr. Lavitt said. "We have become bankers, which isn't easy. All of our competitors are in the same boat."
The real estate slump has played a critical role in lenders' reluctance to lend. Small-business owners are far more likely than large corporations to rely on real estate as collateral for bank loans. In areas like the Northeast, where real estate prices have fallen most sharply, banks are reluctant to extend new loans to even healthy small businesses.
 
Surveys on Credit Trends
 So far, the widely followed monthly surveys of the National Federation of Independent Business, a Washington-based group with 500,000 small-business members, show just 12 percent have reported that credit has tightened in the last three months, about a third the number that reported problems in the last recession. But those figures may be deceptive. The survey also shows that fewer than ever are borrowing from banks.
Signs are also apparent that many are seeking financing in other ways. The National Association of Purchasing Management in McLean, Va., for instance, found that some members were getting requests from their smaller suppliers for advance payments or other financial support.
Some small-business executives say that one of their problems in a recession is that they lack the influence to drive hard bargains with big suppliers or customers.
But such a claim is hard to prove. Melchior, Armstrong, Dessau Inc., a wholesaler of heating, ventilating, and refrigeration equipment in Ridgefield, N.J., says it has sought to stretch out payments to small suppliers because larger companies would cut it off if payments were missed.
But for every company like Melchior, Armstrong, there are those like Mr. Mecaskey's that have found big businesses to be supportive.
"We have been candid and they have been cooperative," Mr. Mecaskey said of paint and solvent suppliers like Du Pont and PPG Industries.
 
 Dealing With Big Accounts

"A lot of companies are actually more likely to pay off small businesses," said Robert Bretz, a purchasing manager for Pitney Bowes Inc. who oversees the monthly survey of business conditions for the purchaers' group. "If you have a cash-flow problem, you would prefer to handle it by dealing with one or two big accounts than hundreds of little ones. Who wants all those phone calls?"
Surveys in November and December by the National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business advocacy group, found that its members' optimism had fallen to its lowest point since 1980.
In another survey, by the Small Business Service Bureau, an organization in Worcester, Mass., whose 35,000 members all have 10 or fewer employees, one in three small businesses expect sales to fall this year, up from one in eight five years ago.

HEADLINE: Deadly Fire in Connecticut Is Attributed to Heater Cord

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Luis Soto shook his head in dismay this morning as he gazed up at the charred skeleton of a three-story, three-family house where 10 people, including five young children, perished in a fast-burning fire early Saturday.
"It was so quick -- it was unbelievable," said Mr. Soto, who lives across the street from the gutted brick-and-wood home, which is in a low-income neighborhood near downtown in this central Connecticut city, about 10 miles southwest of Hartford. "I've never seen a house go up that fast." 
 Fire officials said today that an overheated extension cord on an electric space heater caused the blaze, the most deadly in Connecticut since 14 people were killed in two Waterbury apartment buildings in 1982.
Fire Chief Thomas D. Keough also said that because of a "considerable delay" in calling in the alarm, firefighters faced a building entirely engulfed in flames when they arrived at the fire at 6 Erwin Place. "It was more than a couple of minutes," he said.
 
New in the Neighborhood
 Hector Ortiz, the executive director of Communidad En Accion, a local housing development agency, said the victims belonged to two families, and that five of them were children under the age of 5.
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Farmington has not released the identities of the victims, pending notification of next of kin. A spokesman for the office said autopsies showed that all 10 had died from smoke inhalation.
Santos Ayala, who lives next door to the apartment building, said two Hispanic families had moved in during the last few months but little was known about them. "They were considered new people here," he said.
The fire was reported about 2:45 A.M. Firefighters arrived about one minute later, but did not have the blaze under control until about 5 A.M.
The victims were found on the second and third floors. Seven people who lived on the first floor and one person who lived on the second floor escaped.
"Fire was coming out all the windows," Mr. Soto said. "People were screaming. One guy came running out, yelling, 'Help me! My family is in there!' "
Firefighters, working in near-zero temperatures, were initially blocked from entering the building by extreme heat and flames, Chief Keough said. Several firefighters suffered minor injuries.
 
A Portable Heater
 The Chief said the fire started on the first floor, spread up the front and rear stairwells and caused the roof to collapse. He said an extension cord connected to a portable electric heater on the first floor overheated, causing its insulation to melt and ignite a chair.
The Chief said it did not appear that the cord was defective, but that it was too small to carry the heater's charge. He warned that extension cords should not be used with many portable room heaters.
Tenants and the landlord both told firefighters that the house was equipped with smoke alarms. Chief Keough said the building used a gas-stove heating system, which is legal. He added, though, that no such system appeared to exist on the first floor.
He said no decision had been made about citing possible fire-code or housing-code violations.
 
Collecting Donations
 Communidad En Accion, the development agency, held prayer services outside the home today. The group also established a fund to help pay for the victims' funerals. About $1,100 had been collected by this afternoon.
Mr. Ortiz, the agency's director, said: "They may not have been well known, but for the Puerto Rican community this is very sad. This is our first major tragedy. We are very moved by it."
New Britain, a city with about 73,000 residents, has a fast-growing Hispanic community. Census figures place the number of Hispanic residents at about 12,000; local Hispanic leaders said the number is closer to 15,000.
The city has also received some national recognition because it is featured in advertisements for Stanley Works, a local tool maker, reflecting what the company sees as New Britain's reputation as a charming, hard-working New England town.
But Alderman Peter M. Rosa said such an all-American image is largely illusory in light of the city's growing urban problems and the declining role of manufacturing. He said the fire may help to highlight inadequate housing and other social and economic ills in the city's Hispanic community. "This is a tragedy and a shock to everyone," he said.

HEADLINE: Georgia, Powerhouse for Two Decades, Winds Down

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 17

 BODY:
In the 1970's and 1980's, Georgia was a centerpiece of the South's economic boom. Today it is mired in recession.
Nowhere is the trouble more evident than in Atlanta, the engine that drives the state's economy. As Georgia and the South grew into economic powerhouses, Atlanta became the region's capital, a center for airlines, telecommunications, distribution and insurance. But this year, economic forecasters say, the metropolitan area will lose jobs for the first time since 1974: 5,800 jobs this year, two-thirds of the total loss for the entire state. 
 "The Atlanta area is struggling," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center of Georgia State University here, "and there is no way we can avoid the word recesssion for the state and the city." But he predicted that the state and city would begin to recover late in 1991.
Until last month Mr. Ratajczak and other forecasters had generally been more optimistic about the region's prospects. He said he believed that Atlanta, with its economy based on the service industry and with the second-largest proportion of white-collar jobs in the nation after Washington, could have avoided a recession.
 
The Effect of Eastern
 Then, in the middle of January, came the demise of Eastern Airlines, one of two carriers that used Hartsfield International Airport here as a regional center of operations. (The other is Delta Air Lines.)
Eastern's closure meant the initial loss of 10,000 jobs, said John Braden, a spokesman for the airport, when one takes into consideration concessions, suppliers and commuter airlines that fed passengers into Eastern's base here. But not all those jobs will be lost permanently.
"All of the indicators from construction activity to retail sales were weak," Mr. Ratajczak said, "but we could have avoided a recession had it not been for the closing of Eastern Airlines. The loss of a second airline hub at Hartsfield has tilted the Atlanta economy into recession."
Concourse C at Hartsfield, with its lights dim, looks like a ghost town. When the concourse was a bustling crossroad for travelers, the airport logged 2,200 takeoffs and landings a day. With the loss of Eastern and the end of many commuter flights feeding the Eastern network, the number is down to 1,172.
 
Advantages Disappear
 Georgia's problems partly reflect those of the entire Southeast. In a recent analysis, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said the region is tending to lose the advantages, like inexpensive labor and growing population, that it enjoyed in the last two decades.
Sheila Tschinkel, senior vice president of research for the bank, said the Southeast had matured economically and become more urban. Many parts of it may not actually be declining now, she said, but they are not growing as much as they used to.
In the past, she said, the region grew sharply as people moved in. But now, as job opportunities decline, fewer people are coming and the bill for the increased public services required by the past growth is coming due.
 
Bad News Abounds
 The figures on job growth come on the heels of bad news on other fronts like real estate and automobile sales.
Ron Harris, general sales manager of Banner Ford here, said that while his business was decent it was a constant battle to stay positive amid the torrent of bad economic news.
"Employees have to get their heads right every day," said Mr. Harris as he stood nearly alone in his showroom on a rainy Sunday afternoon. "We can't control much else when it comes to the economy, but we can control our attitudes, and no one who comes in that door is going to buy a car from a guy who acts like he's beaten down by the economic news."
His dealership had cut back on advertising, Mr. Harris said, but had trimmed inventories only slightly, because "you can't sell from an empty wagon."
 
Home Buyers Hold Back
 Jim Thibadeau, a real estate broker and developer whose family-owned business builds houses here, said customer visits to some of the company's developments had been up in recent weeks, but "buyers are still holding back."
Mr. Thibadeau said he, like many other developers, was laying off workers and taking steps to reduce overhead. But he said he had found a tenant to sublet some of its office space.
In the Southeast, as in other regions, nearly all the states are seeing a decline in retail sales and sales tax receipts. Some states are cutting spending to avoid raising taxes; others are finding new taxes impossible to avoid. In Tennessee last week Gov. Ned McWherter, a Democrat, announced he would seek imposition of the state's first income tax to finance long-planned improvements in education.
 
Promises Are Delayed
 Such "important social commitments" are on the agendas of many states in the region, said Ms. Tschinkel of the Federal Reserve Bank, but most had planned to finance them out of normal growth or through methods like state lotteries.
Fulfillment of campaign promises has also been put off. Georgia's new Governor, Zell Miller, a Democrat, had promised to eliminate the sales tax on groceries, but Dr. Henry Thomassen, the state's chief economist, said last week it had become clear that the move would have to be delayed and phased in over time. The tax brings in about $340 million a year.
Most Southern states are not experiencing the same level of job losses in manufacturing and the service industry as is Georgia, or the same recession in real estate. Arkansas, for example, projects that its economy will grow by nearly 3 percent, thanks largely to a growing food-processing industry and several other manufacturing areas that are benefiting from increased exports.
"We've felt the recession mostly in the form of lower retail sales," said Joe LaFace, chief economist for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. "But generally we are doing well."
Georgia and Atlanta's drift into recession comes, paradoxically, at a time when the city is looking forward to a boom from the 1996 Summer Olympics and the accompanying development.
"Being designated at an Oympics city was expected to enhance Atlanta's stature," Mr. Ratajczak said. "Now it may restore it."

HEADLINE: Some Reservists' Families Face a Financial Siege

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
While some reservists called to active duty worry about sun, sand, bullets and bombs, many of the families back home are fighting battles of their own.
"I'm embarrassed to be around my in-laws because of all the money I've borrowed," said Isabel Cranston, a 30-year-old mother of three in Charlotte, N.C., whose husband, Gary, left his $2,500-a-month job with USAir when he was called to active duty in the Air Force Reserves. 
Mr. Cranston's monthly paycheck as an enlisted man is $1,800. Since he was called up, Mrs. Cranston has seen two credit cards canceled and has had to borrow from relatives. "Right now," she said, "I've got six diapers left. I'm hoping they'll last until payday."
While not unsympathetic to such problems, military officials say that all reservists are aware when they sign up that they can be called to active duty, and that Government programs cushion the impact for military families.
 
'Like Becoming Unemployed'
 Many families report no financial difficulty from the call to active duty, and military officials point out that all benefited from the extra income their part-time reserve duty provided before their call to active duty. Income from part-time reserve duty varies widely, depending on rank, but can easily total several thousand dollars a year.
But many of the 215,000 reservists called to active duty face financial strains that are a concern not just for them but for the military, which has made the reserves an integral part of the all-volunteer armed services.
"For many of these people, being called up is like becoming unemployed," said Luther R. Gatling, president of Budget and Credit Counseling Services, a nationwide organization.
 
'On Prayers and Hope'
 For some families, the impact has been traumatic.
Neal Satterwhite, a 44-year-old nurse in Chapel Hill, N.C., was called up for Army reserve duty in December and is now in the Persian Gulf. Administrative problems in getting any of his checks sent home and health problems at home have left his wife, Daisy, and three children reeling.
"We didn't make a lot of money, but we were comfortable," Mrs. Satterwhite said. "I had never been in a position before where I had to ask for money. We were down to nothing, just living on prayers and hope. My aunt brought me some food, and a woman at my church brought over some chicken. It's been a lot to deal with."
Some corporations either continue or supplement lost wages. But those who are self-employed or own their own businesses have no such relief.
 
A Dentist Adjusts
 Mr. Gatling, the credit counselor, said reservists tended to be older, better educated, and with more financial responsiblities than those on full-time military duty. Many are professionals with offices and businesses to maintain and major debts to pay off.
A year ago, after nine years in a partnership, George Priest, an Atlanta dentist, set up his own practice. Since his call-up, he still has to pay the $3,000 monthly rent on his office and other expenses. A salaried associate has been taken on to see patients. Dr. Priest, who was recently transferred to Fort Benning in Columbus, Ga., is now able to see patients on Saturdays.
But the income is less than half the $27,000 a month the practice generated. "The money coming in isn't enough to pay the bills," said Dr. Priest's wife, Sharon, mother of a 22-month-old son. "I've thought of getting a job, but especially with child care, what I could bring in would be insignificant compared to the bills we have to pay."
 
Cutting Back on Everything
 Most families are saving where they can. For Jo Beadling of Carver, Mass., and her three children, house rules now include no new clothes, no eating out and no heat on warmer winter days.
"You try to cut back, but with three kids, it's not as easy as it sounds," said Mrs. Beadling, whose husband, Keith, a freelance craftsman, is now a staff sergeant with the Army National Guard's 1058th Transportation Company in Saudi Arabia.
Military officials say they do not believe severe financial distress is widespread. "I hear sporadic reports of financial problems, but I haven't seen anything that indicates many people are really being pummeled," said Maj, Bill Maddox, a spokesman for the Office of the Chief Army Reserves.
Much of the financial impact is blunted by laws like the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act of 1940, which provides for a 6 percent cap on any previously incurred interest payments by reservists and offers protections against hasty evictions or foreclosures. And Congress is considering several bills to provide them protection from creditors and loans.
 
Most Creditors Are Helpful
 Military officials say most creditors have been sympathetic. "Of those creditors that I've talked with, and I've probably talked with a couple of hundred over the last few months, I have not had any that were not very, very willing to cooperate," said Col. Andrew Vanore, the judge advocate for the North Carolina National Guard.
Many military families say support groups, neighbors and local organizations have helped them.
Three weeks after Michael T. St. Amour, a 35-year-old technician from Milton, Vt., was sent to Saudi Arabia as a member of the 131st Engineers Combat Support Company, the family's trailer was gutted in a fire.
Since then, his insurance company has reimbursed him $32,000 for the trailer and $4,800 for living expenses until the family can settle into a new home. The Vermont National Guard took up a $1,000 collection for him, and other groups have raised amounts ranging from $400 to $25.
"Everybody out there is being supportive," said Mr. St. Amour, who got an emergency leave to deal with the problems at home and was scheduled to return to Saudi Arabia this weekend.
For some families, help from support groups and the resolution of administrative difficulties have solved the most pressing problems. Mrs. Satterwhite said she was expecting her husband's check within a week.
For most, however, problems are likely to mount. Beverly Ashby of Charleston, S.C., said that because of days off her husband accumulated over the years she had been getting his old salary since his Air Force Reserve unit was called up. That will last until April. After that, she may have to pull her daughter from her private school.
"I'm looking at a salary being almost cut in half," she said. "We would basically be living by the skin of our teeth."

HEADLINE: MEDICAID IS DENIED DISCOUNTED DRUGS DESPITE A NEW LAW

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Congress recently passed a law requiring drug companies to give Medicaid the same deep discounts they give other big customers. But instead of reducing Medicaid drug prices, many companies are now raising the prices that those other big customers must pay.
For two decades, Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for poor people, has paid more for prescription drugs than other large buyers, like government and private health groups, which have negotiated discounts of 25 percent to 60 percent or more from the usual wholesale prices. 
 Until last year, the Government did not demand such discounts because Federal Medicaid officials did not focus much on the cost of drugs and drug companies argued that their prices were justified by the high costs of research.
 
Industry Opposed Legislation
 Under the law, which was passed over objections from the drug industry and took effect on Jan. 1, drug makers must offer state Medicaid programs the lowest price available to any buyer in the market.
Now drug companies are increasing prices to some of those other buyers, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, prepaid health plans like the giant Kaiser Permanente group, hospitals, family planning clinics and community health centers for migrant workers, homeless people and the indigent. Health care experts say these added costs may soon trickle down to consumers in the form of higher medical costs, and ultimately, insurance premiums.
In October, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Medicaid discounts would save $1.9 billion for the Federal Government and $1.4 billion for the states over five years. Assuming that such savings would be achieved, Congress substantially expanded Medicaid benefits for pregnant women, children and frail elderly people.
 
Backers Voice Objections
 Supporters of the 1990 legislation are furious about the drug companies' move. The chief sponsor, Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, said the price increases appeared to be "an attempt to circumvent the new Medicaid law," shift costs and nullify the savings envisioned by Congress.
Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, acknowledged that the price increases were legal, but he added: "This is a very foolish move by drug companies. It will be seen as a transparent attempt to get around the intent of Congress."
In opposing the legislation, the drug industry termed it a violation of "free market principles" and warned that it would disrupt the market. Jeffrey C. Warren, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said its 100 member companies "make their own decisions about prices and do not talk among themselves about the effects of the new Medicaid drug law on individual companies because such discussions could raise substantial antitrust issues."
 
Changes Termed 'Logical'
 But a lobbyist for the drug industry, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said: "We are surprised that Senator Pryor is surprised. I don't know what else he would have expected. It's logical that companies would re-examine their prices if Congress passes a law saying that Medicaid, which accounts for about 10 percent of our revenues, must get the best price given to any pharmaceutical customer in the country."
More than 16 million people, about two-thirds of all Medicaid recipients, get drugs through the Medicaid program each year. Medicaid spent $3.7 billion on drugs in 1989, or $280 million more than it spent for doctors' services.
Medicaid benefits vary from state to state. All states pay for all or most costs of prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients. Many also pay for a few selected over-the-counter medications when bought on written instructions from a doctor.
In the 1980's, Medicaid's spending for drugs increased faster than its payments for inpatient hospital care, nursing homes, doctors or dentists. Data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that prescription drug prices rose an average of 9.6 percent a year in the last decade, while the Consumer Price Index for all items rose an average of 4.5 percent a year.
Drug companies say the increase in prices reflects the increased costs of developing new medicines as researchers use more complex technology and focus on chronic diseases requiring long clinical studies.
 
Savings on Several Fronts
 Congress ordered the discounts in an effort to control Medicaid costs after concluding that drug companies had not been forced to make any significant contribution to reducing the Federal budget deficit. Over the last 10 years, lawmakers repeatedly squeezed savings out of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, hospitals and doctors.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which pays some of the lowest prices in the country for the drugs used at its 172 hospitals, says the latest price increases come on top of the usual inflation.
John E. Ogden, director of pharmacy services for the department, said drug company representatives had told him the price increases were a response to the new Medicaid law.
The veterans agency spends $700 million a year on drugs and in the past has negotiated discounts as big as 90 percent for some items.
The Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, a joint venture of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and Merck & Company Inc., recently sent letters to customers announcing that it had discontinued discounts for hospitals on large bottles of five drugs for outpatient use: Coumadin, Ethmozine, Percocet, Percodan and Sinemet. The letters did not give a reason for the action, but said discounts would still be allowed on tablets sold in single-dose packages for hospital patients.
Hospital pharmacists say Du Pont employees told them the requirement for Medicaid discounts was a factor in the new prices.
But Joseph F. Boudreau, director of sales operations for the company, denied that the move away from large-volume discounts was a result of the Medicaid law, saying instead that it reflected the company's new preference for "a one-price policy."
 
Contracts Being Reassessed
 Officials of Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest health maintenance organization, with 6.5 million members, say that drug companies are suddenly trying to renegotiate multiyear contracts and raise prices.
Daniel D. Danzig, a spokesman for Kaiser, said the moves were "clearly related to the new law," because drug companies did not want to have to offer Medicaid discounts. Mr. Danzig said Kaiser, which spends $500 million a year on drugs, feared that the increase in drug prices would force higher ipremiums for its members.
Officials of Kaiser and several other health-care organizations said they would resist the drug price increases. If they retained their discounts, Medicaid would be entitled to similar discounts on certain drugs for at least a few months. But as contracts expire or are renegotiated, drug prices would rise for both private buyers and Medicaid programs. Under the law, the best or lowest price for each drug is calculated four times a year.
Health maintenance organizations provide a comprehensive set of medical benefits to their members in return for flat monthly fees. Leslie Rose, chief lobbyist for the Group Health Association of America, which represents the organizations, said: "The reports we hear from H.M.O.'s across the country are really disturbing. They are being told by drug companies that the days of discounts are over, that drug prices will be raised. Clearly, this is an unintended effect of the new law."
 
Action Came Within Weeks
 Jose E. Camacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers, said that within weeks of passage of the Medicaid law 7 to 10 drug companies began trying to renegotiate the discount-price contracts for his organization, which buys drugs for 31 clinics serving 250,000 patients a year.
The clinics care for migrant workers, homeless people and others who have neither Medicaid nor private health insurance. In the past, Mr. Camacho said, such clinics have negotiated discounts averaging 40 percent below the wholesale price for brand name prescription drugs.
Officials of family planning clinics say they have been told by some drug companies that they should expect higher prices for oral contraceptives. Hoping to build brand loyalty as well as encourage family planning, drug companies typically offer such pills to clinics at a fraction of the list price.
Gerald F. Radke, director of the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, said that drug companies, in increasing prices, "may meet the letter of the law, but certainly do not meet the spirit of the legislation."

The Economy
The run on the Bank of New England was worrisome, but panic eased when the F.D.I.C. took over. The lesson is that a modern-day bank run is containable because of Federal deposit insurance. The situation is far different from Depression-era runs that wiped out the life savings of millions. [Page 1.] The press has played an important role in recent months in shaping public confidence in many banks and attitudes toward the banking industry. [33.]
A majority of forecasters insist that the recession will end by August, basing their optimism on the behavior of past recessions and big recent rises in stock prices. By their own admission, however, they are playing down troubling features of this recession that could prove them wrong. [29.]
A new law requires drug companies to give Medicaid the same deep discounts they give other big customers. But instead of reducing Medicaid drug prices, many companies are raising the prices that other big customers must pay. Health-care experts say these added costs may soon trickle down to consumers in the form of higher medical costs, and ultimately, insurance premiums. [1.]
The problems of domestic auto makers are being aggravated by a decline in the sales of some of its most profitable products: full-size pickup trucks and vans. Sales of light trucks, which include pickup trucks, vans and sports-utility vehicles, declined 7 percent in the fourth quarter, while car sales rose 1 percent. [29.]
Some small companies that thought they were recession-resistant a finding they are not. Not only are consumers holding back on new purchases, but goods and services bought are frequently paid for more slowly. [29.]
A California company is proposing what may be the ultimate wilderness experience for those who think they are roughing it when they peer at mountains and canyons through the windshield of a car: viewing a magnificent film about Zion National Park on a giant wrap-around movie screen, without ever having to set foot in the park. [1.]
The Atlanta metropolitan area is expected to lose jobs this year for the first time since 1974. The demise of Eastern Airlines may have struck the final blow to the optimism of the city, the engine that drives Georgia's economy. [10.]
Cattle ranchers say they face bigger challenges than the extreme weather of places like Wyoming, the constant hard work and even weak beef prices. What bothers some of them the most, they say, are growing attacks on their products from the medical community and environmentalists. [32.]
 
 The Media Business
Young & Rubicam is trying to regain the edge it held in the creative revolution of the 1960's. To that end, the agency has hired an outsider to head its New York creative department, which suffers from an image of making lackluster ads. [29.]
NBC is in the middle of a high-stakes game of programming poker as it tries to extend the lives of aging hit comedies. Even winning the game will cost NBC a potful of money; the producers of "Cheers," for example, are reportedly seeking $4 million an episode. But losing could end NBC's ratings dominance and even send the network into third place. Bill Carter: Television. [34.]
The gulf war is cutting into the publicity that new books receive. Some authors have had book tours curtailed or canceled. Others are finding it increasingly difficult to get television interviews. As a result, sales of some books are likely to fall. And the publication of at least one travel book has been delayed. [34.]
The BBC World Service has expanded its Arabic-language broadcasts to the Middle East. The Arabic Service provides news to 10 million listeners, the BBC estimates. [34.]
 
 International
Several Soviet economists say the Soviet Union's transition to a market economy remains irreversible, even if recent developments have slowed the process, because the old centrally planned system has been too dismantled and discredited to be rebuilt. [29.]

HEADLINE: Slump Not Exclusive, Private Schools Find

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
New York City's "other" school system -- where families pay $10,000 a year and more for the kind of education that most public schools cannot provide -- has lost whatever immunity it had to hard times.
This year, the city's version of the old boy and girl network -- the nation's largest and oldest alliance of nondenominational schools -- has been stunned by the effects of recent financial and population changes. Teachers are being laid off, class sizes are rising, two sets of schools have decided to merge, two others are selling real estate to survive and another narrowly averted closing. 
 Private school tuitions are soaring, and a growing number of parents are applying for financial aid or have withdrawn their children and moved to suburbs with good public schools.
Part of the problem is a drop in the number of students of high-school age, and part of the problem is money: The same slump that is making it harder for parents to pay tuitions that skyrocketed during the 1980's is battering endowments and fund-raising efforts.
"New York's private-school marketplace is shrinking, which means that schools are more and more in competition with one another," said Augustus Trowbridge, the director and founder of the Manhattan Country School. "And with fewer students, there will be fewer schools."
While some schools with traditionally strong academic programs -- among them Dalton, Horace Mann, Chapin, Trinity and Brearley -- remain healthy in both endowments and prospective applicants, many headmasters and admissions directors acknowledge that many of the city's 65 private nondenominational schools are ever more aggressively marketing themselves in order to fill classrooms -- and bank accounts.About 32,000 students, excluding preschoolers, are enrolled in the city's independent schools -- a slight decrease that was the first in many years, said Frederick Calder, the executive director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools. Letters of acceptance were recently sent out, and headmasters are now nervously waiting to see if the numbers of students accepting offers of admission by the March deadlines will continue to decline slowly, or begin a more precipitous fall.
 
New Attention to Bottom Line
 The troubles have clearly affected some schools much more than others, deepening divisions between the most socially and academically prestigious schools, respected middle-tier schools and those without the reputations to attract enough paying applicants, many educators say. This de facto hierarchy and the new attention to the bottom line are subjects that many in the private school community are reluctant to discuss -- in part because they have always guarded their privacy and that of their stu dents and in part because pride and reputation are keystones in maintaining a place in the independent-school market.
One school recently confronted by these brutal realities has been Walden Lincoln. Three years ago, the Walden and New Lincoln Schools, both early-20th-century Progressive schools, merged after a decade of declining enrollments. New Lincoln's East 77th Street building was sold to the Birch Wathen School for about $7 million, said Richard Marotta, Walden Lincoln's director. In 1987, Walden sold property next to its school on Central Park West and 88th Street to a developer, Sutton East Associates, for $5 million, with another $2 million dependent on condominium sales by Sutton East.
Despite this huge cash infusion, in December Walden Lincoln's board voted the school out of existence after a two-year, $3.6 million loss, and it was taken over by the Day School, an East Side elementary school.
"Walden Lincoln parents initially felt betrayed and tremendous loss," John Dexter, the Day School's headmaster, said of the takeover.
 
Teachers Fear Big Pay Cuts
 Though some parents plan to pull their children from the merged school, and almost half of Walden Lincoln's 50 teachers may be laid off, Mr. Dexter and Mr. Marotta voice confidence that a bigger school will be a better, more financially stable one. But some Walden Lincoln teachers worry that they may take a big pay cut at the Day School, and that Walden Lincoln is trying to avoid more than $200,000 in severance pay to laid-off teachers.
In another effort to avert financial catastrophe, the Birch Wathen and Lenox Schools agreed in November to merge next fall and are trying to sell one of Lenox's two buildings. Just two years before, the merged McBurney, Baldwin and Rhodes Schools folded.
Selling real estate has also been the formula for several other schools to remain solvent. The Fleming School, a 35-year-old elementary school that has emphasized French culture, recently sold its two East 62d Street buildings for $13 million and moved to a more modestly priced $6 million building on West 79th Street this fall. Ray-Eric Correa, the headmaster, described the move as a way of paying off debts and trying to attract more students.
St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, on West 114th Street, is trying to sell its air rights to Columbia University for $1 million, and 100 acres that it owns near Brewster, N.Y., for another $1 million, said the headmistress, Lynne Allen, in order "to finance ourselves when enrollment is going down."
After years of tuition increases that roughly paralleled the consumer price index, tuitions soared during the 1980's. The average tuition at a private Manhattan high school jumped by 40 percent in the last five years, partly to bring teacher salaries closer to public-school pay levels, Mr. Calder said. Teacher salaries are about $18,000 to $50,000, still less than in public schools, but low teacher-student ratios -- about 1 to 8 -- keep salary costs per student considerably higher.
 
Economic Diversity in Peril
 While more parents are finding themselves unable to afford that kind of tuition, the hardship is leading not to a large number of students' switching to New York City public schools, but to an increase in parents' leaving the city or requesting financial aid.
"High costs have driven many families out of New York, and the erosion of the city's middle class has been a big problem for private schools," said Brian Wright, the headmaster of Birch Wathen. "We've had a number of parents who've lost jobs and come to us in midyear asking for financial aid or deferring tuition payments."
The financial-aid requests pose another economic conundrum. Even before the recent surge in aid requests, private schools have been trying to broaden their ethnic and socioeconomic profile by admitting and giving scholarships to poorer white, black, Hispanic and other minority students. Consequently, the aid given to private-school students has doubled in the last five years, to $47.4 million in New York State and $267 million nationally.
"If families with kids already in private schools are now requesting financial aid, how can we also attract a new, more diversified student body needing scholarships?" said Randolph Carter, an official of the National Association of Independent Schools.
Many administrators say that the most vulnerable schools include high schools, smaller schools, girls' schools and newer experimental schools.
 
Concern for Girls' Schools
 And while officials of established girls' schools like Spence, Hewitt and Convent of the Sacred Heart say that their applications have held up, there is concern that a national trend toward co-education may cause a drop in girls' schools' enrollments. A 36-member National Coalition of Girls' Schools -- which includes Brearley, Marymount, Chapin, Hewitt and Nightingale-Bamford in New York -- was established two years ago to promote the values of a single-sex education. said Arlene Gibson, the coalition's chairwoman.
The coalition's efforts illustrate a new emphasis among schools to publicize themselves and to appeal to families who have never sent children to private schools.
Glossy new school prospectuses, open houses for prospective students, hiring public relations concerns and even newspaper advertising are signs of this new marketing consciousness, said Cynthia Bing, the head of the Schools Advisory Service, which provides information on New York City private schools.
Others see another kind of change at work. "Even the top-tier schools are taking kids they might not have taken in the past," said William A. Spiegler, an education-marketing consultant.
 
Harder to Raise Money
 Declining enrollments are also forcing schools to look harder for other revenues, but the current recession and 1986 tax-law changes have made it harder for all nonprofit institutions to raise money.
Creative fund raising was key to the unexpected survival of the Elisabeth Irwin High School earlier this month.
"The school was on the brink of closing," said Andrew McLaren, the director of Elisabeth Irwin and the Little Red Schoolhouse, its affiliated elementary school. "A majority of trustees were recommending that we close because, with our falling enrollment, they couldn't see any way out financially."
But the plight of the school "energized our community in an extraordinary way," Mr. McLaren said. In the weekend before the board was to vote on closing the school, one board member raised $250,000, and a $1 million fund-raising campaign was begun.
"I got a letter from a colleague congratulating us for pioneering a good fund-raising concept -- a sort of Phoenix number, closing in order to emerge from the ashes reborn," he said. But, noting that many schools may not be able to tap such last-minute largesse, he added: "I wouldn't recommend it as a long-term financial solution."

HEADLINE: SPRING TRAINING;
A Time of New Hopes And New Teammates

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
With all due respect to Aldous Huxley, John Schuerholz said, "It's the new Brave world."
Schuerholz is the new general manager of the Atlanta Braves, and in an effort to abandon last place, which the team has firmly held the last three years, he has spent an active off season adding players he believes can spur the Braves onward and upward. 
 That quest, of course, is No. 1 on the priority lists of 22 teams each winter because they are the ones that did not win division championships the year before. With many other general managers having joined Schuerholz in bids to bolster their clubs' chances, a small army of players will head in new directions this week as they prepare to begin spring training.
Pitchers and catchers from 15 teams are scheduled to ache their way through their first workouts Friday. Their colleagues from the other 11 teams will begin in the ensuing four days. By March 2, a week from Saturday, all 26 teams will be in full-squad workouts, with exhibition games beginning five days after that.
This spring the players will have a full six weeks of workouts and games. Last spring the players were locked out during the negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement and ended up with less than three full weeks of organized spring training.
Perhaps the player who will have the most difficult task finding his way to his new spring camp is Dwight Evans. After 18 years with the Boston Red Sox, Evans has joined the Baltimore Orioles. Rick Cerone, on the other hand, has become accustomed to traveling to new camps in the spring. In heading for Port St. Lucie, Fla., and the Mets' complex, he will be switching sites for the ninth time in the last 16 springs.
Some teams, like the Braves, have made such wholesale changes that they will have to give their players extra time to introduce themselves to one another. New to the Atlanta camp, for example, will be Terry Pendleton, Sid Bream, Juan Berenguer, Mike Heath, Rafael Belliard, Glenn Wilson and Deion Sanders, all of whom Schuerholz signed as free agents.
 Joe McIlvaine, another new general manager, has been at least as busy as Schuerholz, but he has an advantage in getting the newcomers acclimated. The San Diego Padres train in Yuma, Ariz., and it's so isolated with so little to do that the players will have more than enough time to get to know one another. McIlvaine, who admitted he's not a "stand pat" executive, is counting on the new players to have a positive influence on their new, young teammates.
Ticking off the people he has acquired, McIlvaine noted that Marty Barrett, "a guy who got shunted aside in Boston, is like Ray Knight."
"He doesn't have great physical tools," McIlvaine said of Barrett, "but he's a winning type of player. He's been in the World Series. The Toronto guys" -- Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez -- "have been in the playoffs. Larry Andersen has been in the playoffs. You try to bring in some people who have had success and hope it rubs off on the younger players."
McIlvaine has also brought in Jim Presley, Wes Gardner, Oscar Azocar and Scott Coolbaugh. The Blue Jays, with whom McIlvaine made a stunning December trade, grew tired of being a preseason pick and an end-of-season flop. Pat Gillick, usually the antonym of McIlvaine, shook up his troops by obtaining Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar, Devon White, Pat Tabler, Ken Dayley and some lesser-known players.
The Los Angeles Dodgers, one of the most active teams in the most active division, spent $30 million to create two-thirds of a new outfield with Darryl Strawberry and Brett Butler. They also added two veteran starting pitchers, Bob Ojeda and Kevin Gross.
"It's a tough division," Schuerholz said. "It seems every move one club made another club answered with a salvo of their own. We made some moves we felt would make us a substantially greater club, but so have other clubs in the division."
The Dodgers also invited another veteran pitcher, John Candelaria, and a veteran catcher, Gary Carter, to spring training, giving them a chance to put in one last year while possibly providing needed bench strength. Carter and Candelaria are two of a group of players, aging and otherwise, issued such invitations.
The group also includes Rich (Goose) Gossage, by Texas; Ernie Whitt, by Baltimore; Rick Dempsey, by Milwaukee; Rich Gedman, by St. Louis; Bob Boone, by St. Louis, and Darnell Coles, by Houston. This could be the final spring for some well-traveled catchers.
 This will be the first spring with teams for other players, who are certain to have a greater impact than the invitees.
Vince Coleman, for example, will be relied upon to serve as the catalyst for a Mets' offense devoid of Strawberry's home runs. Hubie Brooks, returning to his starting place, is expected to replace some of the runs Strawberry produced.
Jack Morris will add stability and leadership to a young Minnesota starting rotation, and Kansas City will look to Kirk Gibson, perhaps no longer the offensive threat he once was, to provide the fiery leadership he has displayed in Detroit and Los Angeles. Mike Boddicker joins an already strong Royals pitching rotation.
After 10 years with the Yankees, Dave Righetti has gone home to San Francisco to lead the Giants' bullpen, leaving his spot in New York open to perhaps Steve Farr. Scott Sanderson also has joined the Yankees' pitching staff.
Tim Raines, the new left fielder for the Chicago White Sox, is in the American League for the first time, eager to show that Rickey Henderson is not in a class by himself. George Bell, on the other hand, has moved to the National League, adding a potent bat to an already strong Chicago Cubs lineup. The Cubs, in an uncharacteristic spending spree, also signed Danny Jackson and Dave Smith as free agents, establishing themselves in the view of many as the team most likely to finish No. 1 in the National League East.
But what about the movement of a collection of players who finished No. 1 in offensive categories in the National League?
Willie McGee, the batting champion, is in San Francisco; Butler, who tied for the lead in hits, is in Los Angeles; Jack Clark, who walked more than anybody, has left the league and gone to Boston; so has Danny Darwin, who had the National League's lowest earned run average. Carter, the leader in games played and times batted, has returned to the American League with Toronto, and Glenn Davis, hit by more pitches than anyone else, is in Baltimore.
Rob Deer and Mickey Tettleton are in Detroit, meaning the Tigers could create a gustier breeze than the Cubs get from Lake Michigan. Deer, Tettleton and Cecil Fielder, teammates now, were among the top seven strikeout artists (they use not a brush but a bat) in the American League last year. They struck out a collective 489 times last year.
Given the escalating economy baseball has created, the Tigers could save a lot of money on baseballs this year. What they can't hit won't leave the field.

HEADLINE: The City and State Are One

 BODY:
If New York City and State hope to surmount their shared fiscal crisis, they will have to cooperate. The counterproductive war now going on ignores the obvious: There is no way to separate the two.
The state is the city's bank, the source of at least a quarter of its money -- and of rigorous rules that tell the city how to spend that money. The city is the state's engine, the place where economic activity generates half the state's tax revenues. There is even a mechanism already in place for state-city cooperation. The only hitch is that it is misunderstood and thus mistrusted. 
 Mayors have resented the Financial Control Board ever since it was created to help the city escape the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. Mayor David Dinkins recoils at the very thought that the Control Board, now functioning in only an advisory capacity, would ever regain its original power to approve and veto the city budget. That, city officials think, would be seen as a sign of failure.
But Mr. Dinkins's reservations are based on a misconception of what the Control Board could mean to a city under budgetary siege, now that the state, too, is in economic trouble. The state is planning a deep cut in aid to the city to help close its own huge budget gap. It also imposes laws, rules and mandates that require costly, often unreasonable, spending.
In this climate, nothing could benefit the city more than a mechanism that encouraged close city and state cooperation, forcing Gov. Mario Cuomo to confront his role in the city's fiscal life. The board, headed by the Governor, can be that mechanism.
"The Control Board is not a hair shirt," says Hugh Carey, the Governor during the last fiscal crisis. "It was designed to bring the city and state together to match wits and figures, to see how they can solve their problems. You're not going to solve the state's problems without the city and you're not going to solve the city's without the state."
The current crisis demands fundamental changes -- in city spending, in state spending and in the relationship between the two. There is no better place to examine such matters than on the Control Board, which in addition to the Governor includes the Mayor, the city and state comptrollers and three gubernatorial appointees from the private sector.
The board would also be the appropriate panel to consider the financier Felix Rohatyn's proposition that it might be preferable for the city to use borrowed money, accompanied by a prudent spending plan, rather than make unthinkably harsh cuts.
Mr. Dinkins and his administration have made grave fiscal mistakes -- especially by negotiating costly labor contracts. They have produced an unrealistic spending plan that will be difficult to carry out and have yet to cut programs enough or to weigh structural changes. But any mayor would have trouble pulling the city through this recession. Tax revenues continue to drop, and if things get bad enough, the Control Board's oversight powers will be triggered by law. That happens if the city's budget is $100 million in deficit on June 30, the end of the fiscal year, or if the city cannot sell its bonds.
Why wait? Mr. Dinkins could show strong leadership, political courage and enlightened self-interest if he invited the participation of the Control Board now. As Hugh Carey says, "When the problem is this severe, you'd better bring the two groups together."

HEADLINE: Crossroads in Mental Health: Red Ink and Unused Wards

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GOWANDA, N.Y., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Ward 50 at the state-run Gowanda Psychiatric Center in southwestern New York seems a throwback to the age of asylums. Like geriatric wards at mental hospitals across the state, the day room is well scrubbed and cheerfully decorated, but most of the 18 elderly patients are lost in schizophrenic hazes, captives of their wheelchairs.
Ravaged by decades of mental illness and confinement, they mumble incoherently as accordion music seeps from a stereo. Their limbs jerk involuntarily; their faces contort into images from Edvard Munch. One of the few lucid patients, an 82-year-old woman who has lived here for seven years, shows off a Valentine from her daughter, then begins to weep. 
 Last month, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget proposed closing Gowanda, Ward 50 became a symbolic crossroads for a state mental health system that is struggling with its evolution from institutionalization to community care. Whether the Cuomo administration can persuade the Legislature to close the hospital over the protest of organized labor may provide the clearest sign of that system's future.
 
Millions for Empty Beds
 Since the 1950's, when psychiatry was revolutionized by the introduction of mood-leveling drugs, New York's mental hospitals have been discharging patients into group homes, outpatient programs and, disturbingly, into the streets. But the state still spends nearly three-fourths of its $2 billion mental health budget to maintain 22 underused centers that now are part hospital, part nursing home.
While the state continues to run the largest network of psychiatric hospitals in the country, it is not meeting a dire need to expand community mental health services like group homes, outpatient centers and acute-care units in general hospitals.
Historically, the combined political forces of the local economy and organized labor, whose members staff the centers, have prevented the Office of Mental Health from closing hospitals. But in a year when the state faces a $6 billion budget gap, the fiscal pressure to shut doors may finally rival the political pressure to keep them open.
State officials have announced a campaign to close four hospitals by the end of the decade, beginning with Gowanda in southwestern Erie County. The proposal has generated a heated debate in the Legislature about the wisdom of mothballing hospitals when there is no money for a commensurate expansion of community services.
 
Where Would Patients Go?
 Mr. Cuomo's budget for the 1991-92 fiscal year, which begins on April 1, would cut $110 million in mental health spending, virtually all of it from state hospitals. But while the budget projects a decline of 1,200 hospital patients during the year, from 13,700 to 12,500, it would also cut $5 million in grants to community mental health programs.
That has raised the prospect that deinstitutionalized patients could wind up untreated and homeless.
The leaders of the Legislature's mental health committees, Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, Democrat of Staten Island, and Senator Nicholas A. Spano, Republican of Yonkers, worry that closing the hospitals now may make fiscal sense without making good policy.
"Deinstitutionalization without sufficient community programs is a formula for disaster," Ms. Connelly said.
The state's mental health commissioner, Richard C. Surles, said he understands such concerns. But after seeing his department savaged by recent budget cuts, Mr. Surles said he is convinced that there may never be enough money for community services if hospitals remain open.
"This is not something I would have proposed were it not for the economic conditions," Mr. Surles said. "But I don't see anybody telling us that the state is going to put more money into the mental health budget. So if we don't close Gowanda, we're going to have to cut patient care."
New York has long had the largest and most expensive state mental health system in the country. In 1987, it spent almost $99 a citizen on mental health. Its closest rival, Massachussetts, spent almost $62. California spent just under $30.
The cost has been driven largely by the unwillingness to close hospitals, even as the state has locked unused wards and demolished unneeded buildings.
Mr. Surles estimates that 8,000 of the state's 185,000 mentally ill patients truly require hospitalization. But with the state unable to shift enough money from hospitals to community services, the hospitals have also become dumping grounds for elderly patients who could be treated in nursing homes, and clinics of last resort for younger patients who cannot find care elsewhere.
The cost is numbing. The hospital reimbursement rate for Medicaid patients, half of which is paid by the state, averages $473 a day, or $172,645 a year. A bed in an adult community residence costs the state $15,995 a year.
And because hospitals must meet standards of cleanliness and care to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, and because of strong and entrenched union opposition, the state has not been able to cut staffing at the same rate it has cut patient populations. At Gowanda, for instance, although dozens of employees have been laid off in recent months, 649 workers care for 300 patients. Officials at Gownada and other state hospitals argue that such staff-to-patient ratios are necessary for 24-hour-a-day, year- round care.
 
'A Lot of Money to Squander'
 The cost of maintaining state hospitals during Mr. Cuomo's eight-year tenure grew by $600 million, while the hospital population shrunk by nearly 10,000.
"That's a lot of money to squander on something that isn't state policy," said Evelyn R. Frankford, a mental health policy analyst for the State Communities Aid Association.
Mr. Surles, who has been commissioner since 1987, maintains that the state is heading in the right direction.
The population in state psychiatric hospitals, which peaked at 90,000 in the 1950's, has dropped to less than 14,000, from almost 20,000 in 1987. Ms. Frankford and other lobbyists credit Mr. Surles with starting several innovative programs aimed at shortening hospital stays and expanding community care.
But the Commissioner concedes that the state is meeting only 60 percent of its need for outpatient programs, and only half the need in New York City and on Long Island.
Mr. Surles said he believed he could ultimately save $100 million a year by closing the four hospitals, mostly by eliminating administrative costs and by canceling planned renovation projects.
But John R. Collier, Gowanda's executive director, predicted that the state would save little by closing the hospital, rated among the state's best. Two hundred and twenty-five of its patients are geriatrics, like those in Ward 50, who would have to be transferred to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center.
Other patients -- one hospital official said they "usually come in either a sheriff's car or an ambulance" -- would either have to be admitted to the Buffalo center or find space in community programs in Gowanda's four-county service area.
That region is meeting only a fraction of its need for most mental health services, and would have to expand them greatly to compensate for closing Gowanda, said C. Richard Orndoff, the Office of Mental Health's regional director for western New York.
If closing Gowanda poses a logistical problem, it may pose an even greater political problem. The Public Employees Federation and the Civil Service Employees Association have pledged to defend the hospital's workers, along with thousands of others that Mr. Cuomo plans to lay off, with a $1 million advertising campaign.
Because the psychiatric center has long been the area's largest employer, residents and their legislators have also turned up the heat. Retailers like Stephen L. Cocca, who owns Gowanda's only jewelry store, say they fear that the village of 2,200 would become a ghost town.
Some jobs could be saved if the state followed through on plans to convert the hospital into prison space, but village leaders note that prison jobs would pay far less than the hospital's average annual salary of $33,000.
Three hundred people braved a snowstorm to attend a rally in Gowanda in late January. Yellow signs reading "Keep Gowanda Psychiatric Center Open" are displayed in store windows on Main Street along with American flags.
In normal times, such pressures might quickly kill a proposal to close the hospital. But Cuomo aides hope the state budget crisis will force legislators to accept cuts this year that might otherwise seem unthinkable.
"The only way we'll ever be able to do anything for community mental health in a big way is to downsize the state institutions," said Michael J. Dowling, the Governor's deputy secretary for human services. "If we don't do it now, I don't know that we'll ever have an opportunity to do it again."

Maddox Maintains Community Ties

BYLINE: BY CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
Ralph Kiner, the Mets' broadcaster, was once moved to say that "two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, the other one-third is covered by Garry Maddox."
As a major leaguer, Maddox, known as the secretary of defense, indeed played his position superbly, More important, he played his role even better in showing what could be accomplished off the field as well as on. 
 Even though he is five years removed from the game, Maddox is still quite the secretary of defense, only now he defends as best he can children who cannot defend themselves.
He has done so for nearly 14 years as an integral part of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic, a place where the most innocent victims of violence in the home can find refuge.
 
Knowing Violence First-Hand
 Maddox knows all about such needs, for he has seen what violence can do to a soul. The night of his most recent fundraiser for the children's clinic, Maddox gave a hint of how thorough his education has been.
The occasion was the 14th annual Garry Maddox Celebrity Bowling Tournament put on to benefit the clinic. This year the tournament happened to fall on Jan. 17, which was also the second day of the United States-led coalition's war against Iraq.
As other celebrities paired off the bowl at a South Philadelphia locale, Maddox met with reporters. He was asked if he felt it was appropriate that the Super Bowl go on as scheduled, considering the events of the day.
Maddox said yes. Such events are important to service men and women who might listen on Armed Forces Radio or watch via satellite, he explained. Maddox knew. He once clutched a radio so he could hear the 1969 World Series while serving as an Army combat infantryman in Vietnam.
 
Apology of Sorts
 Days later, Maddox was almost apologetic about the reference. "I've made it my policy not to speak about the war," he said of the conflict that snatched him from the minor league system of the San Francisco Giants at the age of 19. "I hope you understand."
And rare have been the glimpses the quiet, almost introverted Maddox has given. But there had been enough during his playing days for one to see that life at a forward base near Chu Lai was hell because it was war.
Maddox came out of Vietnam whole if not completely healthy at first (skin rashes caused by allergies made it all but impossible for him to shave, thus resulting in his trademark beard, worn well before facial hair was commonly accepted in baseball).
Most important, Maddox did not return a bitter man. Instead, he immersed himself into society and the game which he played so spectacularly at times, as evidenced by eight Gold Gloves and a championship ring.
 
Feelings of Obligation
 Maddox came to the Child Guidance Clinic shortly after being traded to the Phillies in 1975. He had to, Maddox figured, because he had just become a member of an athletic community that was a veritable hotbed of such activities.
Julius Erving, Mike Schmidt, Bobby Clark, Bill Bergey, superstars all, seemed to be everywhere espousing various causes.
"It was so different in those days," Maddox said. "If you came to play in Philadelphia, you made it your home. And it seemed like everyone wanted to help the community."
In 1977, the bowling tournament was born. In any given year in that era, Maddox and his one-time co-host, Larry Bowa, would draft Erving, Schmidt, Pete Rose, Steve Carlton and ballplayers from around the country to participate.
Today, it's still the draw; fans come to see Charles Barkley, the musician Grover Washington Jr. and the like.
"Those guys are the ones who really make it successful," said Maddox. But it is Maddox who's remained the constant.
Not that Maddox hasn't had a notion to give way.
"The 13th tournament was going to be my last," Maddox admitted. "But there's been a tendency in this country to cut back.
"With fewer grants and the trouble Philadelphia is having with its economy, the funds were getting real short. Being on the clinic's board, it was an easy problem to recognize. I didn't have to be asked to stay."
Maddox is not alone in his fervor, but he sadly says he does see a difference.
'It's not the same," Maddox admitted. "Free agency has brought a lot of good things, but a lot of changes, too. Players have become more dollar-conscious, so there's a lot more movement from team to team. They just don't stay around as long."
Maddox did stay though, through the end of his playing career in 1986, through to this day.
Fourteen years and more than a million dollars in solicited donations later, Maddox said: "It's not only just about giving something back. Whether we like it or not, athletes are role models. The sooner a player realizes that the better off he'll be."

HEADLINE: When a Big Bank Went Under, U.S. Presence Stemmed the Panic

SERIES: Banks Under Stress - Second of five articles: Anatomy of Bank Runs

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Jean Driscoll, the manager of the Bank of New England branch in Chestnut Hill, Mass., went to work on the morning of Jan. 4 expecting it to be just another Friday in the affluent Boston suburb. But there was nothing routine about it. By 8:30 A.M., there were long lines of anxious depositors at the tellers' windows and cash machines, withdrawing their money. The phones rang steadily with calls from worried customers. Bank officers tried to calm account holders, assuring them that their savings were federally insured up to $100,000.
 But to little effect. There were similar scenes at many of the Bank of New England's 300 branches. Frantic depositors pulled nearly $1 billion out of the bank in two days; small savers trooped through the lobbies with their money in wallets, bulging envelopes and briefcases, and money managers yanked out multimillion-dollar deposits by remote control with computer and telex orders. 
Some local crooks even tried to get in on the action. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it foiled a plan by six men who had hoped to rob an armored car they figured would be loaded with cash for all the withdrawals.
 Yet as soon as Washington stepped in, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking over the bank on Sunday, the panic subsided. On Monday morning, the doors of the Chestnut Hill branch were opened, and it was business as usual. "We even started to see some money come back," Ms. Driscoll recalls.
 Certainly, the bank run of today is not something to be taken lightly. The Bank of New England case underscores how rapidly public confidence can evaporate. The real lesson in the view of most banking experts, however, is that the modern-day bank run is containable. The bank run of today is far different from the situation in the days before deposit insurance, far different from the Depression-era runs that wiped out the life savings of millions of people and destroyed the American economy. Runs by individual depositors are extremely rare and are likely to remain so, even in times when a rare combination of harsh economic forces collide, as they are doing now amid high deficits, low growth and the stresses of war. The safety net of Federal insurance and regulation does appear to hold.
 At the Bank of New England, the main concern of small account holders was that they would not have access to their money for days or weeks if the bank closed. Few expressed fears of actually losing their money. And it took an unusual series of events -- recent failures by savings institutions in Rhode Island, steady press coverage of the bank's problems and the Jan. 4 announcement of a big loss -- to precipitate the temporary run that did occur.
 After looking back and surveying the damage, banking regulators and experts came away less concerned about conventional runs by the nation's individual depositors than about "silent" runs by corporations, foreign banks and other large institutions, whose money managers might decide to sell the certificates of deposit or commercial paper of banks that show signs of weakness. Usually, these no-confidence votes are made coolly in dealing rooms around the world. The verdicts may simply be relayed by computer, or telex, and can gather momentum with little warning.
 Big depositors have reason to move quickly when the first danger signs appear. There is no assurance that when a bank gets in trouble the Government will guarantee all accounts, even those of more than $100,000, as it did with the Bank of New England.
 Some flow of money away from American banks, mainly those burdened with bad loans from real estate and takeover deals, is already under way. It is a phenomenon that is difficult to measure precisely or to attribute entirely to eroding confidence in the banks. But in the past year or so, money market funds, foreign investors and American corporate treasurers have all cut back their holdings of certificates of deposit from United States banks.
 "The real issue for American banks," said Robert E. Litan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, "is the silent run that seems to be going on right now, and whether that run is gradual or whether it snowballs out of control."
 
The Bank Run

 Confidence Can Erode Quickly
 A bank run occurs when depositors take their money out of a bank, not to use it elsewhere -- to buy a new car or invest in Treasury bonds, say -- but because they are worried about the bank's stability. During a run, a bank must typically sell assets to pay its depositors or temporarily borrow money from the Government. If the run continues, the bank will eventually shrink to the point of collapse, as it loses deposits and sells more and more assets.
 Runs on a small number of banks, causing them to fail, would not be a real blow to the economy. But a more widespread loss could have a collective psychology about it that could deepen the current recession, effectively curb the credit available for growth and increase unemployment and business failures, experts warn.
 "Our whole financial system runs on confidence and not much else when you get down to it," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "What we've learned is that when confidence erodes, it erodes very quickly."
 Some analysts contend that bank runs are not a bad thing, if they represent a "flight to quality," shifting money from weaker banks to stronger ones. This kind of shift can keep the banks sharp. "The runs that involve the movement of funds from one bank to another are a good thing," said George Kaufman, a finance professor at Loyola University of Chicago. "And the threat of a bank run is a powerful source of market discipline."
 The winners in this flight to safe banking havens range from huge foreign institutions to tiny but financially strong rural banks. As qualms about some United States banks have grown, the American arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank has experienced a rise in corporate deposits, says Detlev Staecker, a general manager for Deutsche Bank in New York. In Newman Grove, Neb., a farm town of 750 people, the First National Bank of Newman Grove, an institution with $28 million in assets whose capital cushion far exceeds Federal standards, has pulled in more deposits recently from nearby communities.
 "We're even seeing it out here with small depositors," said Jeffrey Gerhart, the bank's president. "It's not a big stampede. But people want to deal with a bank they feel is going to be around next year and the year after, just as customers feel more comfortable dealing with an airline, a department store or a car dealer that is financially strong instead of one that seems shaky."
 But another group of analysts cautions that viewing bank runs as a market-driven agent of improvement and change may be a dangerous mistake. Their concern is that the scalpel edge of competition that may kill off a sick bank may reach out to pierce the healthy banks as well. "Market discipline and a bank panic can be synonymous," observed Lowell L. Bryan, a director of McKinsey & Company. "Nobody makes a bank deposit choosing to take a risk."
 It was this concern in the Bank of New England case, this fear of runs at other banks in the region, that led Federal regulators to move so quickly and to guarantee that even deposits of more than $100,000 would be fully insured. "When you have a problem with confidence, you have to act decisively to restore calm," Mr. Seidman said.
 
The Safety Net

 
Keeping Panic In Check
 Hugh Rockoff, an economic historian at Rutgers University, points out that when President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a bank holiday in 1933 in the depths of the Depression, half of the nation's banks had closed, industrial production had fallen by half and unemployment had risen to 25 percent. The United States was still on the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was not able to create money to bolster the financial system and the world was in the grip of a destructive trade war.
 Yet not only in the 1930's, but also in the bank panics of 1890 and 1837, Mr. Rockoff said, a powerful psychology was unleashed that quickly fed on itself and operated independently of the underlying causes that started the bank run. Once it started, he said, some people began losing confidence in the banking system, then no one had confidence, and it became "very difficult to trace the source of the panic."
 It is this contagious spiral of unreason that the modern system of bank regulation is designed to stop, and in recent years the Government has done reasonably well in putting that system to work.
 For the last decade, Alan Whitney, the director of communications for the F.D.I.C., has traveled across the country, helping to shut down failed banks. When the Government seized a failed bank, customers were sometimes confused about the arrangements, but rarely were account holders panicked, or did they force the Government to close a bank quickly by making a run on deposits, he recalled. The Bank of New England was the big exception.
 "People have gotten used to the idea that banks can fail, and that their funds are safe and they have access to their accounts," Mr. Whitney said.
 That the Government stands behind federally insured deposits was also underscored by the savings and loan crisis, which has proved costly for taxpayers but generally not for depositors. Most people are reassured by Federal deposit insurance, said Richard T. Curtin, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan.
 
Continuing Weakness

 
Big Depositors Go Elsewhere
 Ordinarily, large institutional depositors use banks as a place to park their spare cash by putting it in short-term certificates of deposit and the commercial paper of bank holding companies. Typically, their holdings at a bank exceed $100,000.
 For their part, the big money-center banks and large regionals are generally much more dependent on these sources of short-term money than small banks, which tend to rely mainly on the deposits of individual savers.
 Even among big banks, the situation can vary considerably, however. The failure of Continental Illinois Bank and Trust in 1984 was a result of a global run on its deposits. Continental had depended on short-term deposits made by large institutions from around the world. But those depositors fled fast once the Chicago bank's bad loans led to earnings problems. And the Continental case showed that once a silent run begins, it can quickly prove unstoppable.
 But when the Bank of America ran into earnings troubles in 1987, it did not suffer a run. "Bank of America never lost its faithful California depositors," said Christopher Mahoney, a bank analyst for Moody's Investors Service Inc. "Having retail deposits makes a bank much less sensitive to confidence problems."
 Now as the financial position of many banks has weakened, the big customers have pulled back. "The smart money is heading for the exits," observed Charles P. Kindleberger, an emeritus professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 The American bank holdings of major foreign depositors like Japan and Taiwan have been sharply trimmed. During the first nine months of 1990, Japan cuts its holdings in United States banks by $19.3 billion, to $92.5 billion, according to the Treasury Department. Over the same period, Taiwan reduced its American bank holdings by $7.1 billion, to $12.5 billion.
 Recently, Prudential-Bache Securities surveyed the treasurers of 100 of the nation's large corporations and found most of them reducing their deposits and dealings with banks showing signs of financial weakness. The survey concluded the shift was "equivalent to a long-term slow run on sicker banks."
 Corporate money managers are particularly sensitive to the marks given to banks by credit-rating agencies, like Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Last year, for example, Moody's downgraded the rating on banking companies 92 times, about double the number of such rating drops in the previous year. The major bank companies whose ratings were lowered a notch last year included Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific. Citicorp was downgraded again in January.
 Many institutions have cut back their large bank deposits. John Hackett, vice president of finance at Indiana University, says that of the university's $200 million in operating cash, well under 20 percent is in bank certificate of deposits, compared with 50 percent two years ago. "We're being very, very cautious about banks today," Mr. Hackett said.
 Whether confidence can be restored, thus containing the silent run that is under way, will depend on the basic condition of the nation's banking system. And that, in turn, will depend on whether bankers and bank regulators forcefully address the question of the industry's health.
 Next: Politics of reform
 
The Making And Breaking Of a Bank Run
1. With the economy strong, a big bank becomes overly aggressive, making enormous loans for real estate and other projects that seem to make sense - as long as the good times roll.
2. But when the economy weakens, developers cannot find tenants, and default on loans. Institutions - mutual funds, pension funds, corporations and other banks - see the trouble and silently begin to pull money out.
3. Because of its deposit - gathering troubles, the bank must shrink. It sells assets, like loans and credit-card operations, and reduces its work force.
4. The economy weakens further, more loans go bad and the bank's downturn accelerates.
5. Press coverage of the bank's problems helps alert small depositors to its weakness.
6. Reports of continued losses prompt a wave of withdrawals by small depositors, leaving the bank precariously short of funds.
7. The Federal Government declares the bank inxolvent, closes it, takes it over and reopens it almost immediately. Depositors have their accounts insured up to $100,000 and the F.D.I.C. tries to find a buyer - and business goes on.

HEADLINE: Toyota to Cut U.S. Exports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation will cut exports to the United States by 10,000 vehicles during February and March because of the soft American market, the company's president, Shoichiro Toyoda, said today.
But Mr. Toyoda stressed at a news conference that the auto maker, Japan's largest, would not reduce production at its plants in California and Kentucky, since that could further damage the sagging United States economy.
Toyota's sales in the United States fell an estimated 13 percent in January, compared with January 1990, to 63,568 vehicles, according to Yoshiharu Tateishi, a Toyota spokesman.
In 1990, Toyota's exports to the United States fell by 4 percent from a year earlier, to 703,000 vehicles, but production in the United States rose by 39 percent, to 320,000 vehicles, Mr. Tateishi said.
Toyota exported about 53,000 vehicles to the United States in February and 58,000 in March 1990, he said.
Toyota's planned cut in exports followed similar announcements by other big Japanese auto makers last month.
The Nissan Motor Company plans to trim exports by 4,500 to 5,000 vehicles in March, the Honda Motor Company by 20,000 in February and March, and the Mazda Motor Corporation by 8,000 in February and March. Honda also said it would trim production in Marysville, Ohio, by 5,000 vehicles between January and March.

HEADLINE: In a Tide of Japanese Books on Jews, an Anti-Semitic Current

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf war has led to a boom in book sales on all aspects of the Middle East. And once again among the best sellers are books about a subject that has long held a fascination for Japanese readers: the influence and power of Jews.
The popular titles include dozens of translated versions of standards in the United States and elsewhere. But also selling well, indeed as best sellers in major Tokyo bookstores, are books depicting a Jewish conspiracy to control the world economy. 
 The popularity of books about Jews in Japan is not new. But according to Masanori Miyazawa, a history professor who has compiled a bibliography on the subject, at least 100 new books related to Jews -- a record number -- were published last year, apparently because of the gulf crisis.
The specific appearance of the new anti-Semitic books, some of them published by mainstream houses, has again drawn the concern of Israeli diplomats and Jewish organizations, giving new impetus to the Jewish groups' campaign to inform publishers that Jews regard such books as repugnant.
 
'Total Ignorance of Judaism'
 "The publication of these books by itself doesn't worry me too much," said Nahum Eshkol, the Israeli Ambassador to Japan. "What worries me is the readiness of Japanese to buy them, maybe to read them, on the backdrop of maybe total ignorance of Judaism and Israel."
Leading American Jewish groups have met quietly with Japanese officials, politicians, opinion leaders and publishers, most recently in December, to discourage distribution of the books, but with little success.
A year and a half ago, the Japan Foreign Ministry responded by urging the Japan Book Publishers Association to be more sensitive, asserting in a memorandum that "the Government of Japan regrets to see that the label of 'Japanese anti-Semitism' has taken root among American Jews."
But the publishers group declined to distribute the ministry memorandum to members, saying it did not want to endorse censorship.
 
'Rebuffed by the Publishers'
 An official of the American Jewish Committee who had lobbied in Japan praised the Foreign Ministry, saying, "They put themselves on the line and were rebuffed by the publishers."
But the official, Neil C. Sandberg, director of the Committee's Pacific Rim Institute, said he found the publishers puzzled by the protests, wondering why Jews were not flattered to be thought so powerful.
"They told us, 'You're a member of a superior race and you come from a successful group and we're surprised this material concerns you,' " he recalled.
 
No Reports of Discrimination
 Books condemning Jews flourish inspite of the fact that the few hundred Jews who live in Japan experience no discrimination or even any evidence that Japanese distinguish them from other foreigners.
The anti-Semitic books continue to sell along with more mainstream works. At present, for instance, bookstores are featuring "The Arab-Israeli Wars," by Chaim Herzog, the President of Israel, along with books telling readers how to make money off stocks that Jews buy, plus others that speak of Jewish rituals and conspiracies.
One new book published in December, "Counterattack of Hitler," is a best seller at many book stores and has sold 30,000 copies. It denies the existence of the Holocaust and asserts that a Jewish conspiracy is being thwarted by Germany, Arabs and other groups.
Another new book, "Confessions of the Jews," by Paul Goldstein and Jeffrey Steinberg, two American followers of the political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, says the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the American Jewish group, engages in organized crime and drug-trafficking. The book has sold only 5,000 copies but is a best-seller in those bookstores carrying it.
 
Author of Anti-Semitic Books
 The author of the first book and the translator of the second is Masami Uno, an Osaka man whose books denouncing Jews have long sold well and are widely available. His book, "If You Understand Jews, You Can See the Whole World," has sold 540,000 copies since it was published in 1986.
Critics of such books, Jewish groups among them, are troubled less by their direct influence than by their general respectability. The new books are from subsidiaries of prestigious publishers and "Counterattack of Hitler" was recently advertised on the front page of the Asahi Shimbun, the nation's most prestigious newspaper.
"Right now, the Japanese are scared to death that Israel will enter the war, disrupt their oil supplies and start a third world war," said David G. Goodman, a professor of Japanese literature at the University of Illinois. But he added that a "blind spot" exists on Jews.
"In all the book stores, there are legitimate books along side this anti-Semitic garbage," Mr. Goodman said. "The question is why the Japanese don't seem to be able to tell the difference."
 
'A Deposit in People's Minds'
 Mr. Miyazawa, a history professor at Doshisha Women's College in Kyoto, who compiled the Jewish bibliography, said they tend to leave "a deposit in people's minds" that could "trigger anti-Semitism."
Indeed, Tatsuya Shoda, a manager at the main office of Maruzen book stores, a major chain, said Mr. Uno's books were stocked because he was widely respected as "an expert on Jewish issues." Mr. Uno declined to return several telephone calls asking for comment.
It is difficult to document the books' influence, but it is not uncommon for businessmen to express concern over what they see as excessive Jewish influence in American foreign policy.
"In Japan, there is no anti-Semitism," declared Takeshi Muromatsu, a literary critic on the board of the Japanese-Israel Friendship Association. "But many Japanese accept this Nazi-style stereotype that Jews control the world's finances. I would guess more than 80 percent of Japanese believe it."
 
Honor for American Financier
 The paradox, Mr. Muromatsu said, is that Japan and Jews have had good relations for many decades. For instance, Japanese histories continue to honor Jacob Schiff, the early 20th century New York financier, for helping Japan float war bonds to fight its war with Russia in 1904-05.
In the 1920's, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the notorious Russian forgery portraying a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world that became a Nazi propoganda tool, was published in Japan. Other Nazi propaganda circulated during World War II, but the Government protected Jews in Japan, Shanghai and Manchuria.
Today the issue is complicated because many Japanese companies observe the Arab boycott against Israel, and because of widespread sympathy for Palestinians and anxieties about war with Iraq.
But the Israeli Ambassador, Mr. Eshkol, said that although Japan and Israel had had many difficulties over the years, ties have improved recently with stepped-up diplomatic exchanges and an increase in trade.
Mr. Eshkol added, in fact, that the recent attacks on Israel by Iraqi Scud missiles, coupled with Israel's not retaliating, had brought an outpouring of sympathy for Israelis, including offers of donations from schoolchildren.

HEADLINE: New York City's Reliance on Public Hiring Is Facing a Change

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
New York City's economy, in the midst of a slide that shows no sign of abating, now faces the decline of one of its last sources of strength: government hiring and government spending.
Of the 350,000 jobs that the city gained in the 1980's, almost 100,000 were government jobs, many on the city's own payroll. Even in 1988 and 1989, when other sectors of the economy were slowing or shifting into reverse, the city government added 20,000 workers, Federal statistics show. 
 The public sector -- city, state and Federal combined -- now accounts for 607,000 jobs, or about one of every six in New York City. And in 1989, the last year for which statistics are available, the $13.9 billionlocal government payroll -- including teachers, subway workers, hospital employees and others who work in city agencies -- outstripped Wall Street's payroll of $10.8 billion, the manufacturing sector's $10.6 billion and the construction industry's $4.2 billion.
 
From Source of Growth to 'Negative'
 But in its struggle to balance the worst budget deficits since the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, the Dinkins administration is contemplating layoffs and attrition that could alter the city's heavy reliance on public-sector spending. The cuts would also turn a source of growth into what Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, called "a negative part of the economy."
Under the law, New York City must havea balanced budget. But the consequences of removing large numbers of workers from its payroll has stirred talk about the extent to which a local government can soften or even reverse an economic decline through continued spending.
In any case, it is far from clear how many city jobs will be trimmed since the administration plans to add police officers and social workers even as it cuts jobs in departments like Sanitation and Parks. Under the city's preliminary spending plan, the head count would decline by about 5,000 between January and the end of June, then hold steady for a year.
Even in a time of retrenchment, the city would continue to hire workers to replace some of those who leave. But Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director, said hiring would drop to 20,000 workers a year from an annual average of 35,000 over the last six years. State budget cuts could further reduce that hiring to 15,000, he added. Though continuing labor negotiations have already changed layoff calculations, the economy is getting worse, not better, so the downward pressure will probably grow. Those hurt most by the cuts are likely to be women and minorities. About 28 percent of all black workers in New York City are employed in government, against 15 percent of the city's white workers. About 20 percent of all female workers in the city have government jobs, against 16 percent of the male workers.
"The public sector is now to the minority community what manufacturing once was," said Mark Levinson, an economist with District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest of the municipal unions. "These layoffs are going to disproportionately affect that community."
But fallout from a concerted effort to shrink city government over the next few years would affect more than those who lose city jobs. The impact of their income loss would deepen as it rippled through the boroughs, as workers cut from the city payroll reduce spending and as grocery stores, barber shops, restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses feel the pinch and trim their own payrolls in response.
 
An Econometric Model
 Matthew P. Drennan, a professor at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service who has developed an econometric model based on 25 years of New York City data, calculates that each job lost in the city, including public-sector jobs, eventually means the loss of 2.2 jobs. He also estimates that every dollar in city workers' lost income -- or any government spending -- eventually means $2.40 will be removed from the city's economy.
So if 10,000 municipal workers are cut from the payroll, Mr. Drennan said, the city would lose an additional 12,000 jobs in private industry. And if the former city workers earned an average of $30,000 a year, their joblessness would result in an annual loss to the city's economy of $720 million, which, he said, was "nothing to sneeze at."
Using its own model, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey came up with a slightly lower multiplier; it has calculated that for every 1,000 government jobs lost, 400 to 600 more jobs would be eliminated.
 
Unemployment Benefits
 Apart from those indirect effects, Mr. Levinson, the union economist, said the costs to the city of making the layoffs would be high. If New York dismissed 15,000 workers paid an average of $24,000 a year, and all received unemployment benefits of about $230 a week for 26 weeks, it would cost the city $90 million, he said. If 6,000 workers then qualified for welfare, with half receiving benefits for a year and the other half for six months, it would cost an additional $32 million, of which the city would pay $8 million.
And the city would also lose about $10 million in taxes that would have been paid by the workers, bringing the total cost to the city, Mr. Levinson said, to $108 million in the first year, offsetting some of the $360 million in wages the city would save.
In the case of some social workers whose salaries are partly underwritten by the Federal and state governments, Mr. Michael, the Budget Director, noted, the city would actually pay more at first to remove them from the payroll than it would to keep them on it.
 
Higher Taxes for Wealthy?
 Mr. Levinson argues that instead of layoffs the city should raise the tax it levies on the incomes of the wealthy, those he said "who have really benefited in the last decade." Some have suggested that property taxes on some homes, which have lagged behind rates in the suburbs, should be raised.
Rosemary Scanlon, the Port Authority's chief economist, said she believed that many New Yorkers would willingly pay higher taxes if assured that city services would be maintained.
"I think that, where possible, if the private economy is in a sharp retreat, you try and buffer it, within reason," she said, adding that such a strategy, which would entail continuing the city's high level of capital spending, was preferrable to "slash and burn techniques that are going on in the private sector."
But Professor Drennan disputed the extent to which the city could spend its way out of trouble. "It's generally agreed by economists that only the Federal Government can pull the economy out of a recession by spending more than it brings in," he said. "No city or state can do that."
 
Reinforced by History
 Those who favor cutting the muncipal work force, including Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent research organization sponsored by businesses, say it is a lesson reinforced by New York's recent history.
From 1969 to 1974, when the city's economy nearly collapsed, private industry lost 400,000 jobs but local government jobs increased by 45,000 as the city borrowed more and more money to pay its bills. Then, its credit gone and its access to the bond market lost, the city came close to going bankrupt. In five years, municipal employment plummeted by 64,000 jobs.
"The reason why the contraction was so huge," Mr. Horton said, "was that the adjustment wasn't made earlier."
Delaying cuts in jobs again by spending in the face of a downturn, he said, would be a "prescription for disaster."

HEADLINE: Soviet Plant Struggles To Join the Modern Era

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Aleksandr Samsonov, a towering man of gruff voice and crunching handshake, has little need for Harvard Business School techniques in running Moscow Watch Factory No. 1.
Instead, Mr. Samsonov relies on tough Communist tactics and primitive capitalist instincts, and with this "do what I say" approach, he has made his factory a showcase by Soviet standards. By Western standards, however, the factory remains years behind the time. 
 Mr. Samsonov likes to tell visitors that his factory made the watch that Mikhail S. Gorbachev presented to Ronald Reagan. He boasts that 80 percent of his factory's watches are exported.
 
Shortcomings Remain
 But Watch Factory No. 1 also claims achievements that would embarrass watchmakers at Seiko and Patek Philippe. Managers proudly note that customers now return as defective just 1.5 percent of the factory's watches, down from 4 percent five years ago.
And Mr. Samsonov notes that the 6,500-employee factory produced more than six million watches last year, up 60 percent from 1985. This means the factory produced 1,000 watches for each worker -- one-tenth the ratio at Seiko.
Still, there is no denying that since 1985, when Mr. Samsonov left his ministry post overseeing the watch industry to take the factory's helm, he has made Factory No. 1 a far more efficient place.
Tough-talking and 53 years old, Mr. Samsonov installed millions of rubles' worth of new machinery, hoping to double production. He eagerly fired laggards, began an anti-alcohol campaign and created a stern corporate culture that demanded hard work.
"There is a tough rule here that people should behave according to certain norms," he said, stretching his hands across the 20-foot-long conference table in his office. "Some people who don't like tough discipline will go work at other places. That's fine with me."
His factory's watches generate large sums of much-needed hard currency. Selling under the name Poljot, the watches command a good price abroad, often selling in Britain and France for $200. Most exports are to Western Europe and East Asia, with only a few going to the United States.
With watches sturdier than most other Soviet types, Poljot has outraced its domestic competition in introducing designs and technologies.
"This is a vanguard enterprise," said Valentina Dvornikova, as she took a short break from her workbench. "There is a lot of attention to quality and discipline here."
The factory's new designs are stolid, classical types, with neither the panache of Swatches nor the swagger of Rolexes. It was only five years ago that the factory began making women's watches.
"They make good, durable, no-frills, workman's watches," said Joseph Thomson, editor in chief of Modern Jeweler. "They make it on price and, to some extent, durability. But technologically the world has passed them by." Seventy percent of the watches are quartz; the rest, mechanical.
 
Struggling to Advance
 On that front, Mr. Samsonov is struggling to advance. In the section of his cavernous factory that makes quartz watches, he has added automated machines that slashed the time needed to put hands on a watch to 1.5 seconds from 90 seconds.
But where mechanical watches are assembled, the floor is filled with decades-old equipment. Behind dozens of rows of tables, women, young and old, are hunched over, squinting as they delicately insert minuscule gears and other parts. Foremen pace the floor like examination proctors trying to make sure no one is slacking off. The factory was founded in 1930 when the Soviet Government purchased all the equipment of a bankrupt watch factory in Canton, Ohio.
"Some Swiss watch people who visited our factory were amazed that we could still get so much out of these old machines," said Mr. Samsonov, whose own gleaming watch looks as if it weighs half a pound. He says the factory's profits have tripled since he arrived but declined to disclose revenues and earnings.
 
No Ordinary Manager
 A visit to Mr. Samsonov's office reveals immediately that he is not just another Soviet manager. The Lenin portrait in his office is not the routine, faded print adorning most managers' offices; instead, his Lenin is a three-foot-tall masterpiece of intricately inlaid mahagony and blond wood.
Mr. Samsonov is also different because when not working as a hard-nosed manager, he works as a hard-line Communist Party deputy in the Soviet Parliament. He is remembered for having once suggested that some pro-democracy student demonstrators be shipped to labor camps to learn the meaning of hard work.
In the factory and in Parliament, he pursues the same crusade -- the need for discipline. "In this country, productivity is three, four times lower than in America," he said. "If people want to live well, then they have to work well. No one ever died because of normal work. People become healthy if they work a lot."
As a result of glasnost and perestroika, he complains, the Soviet people have become less disciplined at work and may not be ready for their new freedoms.
"Discipline has decreased dramatically all over the country," he said. "The level of democracy must be in harmony with the cultural level of our society."
 
Influential Ties
 One reason his factory works so well is that Mr. Samsonov is on a first-name basis with many party stalwarts and ministry bureaucrats. And because his factory generates so much hard currency, it enjoys advantages that make other managers jealous. It is far easier for Mr. Samsonov to buy equipment and components abroad than for many managers.
His factory buys computer chips from Japan and is planning to buy a sophisticated $1.5 million Swiss machine that makes watch casings. With the machine, the factory will need just 10 people, instead of 150, to make six million casings a year.
"We shouldn't have to invent everything ourselves," he said. "We have to get involved with people who can teach us new technologies. The most important thing is to integrate ourselves into the world economy."
But even the status of the factory and its manager have not saved it from the nation's deepening economic morass. The factory is having trouble getting metal springs from its regular supplier in Byelorussia because the government there restricts exports to other republics.
And the factory sometimes has to import sheet metal because it cannot obtain domestic metal thin enough or of adequate quality. What is more, as the factory gears up to increase production, its main supplier of computer chips, a factory in Leningrad, has said it cannot meet demand.
 
Forced Self-Sufficiency
 As a result of such conditions, Factory No. 1 is one of many Soviet plants that have adopted an autarkic, do-it-yourself mentality. This leads to huge inefficiencies: A watch factory that produces its own computer chips, for example, would have to make major investments and could not enjoy large economies of scale.
At Factory No. 1, engineers have developed and built 20 automatic machines, far less sophisticated than those in Japan, on which watch cases snake from worker to worker. About 1,800 employees work directly in assembling watches, and 60 percent of them are adjusters or checkers. Industry experts say this is an astonishingly high percentage.
Henry B. Fried, an American watch expert who visited the Moscow factory, said it needed so many adjusters because "its machines may be too old and its cutting tools may be left too long before they are sharpened." He added, "They're far behind on automation and ultra-precision."
Mr. Samsonov seeks to offset this technological backwardness by pushing his employees to work harder. When he arrived, he found 200 workers who drank continually. He had his foremen meet with these workers to tell them to shape up, but discovered that under existing labor rules he could not fire them.
Using his influence and forceful personality, he put pressure on the union to give him the right to fire these workers.
"If anybody is drunk here or if somebody steals a watch, that person is going to be fired the next day," he said. "I tell people, 'Drink as much as you want. Take what you want. It's your fate. It's your life.' "

HEADLINE: Fixing Antique Furniture In an Old Railroad Station

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLAVERACK, N.Y.,

 BODY:
An abandoned railroad station here in Columbia County, about 115 miles north of New York City, has become the center of a nationwide operation for the repair and restoration of antique furniture.
"We repair spectacular furniture as well as boring furniture," said John Stair, managing director of Sotheby's Restoration, an arm of the well-known auction house. "The range of our work is on chairs worth $100 to chairs worth $70,000 each." 
 Mr. Stair's 4 master craftsmen, 10 journeymen and 4 apprentices work in wooden frame buildings, painted barn red, which once were the railroad depot, storage buildings and office of the old Boston and Albany Railroad, which ceased operations in 1937.
In the light and airy workshops one day recently, John Hanna was polishing a 1790 dining room table, Bill Drinkwater repairing two Chinese lacquer trunks, Alan Hamilton completing an early 18th-century tilt-top chess table, Thomas Hom applying gold leaf to a 1760 Italian mirror, Julie Rutschmann restoring a Regency bench and Neil Van Alstyne and Temprace DiCintio laquering the surface of four dining room chairs made by Giles Grundy back in the 1740's.
 
'Seen a Lot of Chairs'
 In the cabinet shop, John Dunham carefully used his chisels to carve wood for four Russian Pavlosk chairs, with flower pots on top of the chair stiles and monkey heads at the ends of the armrests, copying the design from a book of Russian furniture.
"I've seen a lot of chairs, but to have geraniums growing out of pots on top. . ." Mr. Stair said, his voice trailing off in disbelief.
When completed, the Russian chairs will be sent to their owner in Southern California, the 1740 chairs to Manhattan, the chess table to Massachusetts, the Chinese lacquer trunks to Connecticut and the 1760 Italian mirror to New York City.
"Having antique furniture is a headache," Mr. Stair said, noting that it was not only expensive to buy but expensive to maintain.
As an example, he cited the chess table, valued at an estimated $4,000, which took 26 hours to repair and restore at a cost to the client of about $1,300. Another object, the small curved Regency bench, worth between $6,000 and $8,000, would be repaired in 24 hours of work for $1,200, he said.
 
'An Old-Fashioned Generalist'
 "I worry about mistakes," Mr. Stair said. "I wander about the shops all day -- that's my job, talking to and conferring with the people doing the work. I am an old-fashioned generalist in these days when everybody seems to be a specialist."
Mr. Stair, who is 48 years old, was born in Brooklyn and served for four years in the Marine Corps before following a family tradition into the art and antique business. His grandfather was an art dealer in London. His father, Alistair Stair, operated his own business in 18th-century furniture on 57th Street in addition to being president of the New York Art and Antique Dealers Association.
That family connection helped Mr. Stair get his first job as a trainee with Sotheby's in London in 1964. He worked in Toronto and Los Angeles before starting Sotheby's restoration business in New York in 1979.
The Claverack operation began in 1987, following a well-established pattern of movement into the Hudson Valley. Mr. Stair and his wife bought a summer house in Cold Spring. But he soon was looking around to find a way to do business near his home.
 
Hard to Find Good Help
 He found what he thought was an ideal location for a repair center in Claverack railroad station. A few craftsmen came up from New York, but Mr. Stair recruited most of his staff locally.
"The problem in New York was that we faced criminals, dope addicts and young people from good families who thought they wanted to work with their hands but who had a high dropout rate," he said. "Up here, we have found sincere young people who want to take advantage of the good opportunities we have for work and make a career out of it."
Mr. Stair said his workshops offer an active apprentice program, with 10,000 hours of training required, "just the same as they had in the 19th century."
The wage scale starts at $5 an hour for beginners, rising to $7 an hour after two years and then to $12 for experienced workers. Senior master artisans can make up to $50,000 a year, he said.
"Even at that pay, they could not live in New York City," he said. "But up here, you can live well on that, own your own home and enjoy all the things you can't do in New York."
One of the artisans, Mr. Hamilton, who came to Claverack from New York, looked up from the chess table he was repairing. He now lives in Hillsdale, a few miles east of Claverack.
I like the slower pace of life and work up here," he said. "There's a lot more space and the open spaces keep you calm."
Mr. Stair himself now lives on a nearby farm in Claverack with his wife, Lynne, and four children. Two of his sons have followed him into the restoration business. One son, Colin, is the manager at Claverack and Brian is an apprentice polisher at the restoration's small shop in New York City.
"It's been a good move," Mr. Stair said. "All our expenses are under control, which wasn't possible in New York. Our costs are down and the only thing that fluctuates is our payroll. When the economy turns around, we could be very busy, handling twice the work."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Delay in Further Rate Cuts Is Seen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A number of credit market analysts think the Federal Reserve Board will probably delay further cuts in short-term interest rates because of indications that a possible end to the Middle East war may be in sight.
They cite Iraqi and Soviet proposals for negotiated settlements and evidence that a powerful and decisive United States ground attack is imminent as signs that the war could be nearing its conclusion. 
 The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has said that had Iraq not invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the economy would probably have avoided falling into recession. If this were the case, an end to the fighting soon would almost certainly give consumer confidence a much-needed lift and provide more tangible aid for pocketbooks if oil prices fall at war's end.
This possible course of events, which many analysts say is highly plausible, would alleviate the need for more interest-rate cuts by the Fed to stimulate the economy.
"The Fed is of the opinion that the recent decline in the economy is due to the outbreak of the war," said Joseph Carson, a senior economist at Chemical Bank. "Therefore, if the end of the war is much closer than we thought even a few days ago, it could put them on hold for a while, to see how quickly confidence comes back."
 
Reason to Pause
 The Fed had good reason to pause in its manipulation of interest rates even before the prospects of a conclusion to the war emerged. After having lowered the overnight Federal funds rate by 1.75 percentage points since early November, the Fed was bound to stop to assess how much impact the decline in rates had had on the slumping economy. As a rule of thumb, analysts say it generally takes about six months for a change in monetary policy to be reflected in the pace of economic activity.
"It's one thing to ease when things are horrible," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But when you sense that things are bottoming out, you sit on your hands."
One source of concern -- slow money growth -- is beginning to show the effects of the Fed's ministrations. After barely budging for much of the fourth quarter, M-2, the monetary aggregate the Fed monitors most carefully, has begun to grow at a more rapid pace since about mid-January.
"The money numbers through early February suggest we may have a rebound under way," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "But the Fed will want to see more of them, and consequently may take a wait-and-see attitude about another easing in policy until the next F.O.M.C. meeting in March." He was referring to the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, at which monetary policy is decided upon.
 
Improvement for Banks
 Another big problem, the financial health of America's banks, is also showing signs of improvement, some analysts said.
In addition to the cuts in the funds rate, the Fed's decision to lower reserve requirements for banks and to cut the discount rate by a full percentage point has "liquified and ventilated the banking system," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Company. "Through the steps they have taken, they have taken some pressure off banks."
There are also signs that investors are feeling more comfortable about the outlook for banks. These signs include sharp increases in the price of outstanding bonds of troubled organizations like Citicorp, Chemical Bank and others. In addition, interest-rate differentials between three-month bank certificates of deposit and three-month Treasury bills have narrowed substantially since late December, Mr. Kudlow said.
"Late last year, spreads between C.D.'s and Treasuries had gotten as wide as 170 basis points," he said. "Now they are down their normal range of 45 basis points to 50 basis points."
 
Troubling Evidence Remains
 Despite some reassuring signs, there remains substantial evidence that the economy is still quite weak. Mindful of those problems, a number of economists continue to insist that the Fed will need to do much more to end the current downturn, even if the war ended tommorrow.
"The list of risks to economic revival is substantial and includes more than just a prolonged war," said Alan Sinai, president of Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
"The odds on a turnaround happening six months after the Fed began to aggressively ease are very low," he added. "Between the time Iraq invaded Kuwait and now, a lot of income and jobs have been lost."
In order to redress the slide, Mr. Sinai said the Fed would probably have to push the funds rate down another 75 basis points, to 5.5 percent, by midyear.
 
Questions for Greenspan
 Mr. Greenspan will no doubt be questioned on many of these issues tomorrow and Thursday, when he is scheduled to provide Congress with his semiannual report on the economy and monetary policy.
After being jolted by the recent news that the Producer Price Index, e xcluding food and energy costs, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in January, traders and economists will be looking closely at new consumer price data, which are expected to be released on Friday. Some analysts said the report might not provide much support for the view that the recession was bringing down inflation.
Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, predicted that higher excise taxes on items like airline tickets, tobacco and luxury goods helped to push the so-called core rate of consumer price inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- up by six-tenths of 1 percent in January. An increase of that size would be the largest since July.
But the overall January Consumer Price Index is likely to fare better, Mr. Jones said. Thanks to falling gasoline and heating-oil prices last month, the full Consumer Price Index probably rose by four-tenths of 1 percent last month, compared with the rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in December, Mr. Jones said.

HEADLINE: Congress Rushes to Pass Benefits for Gulf Veterans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Military personnel serving in the Persian Gulf may soon get help from Congress in dealing with economic hardships at home.
In a rush to show support for the troops, the House has already passed a bill to provide aid, and after the Senate reconvenes Tuesday it will consider the measure. 
 The legislation would protect men and women in the reserves who are called to active duty by guaranteeing their right to return to their civilian jobs. The bill would also stipulate that families of service members generally could not be evicted from their homes for failure to pay rent if the monthly rent is $1,200 or less. Such protection is currently available only when the rent is $150 or less.
Members of Congress are drafting dozens of other proposals to assist the veterans. "When our forces are facing the threat of Scud missile attacks or ground force assault," said Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida, "the last thing these men and women need to worry about is whether or not their families will be evicted from their homes because they cannot afford the rent, or suffer loss of re-employment rights."
The bill would allow doctors called up for service to suspend payment of premiums on their medical malpractice insurance. Even while on active duty, doctors need such insurance to protect them against claims that might be filed by private patients they treated months or even years ago.
 
Provision on Court Cases
 The legislation passed by the House is an amendment to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. It would also require courts to postpone judicial proceedings at the request of anyone serving in the gulf.
Some members of Congress, including Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, are prodding the Pentagon to avoid assigning single parents and married military couples to the Persian Gulf if they have young children.
"Is it in the best interest of the United States of America and the U.S. armed forces that we take new mothers, days after delivering their infants, and place them in the way of Saddam Hussein's missiles?" Mr. Heinz asked. "This, in my view, defeats the entire purpose of a volunteer Army."
But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, oppose such exemptions, saying they would undermine the "cohesion and esprit de corps" of military units. In a letter to Congress stating their position, Mr. Cheney and General Powell said reassignment of people with young children would "weaken our combat capability by removing key personnel" from units in the glf.
In January, Congress extended the deadline for troops to file income tax returns to six months after the end of their service in the gulf. They could receive further tax relief for up to five years if they were hospitalized with wounds.
Beyond such measures, lawmakers are stitching together a sweeping package of other education, insurance, medical, pension, housing and economic benefits.
 
Variety of Benefits
 For example, Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat who is chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, has introduced a comprehensive measure that would increase education benefits under the G.I. Bill, authorize the Small Business Administration to guarantee bank loans to veterans and increase veterans' eligibility for home loans, medical care and life insurance. His bill would also double the maximum amount of unemployment compensation for men and women leaving the armed forces so they could get up to 26 weeks of benefits, and it would set a goal for the Federal Government of awarding 5 percent of its commerical contracts to small businesses owned by veterans.
Senators John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, are assembling a similar package of assistance. The breadth of the endeavor is suggested by the numerous Senate committees involved in the work: Armed Services, Finance (tax breaks), Governmental Affairs (Civil Service employment preferences), Small Business and Veterans Affairs, among others.
"This package should not really be termed 'benefits,' " Mr. Glenn said. "It should be termed a fairness package, as I see it, because that is what we are trying to achieve."
Mr. Glenn said the recent "flurry of bills" reflected not only support for military men and women in the Persian Gulf, but also unanticipated problems caused by the heavy reliance on reserve forces.
 
Finding the Financing
 Most of the new benefits will cost money. An explosive political question is how much of the new spending must be offset by cuts in other Federal programs, in compliance with the new budget enforcement procedures adopted last year. The costs of the war itself are exempt from the statutory limits on Federal spending, and proponents of new veterans' benefits contend that these costs should also be exempt.
But the Bush Administration maintains that the costs of the war should be defined narrowly. And Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee, also insists that the exemption applies only to "emergency requirements" directly related to military operations in the gulf.
Thus, he said, a general increase in unemployment benefits for people leaving the armed forces would not be exempt from the limit on spending for Federal benefit programs.

HEADLINE: With Chicago Calm, Daley Glides Toward Primary

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
For much of the 1980's, politics in Chicago was a cross between a street fight and civil war.
Whites voted for whites and blacks voted for blacks. Politicians would switch parties to run as spoilers if it would keep a rival from winning. And at a tempestuous City Council meeting after the death of Mayor Harold Washington, at least one alderman wore a bulletproof vest just in case. 
 But the waters have calmed in the two years since Richard M. Daley, the low-key, 48-year-old son of Richard J. Daley, the longtime Mayor and Democratic boss of Chicago, won a special election to fill the remainder of Mr. Washington's term.
The younger Mayor Daley, with his Everyman demeanor and good-government mantle, has brought this fractious city an uncharacteristic stability that has frustrated his critics and helped make him the clear front-runner in his current re-election bid.
"The edge is off Chicago politics," said David Axelrod, a political consultant to the incumbent and former consultant to Mayor Washington. "After 10 years of turmoil and angry, divisive politics, we've settled into a comfortable, secure kind of a politics, where people are actually talking to each other, where you can disagree with people without defaming them."
People like Mr. Axelrod say Mr. Daley is the main reason for Chicago's relative peace. Critics say it is luck, timing and political pedigree. They say the Mayor has just been on good behavior until he wins his first full term.
Either way, with only a week remaining before the Feb. 26 Democratic primary, Mr. Daley leads the polls, while his opponents -- one black, one white -- grope for something to pin on him.
The black candidate, Danny K. Davis, is a Cook County commissioner whose campaign got a late and disorganized start and who has been unable to inspire a black electorate left fragmented since Mayor Washington's death. It is widely predicted that the black turnout on Primary Day will be low. The white candidate, former Mayor Jane M. Byrne, has not won an election since 1979 and has been all but ostracized by Democratic Party regulars. That has left her pulling single digits in the polls.
In the latest Chicago Tribune poll, published Sunday, Mr. Daley was favored by 53 percent of those who said they were most likely to vote Democratic, Mr. Davis by 21 percent and Mrs. Byrne by 6 percent. Eighteen percent of the blacks polled said they would vote for Mr. Daley, 45 percent said they would vote for Mr. Davis and 8 percent favored Mrs. Byrne.
Twenty percent of those polled were undecided, and most of those were black. The poll of 600 Chicago voters, taken Feb. 9-11, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Beyond His Father's Shadow
 Mr. Daley's huge lead in the polls, plus the distraction of war in the Persian Gulf, has fostered one of the quietest mayoral campaigns in recent memory and has fueled speculation not about whether Mr. Daley would continue to serve as Mayor, but for how much longer. Many say that he is already looking to the Governor's mansion to get beyond the shadow of his father, and that he was not especially disappointed that a Republican, Jim Edgar, won last November's race for governor, making it easier for Mr. Daley, as a Democrat, to run for governor if he wants to.
Whatever his ambitions, Mr. Daley is coming to be seen as a Mayor with a charmed administration. Not only has he not faced the career-ending blows of some of his predecessors but, like former President Ronald Reagan, he has also surrounded himself with shrewd political advisers.
The result is that Chicagoans will endure from Mayor Daley what they would not endure from other mayors. In 1979, for example, the city was slow to clear the roads in a winter of record snowfalls. Voters blamed Mayor Michael A. Bilandic and swept him out of office the first chance they got. But when a big snowstorm caught the Daley administration off guard last year, the Mayor shrugged it off and said he knew how people felt. It took him an hour to get home, too, he said. The voters and the press were satisfied.
Mayor Daley has also been blessed with a healthy economy and a welcoming City Council.
 
Support From the Council
 While Mr. Washington labored under a $90 million deficit, Mr. Daley got a $180 million windfall from the state in the form of an income tax surcharge in 1989, the year he took office. In the Washington years, a tightfisted Council majority led by Alderman Edward R. Vrdolyak opposed the Mayor at every turn. But Mayor Daley has had the solid support of 26 of the 50 aldermen 90 percent of the time, enough to pass virtually whatever he wanted, a recent University of Illinois study showed.
Critics, especially blacks who are still bitter over the roadblocks that Mr. Washington ran into, complain that white politicians are more willing to work with Mayor Daley. "The Daley name is paying off," said Lu Palmer, a radio talk show host who is a leader of black community affairs.
But the Mayor's supporters say that, like his father, he is a shrewd administrator who, despite his broken syntax, thick Chicago brogue and "gee whiz" manner, knows how to deflect detractors and keep the trains and sewers running.
"There's a lack of artifice about him," said Eugene Kennedy, who wrote a biography of the elder Mayor Daley. "He's not the candidate of photo opportunities and icon-making. He resists the cosmetics and manipulation of handlers. He's very comfortable being Mayor. He understands it. It is not at all a mystery to him."
To the frustration of his opponents, Mr. Daley anticipates their criticism and tries to pre-empt it. While he angered blacks early in his term when he cleared City Hall of appointees from the previous administration, he later made sure that 18 of his 44 department heads were black or Hispanic. And perhaps more important, he kept blacks in charge of the areas where his administration was considered most vulnerable, like the police department, schools and public housing.
Critics say that in a city with slightly more blacks than whites the percentage of black appointees is not high enough and that everyone knows the real power lies with the Mayor's inner circle, mostly white men from his South Side ward. But at least the official flow chart shows what the Mayor likes to call "a rainbow cabinet."
 
'A Positive Backlash'
 Probably the most enduring criticism of Mayor Daley is that he is not the intellectual Harold Washington was. Critics like to remind people that Mr. Daley failed the bar exam twice before he passed it. But even that has worked for him.
"He's gotten a positive backlash from it," said Don Rose, a Democratic political analyst who managed Mrs. Byrne's first mayoral campaign. "He comes out and says something resembling English, and people say, 'I didn't know he could talk!' It helps him."
Mayor Daley, a former Cook County State's Attorney, has rarely allowed himself to be on the defensive. Instead, he has been running a "feel-good" administration, bent on projects like building a new airport, doling out city services to private businesses, and most important, critics say, watching his step with an eye toward Election Day, April 2.
"He has been principally concerned with avoiding controversy," said Judson Miner, who was the corporation counsel for Mayor Washington.
Because campaign contributions from the business community have overwhelmingly gone to Mr. Daley in this race, some political analysts say the Mayor will soon be obligated to return the favor.
 
'Pinstripe Patronage' Predicted
 "He has been a very good boy for the last two years," Mr. Rose said. "We will begin to see the spoils system during the first full term. Pieces of the city will be sold off to keep him in office. Then we will see pinstripe patronage."
The Mayor makes no apologies for his courting of businesses, and says he has helped heal the city. "People were just sick and tired of everybody fighting for the sake of fighting and nothing was accomplished," Mr. Daley said in an interview. "I said, 'Hey, let's move on with it. Let's get it done.' "
While he may spend his working hours making deals in high places, many say he is hot dogs and White Sox at heart. He works in his father's old fifth-floor office at his father's desk beneath his father's portrait. And he lives with his wife, Maggie, and their three children in a modest brick bungalow a few blocks from where he and his father grew up in Bridgeport, a working-class, mostly white ethnic South Side community that once had an iron gate to keep out blacks from an adjacent neighborhood.
Critics say Mr. Daley's success has been mostly in public relations. "They've been masterful," said Jacky Grimshaw, a political analyst who was a top aide to Mayor Washington. "You don't see him on TV without a black woman. But their true Bridgeport selves will emerge after April 2."
The Mayor shrugs off such predictions. "What, I'm going to come out with big horns on me?" he said in the interview. "Fangs, blood, beating the little kids, shooting them and selling dope?"
 
The Politics of Pragmatism
 At the moment, critics do not pose a big problem for the Mayor. Mr. Davis, the black candidate, has had to watch as dozens of black ministers and business executives, wanting to go with a winner, extol Mr. Daley from the pulpit or act as host at $200-a-person fund-raising events for him.
Nate Clay, a black political analyst, predicts that the Mayor will win close to one-fourth of the black vote. He got 8 percent in 1989 "without even trying," Mr. Clay said.
Some black politicians are already preaching the politics of pragmatism. "It's a sad day when we've got people who go around saying it's got to be all black or it's got to be all white," Lemuel Austin Jr., a black alderman, said in a speech at a South Side church a few weeks ago.
Some blacks are already looking to 1995 as the next best hope, and have written off this election. "I don't want to see us embarrassed, but that's what's going to happen," Mr. Palmer said. "We don't have anybody who can beat Daley. I don't even know if there is a candidate in the white community. He was in before he even ran."

HEADLINE: Holtzman Sees Budget Gap Rise

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, warned yesterday that the city faced a larger budget gap over the next 16 months than what the Dinkins administration has announced so far.
Ms. Holtzman predicted that rising costs and shrinking revenues meant that the city faced a $300 million gap for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, even though the administration says it has balanced the budget through various measures. She also estimated that the gap for next year was $1.2 billion more than the $2.2 billion the administration had said it needed to close. 
 "We think that most of the city's major revenue projections are overly optimistic," the Comptroller said. "We believe tax revenues will fall and spending will increase." Her projections will be detailed later this week in a review of the city's latest financial plan, which Mayor David N. Dinkins issued last month.
The biggest single item cited by Ms. Holtzman as changing since then was Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to slash aid to localities because of the state's own fiscal troubles. The Comptroller estimated that would cost the city $635 million.
But she said other factors are widening the budget gap, including rising overtime bills and debt service costs and reduced collections from personal-income taxes and other revenues.
Eli Attie, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said the city administration was well aware of the threatened loss of state aid, which the Mayor's office estimated at more than $600 million. As for the rest of the projections, the Mayor's office reserved specific comment until the Comptroller's report was received and studied.
"The Comptroller has made these kinds of projections before," Mr. Attie said. "Sometimes they have been very helpful, and sometimes wildly pessimistic. We believe our data are at least as accurate as the Comptroller's. We will listen to what she has to say, but for now we stand by our own analysis."
Ms. Holtzman's economic model forecasts a greater loss of private and public jobs than the model on which the city's budget is based. She said the city could lose 110,000 private and public jobs this year, double the number predicted by the city's budget office. Next year she foresees the loss of another 68,000 jobs, in contrast to the budget's projection of 8,000 new jobs.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Accountability In Health Care

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
EMPLOYERS, insurers, medical societies and hospitals are pressing to create tests and guidelines that they hope will bring more order and economic accountability to a health-care system that has traditionally been based on the judgments of doctors who may often disagree.
In a major development last week, 11 large companies and their insurers decided to test a system in which employees and their doctors are asked about specific results of medical treatments.
Employees treated for lower back pain, for example, would be asked whether they could climb stairs, bend over to tie their shoes and do other things reflecting their health status.
The test will seek to determine whether the system is "a useful and valid way of demonstrating accountability," said Bill Goss, the health-care programs manager at the General Electric Company. Large employers spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on employee health care. "But we are not really sure whether we are getting value from it," said Mr. Goss, who is chairman of the group conducting the test.
The companies and insurers taking part include American Telephone and Telegraph, with the Travelers; Ameritech, with Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Digital Equipment, with Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Community Health Plan and Matthew Thornton Health Plan, three New England health maintenance organizations; General Electric's aerospace unit, with U.S. Healthcare, and General Motors, with Blue Cross of Missouri and St. Louis and Kaiser Permanente in Cleveland.
Other participants are Hercules, with the Intermountain group in Salt Lake City; Honeywell, with<biCigna; James River, with Aetna; Marriott, with Prudential, and Proctor & Gamble and Promus, both with Metropolitan Life.
Doctors and patients will use questionnaires developed by medical authorities for Dr. Paul Ellwood, president of Interstudy, a nonprofit research group based in Excelsior, Minn. The sponsor is the American Managed Care Association, whose members include 150 large companies that use health maintenance organizations and networks of doctors and hospitals.
During 12 months, the 11 companies will all ask employees about the same two or three medical conditions. Lower back pain, angina (heart attack) and asthma are the most likely subjects, said John Doyle, the project's coordinator at Interstudy.
Dr. Ellwood said Interstudy questionnaires were already being used in a similar project at half a dozen group medical practices across the country, including the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. The American Group Practices Association is the sponsor.
In yet another project, General Motors, Ford Motor, Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union agreed this month to work on quality-ofcare measures with nine health maintenance organizations in southeastern Michigan. The H.M.O.'s will be required to meet certain standards and their members will be asked whether the H.M.O.'s provided satisfactory care.
The American Medical Association and several medical specialty professional groups are taking a different tack. They are developing guidelines for medical procedures and treatments that are based on a consensus of views of experienced doctors and from medical journals.
The A.M.A. says the guidelines will be parameters, leaving ample room for variations in particular cases. "The specialty societies' fear is that if they don't develop guidelines, the Government will do it for them," said Dr. David M. Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University.
Indeed, Congress has already ordered Federal studies of both guidelines and medical results that the Government calls patient outcome research. "At least we ought to know where we are getting the biggest bang for the buck without causing harm to patients," said Ira Raskin, an economist who is acting director of the Center for Medical Effectiveness at the Federal Public Health Service.
Hospitals are also developing practice guidelines and "statements of expected performance," said Dennis O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, which accredits hospitals.
"We used to assume that clinical judgment alone was an adequate source of truth," Dr. Eddy said. "Now we have to go out there and measure the consequences of different medical activities."
"The problem is: How do you measure the whole spectrum of health care?" said Margaret E. O'Kane, executive director of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nonprofit group that accredits health maintenance organizations. "There are whole areas where you just don't know the answers. We're all grappling for measurements."

HEADLINE: Texas Calls Halt to Waste-Disposal Sites

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Reacting to public concern over proposals to burn and bury thousands of tons of chemical wastes, Texas is about to become the first state to suspend development of new commercial hazardous-waste sites and stop expansions of existing ones.
The rules, requested by Gov. Ann Richards and to be enacted this week by the Texas Water Commission, halt until at least September actions to issue permits for commercial hazardous-waste projects in Texas, the nation's largest producer of chemical poisons. 
 The action, which stalls projects sought by 35 waste-disposal companies, is meant to give legislators time to find a balance between the needs of nearly 11,000 businesses that generate hazardous wastes and the concerns of residents unwilling to live near new dumps and incinerators.
But the moratorium also crystallizes more clearly than before the political, economic and environmental problems that Texas and other industrial states face in the disposal of wastes, problems that threaten to worsen.
 
Worries in Other States
 From New York to the Deep South, states are struggling over how to handle the wastes they generate, and are erecting barriers against outside wastes.
Industrial groups say more space is needed to dispose of wastes, or companies may have to curtail their businesses or dump illegally. The water commission, an environmental agency, does not deny that, but it says the problem is one that must be confronted by political leaders.
Buck Jim Wynne 3d, chairman of the water commission, said state lawmakers need to understand the emotional and economic issues in any proposal to establish hazardous-waste sites.
"With this dramatic action, we hope to generate the attention that's needed to take a hard look at the whole issue," said Mr. Wynne, who serves at the pleasure of the Governor. "The bottom line is that we need more landfills, more incinerators, more capacity to handle hazardous wastes. I hope we go beyond the slogans and focus on the hazardous-waste crisis coming in this state."
 
Putting Pressure on Industry
 Environmental leaders in Texas said Mr. Wynne's call for more disposal sites was misguided and politically impractical. One issue that most upsets Texans these days is any proposal to put a hazardous-waste site near a community. Public outcry reached a peak last year, with a proposal to build an incinerator near Houston.
"Texas is being turned into one big toxic-waste dump," said Rick Abraham, director of Texans United, an environmental group based in Houston. "People are upset. They realize these sites are dangerous. Industry needs to implement waste-reduction programs, but they aren't going to try that until they are forced to."
Governor Richards's letter to Mr. Wynne on Feb. 6 said in part, "I am convinced that the state is moving too quickly to grant permits to facilities that jeopardize public health and sensitive environments." She added, "Most, if not all, of these new projects have been strenuously opposed by citizens groups and local officials."
Texas is far from the only state grappling with safe disposal of industrial wastes. Last fall, New York alerted the owner of a new hazardous-waste site that it was restricting the wastes that could be dumped there to those generated in the state or from states that had agreements with New York.
 
Battles in the South
 South Carolina and North Carolina are battling over restrictions to interstate shipments of hazardous waste. The Alabama Legislature has sought to restrict the importing of hazardous wastes to the nation's largest commercial chemical waste landfill in Emelle, an action that was deemed unlawful by a Federal appellate court and that the state is appealing.
In 1976, when the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was passed, Congress hoped to avoid such disputes by ending the practices that had led to leaky landfills and polluted swamps. In 1984, the law was amended to include strict rules for generating, transporting and disposing of hazardous wastes. The rules led companies to design specially engineered waste dumps, incinerators and deep wells for permanently storing hazardous wastes.
Most of the estimated 350 million tons of hazardous wastes generated each year are produced by large corporations and disposed of in their own incinerators or dumps. But smaller businesses must also meet the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The law had the effect of concentrating the wastes of these smaller businesses at specific commercial sites. And because these businesses must pay to have their wastes taken care of, what had been worthless poisons have been turned into an extraordinarily valuable commodity.
 
More Lucrative Than Ever
 Last year, the commercial hazardous waste-disposal industry generated revenues of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, some industry analysts said, and is growing 20 percent annually.
In September, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency took steps to make the industry more profitable when it issued rules to broaden the types of wastes considered hazardous.
The nation's chemical-waste companies have besieged states with applications to build new incinerators, special landfills, deep well-injection systems and disposal plants. Texas, which generates 70 million tons of waste annually, has been a particular target.
More than 60 hazardous-waste businesses operate in Texas, according to the water commission. In 1990 alone, officials said, nine new hazardous-waste incinerators were proposed.
Texas environmental groups and community leaders reacted with dismay to the proposals and held public protests, filed court actions and filled city and county council meetings. Public outcry reached a peak last year, when Houston Chemical Services gained permission from the Texas Water Commission to build a commercial incinerator in La Porte. The permit was approved over the objections of the City Council, the county commissioners and the water commission's own hearing examiner.
In Robstown, 15 miles west of Corpus Christi, Texas Ecologists Inc. operates a 240-acre commercial hazardous-waste landfill and has asked for approval to put 15 percent to 30 percent more waste in each of the pits it digs. The permit has been put on hold.

HEADLINE: Barclays Plans To Cut Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Barclays Bank P.L.C. said today that it intended to sharply reduce its work force, perhaps by 15 percent to 20 percent over approximately five years.
Barclays hopes 13,000 or more jobs can be eliminated through retirements and resignations, said a spokeswoman.
In an interview in today's issue of The Financial Times, the bank's chairman, Sir John Quinton, said the cuts in the work force of 87,000 were necessary because of the recession. The bank said details of the job cuts would be announced when financial results were disclosed on Feb. 28.
Barclays has about 8,000 employees in the United States.
The Barclays spokeswoman, who insisted on anonymity, said: "The 15 to 20 percent is very much a forecast still. We don't have an actual program of cuts up to that level to be implemented. It is a forecast we will be working with over the next five years or so."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Money Fund Investors' New Tack

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Investors' headlong rush toward the safest type of money market funds seems to have slowed, perhaps reflecting lower interest rates and reduced fears about the fragility of America's financial system.
Since the beginning of 1991, investors have added money to ordinary money market funds at about the same pace as they have added cash to the super-safe funds that invest only in Federal Government securities. 
 "Yields have dropped to the point where investors are looking for a little pickup in yield," said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
That is a sharp turnabout from the attitudes that prevailed in late 1990, when investors seemed to value safety above all else. In the final four months of the year, those money funds that do not promise to buy only Treasury securities, or Treasuries and Government agency paper, saw their total assets fall by $3.4 billion, or almost 1 percent, according to IBC/ Donoghue.
 
Shift in Last 2 Weeks
 By contrast, those funds that restricted their investments to Treasury securities picked up $8.3 billion over that period, a gain in assets of 41.7 percent. And funds that take on only a bit more risk, by adding Government agency securities to Treasuries, added $5.7 billion, raising their assets by 21.4 percent.
Adding together the two categories of super-safe funds, their share of the money market fund universe, which had been under 11 percent, rose to 15.2 percent by Jan. 29 of this year. But over the last two weeks, it has edged lower, to 15.1 percent.
That slight decline in market share has reflected a pickup in purchases of the general money market funds, not a loss in assets for the safer ones.
In part, the new move reflects the fact that investors who are willing to accept the slight increase in risk inherent in general money market funds are being well compensated for it. At the end of September, the 30-day yield on the average Treasury-only fund was 7.3 percent, only 19 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, less than the 7.49 percent offered by the average general fund.
By last week, the return on the Treasury funds had plunged to 6.28 percent, but the yield on general funds was down to only 6.74 percent, a difference of 46 basis points.
That rise in the difference is a bit puzzling. The tenor of the markets in recent weeks has been one of rising confidence that the recession is nearing an end, a move that would normally lead to a reduced quality differential.
No money market funds engage in practices that come even close to really risky investing. Those that venture past Government securities buy assets like short-term notes of corporations, called commercial paper, and bank certificates of deposit.
While they can buy securities that do not mature for at least a year, on average the maturities must be no longer than 120 days, a figure that will be cut to 90 under a rule approved last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Even those that buy commercial paper now restrict almost all of their buying to paper rated A-1 by the Standard & Poor's Corporation or P-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. Those are the top grades, and indicate minimal risk.
A few years ago, it was common for funds to venture into the next grade down, which is still investment grade. But there were two defaults involving commercial paper that had been rated at the second level, and that both scared fund managers and persuaded the S.E.C. to restrict the amount of such paper that funds can hold. The defaults did not cause money market fund investors to lose any money, but only because the sponsors of several funds stepped in to make up the losses.
As a result of the increased caution, many second-tier issuers have been forced to drastically scale back their issuances of commercial paper, further reducing the spread in quality between the safest money market fund investments and the most risky. That trend makes the rising spread even more puzzling.
One explanation is that the abrupt fall in interest rates has been brought on by the easing of credit by the Federal Reserve, whose actions are felt most sharply in the Government securities market.
"The Fed has really pressed on the accelerator," said Patricia Klink, president of the Discount Corporation of New York Advisers, a money management firm, adding that even with the increased spread, she did not believe there had yet been "a real classic flight to quality." Such a move, she said, would send Treasury bill rates falling even more abruptly.
One aspect of the money market fund figures that may also be surprising is that the funds have not lost assets in recent weeks, despite the surge of the stock market. On Jan. 15, just before the stock market took off, the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue had $436.4 billion in assets. By Feb. 12, that figure had risen to $447.8 billion.
Wherever the money came from to propel the stock market's sharp rise, it would appear that the money market funds were not the source. If that indicates many individual investors are still on the sidelines, it could be a bullish indicator for stocks.

HEADLINE: Laws Encourage Car Alarms, But Din May Not Be Worth It

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
It seemed a minor technicality, an amendment to section 167-d(12) of the New York State Insurance Law, and it took effect a decade ago very quietly. But since then every New Yorker has heard its consequences, often around 2 in the morning.
The new law required insurance companies to give discounts for cars equipped with anti-theft devices, and the discounts encouraged policyholders to install car alarms. 
 Ten years and countless false alarms later, there is no evidence that the wailing has reduced car theft in New York or anywhere else, which leads some sleep-deprived citizens to ask: Why is it public policy to subsidize car alarms? Why is it not public policy to outlaw them?
Insurance company actuaries view the discounts as unmerited and unfair to other policyholders. Criminologists say there are better and quieter ways to protect cars. Economists argue that the alarms' benefits, if any, are far outweighed by their social costs. Vigilantes have made their point by attacking noisy cars with eggs and baseball bats.
Yet the alarms continue to proliferate, and lobbyists for the car-alarm industry have helped persuade other states to adopt similar policies. Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island also require discounts, and the New Jersey Legislature is considering the most sweeping measure yet: a bill making alarms or other anti-theft devices mandatory in all cars worth more than $5,000.
"These laws are a private bonanza for the alarm industry, but they're ridiculous social policy," said Lawrence W. Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland who is the president of the Crime Control Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
"Car alarms are a terrible urban blight with obvious social costs -- noise pollution, increased stress, wasted police manpower dealing with broken alarms -- and it's not clear there are any benefits in return. No study has demonstrated they reduce auto theft. Personally, in 10 years I've never seen anyone respond to one, because people know the vast majority of them are false alarms."
Studies of home burglar alarms have repeatedly shown that there are about 20 false alarms for every real one, and Dr. Sherman said there was no reason to think the ratio would be lower for car alarms. Some car alarms can be set off by vibrations from passing trucks, wind, rain, or a tap from another car's bumper, and some are designed to go off briefly every time the driver enters or leaves the car.
Even if the alarm attracts attention to a crime, will anyone interfere? Not likely, said Harold Takooshian, a professor of psychology at Fordham University who has run experiments near his office on Manhattan's West Side. He did not use car alarms, but he did study how bystanders react to car thieves.
In one study, a researcher pretended to be a thief nervously using a coat hanger to break into a car and steal from it. Most bystanders on the sidewalk who noticed the burglaries did nothing. In the minority of cases where people got involved, sometimes the bystanders called the police or questioned the thief, but twice as often their involvement consisted of helping the thief break in.
 
'This Is My Shtick'
 Most of these helpful souls apparently assumed, without asking, that it was the thief's own car. But a few clearly had larcenous ideas of their own. "Hey, baby, this is my shtick," said one youth, who took the hanger from the thief, used it to open the door, watched the thief remove a television from the car, and then asked for a tip.
These findings, together with similar results from 29 other American cities where Dr. Takooshian repeated the study, do not seem to show great benefit from alerting a neighborhood to car theft. Nor is there much support for car alarms to be found in insurance company statistics.
Some trends in car theft are unclear, such as the rate of theft nationally. The number of thefts reported to the police has been increasing in recent years, according to F.B.I. reports. At the same time, the number of theft claims reported to insurance companies has been declining, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute, which collects data for insurers. One trend that does seem clear in the data is that cars equipped with anti-theft devices, which are most commonly alarms, are more likely than other cars to be stolen or broken into.
"In New York, cars with these devices have a rate of claims that's three times higher than that of other cars," said Dale Nelson, an actuary with State Farm, the nation's largest car insurer. "The comparison is a little misleading, because these devices tend to be installed on theft-prone cars in high-crime areas, but it does indicate that these devices are not all that effective, which is why we don't think it makes sense to give discounts for them."
 
Better Than Nothing?
 That sentiment is shared by Sara Schlenker, an actuary at Allstate, the second-largest auto insurer. "We haven't seen any evidence to justify the discounts," she said. "Our gut feeling is that an audible alarm does very little if anything to limit losses."
Proponents of car alarms argue that the alarms are better than nothing. State Senator Ronald L. Rice, Democrat of Newark, the sponsor of the bill making anti-theft devices mandatory, said the auto-theft problem is so serious in his home district of Newark that his constituents are willing to endure the alarms' noise.
"I don't know if there's any real evidence the alarms are effective," said Mr. Rice, a former police officer. "I guess it's more of a subjective feeling than anything else, but I think anything you can do to deter a thief will help."
Mr. Rice's bill is being supported by a trade group, the Car Audio Specialists Association/Vehicle Security Association. The group's first vice-president, Barnet Fagel, said that car alarms could be both effective and non-polluting.
 
Measuring the Costs
 "There are no hard statistics that the alarms have worked," he said, "but my own experience in installing them tells me that they can be very effective if they're installed properly. The problem is that some systems are designed or installed badly, so they go off at the wrong times, and I'd be in favor of legislation to eliminate the bad systems. We know that noise pollution is a problem. The question is, do we curse the darkness or light a candle?"
But others doubt that the alarms' social costs could be justified in densely populated areas. It is hard to measure these costs -- the annoyance, for instance, of the Broadway audience that endured three alarms from the adjacent parking lot during a recent performance of "Mule Bone," or the frustration voiced by Woody Allen's partner in "Annie Hall" when sex is interrupted by a wailing vehicle.
But some ways to measure environmental costs have been developed by economists like Richard T. Carson, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, who is an expert on the impact of air and water pollution. He is currently working for the State of Alaska on the damage assessment of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
One rule of thumb for measuring the cost of alarms waking people, Dr. Carson said, would be to value people's lost leisure time at half their normal wage. In New York City, where the average wage is $15 an hour, a car alarm that woke 500 people for 15 minutes would thus cause more than $900 in social costs -- greater than the value of the typical radio being protected.
 
$10,000 Social Cost
 And assuming that there are, say, 10 false alarms for every real one, then the social cost of protecting a car from one attempted theft would rise above $10,000. That is twice the value of the average car that is stolen.
"You can come up with various figures using other methods," Dr. Carson said, "but it probably wouldn't change the outcome of a cost-benefit analysis. We know that the social costs of car alarms are not small, and we don't know that there any benefits, so there's a fairly good case for either outlawing them or giving stiff fines for false alarms."
Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler of New York City, who unsuccessfully proposed banning car alarms several years ago, said last week that he thought the idea would be more popular today. Henry J. Stern, a former City Councilman who is the president of the Citizens Union, a private watchdog group, agreed with him.
"The time has come to end this nuisance," Mr. Stern said. "We should certainly eliminate the insurance discounts for the alarms. Back in 1980 I would have voted for the discounts, because the alarms seemed like a way to deter thieves, but all they seem to do is stop New Yorker from sleeping. They should go the way of leaded gasoline, another car pollutant."
Dr. Sherman of the Crime Control Institute said he would favor either banning the alarms or issuing a fine whenever an alarm went off without any sign of forced entry, a tactic many communities have adopted toward home burglar alarms.
"At the very least," Dr. Sherman said, "there ought to be some effort made to make people with car alarms ashamed of how rude they're being to their neighbors. Moral appeals can be very effective with this kind of problem. Perhaps the police could be empowered to slap a big sticker on the windshield saying, 'Noise Polluter'."
He and other criminologists said that there are more effective devices that frustrate the thief instead of the neighborhood. These devices also generally qualify for discounts. Statistics gathered by insurance companies and the Federal Government have a shown dramatic reduction in theft when cars have electronic systems that disable the engine unless the right key is used.
Several new systems use silent devices that transmit radio signals, allowing stolen cars to be tracked on a computer screen. There are also quiet low-technology solutions available like the Club, a $60 bar that locks the steering wheel in place, although it generally does not qualify for the same insurance discounts as an alarm.
"The Club is visible, so it deters thieves from even attempting the crime," said Robert D. McCrie, a professor of security management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "It's cheap, it's simple, and it doesn't pollute the environment."
The Fraternal Order of Police last week endorsed the Club and began selling it in local lodges. The national president, Dewey R. Stokes, said the group had decided against endorsing any alarm systems.
"A thief can turn off the alarm and be driving away in 15 seconds, so what difference does the noise make?" Mr. Stokes asked. "Are the neighbors going to do anything? Considering the noise, they're probably glad to see the car going away."

HEADLINE: Talks on Gulf Crisis Lift Foreign Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Talks on the Persian Gulf war between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq lifted stock prices and the United States dollar yesterday on overseas markets. Oil prices headed lower.
The talks in Moscow brought a proposal from Mr. Gorbachev for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, which Mr. Aziz is conveying to Baghdad, and raised hopes for peace. That set off a wave of buying of stocks and the dollar. 
 No trading occurred in the United States, where the financial and commodity markets were closed for the Washington's Birthday holiday.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the stock exchange's main index soared to a six-month high yesterday in brisk trading, then fell today on heavy profit taking.
The Nikkei average of 225 stocks rose 3.5 percent yesterday, to close at 26,230.01, but fell 63.03 points, or less than 1 percent, today. At the end to today's trading, the Nikkei was at 26,166.98. The gauge finished the morning session up 202.50 points, also less than 1 percent, to 26,432.51.
Stocks also rose yesterday in Europe. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index gained 21.4 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 2,318.3. But volume was below the level of Friday.
In Frankfurt, the German stock index picked up 41 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 1,572.31.
In Canada, stocks rose slightly as interest rates were cut. The Toronto Stock Exchange composite index gained 25.99 points, to 3,532.54. Advancing issues led declines 340 to 206 on volume of 18.2 million shares.
Four of Canada's leading banks cut their prime lending rates yesterday by half a percentage point, to 11.25 percent, to match the Bank of Montreal, which had made a similar move last week.
 
Dollar Gains Overseas
 In foreign exchange trading, the dollar gained yesterday against leading currencies in Europe and Tokyo. Gold prices fell.
Currency dealers said an end to the fighting in the Persian Gulf would help deficit-cutting efforts in the United States, benefiting the economy and the dollar.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with the late Friday quotes, included: 1.4845 German marks, up from 1.4765; 1.2730 Swiss francs, up from 1.2685; 5.0518 French francs, up from 5.0310; 1.6725 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6635; 1,113.38 Italian lire, up from 1,110.00, and 1.1526 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1543.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.29 yen yesterday to close at 129.95 yen. The dollar was quoted in London at 130.45 yen.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $363 an ounce, from $365.25 late Friday. Gold fell in Zurich to $364, from $364.85, and it fell in Hong Kong to $365.98, from $369.97.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $3.78 an ounce, from $3.84 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Plants May Teach How to Make Fuel From Sunbeams

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS believe they are on the verge of constructing test-tube versions of photosynthesis, the basic life process in which plants tap the sun's energy. Their aim is to open the way to new sources of usable energy based on the cheapest and most abundant of raw materials: sunlight, water and carbon dioxide.
In principle, the effort could eventually enable chemists to mount a new two-front attack on the threat of global warming posed by the buildup of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Artificial assemblies of photosynthetic molecules that converted the sun's energy into liquid fuels like hydrogen would both cut demand for oil, and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
 "That's the dream," said Dr. Mark Wrighton, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is in the forefront of photosynthesis research.
"We can see how to do it and we're embarking at this point on a faithful reproduction of the biological system," he said in an interview. "We hope we'll be able to make inexpensive molecules, make them efficiently and make them durable."
Dr. Wrighton was the main speaker on the subject at the Second Annual Frontiers of Science Symposium conducted recently by the National Academy of Sciences at Irvine, Calif., where many of the latest advances were described.
"Understanding has been developing very, very fast," and the close circle of scientists working on the problem has become "a very excited group of people," said Dr. George L. McLendon of the University of Rochester, another speaker.
In a critical step, chemists have already put together elegant artificial versions of the basic molecular mechanism that is at the heart of photosynthesis. In this mechanism, solar energy strikes molecules of chlorophyll inside the leaves of green plants. The energy infuses electrons with new force, sending them leaping and cascading from molecule to molecule, transferring energy as they go.
The chain of reactions ultimately results in the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the carbohydrates that sustain almost all life. Oxygen is released to the atmosphere as a byproduct.
Scientists believe they will be able in time to manipulate the process to produce not only carbohydrates, but also hydrogen, methane and other forms of chemical energy. Methane is the essential ingredient of natural gas, the burning of which emits less carbon dioxide than either coal or oil. The burning of hydrogen emits no carbon dioxide. It could be used to power motor vehicles or, combined with oxygen in a fuel cell, to make electricity.
Plants convert solar energy to chemical energy inside organs called chloroplasts, tiny components of plant cells. The parts of the chloroplast that capture solar energy and set off the cascade of electrons are known as photochemical reaction centers. These are complexes of proteins and the green-colored chlorophyll molecules that give plants their distinctive color.
Photosynthesis begins when particles of light, known as photons, strike molecules of chlorophyll. Each photon boosts an electron in the chlorophyll to a higher energy state. The excited electron then jumps across to a special "carrier" molecule nearby. This is the first in a sequence of leaps by electrons between molecules that are held in precise positions in a special membrane in the reaction center.
Along the way, the electrons give up some of the energy imparted to them by the photon. In a reaction separate from the chain of jumping electrons, this energy is harvested as a compound known as adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This compound plays an important role in the subsequent manufacture of carbohydrates.
 
'Dark Photosynthesis'
 Back in the main stream of electron flow, the energy level of the leaping electrons is reboosted by a second photon, and the electrons cascade down a second series of molecules. This chain of events culminates in the creation ofa molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydride, or NADPH. The NADPH molecule is a sort of special-purpose battery that stores electrons for the vital reaction in which NADPH teams with ATP to convert carbon dioxide from the air into carbohydrates, or sugars.
These sugars provide food for plants and hence for almost all life. The reactions that create them constitute a second phase of the process, called "dark photosynthesis" because it is not directly dependent on sunlight.
The electron that is lost at the start of photosynthesis, when a photon strikes the first chlorophyll molecule, must be replaced so as to restore the system to its initial state. Replacement electrons come from water molecules through a mechanism that is not yet completely understood. In surrendering electrons, the water molecules split apart into hydrogen atoms and oxygen. The oxygen is released to the atmosphere.
Despite their considerable understanding of this mechanism, scientists have only recently gained insight into what Dr. McLendon calls the "basic ground rules that nature is playing with." These involve, for instance, such critical details as the way in which the parts of the system are physically arranged in relation to each other, the distances electrons must travel and the speeds at which the action takes place.
"There is nothing magic about the molecules used in photosynthesis," said Dr. Thomas E. Mallouk of the University of Texas at Austin, another participant in the Frontiers of Science symposium. "What's special about it is that they're organized in a certain spatial arrangement that allows the electrons to go in one direction in the chain."
How the leap of electrons happens "is one of the big things that's been worked out in the past six years," said Dr. McLendon. "The distances that the electron has to jump are very big compared to the sizes of the molecules. It is clear that in photosynthesis, electrons can jump a lot farther than we used to think."
 
Building Molecules That Work
 In the last few years, scientists in several laboratories have designed assemblies of molecules that mimic the photochemical reaction center in its ability to absorb photons and excite electrons. "We can make very complicated molecules now, and big ones," and they work, said Dr. Wrighton of M.I.T., whose laboratory is one of the makers.
The first such molecule was synthesized in 1983 by chemists at Arizona State University. It consisted of an electron-donating molecule, a light-absorbing molecule and an electron-accepting molecule, all linked in the right way to make the photochemical reaction possible.
Scientists say progress has been rapid since then, and several laboratories have produced synthetic molecules that duplicate the essence of photosynthesis.
One of the latest, reported last year, is a five-part molecule called the pentad system, produced by the Arizona State laboratory that first created the triad molecule. "We're basically using the same building blocks as nature, but we're controlling the structure differently," said Dr. Devens Gust, a leader of the Arizona team.
The pentad molecule is made of organic chemicals that absorb light and receive and donate electrons. The chemicals are porphyrins, quinones and sometimes materials derived from chlorophyll itself. But while nature embeds the molecules in protein, the Arizona State researchers hold them together through chemical bonds.
The salient advantage of the molecule, said Dr. Gust, is that it mimics the multistep cascading of electrons so as to maintain an energetic state long enough for useful products to be derived. If the chain is too short, the energy will simply dissipate before anything useful can happen.
 
'Microscopic Swiss Cheese'
 Dr. Mallouk's group at the University of Texas is duplicating the light-induced cascade of electrons with a chain of nonbiological molecules containing the metal ruthenium. These molecules absorb light like chlorophyll. The molecule was devised by Michael Gratzel, a Swiss chemist.
The Texas team has strung five of these molecules together, embedding them in a matrix made from minerals called zeolites. The zeolites are full of empty spaces, "like microscopic Swiss cheese," says Dr. Mallouk, and the spaces can be strung together to make tunnels about the size of a molecule.
By choosing zeolites with the right pore size, the Texas team believes it will be possible to solve a major problem: how to hold the molecules in place at proper distances and angles from each other. This orientation "is going to be central to getting high efficiency whether we make electricity or whether we make chemical fuel," said Dr. Wrighton.
In the first place, the molecule at one end of the electron-transfer chain must be kept away from the molecule at the other end; otherwise, the two molecules would exchange electrons and all the energy originally absorbed from the sun would be lost as heat. And even if they can be kept apart, molecules must be arranged in certain ways, relative to each other, for maximum efficiency of energy conversion from solar to chemical.
Most of the artificial assemblies of molecules until now have been suspended in an electrolyte solution. This means that although the early steps of photosynthesis can be carried out efficiently, the energy is ultimately dissipated. Apart from the Texas zeolite method, researchers are trying to embed the molecules in some sort of biological material, as in nature; to bind them to films, and to suspend them chemically, as Dr. Wrighton's group is trying to do, between two electrodes.
Researchers face an even more difficult problem in the question of how water molecules yield up electrons to replace those lost by chlorophyll. They do not fully understand this process, although they know that a manganese compound plays a critical role.
 
'Like a Tinker Toy Box'
 A group headed by Dr. Thomas J. Meyer of the University of North Carolina is approaching the problem by substituting a ruthenium compound for the manganese compound, which is hard to manipulate in an artificial system because it is so unstable. The more stable ruthenium mimics the action of manganese so well, said Dr. Meyer, that "we're beginning to get a good handle" on electron replacement.
Still another challenge is presented by "dark photosynthesis," the final part of the process in which NADPH and ATP are used to create carbohydrates from carbon dioxide. Duplicating this, says Dr. Meyer, "is difficult chemistry" and "no picnic."
How close are scientists to fashioning artificial photosynthetic systems that could produce usable energy?
"We could almost put all this together in a single device now, but we're not quite ready yet," said Dr. Meyer. "It's just like a Tinker Toy box. All the pieces are lying around, some of them assembled, but the complete assembly has yet to be done."
Dr. McLendon says that while "many people have done elegant synthesis and have made some lovely molecules," scientists understand the process "to about a 90 percent level.
"But that's like saying we understand engineering principles to within 90 percent of building a bridge," he said. "You wouldn't want to drive over it."
 
Economic Question Remains
 And even if all these problems are solved, years of further development will be required before any operational devices can be produced.
A major question is how much of the energy carried by photons can be converted to practical use. Theoretically, said Dr. Wrighton, 20 to 25 percent could be converted. This efficiency would rival that of conventional photovoltaic systems.
With such efficiencies, scientists believe, artificial photosynthesis might be used to produce a variety of fuels. In theory, chemists could manipulate the photochemical reaction center so as to produce methane or hydrogen in place of NADPH.
Once the technical problems are solved, the question of economic feasibility remains. But the prospect of converting the sun's energy directly into liquid fuels, and of removing unwanted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is too important to ignore. So scientists are pressing ahead on the basic science of the problem in the hope of an eventual payoff.
Dr. McLendon calls it "the scientific field-of-dreams approach" to technological advance: "If you build the foundation, it will come."
 
Green Power: Inside the Plant's Energy Factory
 
In photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into the compounds ATP and NADPH, which play key roles in chemical reactions that create sugars out of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The sugars sustain almost all life, and the process releases oxygen to the atmosphere as a byproduct. All this takes place in tiny organs, called chloroplasts, within leaf cells. Scientists hope to open up new sources of energy by duplicating the process artificially.
 
The Chemical Cascade of Energy
 
Photosynthesis begins inside a complex of proteins and chorophyll, called a photochemical reaction center, when a photon, or particle of sunlight, strikes
a chlorophyll molecule.
 
The photon boosts an electron to a higher energy state, and it jumps to a special "carrier" molecule. This is the first in a sequence of such electron leaps. At the same time, protons accumulate in the lumen, or cell interior.
 
Electrons lose energy along the way. To regain it, they jump to a second chlorophyll molecule, where a second photon reboosts the energy level, and a second cascade of electrons begins. It ends with the synthesis of NADPH.
 
The protons that have accumulated in the lumen trigger the synthesis of ATP. Outside the photochemical reaction center, in the stroma, ATP and NADPH drive the manufacture of sugars from carbon dioxide.
 
To restore the system to its initial state, the electron that is lost from chlorophyll at the start must be replaced. It comes from water molecules which then react to release oxygen to the air.

Giant That Lost Race to Moon
 
Soviet space officials have released details of the N1 rocket, designed to carry men to the Moon in the 1970's, a space ship whose existence was denied until a year ago. It failed because its many first-stage engines could not be mede to deliver stable, reliable thrust, the officials now say. Like the successful Unites States Saturn 5, it was about 370 feet long. The first three stages were to place the lunar module and Soyuz transport vehicle into Earth orbit. The fourth stage was to propel the vehicles toward the Moon, and the fifth stage was for insertion into lunar orbit, initial descent and return to Earth.

HEADLINE: Mining Dead Cars for Money

 BODY:
Making use of new enforcement authority, New York City is slowly beating the blight of abandoned cars -- adding to the city's depleted treasury in the process. But help from Albany could permit a lot more progress.
Plateless hulks, cannibalized by scavengers and vandals, deface every city neighborhood. Last year the Sanitation Department had to remove an astonishing 121,000 dead cars from city streets, up from only 31,000 in 1981. 
 The problem is finally starting to shrink. The city's 1989 hulk count was a record 140,000. To some extent, the decline results from higher scrap metal prices and a sour economy that makes people more reluctant to junk old cars. But there's another factor: The city has finally embarked on a serious program of stiff fines.
Previous crackdowns failed mostly because of an impractical requirement that abandoned-car summonses be served in person. Two years ago, at the city's behest, the State Legislature changed the law. The Sanitation Department now may serve summonses by certified mail, and the minimum fine has been raised to a hefty $250.
Using the number found on most engine blocks and a computer link with the State Motor Vehicles Department, sanitation agents track hulks to the last registered owner, then mail out a summons; owners who report a theft are not liable.
The early results are impressive. During 1990, the first complete year of the new program, the city mailed out nearly 19,000 abandoned-car summonses and collected nearly $1 million in fines -- an amount the city says is about double its administrative costs. That compares with just 3,500 summonses issued and $73,000 collected the year before. The program's manager, Roy Pantangelo, estimates the city will mail out 50,000 summonses this year.

HEADLINE: Conserve Oil -- and Wilderness

 BODY:
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge forms only a small part of Alaska. Smaller still is the coastal plain of the refuge, a narrow wilderness that flanks the Beaufort Sea. The frozen plain is home to maybe 200 Eskimos, 180,000 caribou and dozens of rare Arctic species. It may also contain the biggest undiscovered oilfield in the United States.
President Bush wants to open the plain for exploration. The proposal symbolizes everything that's wrong with what is known of Mr. Bush's energy strategy, which will be unveiled this week. It's not so much that he would exploit an ecological treasure, although to many environmentalists that is the heart of the matter. What's worse is that he would do so even though conservation could achieve the same results without risk to the environment. 
 The oil industry, which is running out of places to drill, makes a strong case for exploring the refuge. It says that only 12,700 acres of the plain -- less than 1 percent -- would be marred by the usual detritus: rigs, pipelines, drilling mud, airfields. Meanwhile, the Interior Department figures the odds are one in five of finding as much as 3.4 billion barrels of oil. By industry standards, those are good odds promising a huge return. By 2005, assuming quick discovery, the field could reach peak production of 800,000 barrels a day. That's 10 percent of all present U.S. production.
These numbers are almost big enough to obscure two counteraguments. One: The oil under the plain is not a renewable resource. Soon it will be gone. Two: If the objective is to reduce reliance on foreign oil and create a rational long-range energy policy -- and Mr. Bush says it is -- there may be far better ways of achieving it.
For example, assuming that the number of cars increases only slightly, a gradual increase in fuel economy standards from 27.5 miles per gallon to 40 could reduce demand by two million barrels of oil per day by 2005. That's far more than the coastal plain could produce. Besides, the conservation saving would be permanent.
Mandating tough fuel standards may not be the most fair or effective way to save oil. A good case can be made for a stiff gasoline tax that goes to the root of America's addiction to petroleum. In the bargain, it would raise money to develop other energy sources. Yet neither alternative is mentioned in the energy proposals now circulating in Washington. Nor is there more than a hint that consumption may be part of the energy equation. Give me the refuge, the President seems to say, and we will drill our way out of dependency.
Perhaps, someday, a stronger case can be made for exploring this fragile terrain. But Mr. Bush hasn't begun to make it. Until he does, the man who asks to be known as the Environment President sounds like the Expedient President instead.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The Soviet-Iraq Axis

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
There's no use getting mad at Mikhail Gorbachev and his partner, Saddam Hussein. Both are doing what comes naturally to two nervous dictators trying to get out of terminal trouble.
The Moscow-Baghdad axis, obviously and openly, is at work on a plan that would restore to the Soviet Union and Iraq the power that both have lost in the Middle East. It would also meet another objective of interest to both men -- survival. 
 Mr. Gorbachev needs some success to take Soviet minds off his stumbling leadership. It won't work for long, but at least in the Kremlin losers are shuffled off to a villa somewhere.
The Iraqi leader has an even more vivid interest involved. In the Middle East, a dacha is not prepared for a suddenly unemployed ruler -- just a grave.
The Moscow-Baghdad alliance was never dissolved. In the eternal struggle against naivete about the Kremlin and the third world, it helps to keep that in mind. The Soviet Union was Saddam Hussein's chief ally and source of weapons. Scud missiles landing in Saudi Arabia and the tanks facing American troops are Soviet made.
Of course, our Western allies also armed him while Washington smiled and appeased. Most of our current Arab allies toadied to him or stuffed his treasury with money. Saddam Hussein: he belongs to us all.
The difference is that Moscow never broke the axis with Baghdad, despite its clucking about Kuwait. The U.S. paid for this mouth support with fawning gratitude. Hardly a word did Washington say about the hundreds of Soviet military "technicians" who stayed on in Iraq to extend comradely help with Soviet weapons or the case of the Soviet ship caught with weapon parts destined for Iraq through Jordan. Politically, the Soviet Union kept working for Iraq through Mr. Gorbachev's personal envoy.
Now comes the mutual payoff. Saddam Hussein faces defeat. He knew it was coming. He is neither martyr, mystic nor moron. In meetings with Soviet diplomats, the Iraqis prepared their line of retreat and survival.
Saddam Hussein would withdraw from Kuwait -- with the U.S. accepting some formula on the importance of settling other Mideast issues. Washington would never use the word linkage, but Saddam Hussein would be strengthened because the world would know a deal when it smelled one.
Saddam Hussein would take his tanks and missiles with him. They would join the divisions he left in Iraq. Teheran would deliver the air armada he thoughtfully parked in Iran. Saddam Hussein would emerge battered, but still dangerous.
Moscow would be waiting to pitch in with arms and advisers, despite any international agreements. The Soviet Union's double-crossing on treaties is spelled out devastatingly in Arnold Beichman's new book "The Long Pretense" (Transaction Publishers).
With contempt, let's dispose of the argument already being heard that Americans opposed to a settlement that would strengthen the Moscow-Baghdad axis are itching to march on Baghdad and don't care about American casualties. That is brother to the one about how only Israel and its amen corner in the U.S. were beating the war drums against Iraq -- remember that one?
No march on Baghdad is necessary -- simply a continuation of President Bush's steady course. A ground attack should not start a day earlier or later than planned before the Gorbachev-Hussein maneuvers.
 Primary objectives should be Iraq out of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein out of power. If we do not achieve the second at once, we should work at it incessantly after he pulls out.
To rest with him in power would be hypocrisy crossing into criminality. The U.N. called for a restoration of international peace and security in the Persian Gulf area.
 Does anybody really believe Saddam Hussein would cooperate with that goal? Would he suddenly deal honestly with the international machinery needed to prevent him from getting new weapons, including chemical or nuclear ingredients? Anybody?
President Bush has advised Iraqis to get rid of their tyrant. The honesty horrified bureaucrats and former bureaucrats as official honesty usually does. Mr. Bush showed respect to Iraqis by speaking the truth to them -- peace and Saddam Hussein cannot exist together. Mr. Gorbachev is sophisticated enough to know that.
 No, it is not a firm Mideast peace Mr. Gorbachev and his axis partner seek but their own survival and renewed power. Did anybody expect anything else of either partner? Anybody?

HEADLINE: Don't Call Today's Combat Soldier Low Skilled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The issue in "The Killing Fields Aren't Level" (editorial, Jan. 28), as old as Socrates, is the citizen's debt to the democratic state. Stating that recruiters don't advertise the risk to life inherent to service is gratuitous. Airlines, motorcycle and automobile dealers, athletic clubs, hospitals and others don't advertise risks either.
You can't join the armed forces by accident. The system requires examinations, interviews and signed statements, continuing even after arrival at recruit training. The goal is to prevent anybody's joining any service with any disqualifications or false expectations, including risk. The benefit of the doubt goes to the recruit, to include enlistment voiding.
The oft-repeated "low-skill-combat-duty" aphorism is becoming conventional wisdom. "Platoon," "China Beach" and others set up this image. It is wrong. It does not follow that a task is low skill if not technically oriented and structured. Nor can high risk and low skill be logically coupled.
The skilled combat arms soldier or marine is the product of a lengthy training regime, progressing through basic skill qualification and then unit training. He is skilled in the employment of three or four individual weapons. He is not a mere ammunition mule and bullet hose holder. He understands both mechanized and foot-soldier tactics. He is skilled in the operation capabilities of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, for he is most often the controlling agent.
Directing aircraft means he understands antiaircraft weapons. He is skilled in geometry and navigation, to direct mortars and artillery. He integrates artillery, aircraft and direct-fire weapons simultaneously in the same airspace. The pilots trust him, not something they are likely to do for somebody with low skill. Armor and antiarmor, mine and countermine weapons and tactics, use of demolitions, computers, motor vehicles, laser designators, thermal sights, satellite communications gear and organization of supply and logistics are part of his kit.
Perhaps most significant, willingly firing upon the enemy, and discriminating between combatants and noncombatants, are acts of high initiative. These require sophisticated moral and ethical judgments not normally attributed to the low skilled.
Postwar, many of the new American success stories will be written by those who can operate in the unstructured chaos at the edge of the modern battlefield, generating solutions under the most severe stress imaginable. Who better to sort out the problems of our economy, industry, families, drug addiction and schools? Independent thinkers or structured technologists? Perhaps we will need less technical structure and more "low skill" solutions in the 1990's.

HEADLINE: Don't Call Today's Combat Soldier Low Skilled;
Dependent Allowances

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Support the troops. What started as a simple call has grown into a crescendo. Even the opponents of our latest war make it clear that their activities are not meant to demean the men and women over there. We show support with snippets of ribbon, massive flag waving, a steady stream of letters to the front. New support symbols appear almost daily.
In war, as elsewhere, talk is cheap. Television reports remind us of the economic plight of the dependents of an unknown but obviously large number of the soldiers called to duty in the Persian Gulf. They are wives, husbands, young children, grandparents called suddenly to shoulder unanticipated burdens. One night's special case was a bedridden mother supported and cared for entirely by a son who was called up.
Symbols don't pay rent or feed children. I suggest an immediate increase in allowances for dependents of enlisted military personnel stationed in the war theater and enactment of a graduated income tax surcharge to finance the costs of the allowances.

HEADLINE: Eugene Fodor, Creator of Guides For Worldwide Travel, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Eugene Fodor, whose travel guides have been carried by tourists to the far corners of the world for more than half a century, died last night at the Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. He was 85 years old and lived in Litchfield, Conn.
He died of a brain tumor, said a business associate, Robert Fisher. 
 Mr. Fodor's approach to travel writing was set forth in his first book, "1936 . . . On the Continent," a guide to Europe for British travelers that he published in London. The joy of travel, he wrote, should not be derived solely from seeing "the sights," but from mingling with "peoples whose customs, habits and general outlook are different from your own."
Between "On the Continent" and Mr. Fodor's retirement a decade ago, the number of Fodor guides grew to more than 140 titles, many in languages other than English. Roughly 200 million Fodor guides, now published in the United States by Random House, are sold each year.
 
Spoke 5 Languages
 Mr. Fodor was born in Leva, Hungary, now part of Czechoslovakia. He left as a youth to study political economics at the Sorbonne and at the University of Grenoble in France. A desire to travel and an ability to speak five languages led him to work as an interpreter for a French shipping line.
In his spare time he wrote articles for the line's in-house magazine about life aboard ship and visits to exotic ports. Soon he was selling articles to newspapers in Hungary and France.
In 1934, while working for the Aldor Publishing Company in London, he suggested a guidebook to the Continent that would contain the "human element" he found lacking in guides of the day.
The book was a success, and in 1938, when it was published for American travelers, it became a best seller. He was in the United States on a business trip that year, and when Nazi Germany annexed the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, he concluded that World War II was imminent.
He stayed in the United States, went into the Army in 1942 and served five years in the intelligence branch, emerging a captain.
 
A C.I.A. Link Charged
 Three decades later E. Howard Hunt Jr., the former Central Intelligence Agency operative who figured in the Watergate scandal, asserted that Mr. Fodor had been a C.I.A. agent, which Mr. Fodor denied. He declined to comment, however, on Mr. Hunt's contention that the Fodor guides had provided operating cover for American intelligence agents abroad.
In 1950 the David McKay Company in New York began publishing a series of Fodor guides to individual countries, and Mr. Fodor set up a Paris headquarters. The first four guides covered France, Switzerland and Italy and, in a move that angered the Irish, combined Britain and Ireland in a single book. Subsequent guides dealt separately with Ireland.
Mr. Fodor returned to the United States in 1964 to live in Litchfield, Conn., and began compiling travel books about this country.
"America is still a little-known and little-understood country, and we don't do much to promote ourselves abroad," he said at the time. "We may go to Europe to visit our past, but the rest of the world comes to America to see their future."
Mr. Fodor is survived by his wife, the former Vlasta Zobel, whom he married in 1948.

Barnes Names a Chief From Outside Family

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The Barnes Group, a 134-year-old industrial company in Bristol, Conn., has named William R. Fenoglio chief executive. He is the first executive from outside the Barnes family to lead the company.
Mr. Fenoglio, 51, will take over in April after Wallace Barnes steps down at age 65. Mr. Barnes will continue as chairman. 
 Barnes, with sales last year of $550 million, is in the precision spring and aircraft component businesses and the distribution of maintenance supplies.
The company was founded by Mr. Barnes's great-grandfather, and the family owns a third of the stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Some Barnes family members serve on the board, including Carlyle F. Barnes, Mr. Barnes's first cousin and a retired executive officer of the company.
But there are no other Barneses in the company's executive offices. Mr. Fenoglio was recruited six years ago from the General Electric Company and joined Barnes as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Fenoglio will continue as president as well as being chief executive.
"There will be no dramatic changes in store," Mr. Fenoglio said. "We believe in focus. We've got three good business with a lot of opportunities."
The company is feeling the effects of recession, especially in the auto industry. "This is a fairly tough time, with the auto market a big part of our precision spring business," he said. "People are worried about the war and about having jobs. I don't see it being too short term," he said of the slump.
But he said that Barnes was a "well-managed company able to handle adversity."
Mr. Fenoglio is a graduate of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind. From there he went to G.E., where he spent 23 years. In his last job at G.E., he was general manager of the component motor division in Fort Wayne, Ind.
Wallace Barnes was named president in 1964 and that year the company diversified away from its Associated Spring business with the acquisition of the Bowman Distribution Group. It entered the aerosapce business in the early 1980's.

HEADLINE: Harrods to Cut 600 From Work Force

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Harrods department store, whose popularity with tourists has made it a London landmark, said it would slash 14 percent of its work force, partly because of a drop in tourism caused by the war in the Persian Gulf. Harrods said the 600 job cuts had also been caused by Britain's deepening recession.
The reductions among the 4,200 staff will be made mainly in sales, distribution and administrative departments, the company said. Last month, Harrods cut 90 jobs because of the drop-off in foreign visitors. Americans and Europeans have cut back their travel plans.

HEADLINE: DEBATE ON SAVING RIVER LOCK SYSTEM

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KAUKAUNA, Wis., Feb. 19

 BODY:
A battle to save one of the last hand-operated river navigation systems in the nation is pitting local interests against a Federal agency unwilling to pay a $20 million repair bill.
The system consists of 17 wooden locks along a 37-mile stretch of the Fox River, their gates and water valves cranked by hand. Once a vital link for moving goods between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, the 140-year-old locks have not been regularly used since the early 1960's, and some are falling apart. 
 For communities along the Fox, in northeastern Wisconsin, the locks are a historic jewel whose restoration could mean millions of dollars for local economies. For the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been responsible for the locks since they were built, they are an expensive nuisance that ought to be dismantled. Nearly nine years of negotiations have failed to settle the dispute.
 
A Matter for Congress
 The locks connect Green Bay, on Lake Michigan, with Lake Winnebago, a popular fishing and boating haven. Once they raised cargo boats 169 feet from Lake Michigan to Lake Winnebago, taking them through nine dams built to supply power for paper, lumber and flour mills. Now their condition is so precarious that the locks can be used only by special arrangement.
Congress would have to approve the Corps of Engineers' recommendation to dismantle the system. The Fox River communities hope their members of Congress will help them prevail despite the tight Federal budget.
"It is definitely going to be a tough battle; nobody doubts that at all," said Beverly Anthony, an aide to Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat. "It is going to require a lot of work by every member of the Wisconsin delegation."
State and local officials say they are willing to assume operation of the locks, but not until they are repaired. They argue that the corps wrongly allowed the system to fall into disrepair.
Since at least 1982, the corps has worked to abandon the locks, refusing to do regular repairs or maintenance. A local group, the Fox River Management Commission, has leased and operated the locks since then.
One lock has been closed. It still has wooden logs for walls and could collapse with little warning. It would cost an estimated $2 million to rebuild.
 
Recreation and Development
 Friends of the Fox, a citizens' group formed to save the navigation system, say the locks would enhance recreational boating, preserve a historic treasure and insure future development in the Fox River Valley. "Would you build a new system? Probably not," said Mayor Ron Van De Hey of Kaukauna, co-chairman of the Fox River Management Commission. "Would you save the old one? Absolutely."
The corps estimates that restoring the locks to reasonable operating condition would cost $20 million; the local interests' estimate is $10 million. Jim Bonetti, project manager for the corps at Kaukauna, said it would cost about $4 million to dismantle them.
Richard Dexter, an archeologist with the State Historical Society, said historic reasons alone should justify the cost of repairs. The only other hand-operated system is on the Muskingum River in Ohio, where the state owns 10 locks and uses them entirely for pleasure boating.
"It is still a living, breathing and functioning system that you can maintain and preserve," Mr. Dexter said of the Fox River locks. "It is a major artifact. It clearly is the major reason you have the Fox River Valley as it is today."

HEADLINE: Nortek Halts Its Dividend

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Feb. 19

 BODY:
Nortek Inc. said today that it would suspend dividend payments after its fourth-quarter loss soared because of a 12.5 percent drop in sales.
Nortek lost $35.8 million on revenue of $224.6 million, compared with a loss of almost $6.7 million a year earlier on revenue of $256.8 million. 
 The building-products manufacturer said it saw no prospects for improvement until the economy improved and consumer uncertainty over the Persian Gulf war ended.
Nortek's yearly loss was $38.1 million, compared with a loss of $12.5 million in 1989. The company had sales of nearly $1.04 billion last year, 3.7 percent below its $1.08 billion in sales in 1989.
Richard L. Bready, Nortek's new chairman and chief executive, said that Nortek would indefinitely suspend quarterly dividends of 2.5 cents a share on its common stock and a cent a share on its special common stock.
Nortek, which was heavily involved in the "junk bond" market under its former chairman, Ralph R. Papitto, said it continued to consider restructuring debt, selling assets or seeking bank financing to cut costs.
Nortek's stock fell 62.5 cents today, to $3.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, where its 16.7 percent decline was the worst of the day.

HEADLINE: Marketing in the Classroom: Assets vs. Liabilities

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
When Whittle Communications introduced a daily television news program, with advertising, in schoolrooms last year, the action touched off a noisy debate among educators, corporations and consumer advocates about marketing to impressionable children.
But for years some of the nation's largest corporations have been quietly marketing to millions of schoolchildren, with little controversy and with the tacit or even open approval of school administrators. 
 Corporations hand out samples of Noxzema skin cream and Tampax tampons in home economics classes and distribute millions of Halloween "safety kits" with corporate trademarks like Kool-Aid emblazoned on the side.
Some educators describe such practices as ethically murky at best and exploitative at worst -- the dark side of corporate America's bid to help financially ailing schools. Others say school budgets are so tight that they welcome whatever help they can get.
"Schools are so under the gun that they are willing to accept anything," said Bill Honig, the state superintendent of public instruction in California, the nation's largest state school system with more than 4.9 million children. William L. Rukeyser, an aide to Mr. Honig who has studied the issue, said, "We don't want to see the nation's schools turn from a marketplace of ideas to simply a marketplace."
Next month, a not-for-profit group of educators and business executives, the National Association of Partners in Education, is scheduled to release the first draft of pioneer guidelines on corporate marketing in schools.
 
'Benefits Outweigh Pitfalls'
 As government expenditures for schools have declined, cash-strapped school districts appreciate corporate marketing because it is free. In Gallup, N.M., Susan M. Cave, county coordinator for elementary instruction, allows schools to use corporate-sponsored materials, because, she said,"the benefits outweigh the pitfalls for the few minutes of advertising."
Marketing exectives say critics exaggerate the dangers. "We are not descendants of Attila the Hun crashing through the window and pillaging the classroom," said Edwin L. Swanson, senior vice president of Modern Talking Picture Service Inc., another company that markets to schools. "Even philanthropy has to have a bottom line. Companies have an interest in helping kids, but they also have an interest in taking credit for their help."
The move to have guidelines drawn up by the National Association of Partners in Education was partly prompted by the Whittle marketing program, which many educators oppose.
 
Agreement With Schools
 Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., agrees to provide about $50,000 worth of television and videocassette equipment to the average school in return for students watching 10 minutes of Whittle-produced news programs interspersed with two minutes of unobstrusive corporate advertising from companies like Burger King.
Some states, including New York and Rhode Island, have banned Whittle from their schools. In California, Mr. Honig has ruled that public schools cannot legally accept Whittle's program and has threatened to cut off those who do.
Some educators distinguish between the Whittle program and corporate-sponsored materials that teachers are free to use as they see fit. They also say the potential for controversy is most acute when marketing comes from companies that make products that children can readily buy.
Consumers Union, a group that tries to assess advertiser and product claims, has denounced virtually all corporate marketing in schools as "brainwashing and not advertising," and advocates that schools be declared "ad-free zones."
Mr. Swanson of Modern Talking Picture Service said such a move would be disastrous. "To make rules foolishly strict," he said, "is to make it hard for corporations to justify school aid to the bean counters. They're going to say, 'What are we getting for the money?' "
 
Pens and Creative Writing
 Lifetime Learning Systems Inc., in Fairfield, Conn., says it has produced 650 programs for 350 clients. One of its most popular programs, sponsored by Bic, the maker of pens, is designed to encourage creative writing. "Yes, it's an advertisement for Bic," said Roberta Nusim, the company's recently retired founder. "But does the benefit of this program outweigh the logo on this material? I would say yes."
Lois R. Van Wagner, a high school science teacher at East Rock School in New Haven said such materials are welcome. She said she spends about $400 of her own money for magazines, field trips and other ways of supplementing textbooks.
Ms. Wagner uses a free science program sponsored by the GTE Corporation called, "Discover the World of Science." If companies were banned from such marketing efforts, she said, "who else is going to pick up the tab?"

1,000 to 1,500 Job Cuts For Pratt & Whitney

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that it would eliminate between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs from its Pratt & Whitney division in the first half of this year.
The division, which makes military and commercial jet engines, cited continuing deterioration of the market for aircraft equipment. 
 United Technologies announced last August that it would eliminate 4,000 jobs by 1993 because of expected cutbacks in Defense Department contracts. But the company said yesterday that the layoffs would be accomplished at a quicker pace than originally expected.
"Events in the Persian Gulf and higher fuel prices are having an adverse impact on the world's airline industry," said James G. O'Connor, executive vice president of Pratt & Whitney. "Airlines are flying less and have decreased their spending for equipment."
The reductions will be accomplished largely through attrition, but layoffs have not been ruled out, the company said. Pratt & Whitney, the largest division of United Technologies, has a worldwide work force of about 45,000. The company said that most of the positions affected would be at Pratt & Whitney plants in Connecticut, with smaller cuts at plants in Maine, Georgia and Florida.
The announcement yesterday came three weeks after United Technologies reported an 8 percent drop in fourth-quarter net income. The company, which is based in Hartford, said its earnings were hurt by continuing losses at its military division.
In New York yesterday, Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief executive, repeated a forecast for 1991, saying the year could be slow for the company without a significant revival in the domestic economy. "The first half will be down unless the nation gets a few pleasant surprises that jump-start the economy," he said.
Military contracts account for about 35 percent of Pratt & Whitney's business, and the company has been trying to shift its operation to more civilian products to offset Pentagon cutbacks. It has a huge business supplying engines for passenger jets, but its $20 billion backlog of orders is spread out over 10 years, lessening the company's ability to cushion immediate military cuts.
Citing military cuts in recent years, United Technologies has already laid off hundreds of workers at other divisions, including Sikorsky Aircraft, a maker of helicopters in Stratford, Conn., and Norden Systems Inc., an electronics and propulsion systems company in Norwalk, Conn.
United Technologies' stock was unchanged yesterday, closing at $47.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Rearrangement Of Damon Stock

BYLINE: Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE Damon Corporation, an operator of clinical laboratories and one of the last leveraged buyouts financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has done better than it was expected to when it was taken over in 1989. Sales are up, and while heavy debts have forced it to report losses, those losses are a bit less than expected.
Now it plans to restructure in a complicated transaction -- involving a subsidiary taking over its corporate parent -- in a way that will make it far easier for insiders to take out cash. The plan announced yesterday, if completed, would also create a larger public company that could attract investors seeking a pure play in the lab business. 
 Damon has benefited from being in a booming business, something rare in these recessionary days. A small conglomerate when it was acquired in 1989, it has since sold all its businesses except the clinical labs, which now provide laboratory services to more than 30,000 doctors and 300 hospitals in 26 states. It says it is the fifth-largest clinical lab company in the country.
Among the operations sold were companies that made centrifuges, Estes model rockets and Hi-Flier kites. Those companies generally were sold for more than expected, Robert L. Rosen, Damon's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview last month.
Mr. Rosen said the lab business had grown in part because the management had remained in place. For the year that ended in August, Damon reported sales of $216.4 million, compared with $183.2 million the year before and well above the $202.4 million the company had predicted in early 1989.
Understanding Damon's business, clinical labs, is relatively easy. Understanding its capital structure is more difficult. The convolutions there, while typical of Drexel deals, may have turned off some investors who would be interested in a pure play in a rapidly growing business.
The Damon situation involves a wide variety of securities in two companies with similar names. The plan announced yesterday, if it is completed, would both simplify the corporate structure and get rid of some of the looming financial obligations that existed as part of that structure.
The parent company is Damon Group, which used to be known as the American Magnetics Corporation. Traded over-the-counter, its shares have boomed in recent weeks, benefiting both from the general stock market surge and from the perception that things were going well at the Damon Corporation, the operating subsidiary. Damon Group's shares fell 25 cents yesterday, to $7.25, after trading earlier in the day at $7.625, the highest level since 1985.
While Damon Group has other assets, including a Florida shopping center that is up for sale, its value is largely dependent on the operations of the Damon Corporation, of which it owns about 25 percent. The remainder of the Damon Corporation is owned by a variety of holders, led by a partnership controlled by Mr. Rosen. Drexel owns nearly 5 percent of the company, a residue of its financing of the May 1989 buyout.
Under the proposal announced yesterday, the Damon Corporation will acquire Damon Group, the company that is now publicly traded, by issuing more stock. The effect of that will be to make Damon Corporation shares publicly tradable, offering insiders the possibility of getting cash for some of their holdings. Holders of the current Damon Group stock will end up with Damon Corporation shares.
Mr. Rosen, a former vice chairman of Maxxam Group, previously was an investment banker and a close aide to Sanford Weill when Mr. Weill ran a predecessor of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Under the proposal announced yesterday, Damon Corporation preferred stock, which pays high dividends in more preferred stock, will be converted into common through a rights offering. The exact ratio of the exchange was not announced, and negotiating it could be a crucial part of the deal. Some preferred stock is held by institutions, and while nominally it is publicly traded, there seems to have been little activity.
Two insiders in Damon Group will sell out immediately, as part of the transaction. Harry S. Hendler and his brother, J. M. Hendler, both founders of American Magnetics, the predecessor of Damon Group, will sell their 20 percent stake, about one million shares, at $7 a share, and will collect additional payments of just over $1 million each to settle stock options and employment contracts. They will also agree not to compete with the company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher on Optimism Over Soviet Peace Proposal

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher on world currency markets yesterday, advancing on optimism that a Soviet peace proposal may help bring the Persian Gulf war to a close soon.
Gold prices also advanced. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $364.50 an ounce, up 10 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank reported a late bid of $363.70, up 20 cents.
Financial markets in the United States were closed Monday in observance of the Washington's Birthday holiday. 
 President Bush received details of the Soviet-backed peace plan on Monday but he did not make them public. Even his comment that the plan "falls well short of what would be required" did not diminish investors' appetite for dollars.
 
Began Rising Friday
 An end to the war "would give a big boost to consumer confidence and therefore would lead to an upturn in the U.S. economy, which is positive for the dollar," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The dollar began rising on Friday after President Saddam Hussein proposed a conditional withdrawal from Kuwait even though the United States dismissed the offer as a "hoax."
"The dollar tends to be trading higher on peace news or quick war news," said Andrew Hodge, of Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
Still, several traders said that it would be some time before the United States economy turned around. "We will still see weak economic data for a number of months," Mr. Johnson said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 130.55 Japanese yen, from 129.95 yen on Monday. Later in London, it rose to 131.55 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 131.58 yen, up from 130.50 yen on Monday.
 
Pound Falls in London
 In London, the British pound fell to $1.9505, from $1.9600 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.9496 to buy one pound, cheaper than Friday's $1.9670.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4935 German marks, up from 1.4777; 1.2785 Swiss francs, up from 1.2692; 5.0825 French francs, up from 5.0320; 1,112.00 Italian lire, up from 1,110.50, and 1.1528 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $362.50 a troy ounce, from $364 bid late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $362.30, from $364.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid $365.22.
Silver prices declined. On the Comex in New York, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.687 a troy ounce, down from $3.780 on Friday. In London the metal fell to a late bid price of $3.69 a troy ounce from Monday's $3.79.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Security Prices Fall Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped a bit further yesterday in light trading, as credit market participants lightened up positions on the eve of two days of Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan on the economy and monetary policy.
Mr. Greenspan, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve is required by law to provide twice-yearly assessments of the nation's economic affairs, will address the Senate Banking Committee today and the House Banking Committee on Thursday. 
 At the moment, market participants are not expecting the Fed chairman to say much to further a rally that appears to be losing steam.
"The momentum that the bond market has had seems to be temporarily suspended," one Government bond trader said. "And people aren't counting on much from Greenspan. People think the Fed is on hold, and as a consequence the market is marking down prices a bit."
Michael R. Englund, a vice president and director of research at MMS International, an economic information and service company in Belmont, Calif., ticked off a list of points that Mr. Greenspan is likely to touch on, including the likely impact on the economy if peace comes suddenly in the Middle East, and the condition of the nation's financial system.
In general, Mr. Englund said, the nature of Mr. Greenspan's remarks are likely to be that while the economy is weak, there are signs it has bottomed out. Moreover, he said, Mr. Greenspan may take note of the signs that the deterioration in the banking system is slowing.
In sum, Mr. Englund said the substance of Mr. Greenspan's remarks "will lead to a somewhat negative tone for the market."
 
2- and 5-Year Note Sale
 The two days of testimony will also influence coming Treasury auctions of two- and five-year securities.
Late yesterday the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.86 percent. Meanwhile, the five-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.45 percent.
Concerns that the Fed will not move soon to lower short-term interest rates were reflected in bids at the weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.94 percent, up from the 5.86 percent average rate at last week's sale.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.91 percent, up from 5.85 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 98 23/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.98 percent, up from 7.97 percent late Friday.
Traders said the quite modest price decline would have been more severe but for a large buyer of 30-year government bonds. The buyer reportedly bought more than $1 billion worth of securities.
Among note issues, the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 21/32, down 5/32, to yield 7.68 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 101 9/32, down 1/8, to yield 7.23 percent.
 
Corporate Bond Market
 In the investment-grade corportae bond market, Security Pacific Financial Services Inc., a subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation, offered a total of $1.3 billion worth of securities backed by home equity loans.
The bulk of the huge three-part issue consists of $1 billion worth of 8.25 percent notes that carry a final maturity of May 10, 2003, but an average life of 1.80 years.
The notes were priced at $99.625, to yield 8.443, 1.60 percentage points over the prevailing when-issued yield on the new two-year Treasury notes to be auctioned today.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the transaction. The first two classes of the issue are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The third class, consisting of $133.7 million of subordinated securities, is rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, a $226 million offering of highly-rated securities issued by the State of Georgia was received with a tepid reception by investors.
A bid from a group led by Prudential-Bache Securities won the issue, which consists of serial bonds maturing from 1992 to 2011. The bonds were reoffered at yields from 5 percent in 1993 to 6.45 percent in 2011.
The bonds are rated AAA by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard & Poor's. Nevertheless, bankers familiar with the transaction said that by late yesterday underwriters retained an unsold balance of around $150 million worth of securities.
A poor tone was also evident in the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said, where prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

Northwest Cutting Its Flights Abroad

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc., said it would cut 28 of its 144 weekly international flights in March because of light passenger loads. Northwest said the flights are from United States cities to Europe and Asia. For example, service to Tokyo from Minneapolis is being cut to no flights from three flights a week. Service to Tokyo from Honolulu is being cut to 14 flights from 21.
Northwest's flight reductions follow similar moves by other United States carriers to cut capacity as traffic ebbs because of the American recession and fears of terrorism.

HEADLINE: Holocaust Skeptic Who Gives Advice on Death Faces Trial

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MALDEN, Mass., Feb. 19

 BODY:
A judge in this Boston suburb refused today to dismiss the case against a Holocaust revisionist and execution-machine builder who prosecutors say has been practicing engineering without a license.
The defendant, Fred Leuchter Jr., who has published articles contending that the number of people killed in the Holocaust has been exaggerated, must stand trial May 9 under the ruling of the judge, J. W. Killam 3d of Malden District Court. 
 Mr. Leuchter (pronounced LOOT-cher) specializes in building electric chairs and other execution devices and serves as a capital punishment consultant to some states. He claims to have an engineering degree but has refused to provide any documentation.
After the Malden Holocaust Committee, a private group, had begun raising questions about his background, the authorities reviewed his qualifications and charged him with practicing engineering without a license. The penalty for the crime in Massachusetts is up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.
Mr. Leuchter has vowed to sue the Holocaust Committee and other groups that he says "have sought to destroy my family, my livelihood, my life."
His lawyer, Kirk D. Lyons, contends that Mr. Leutcher is a victim of selective prosecution. "Only someone very naive would believe that if Fred Leuchter had not written his Leuchter report that we would be standing here now," Mr. Lyons, who has represented white supremacist groups in Idaho and elsewhere, said today.
Outside the courthouse, supporters and opponents of Mr. Leuchter, perhaps 30 people in all, engaged in a scuffle. Three of them were arrested, and an elderly woman was treated by paramedics.
"By coming out with their signs and their expressions of hatred, they only expose what kind of people they are," said Suzanne D. Tabasky, a spokeswoman for the Holocaust Committee. "In tough economic times like we have now, hate groups come out of the woodwork.'
Across the street, near a sign that said, "The Holocaust Is the Hoax of the 20th Century," a supporter of Mr. Leutcher, C. D. DiGiambattista, said his prosecution "is part of a whole pattern of getting at people who expose the Holocaust myth."

HEADLINE: Salomon Taking A 700-Job Unit Out of New York

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers announced yesterday that it would move the 700 jobs in its domestic operations division to Tampa, Fla., the first major investment banking concern to relocate a large division out of New York City, the traditional capital of investment banking.
Salomon officials said that they needed to build a new technology center for the division, which handles such tasks as billings and stock transfers, and that it was less expensive to do so in Florida. They also cited Tampa's lower wage scales and work force, which they said was well qualified to handle the office machines and computers in the new center. They did not criticize New York's work force. 
 The company's decision to move nearly a quarter of its 3,000 employees came after extensive lobbying by officials from Florida and Ohio. Company officials said that in the final stages of their decision they also considered relocating within the New York metropolitan area or in Columbus, Ohio.
 
'Cost-Effective' Center
 "We will build a state-of-the-art, cost-effective processing facility that will take us well into the 21st century," said Bruce V. Carp, chief administrative officer of Salomon.
While a site has not yet been selected, Tampa officials said the building or renting costs of doing business there were one-third of those in New York.
The move is expected to be completed early in 1993. The company's world headquarters is now in the process of moving into 7 World Trade Center from One New York Plaza in the Wall Street area.
The decision came two weeks after Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida led a delegation of 12 Floridians to visit Salomon executives in New York.
New York has found it tough to counter corporate moves when the motive is to find a more readily available and cheaper work force, said Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "When dealing with overall costs, the city can do something with tax breaks and other incentives, but when it involves a different work force and wage scales, there is little we can do," she said.
Tampa, with a population of about 860,000 in the city and its suburbs, is already home, its Mayor, Sandra Freedman, said, to computer operations of several New York-based corporations, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Time-Life.
