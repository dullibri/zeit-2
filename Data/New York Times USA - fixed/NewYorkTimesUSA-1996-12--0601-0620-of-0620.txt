HEADLINE: Immigrants in New York Pressing Drive for Dual Nationality

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Over the last several years, Dominicans, Colombians, Mexicans and others among New York City's newest and largest immigrant groups have been pressing their native countries, often successfully, for the right to retain their citizenship of birth, even after they become citizens of this country.
Proponents say immigrants have much to gain from the dual status. American citizenship brings many benefits -- especially now that the welfare law limits payments to noncitizens, while homeland citizenship often enables expatriates to vote in elections and to invest in their birth countries free of the restrictions that are placed on foreigners. 
 But for the United States, the drive for dual nationality raises prickly questions about the allegiances and assimilation of immigrants, along with more tangible matters like military duty, extradition and taxes, historians and constitutional scholars say.
Dual citizenship is not new. Some countries, like Ireland and Poland, have long allowed their sons and daughters abroad to retain their birthright. But immigrants of an earlier era were not as likely to have had -- or pressed for -- dual nationality.
Today, new technology and the globalization of the economy help immigrants to maintain connections to their native countries more easily than their predecessors, and dual nationality, in effect, codifies their stake in both homes.
"Many people live an existence that's transnational," said Linda Basch, an anthropologist and the co-author of "Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments and Deterritorialized Nation States (Gordon & Breach, 1985). "They have families in both places. They invest in both places. They get involved in politics in both places. It's difficult at this historical moment to think of people leaving location A and coming to location B and that's that."
The United States generally allows its citizens to become foreign nationals without losing their American citizenship.
A State Department spokeswoman, Suzanne Lawrence, said that while the United States does not encourage dual nationality -- and would prefer to avoid its complications -- it cannot control what another nation allows. Numbers remain a mystery: with so many different countries involved, Ms. Lawrence said, it is impossible to determine how many dual nationals live in the United States.
In New York City, 7 of the 10 largest immigrant groups have the right to be dual nationals, and just this month Mexican-Americans, one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the city, won a legislative victory in Mexico that opens the door for dual citizenship for them.
Two years ago, the Dominican Republic's Legislature approved a similar law, allowing its expatriates to vote, run for office and invest more freely in their island nation.
Ecuador approved dual nationality last year, though it does not permit voting in its overseas consulates.
In Trinidad and Tobago, which has allowed the practice since 1988, dual nationals can vote only if they have lived there for a year prior to elections.
"There's a whole new perception in the immigrant's mind," said Austin T. Fragomen, a partner in Fragomen, Del Rey & Bernsen, a leading immigration law firm in Manhattan. "It used to be they were leaving one place and adapting to a new location. Now, when people leave one country for another, they want to retain ties. They may have business interests and they want to participate fully in both. Your native country isn't as remote anymore."
Four years ago, Colombian immigrants to the United States successfully lobbied for a Colombian constitutional amendment allowing them to retain the privileges of Colombian nationality.
Colombian nationals can vote -- either in Colombia or at a Colombian consulate abroad -- and run for office in their homeland, even after they become United States citizens.
Saramaria Archela, who runs the Latin American Integration Center, a social-services agency in Woodside, Queens, said that before the passage of the amendment, many of her Colombian compatriots in New York resisted naturalizing. But after passage of the new law, Colombians flooded the agency for citizenship papers.
In the 1994 fiscal year, according to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, 12,067 Colombians became American citizens, more than double their numbers in 1991.
"They are relieved now," said Ms. Archela, who had testified in Colombia's Legislature in favor of dual nationality. "This is very important for the Hispanic community. Hispanic people need to be involved in the political process here."
In Mexico, the Congress voted on Dec. 10 to grant Mexican citizens living outside the country the right to cast ballots in presidential elections.
The law, which had been pushed by the ruling party and is expected to be ratified by Mexico's 31 state legislatures and President Ernesto Zedillo in 1997, would offer voting rights to more than five million Mexican expatriates living in the United States.
Mexicans have among the lowest rates of naturalization in the United States. Dual nationality could change that for Mexican immigrants like Ofelia Mora, who moved from Chinantla, Mexico, to Borough Park, Brooklyn, in 1971 but has yet to become a United States citizen.
"That's wonderful," she said. "I'm not a citizen yet. I would like to get it, but I would like to keep my nationality, too."
Mrs. Mora's ties to Mexico are firm. She has sent her children back to Chinantla every summer. And during one of those trips a few years ago, her daughter, Nancy, now 23, competed in and won the Chinantla beauty pageant. But for the first time, prompted by the Federal law that will cut off Social Security benefits to legal immigrants like her, Mrs. Mora, 38, is considering United States citizenship.
She hopes that dual nationality will make it easier to buy property back home and allow her to vote and help shape Mexico's political destiny.
"We need some change," she said of the Mexican Government. "If we have another party, maybe it will be better. We've never tried it before."
Some of the loudest proponents of dual nationality are elites within immigrant communities. While immigrants rich and poor send vital dollars home, wealthier immigrants are the ones who say they yearn for the right to own property and invest in businesses unthwarted by regulations that apply to foreigners.
"Dominicans abroad have been called the dorsal column of the Dominican economy," said Dr. Rafael Lantingua of Washington Heights in Manhattan, a Dominican native and naturalized American citizen. "We are the main supporters of the Dominican economy. And if we are, we should have a say in what's happening in the country."
A spokesman at the Dominican Consulate General, Hector Ramirez, said remittances from abroad account for 10 to 15 percent of the income of his country, where the new prime minister was once a United States green-card holder.
City Councilman Guillermo Linares, a native of the Dominican Republic who became a United States citizen more than 20 years ago, agreed that economics was the driving force behind dual nationality, though it also signified an opportunity to remain Dominican.
"There was a feeling you would be betraying your nationality, that you would automatically lose your nationality if you naturalized," said Mr. Linares, whose district includes Washington Heights, the city's Dominican mecca. "But what I think was the most fundamental concern was wanting to invest in the Dominican Republic."
In India, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the rightist Hindu-nationalist bloc that temporarily captured the prime minister's seat earlier this year, had also pledged in its election platform to consider granting dual nationality to expatriates, known as nonresident Indians, or N.R.I.'s. The party has since been forced to give up the post.
"They consider the N.R.I.'s as assets," said Dr. Mukund Mody, a Staten Island pediatrician and president of an influential group called Overseas Friends of the Bharatiya Janata Party. "They would like to make conditions such that they could feel at home."
During Indian elections last spring, Dr. Mody advised party leaders almost daily on matters ranging from Kashmir policy to economic reforms. A senior party leader was appointed to serve as a liaison to supporters of the party abroad.
That kind of expatriate intervention has led to concerns about people living in the United States having excessive influence in their homelands. Dr. Vijay Prashad, an Indian historian who teaches at Trinity College in Hartford, said that even without dual nationality, middle-class Indian-Americans and their investment dollars already wield too much power over matters in that country.
"This community need not have its political influence codified any more," said Dr. Prashad, a critic of dual nationality.
Others point out the practical problems of dual nationality, especially if it applies to large numbers of immigrants. Peter Schuck, the author of "Citizenship Without Consent" (Yale University Press, 1985), who is a law professor at Yale University, said, "In the event of war, there might be dual or multiple claims on the individual to serve."
Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform in Washington, which has long argued for more controls on immigration, criticized dual nationality as a sign of a reluctance on the part of immigrants to assimilate. All immigrants, he asserted, should naturalize and maintain allegiance only to the United States. "We are of the view that you ought to get on board or get out," he said. "At some point, you start looking like Rome, with an influx of alien hordes who never get on board."
Rising concerns about immigration in this country has made dual nationality more appealing as a form of emotional security. Dr. Evelyn Hu-DeHart, a professor of history and ethnic studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that immigrants who are members of racial minority groups are more likely to feel like outsiders in America. Asians, she said, were not allowed to naturalize until 1952.
"Perhaps they don't want to vest everything in U.S. citizenship," said Dr. Hu-DeHart, who emigrated from Hong Kong in 1959 and became an American citizen in 1965, "because they don't know how much it will protect them."

Liquor Industry Rise Cited by Impact

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
After 15 years of declines, shipments of cases of distilled spirits to wholesalers are expected to increase slightly in 1996, primarily because of more robust demand for higher-priced liquor brands.
The increase is being projected by the Impact Databank unit of M. Shaken Communications in New York, which collects information about the alcoholic-beverage industry. 
 Impact estimates depletions for this year of 135 million cases, an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent from 134.6 million cases in 1995.
Impact, in a newsletter published by Shanken, attributed the increase to growth among so-called premium brands in categories like vodka, tequila, rum, Scotch whisky and liqueurs.
The factors contributing to the increase, according to Impact, included marketing programs aimed at drinkers in their 20's and 30's, an improved economy, relatively stable prices and renewed interest among consumers in indulgent pleasures like steaks, cigars and nightclubs.
The recent decision by liquor marketers to begin advertising on television and radio "boded well" for stimulating future growth, the newsletter said.
The brands that did best in 1996, as cited by Impact, included Skyy vodka, sold by Skyy Spirits Inc., at 625,000 cases, up 66.7 percent; Hennessy Cognac, marketed by the Schieffelin & Somerset Company, a joint venture of LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton and Guinness P.L.C., at 930,000 cases, up 24.8 percent, and Malibu liqueur, marketed by the Paddington Corporation unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., at 500,000 cases, up 17.6 percent.
Among the larger brands cited by Impact, depletions of Absolut vodka, marketed by the Seagram Company, grew 5.2 percent, to 3.3 million cases; Jose Cuervo tequila, marketed by the Heublein unit of Grand Metropolitan, grew 6 percent, to 2.5 million cases, and Crown Royal Canadian whisky, marketed by Seagram, grew 8.7 percent, to almost 2 million cases.

Urban Hospitals Seek Money

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Urban hospitals are pressuring Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the State Legislature to come up with a permanent source of money to care for indigent, uninsured patients before the end of 1997, to avoid another crisis like the one earlier this year when hospitals were forced to treat so-called charity care patients without being reimbursed. After months of wrangling, lawmakers decided in May to keep using money from the unemployment insurance fund to finance charity care through the end of 1997. 
 The Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, which represents 20 urban hospitals, has suggested that the state set aside for charity care the $80 million it expects to save by moving welfare families to managed care. Further savings are expected if Federal health officials approve a New Jersey plan to let hospitals refer uninsured patients from their emergency rooms to doctors or treatment centers if appropriate. This year, the state spent $310 million on charity care reimbursements.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Fails on Practical Level, Too;
Abstractions Matter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For Stanley Fish (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), bridging the economic gap between the races is child's play if we don't get bogged down in abstractions. If we discredit abstractions, affirmative action is unimpeachable as policy. But why stop with affirmative action, which at best is messy? 
 If we wish to counter the historical effects of slavery and discrimination, why not a rule that the next 10 million Americans hired have to be black? Or that half the estates of the descendants of slaveholders should be confiscated and turned over to the descendants of bondsmen?
We could even come up with a legal rationale for such action if we needed an abstraction: the economic benefit of blacks would represent compensatory and punitive damages.
The rub is that abstractions matter. Though not unproblematical, they play a crucial role as an ideal in the American constitutional system. Or would Professor Fish advocate, say, abolishing due process or replacing the rule of law with the rule of men?

HEADLINE: South Korea's Immovable Objects

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 29

 BODY:
When workers demanded union rights a decade ago and denounced repression by an authoritarian President, they were championed by a longtime democracy campaigner named Kim Young Sam.
These days, tear gas again stings the eyes as tens of thousands of workers once more take to the streets to demand union rights and denounce what they describe as repression by an authoritarian President -- Kim Young Sam. 
 Why does a democratically elected President like Mr. Kim rely on the riot police and armored tear gas vehicles that were once used against him?
The answers are complex, but they may have less to do with the specific issues that provoked the latest unrest in Seoul and more to do with the broad challenges of creating a democratic political culture. Many countries in Asia and around the world are wrestling with the difficulties of transition to democracy and -- like South Korea -- are finding that pluralism needs to be based on attitudes as well as on institutions.
"To create democratic institutions is easy," said Kang Tae Hoon, a professor of political science at Dankook University in Seoul. "But to create a democratic process and political culture takes longer. It is hard to change old habits."
Perhaps as many as several hundred thousand workers are on an indefinite general strike in South Korea, demanding the nullification of new labor laws passed by a secret session of the National Assembly on Thursday.
The laws make it easier for companies to lay off workers, and they delay for three years the authorization of certain labor unions that are now technically banned.
Another law passed in the session broadens the powers of the domestic spy agency, and many strikers say Mr. Kim has betrayed the democratic movement and become almost as authoritarian as his predecessors.
"As a union member, I don't see much difference between Kim Young Sam and the old military dictators," said Cho Chul, 36, a hotel cook who carried a banner at a labor rally today. "There's physical oppression, as there was before, and now in addition there's legal and economic repression as well. So it's tougher than before."
Such assertions seem vastly overstated. There is far more democracy now than there was under the dictators, and the best evidence for that is that people like Mr. Cho cheerfully give their names to a reporter. A decade ago almost nobody dared excoriate the President directly, and those few who did often ended up being tortured in prison.
Still, the comparison between Mr. Kim and his predecessors is made by many strikers. One quoted a Korean proverb about how a woman may hate being bullied by her mother-in-law but will also learn to do the same to her own daughter-in-law. The point is that Mr. Kim may have chafed at dictatorship when he was its victim, but he learned the methods and now applies them to his critics.
But if Mr. Kim has an intolerant streak, much the same could be said of the opposition.
The present crisis erupted when the governing party approved new labor laws at a secret session of the National Assembly with no opposition members present. The party took that step because opposition parties were physically blocking the Assembly from meeting, in part because they knew that they would lose a vote.
Song Yon Hyong, 27, a factory worker on strike, looked a bit flummoxed when she was asked if it was not undemocratic of the opposition to use force to prevent the enactment of laws by a majority of legislators.
"Well, it's true that both sides are undemocratic," she said finally. But she added that it was acceptable for the opposition to use undemocratic steps because the governing party had gained a majority only by manipulating press coverage of politics.
Conflicts like the present one are sometimes difficult to resolve because Korean politics are so deeply rooted in principles that compromise becomes almost impossible.
In the present dispute, union leaders, women included, have shaven their heads to express their anger at the new labor legislation. That is at least a milder step than that of the 28-year-old union worker who last year expressed his frustration with his employer by burning himself to death on company property.
Nothing so horrific has happened in the present confrontation, but the impasse looks difficult to resolve. The strikers insist that the first step must be for the Government to cave in.
"This strike will end only when the laws are nullified," said Park Moon Jin, head of a hospital workers union.
"Negotiations are impossible until then," she said. "After the laws are revoked, then labor and the Government can have a dialogue."
The Government, for its part, is denouncing the strike as illegal and suggesting that it might use force to smash the unrest.
While the focus of the confrontation is on the Government's policies toward unions, critics also charge that Mr. Kim is undemocratic in a broader sense. They say his Government puts pressure on the news media to curb unfriendly coverage, uses the tax authorities to punish its enemies and uses security forces to tap the phones of opposition leaders.
"Democratic institutions are being manipulated by the ruling party," said Lee Dong Bok, a member of a conservative opposition party in the Assembly. Commenting on Mr. Kim's years as a democracy campaigner, Mr. Lee added, "If he fought for democracy, he seems to have fought for his own version of democracy, not a universal one."
To be sure, the Government denies that it abuses the legal process in these ways. And some of the most obvious authoritarian policies of Mr. Kim -- like the ban on saying nice things about Communist North Korea -- have broad popular support.
There is also no question that South Korea, for all its political hiccups, is a functioning democracy. Indeed, the vigor of the political debate shows that South Korea is becoming more open.
A Government official said the new labor laws had been carefully drafted over many months and were simply the product of an honest desire to make the South Korean economy more competitive.
"This Government is fully committed to reform," the official said. "But sometimes you find that reform is more difficult than revolution."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 31, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a news analysis article yesterday about workers' protests in South Korea referred incorrectly in some editions to the status of labor unions. The law bans multiple unions in a workplace, not all unions. (In practice, this has often meant that a tame, Government-approved labor union is authorized while others are not.)

GRAPHIC: Photos: About 20,000 striking workers rallied in Seoul yesterday, opposing new laws that make layoffs easier and prolong a ban on labor unions. The strikers and President Kim Young Sam are unyielding in their positions; Kim Young Sam was a dissident leader when he confronted policemen outside his home in 1985. They kept him from a dinner with Americans. (Associated Press)

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Jets Leave Coaches Twisting In Wind

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Dec. 30

 BODY:
The Jets' long slide into oblivion is taking the latest batch of assistant coaches headlong into unemployment.
And like everyone else who follows the Jets, they don't have a clue about which direction the search team for a head coach -- the experienced twosome of the owner Leon Hess and the president Steve Gutman who seem to do this all the time -- is facing. 
 But this time, they are taking their time. The last two Jets head coaches, Pete Carroll and Rich Kotite, were picked without a search.
"We were told no decision has been made," Bill Muir, the offensive line coach, said today.
The Kotite legacy is a slew of departing assistants. Their two-year contracts are up in February, and five of them, including Muir, met today with Gutman to learn what will happen to their health insurance, when their cars have to be returned and when they have to move their belongings out of the training facility. Almost everyone -- other assistants were out of town -- will be let go, but all of the assistants will meet with Gutman next Monday.
"There are a couple of people who could stay for any number of reasons," said Muir, who has had tenures with the Patriots, Bucs, Lions, Colts and Eagles before making the Jets his sixth stop in the National Football League.
"All I want is to wind up somewhere with a job," he said. "What will happen to me here will be determined by several factors. If they bring in a Bill Parcells-type coach, he will bring in 90 percent of his staff, so there will be no room for holdovers. If they bring in an assistant coach or a head coach who has been out of football for a few years, he may want holdovers."
According to Muir, neither he nor the other assistants really knows what is on Gutman's mind.
"Even if they bring in someone who may not have a ready-built staff, he could say, 'I don't want people from this program,' " Muir said. "If they promote a general manager from within, they may have someone he feels comfortable with. Everything is rumor and innuendo and it will take at least two weeks."
The last real interview process involving the Jets' search for a head coach followed the 1989 campaign of Joe Walton. The late general manager Dick Steinberg's first two choices -- Mike Holmgren, then an assistant with the 49ers, and George Perles of Michigan State -- turned him down. Bruce Coslet, then an assistant at Cincinnati, said yes.
So Muir made a not-surprising suggestion of his own today: "I do think they have to talk to Parcells, in light of what they did in their last go-round. They've got to ask Parcells, they've got to ask general managers Bill Polian, or Carl Peterson, if he becomes available. Someone of experience has got to talk to them. That's a no-brainer. Polian, Parcells, gives them credibility."
The only Jet assistants with a year remaining on their contracts are two people Kotite recruited this past season from the Steelers: the offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt and the tight ends coach Pat Hodgson.
"It's status quo," said Erhardt, after meeting with Gutman. "It's going to stay like this for a while."
Of everyone in the organization -- including the front office -- Erhardt seems best positioned. The offense is his creation. And his being hired led to Neil O'Donnell joining the club after leading Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl. Of course O'Donnell's $7 million signing bonus didn't hurt.

HEADLINE: Lyle Fitch, 83, Administrator Of City Under Mayor Wagner

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Lyle C. Fitch, an authority on urban problems who served as City Administrator under Mayor Robert F. Wagner and later as president of the Institute of Public Administration, died on Saturday at the Meadow Lakes retirement community in Hightstown, N.J. He was 83.
The cause was believed to be lung cancer, according to his wife, Violet. 
 A prescient analyst of the fiscal and administrative problems of cities and governments, Mr. Fitch addressed such matters as transportation, construction, hospitals and nursing homes in New York, first as deputy City Administrator, from 1957 to 1960, and then as City Administrator.
The city administrator's office recommended management practices and procedures for the city and its agencies, coordinated management policies and made management studies under the direction of the mayor.
When Mr. Fitch left city government in 1961 to become the president of the Institute of Public Administration, a private, nonprofit education, research and consulting center, he observed in a 1,100-word letter to Mayor Wagner, "Management improvement in New York is like going with Alice through the looking glass: so much of our effort is spent in running hard just to keep even."
In the letter, he told the Mayor of three management problems of "transcendent importance" that he said the city must solve. These were development of long-range fiscal planning to eliminate budgetary gimmickry, a technique for bringing top-flight employees into city government and the concentration of responsibility for planning and administering city transportation services, which were then spread among 11 authorities and public departments operating under different rules and controls.
Still, he said: "I have looked at the governments of many large cities both here and abroad. I know of none where the overall level of governmental performance excels that of New York in moving to meet problems, in the level and quality of governmental services and in the integrity of its officials and employees."
After Abraham D. Beame became Mayor in 1974, the functions of the city administrator were moved into the Budget Bureau.
At the Institute of Public Administration, Mr. Fitch addressed national and international management and policy issues for agencies including the Departments of Energy and Commerce, and for countries including Venezuela, Indonesia and Bangladesh.
He was named president emeritus when he retired from the institute in 1982. Afterward he was a Regents professor and visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley and at Los Angeles.
Mr. Fitch was a prolific writer of articles and reviews, and the author, co-author or editor of a number of books. His most recent, published this year by the Institute of Governmental Studies Press at Berkeley, was "Making Democracy Work: The Life and Letters of Luther Gulick." Mr. Gulick, the first City Administrator, also preceded Mr. Fitch as president of the Institute of Public Administration.
Mr. Fitch, who was born in Merriman, Neb., spent his early years on a cattle ranch and attended a one-room country school for seven years. Later, he liked to say he was the only public official in New York City who could rope, tie and brand a calf.
He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from Chadron State College in Chadron, Neb., in 1935, received a master's from the University of Nebraska in 1938 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1946.
In addition to his wife of 59 years, the former Violet Vaughn of Hightstown, Mr. Fitch is survived by a daughter, Linda Fitch of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Val, a Nobel laureate in physics, also of Princeton; a sister, Helen Logsdon of Millersburg, Ohio; a half-sister, Judith Singleton of Fayetteville, Ark., and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Surged a Surprising 1.8% in November

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Spurred by falling mortgage rates, sales of existing homes rebounded smartly in November after five straight months of declines. For the year, sales are headed for a record total of more than four million, figures compiled by the National Association of Realtors showed today.
The unexpected 1.8 percent increase last month all but guaranteed that 1996 would surpass 1978, when 3.99 million homes were sold, as the most active on record. The increase also suggested that housing might help propel the economy to brisk expansion in the early months of the new year. 
 "This economy is gaining a bit of momentum here," John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. "It's pretty robust in the fourth quarter, and if housing is picking up, we could be looking at a couple of quarters running well ahead of people's expectations."
Another report today also pointed to continuation of the business expansion, which will soon reach its sixth anniversary without significant interruption.
The Conference Board calculated that the index of leading indicators edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in November, the 10th month in a row without a decline.
Securities markets registered no obvious reaction to the data, which came as many Wall Street firms have given their employees extended holidays or have effectively closed their books for the year.
Still, the housing figures were seen as significant because few analysts had predicted an increase in sales of existing homes, which though running at a rapid clip this year had eased each month since May.
"It picked up a bit stronger than I expected it would," said Marlene K. Grabau, economist at HSBC Securities in Washington, noting that she expected figures for the next couple of months to remain high.
That is because interest rates have declined since late summer, when most contracts were signed for homes on which buyers closed in November.
"The housing market is in fine shape," Russell K. Booth, the realtor association's president, said in a statement. "Confidence is strong once again, and this is resulting in heavy activity in markets coast to coast."
The trade group predicted that resales of single-family homes would total 4.09 million for the year.
Considerable economic activity is generated when a home changes hands, from spending on repairs by sellers and redecorating by buyers to the host of fees, commissions and taxes involved in the transaction.
Regionally, the Midwest showed a 4.9 percent surge in sales last month. That was followed by the West, up 4.5 percent. Sales edged up just seven-tenths of 1 percent in the South, while in the Northeast they slumped 4.8 percent from the October pace.
A total of 2.24 million houses were for sale last month, enough to last 6.6 months at the November selling pace. In October there was a seven-month supply of unsold houses.
The association's report also showed a median sales price for transactions completed last month of $117,400. For 1996 over all, the association projected a median price of $117,700, up 4.2 percent from the 1995 level.
In the report on leading economic indicators, the Conference Board said that 5 of the 10 components contributed positively, led by higher stock prices and an expansion of the money supply.
The biggest negative was a decrease in the interest-rate spread -- the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds minus the rate on overnight bank loans -- which was incorporated in the index for the first time. Two components were removed, sensitive materials prices and unfilled orders for durable goods.
These changes, announced in mid-November, were aimed at limiting false signals of a turn in the direction of the economy, such as seemed to occur when the index, then under the auspices of the Commerce Department, fell for five straight months at the beginning of 1995.
The companion coincident and lagging indexes advanced three-tenths of 1 percent and one-tenth of 1 percent, respectively, in November, the board's report also showed.

HEADLINE: Chief of Rockefeller Fund Planning to Resign in '97

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
After eight and a half years at the helm of one of the nation's largest philanthropic organizations, Peter C. Goldmark Jr. said yesterday that he planned to resign in the coming year as president of the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue as yet undetermined interests.
"When you've pitched eight and a half innings, it's time to cast an eye on the bullpen," the 56-year-old executive with a well-known passion for baseball analogies said in an interview. "The foundation is in strong shape now, and I feel in my bones that I'm ready for the next adventure." 
 Mr. Goldmark's public service career before joining the foundation in 1988 included tenures as an aide to former Mayor John V. Lindsay, as Secretary of Human Services for Massachusetts, as New York State Budget Director under Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and eight years as executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Scoffing at a question about entering politics in a mayoral election year, he said he had no job lined up, or even in mind. "I'm violating the first law of wing-walking," he said, "not to let go of the strut behind before grabbing another."
He said he had told his staff on Dec. 20 of his plans to leave and was disclosing his intentions to give the organization's trustees time to pick a successor to head the 83-year-old foundation, the nation's eighth largest, with assets of $2.5 billion.
"While I and the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation accept the news of Peter's desire to move on, he will be greatly missed," Alice Stone Ilchman, chairman of the foundation's board, said. "He is a man with a clear vision and strong leadership style that has served the foundation well."
Endowed by John D. Rockefeller in 1913, the foundation awards grants of more than $110 million a year to the arts and humanities, to groups promoting equal opportunity and school reform, and to international health, environmental and family planning organizations. Under Mr. Goldmark, the foundation's assets have grown by nearly $1 billion.
About 60 percent of the spending has traditionally gone for international causes, particularly fights against hunger and disease. Soon after joining the foundation, Mr. Goldmark called on the nation's philanthropic organizations to put more money into alleviating third world poverty and protecting an imperiled global environment, and in recent years many other foundations have increased their contributions to such programs.
During Mr. Goldmark's tenure, the foundation has also spent more on improving schools, on the education of women and on persistently poor Americans.
Mr. Goldmark, a 1962 Harvard graduate, joined the Office of Equal Opportunity in the Administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. Besides his work in the Lindsay and Carey administrations, he was a transition adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1989.
As head of the Port Authority, he was credited with transforming a sluggish two-state agency into an energetic vehicle for regional economic development. After decades in public service, he joined the Times Mirror Company in 1986 as senior vice president in charge of Eastern properties that included Newsday and five other newspapers, book publishers and a group of magazines.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits 45-Month High As Yen Continues Its Slide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched another 45-month high against the yen yesterday, reflecting more pessimism about Japan's economy and a move by Japanese investors out of their currency before a long market holiday.
The absence of any public concern about the yen's weakness from either Japanese or United States officials was interpreted by some traders as another reason to push the dollar higher against the yen. The dollar ended little changed in other foreign exchange dealings. 
 "It's still a somewhat fragile economic recovery in Japan," said Robert Katz, a currency trader at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "That has given the dollar a bit more life against the yen."
The dollar traded as high as 116.18 yen, the strongest level since March 1993, before easing slightly to 116.15 yen in New York, up from 115.50 yen on Friday. The latest advance left the dollar 12.75 yen higher than its level at the start of 1996, a gain of more than 12.3 percent.
The dollar initially strengthened against the mark, but it ended slightly weaker at 1.5555 marks, down from 1.5558. Some traders attributed the pullback to remarks by Franz-Christoph Zeitler, a senior member of the Bundesbank, who said the current value of the mark was consistent with economic fundamentals, suggesting the currency would not weaken further against the dollar.
The British pound slipped to $1.6915 from $1.6929.
There was little news to guide the dollar higher against the yen other than the end of 1996 trading in Japan, where markets will not reopen until Monday because of a traditional extended New Year's break.
But the failure of the Japanese stock market to close on a decisively upbeat note underscored the pessimism about the outlook in Japan and further dampened the appetite for yen. The Nikkei index of 225 issues ended trading yesterday with a 13 percent decline for the year.
There had been some expectation that senior Japanese officials would have said something by now to arrest the yen's slide. But, according to Jack Fellingham, a vice president at the New York branch of Commerzbank, "their lack of having anything to say implied they don't mind if the dollar goes up."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
NCR stock is trading high, and some analysts wonder why.

BYLINE: By Laurence Zuckerman 

 BODY:
ONE of the most disastrous corporate acquisitions in recent memory comes to a close today when AT&T spins off the NCR Corporation, just five years after its hostile takeover of the computer maker. But you would not know how painful a stretch it was from watching Wall Street.
AT&T is giving its stockholders one share of NCR for every 16 of their AT&T shares, creating about 101.4 million new shares. The new stock officially begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. But NCR shares have been trading on a "when issued" basis since Dec. 11, meaning that investors have pledged to buy and sell the stock at agreed prices when it becomes available. 
 NCR's closing price yesterday was $35.125 a share, down 25 cents. That values the company at $3.54 billion, about half of the $7.48 billion that AT&T paid in 1991. Nevertheless, the few computer analysts who have looked at NCR think it is priced far too high.
"The best company that I follow in this sector is Hewlett-Packard," said John B. Jones, a computer analyst with Salomon Brothers in San Francisco, and one of the few on Wall Street to look closely at NCR. "Hewlett-Packard has had a sustainable growth rate of 15 to 23 percent in the last four years. If you give NCR the same valuation as Hewlett, it would be a $24 stock. And I don't think NCR should be valued the same as Hewlett."
Indeed, NCR has barely broken into the black this year on an operating basis after losing nearly $4 billion over the last five years. Lars Nyberg, NCR's no-nonsense chairman and chief executive, has cut 8,500 jobs and $600 million in expenses in an effort to turn around the company since he arrived at NCR's Dayton, Ohio, headquarters in June 1995.
His strategy is to refocus the company on its core strengths. NCR is the world's leading maker of automated teller machines and the No. 2 seller of electronic cash registers behind I.B.M. It also is the largest supplier of large "data warehouses" used by retailers, banks and others to glean valuable marketing data about their customers' buying patterns. And it operates in virtually every corner of the globe, an enviable reach in an industry with relatively few global players.
Despite these strengths, NCR's revenue has been flat, and the company is not perceived as an industry leader by many analysts.
"Their products are pretty good, but from a marketing perspective their presence is zero," said Jon Oltsik, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. "The difference between when AT&T bought them and now is that a lot of other people have caught up. Their lack of direction for many years has really hurt them."
Despite the small operating profit of $3 million for the first nine months of this year, NCR had a $116 million net loss, largely because it is profitable overseas, where much of its income goes to pay higher tax rates, and it has been losing money in North America.
Mr. Nyberg said he recognized that revenue growth was the principal challenge. The company's annual revenue now totals about $7 billion.
Mr. Jones, the Salomon analyst, said he thought that the revenue growth would come. His earnings forecast for the company shows profits of $152.3 million next year, $224.3 million in 1998 and $315.3 million in 1999.
That is respectable for a company that is turning itself around, Mr. Jones said, but it does not nearly justify NCR's stock price. "I really like the company and I like management, but I think even $25 a share is a stretch," he added.
The reason that the preliminary trading of NCR has been so high, some analysts said, is that investors are comparing its value with that of AT&T stock rather than that of other computer stocks. AT&T shares closed yesterday at $44.125, up 37.5 cents. Some investors may even be counting on NCR to perform as well as Lucent Technologies, the telecommunications equipment company that AT&T successfully spun off earlier this year as part of its three-way breakup, even though the companies are in different businesses.
Some analysts are predicting that NCR shares will fall after trading begins later this week, if only because institutional investors that own AT&T stock and have no interest in owning a computer stock will sell.
"You will probably see some downside pressure on the price when shares begin trading on Thursday," said Arthur V. Russell, technology analyst at Edward Jones, a brokerage firm in St. Louis.

Crazy for Conspiracies

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Once the obsession of a dedicated but tiny band, conspiracy theories now seem to have captured a wider audience.
Many people, for example, bought former ABC correspondent Pierre Salinger's claim that a Navy missile blew up T.W.A. Flight 800, even though such a cover-up would require a level of discipline and silence from government officials found only in North Korea. The story that the Central Intelligence Agency deliberately started the crack epidemic also hit a nerve, especially among blacks. The "murder" of Vincent Foster is a staple of talk radio. The last decade has seen the rise of the militias, with their tales of creeping world government and black helicopters. 
 The Internet has taken much of the blame. Theories travel fast, and get juiced up as they are passed along. But the Internet only reaches those who want to be reached. To understand why people embrace conspiracy theories, it pays to visit the former Soviet bloc. Right after the fall of Communism, when people were still euphoric, they proudly claimed the revolutions as the work of people power. But as economic hardships persisted, conspiracy theories began to emerge.
One popular theory in the Czech Republic revolves around the 1989 summit meeting in Malta between Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush. People felt their lives had been deformed since 1945 by the Yalta agreement, in which Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt divided up Europe. In Malta -- the rhyme was considered no coincidence -- Mr. Gorbachev supposedly promised Mr. Bush he would topple Communism if the old Communists were handed their nations' wealth. The worse things became, the more people talked about Malta. Conspiracy theories were an expression of their anger and powerlessness. They also gave people a justification for passivity.
Russia and Eastern Europe have always loved conspiracy. The classic of the genre is "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a fictitious but widely believed account of a Jewish plot to take over the world, published in Russia in 1905. But Communism raised conspiracy theory to an art form. In the Soviet bloc, you had to be crazy not to be paranoid about a Government whose officials published election results in advance and lied about the weather. Stalin promoted conspiracy thinking by blaming all problems on saboteurs and evil manipulators. These ideas are harder to shake than the political systems that created them. Today many people believe that the cause of inflation is not economic mismanagement but secret police officials printing money.
In some places, conspiracy theories thrive because nationalist demagogues invoke them. Slovakia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, has justified his authoritarian rule by warning that the Czechs are going to invade. Slobodan Milosevic incited Serbs to commit genocide by telling them, among other things, that Muslim men were building harems of Serbian women.
Why are Americans, who have no such excuses, so ready to believe just about anything about their Government? America's individualism has always featured a suspicion of government. But it is also because such suspicions have sometimes proved true. The Vietnam War and Watergate finally convinced mainstream America that our leaders sometimes do bad things and often lie about having done them. This did not come as news to many members of minority groups. The C.I.A.-crack connection sounds plausible to many black people because the Government has often committed terrible crimes against black people. The C.I.A. has employed drug traffickers as agents, from lowly contras to Manuel Noriega. There is a difference between looking away from agents' trafficking activities and deliberately fomenting a drug problem, but it is understandable why the people of Watts might not see it that way.
Ironically, the increased public scrutiny that followed Watergate has probably helped to make the United States Government less involved in malignant activity today than ever in history. Skepticism is healthy. But conspiracy theories are not. They are a symptom that people feel the government does not belong to them. One measure of the health of American democracy is whether such theories become widely embraced. TINA ROSENBERG

HEADLINE: Tandy Plans To Close 17 Superstores

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
The Tandy Corporation conceded yesterday that its Incredible Universe stores, a chain of superstores the size of three football fields that sell everything from computers to refrigerators to cassette tapes, were not so incredible after all and, in a bow to Wall Street, said it would shutter the unprofitable operation.
Tandy's year-end revamping, which also includes the closing of 19 of its 108 Computer City stores, will result in an after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings of $170 million, or about $2.80 a share. 
 Tandy's stock rose 75 cents, to $46.25, far below its 52-week high of $59.128 reached last May, even though the charge will put the company in the red for 1996. "On balance, this will be cash-positive for the company," said David Childe, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. "It eliminates $100 million in losses." Mr. Childe has forecast that the closings will add $1 to Tandy's per-share earnings in 1997, which he figures will be $3.15 a share.
The Incredible Universe chain never made money for Tandy, which had already closed two of them earlier this year. There are 17 Incredible Universe stores, and two are in metropolitan New York: Wesbury, L.I., and Elizabeth, N.J. None of the 19 Computer City stores to be closed are in the metropolitan region.
Although the Incredible Universe stores "were mobbed at first," according to Barry Bryant, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw in New York, eventually they suffered from the two disadvantages all mega-stores face. "The location is by nature inconvenient and to a consumer they are psychologically intimidating," Mr. Bryant said. The sales needed to break even never materialized.
"Other super-superstores have failed, too -- Wal-Mart's hypermarket, for example," he added.
John V. Roach, Tandy's chairman and chief executive, said that while some Incredible Universe stores enjoyed success, "the economic model is not viable for Tandy."
Tandy's announcement said it had agreed to sell the assets in six Incredible Universe stores to Fry's Electronics, a privately held Palo Alto, Calif.-based chain of 10 computer and consumer electronics stores, and to sell those six stores to real estate partnerships that will lease the stores to Fry's. Tandy is negotiating to sell the remaining 11.
Tandy, analysts said, also badly muffed its foray into computer superstores, starting Computer City stores long after rivals like CompUSA, the market leader, were established. Tandy will continue to operate 94 Computer City stores, but plans to focus more on sales of home-office equipment.
Earlier this month, Tandy announced the closing of its McDuff Electronics unit, a chain of 53 personal computer stores in Texas and the Southeast, resulting in a $20 million fourth-quarter charge.
Tandy's moves cap a year the company would probably like to forget. Computer and consumer electronics retailers in general have been suffering, and Tandy is no exception. Its comparative sales for stores open at least one year have been shrinking. For the year through November, Tandy's same-store sales, as they are known in retailing, dropped by 2 percent.
Still, even though sales at Tandy's flagship store, Radio Shack, are down, "Radio Shack has outperformed the consumer electronics sector by a wide margin this year," Mr. Childe said.
Tandy's change in strategy will leave management to concentrate on Radio Shack's more than 6,800 outlets across the country. Already, Radio Shack has scaled back its computer offerings to emphasize phones, pagers, satellite dishes and other electronic gadgets with higher profit margins. The chain's outlook could brighten further if, as Mr. Childe predicts, "the environment for consumer electronics will improve in the second half of 1997," as the industry consolidates and as new computers and digital video disk products are introduced.

HEADLINE: Retail Growth Proves Slowest In Northeast

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Wall Street boomed, women wrapped themselves in Gucci scarves and tourists flooded New York City, floating from Niketown to Planet Hollywood in a spending daze. Yet retail sales in the Northeast appear to have lagged behind those in the rest of the country in 1996.
In the Northeast, it appears that there was less shopping in malls and people wrote fewer checks and cracked their wallets less often than in the rest of the country, particularly during the holidays and in the New York area, initial sales reports show. 
 Of course, retailers are still ringing up post-Christmas sales, marking down ski sweaters and waiting for the final sales tallies. And next week, major American retailers will report their December sales.
But sales figures to date show a definite pattern of closed pocketbooks in the Northeast, which underscores the region's generally poor economic performance. For example, check writing during the first 24 days of the Christmas selling season in the Northeast rose eight-tenths of a percent compared with the corresponding period last year, said Telecheck Services, which monitors check writing. The national rise was 5.7 percent.
Further, executives at Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm, said retailers told them that their sales in the mid-Atlantic region rose a mere 1 percent compared with last year. But sales in the Pacific region gained 9.5 percent, and in the South Atlantic region rose 8.5 percent.
And for the first 10 months of 1996, sales of general merchandise at the nation'smalls grew 3.7 percent, ahead of the Northeast, where the gain was 3.3 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
"There numbers correlate very closely with leading economic conditions," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa. "The Northeast is the laggard economy nationally speaking, and the area being hit the hardest by corporate restructuring."
For example, while the Conference Board reported in November that its index of consumer confidence, calculated from a base of 100, was 107.3 nationally, the mid-Atlantic -- New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- reported only 73.8. New England's figure was 95.3. Furthermore, the nation's low unemployment rate of 5.4 percent in November was exceeded in the Northeast; in the mid-Atlantic, the rate was 5.7, and in New York City, it was 7.4 percent. Job growth in New York is at an annual rate of about 1 percent, roughly half of the rate in the rest of the country.
Indeed, while stock prices on Wall Street climbed to repeated records during the year, translating into sales of cashmere, cigars and pricey little purses, there was plenty of downsizing in the larger corporate universe, and that might have hurt overall retail sales.
"There continues to be an exodus in jobs in New York," Ike Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, said. "The city government payrolls, the Port Authority, Newsday, the Chase-Chemical merger, the insurance area and hospital consolidations -- all of those things are not being counterbalanced by other employment. So that is where it starts. Employment means income, which means retail sales."
The mid-Atlantic states were clearly getting beaten by those farther south and west. In the Telecheck survey, the Southwest outperformed the national average with a 7.9 percent gain in holiday check writing. The Southeast reported a gain of 6.6 percent, and West Coast check writing climbed 5.9 percent.
Tactical Retail Solutions found that holiday sales in states like Florida, California and Georgia were much brisker than on the East Coast. According to the association, San Diego saw retail sales gains of about 15 percent compared with a loss of seven-hundreths of 1 percent in 1995, and Atlanta gained 14 percent. By contrast, New York limped in with a 1 percent gain, after a 1.9 percent loss in 1995.
"The West has been really strong and outperforming everyone all year," Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said. "Things don't change overnight at Christmas."
While national chains have quietly complained about lackluster Northeast sales, many retailers based here or which have a large portfolio of real estate in the Northeast are worse off than their counterparts.
"It is not a coincidence that some of the celebrated bankruptcies like Bradlees Inc., Caldor Corporation and Jamesway happened here," said Mr. Lagnado. The first two discounters, both based in the Northeast, are operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Jamesway was liquidated last year. "Some of the specialty stores like Charming Shoppes and Merry-Go-Round have been concentrated here too," Mr. Lagnado continued. "You put that all together, it is not a pretty picture."
Some economists were nonetheless surprised at the poor sales. "I would have thought that at least the New York metro area would not have been that badly off," David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard & Poor's , said. "My general sense is that the middle sections of the country are better off by broader measures. But it is a little bit surprising that the tri-state area should show up as markedly weaker."

HEADLINE: Senate Leader in Albany Offers Tax Cut Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Saying the state's economy is more vibrant than it has been in years, the Republican leader of the State Senate announced a plan today to reduce business, energy and property taxes by $2.1 billion by 2001.
In announcing the plan, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said he expected the state to end its fiscal year on March 31 with a $1 billion surplus on a budget of $64 billion. That is significantly more than has been projected by aides to Gov. George E. Pataki and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who have said they expect the surplus to be closer to $400 million. 
 Mr. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, said the larger-than-anticipated tax revenues provided a clear sign that the state's economy was booming, which he attributed to cuts in state business and personal income taxes during the last three years. He said he was optimistic that the economy would stay strong, allowing the state to collect the revenues it needs to support vital services even with new tax cuts.
"While we have cut more taxes than all the other 49 states combined, our revenues will be $1 billion up over our projections," Mr. Bruno said at a news conference. "That tells me, the Governor and others that are interested in New York State that what we're doing is working. And if it's working, we want to keep right on doing it."
Mr. Bruno's plan is his opening bid on the negotiations over the state budget and is not likely to be enacted without changes. Governor Pataki said he supported the idea of more tax cuts, but declined to endorse the plan. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, called the proposal a rehashing of old ideas that would have to be discussed in the context of the budget.
Though the tax-cut package resembles plans advocated by the Republicans in the past, its release at such an early date, before the beginning of the 1997 legislative session and before the Governor has unveiled his budget, is an aggressive new effort by the Republican Senators to set the agenda.
The Senate Republicans' plan would reduce, abolish or phase out a broad array of taxes. The largest component of the package calls for providing $700 million in property tax relief to school districts by 2001. Under the plan, school districts that freeze their property taxes would receive additional aid from the state to pay for their increasing costs. The added assistance could be as much as 3 percent more than the district was expected to receive under the state's school aid formula.
The plan also calls for reducing a tax on utility companies that is passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy costs. The gross receipts tax, as it is known, has long been criticized both by advocates for the poor, who say it is regressive, and by large manufacturers, who contend it increases costs and makes them uncompetitive with companies in surrounding states.
The Senate plan would gradually reduce the tax during the next four years, reducing state revenues by $545 million by 2001. Mr. Bruno said the resulting savings would make it easier for electric companies to reduce their rates, which throughout the state are well above the national average.
The Senate plan also calls for reducing or eliminating a host of smaller taxes on specific industries, like sales taxes on car washes and food vending machines, excise taxes on liquor, container taxes on beer, petroleum taxes for railroads and income taxes on mutual funds. It would also sharply reduce estate taxes.
The plan would reduce tax revenues by just $82 million in the coming fiscal year, which begins April 1, but that would grow to $2.1 billion in 2001.
In announcing his plan, Mr. Bruno repeatedly declined to explain how the state would pay for the additional tax cuts, saying only that the Senate Republicans would support reducing spending as is needed.
But the State Comptroller and independent fiscal monitors have predicted that even if the state has a surplus at the end of the current fiscal year, it will face a $3 billion shortfall in the coming year, because its costs continue to grow faster than its revenues.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A late wave of year-end profit-taking pulled stocks lower yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.54 points, to 6,549.37, trimming its gain for the year to 28 percent and snapping an eight-day advance. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.94 points, to 753.85 after rising 2.41 points earlier. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.63 points, to 1,287.75 after scoring an early 5.63-point advance.
Two series of computer-guided "sell" orders in the final half-hour of trading pulled stocks down.
The rising dollar may have also hurt stocks by threatening to cut the overseas earnings of United States companies. The dollar rose to its highest point against the Japanese yen since March 1993, but fell compared with the mark. Treasury prices were little changed.
Even though the late slide stopped the Dow from posting its 45th record of the year, investors said next year's outlook calls for both the economy and corporate earnings to keep growing.
"A lot of people are starting to look to more of the same in 1997: benign inflation and controlled growth," said Tracy Chester, a money manager at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago, which oversees assets of $45 billion.
Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by 14 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 339.1 million shares changed hands compared with this year's average of 409 million shares.
The shares of the Zitel Corporation plunged, spurring big declines in other software companies whose stocks rose this month on speculation that they will create products for programming computers to read the correct year after Dec. 31, 1999.
Zitel shares dropped 20 1/4, or 33 percent, to 41 after trading as high as 72 7/8 earlier. The stock was the most active in the United States, with 11.2 million shares traded.
The stock had risen in December partly because of speculation that the billionaire investor George Soros was buying shares. Mr. Soros is not buying shares of Zitel, a person close to Mr. Soros said yesterday.
A spokesman for Mr. Soros, Shawn Pattison, declined to comment on the reports.
Other companies among about 13 software or technology concerns known as "millennium" stocks followed Zitel down, after taking a roller-coaster ride earlier in the day.
Shares of TSR Inc. dropped 7 1/2, to 30, after reaching a high of 50 1/4. Accelr8 Technology shares fell 5 1/8, to 16 3/8; BRC Holding fell 5, to 45 3/4, and Data Dimensions declined 4 1/8, to 33 5/8.
Telephone stocks, which in the six days through Friday had soared almost 13 percent, led the loss in the S.& P. 500. BellSouth fell 2 1/4, to 41 3/4; SBC Communications retreated 1 5/8, to 53 1/2, and Ameritech dropped 1 5/8, to 61 1/4.
Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, I.B.M. dropped 1 1/2, to 153 5/8; Disney fell 1 1/4, to 70, and American Express eased 1, to 57 3/8.
Among active stocks, Long Island Lighting climbed 2 5/8, to 22, after Brooklyn Union Gas announced plans to buy the suburban New York electric utility for almost $25 a share, or $3 billion in stock. Brooklyn Union fell 3/4, to 30.
American depository receipts of Aegon N.V. of the Netherlands surged 5 7/8, to 62 7/8. The insurer agreed to buy the Providian Corporation's insurance operations for $3.5 billion in stock and assumed debt, while Providian, down 1 1/8, to 51 5/8, agreed to spin off its banking operations to shareholders.
In another buyout, Liberty Bancorp of Oklahoma surged 8 1/2, to 50 1/4. Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, down 1/8, to 44 3/4, agreed to buy Liberty for $546 million in stock.
Crestar Financial climbed 2 3/8, to 75, after its shareholders approved the Virginia-based company's acquisition of Maryland's Citizens Bancorp for $916 million in stock. Citizens jumped 2, to 62 1/2.

Big Dutch Insurer To Buy Providian Unit
In the biggest acquisition of an American life insurer, Aegon of the Netherlands said that it was buying the insurance business of Providian for $2.62 billion in stock. Life insurers have been rapidly consolidating, pressed by high costs and tough competition for consumers' savings from banks and mutual funds.
Aegon also said it would assume Providian debt worth $780 million and preferred stock worth $100 million. And Providian's banking subsidiary will be spun off. [Page D2.]
 
Tandy to Close Electronics Chain
Tandy said that it would close its Incredible Universe stores, which sell everything from computers to refrigerators to cassette tapes but have been losing money. The company will also close 19 of its Computer City stores and take a charge of $170 against earnings. [D3.]
 
NCR's Price: Too High, Even Now?
In one of the most disastrous corporate takeovers of recent years, AT&T acquired NCR for $7.48 billion in 1991. Today it is spinning off the computer maker for less than half that, based on the price of NCR's shares in "when-issued" trading. Still, some analysts think even that is too high a price. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Dow Falls 11.54 on Profit-Taking
A wave of late profit-taking snapped the market's eight-day advance. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.54 points, to 6,549.37, trimming its gain for the year to 28 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.63 points, closing at 1,287.75. The losers included some big technology stocks. [D7.]
 
Treasury prices were little changed in thin trading in the last full session of the year. The 30-year bond yield edged up to 6.54 percent from 6.53 percent on Friday. [D13.]
 
Humana to Cut Hundreds of Jobs
Humana, the operator of managed health care plans, said it would cut 700 to 900 jobs, or as much as 5 percent of its work force, next year as it reduces costs to stem a decline in earnings. [D3.]
 
Banc One to Grow in Oklahoma
Banc One said that it had agreed to buy the Liberty Bancorporation of Oklahoma City for $546 million in stock. Banc One operates in 12 states, and this acquisition would give it 29 branches and $2.9 billion in assets in Oklahoma, making it one of the top three banks in the state. [D3.]
 
Merger Could Squeeze Con Edison
The proposed merger of Brooklyn Union and Long Island Lighting would put new pressure on the New York area's largest electricity supplier, Con Edison, to lower rates and allow its customers to seek different energy options, analysts said. [B1.]
 
Executive Quits At HarperCollins
After less than a year as president and publisher of the HarperCollins trade publishing group, Jack McKeown has resigned, the company said. Mr. McKeown's responsibilities will be divided between David Steinberger, a management consultant at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, and Anthea Disney, the president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers. [D4.]
 
Chinese Growth and Inflation Slow
China's robust economy expanded at the slowest rate in five years during 1996. The gross domestic product rose 9.7 percent, down from 10.2 percent in 1995. The Government has been holding back growth in an attempt to curb inflation, which fell to a four-year low of 6 percent from 14.8 percent in 1995. [D6.]
 
Stake in Hong Kong Investor Sold
Executives of Citic Pacific, China's largest investment vehicle in Hong Kong, acquired 15.5 percent of the company from its state-owned parent, Citic Hong Kong, for $1.4 billion. Their goal is to increase its independence and growth prospects. The Chinese Government will still own 26.5 percent. [D6.]

HEADLINE: ROOTS OF REPRESSION: A special report.;
How Afghans' Stern Rulers Took Hold

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS with STEVE LeVINE 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan

 BODY:
When neighbors came to Mullah Mohammed Omar in the spring of 1994, they had a story that was shocking even by the grim standards of Afghanistan's 18-year-old civil war.
Two teen-age girls from the mullah's village of Singesar had been abducted by one of the gangs of mujahedeen, or "holy warriors," who controlled much of the Afghan countryside. The girls' heads had been shaved, they had been taken to a checkpoint outside the village and they had been repeatedly raped. 
 At the time, Mullah Omar was an obscure figure, a former guerrilla commander against occupying Soviet forces who had returned home in disgust at the terror mujahedeen groups were inflicting on Afghanistan.
He was living as a student, or talib, in a mud-walled religious school that centered on rote learning of the Koran.
But the girls' plight moved him to act. Gathering 30 former guerrilla fighters, who mustered between them 16 Kalashnikov rifles, he led an attack on the checkpoint, freed the girls and tied the checkpoint commander by a noose to the barrel of an old Soviet tank. As those around him shouted "God is Great!" Mullah Omar ordered the tank barrel raised and left the dead man hanging as a grisly warning.
The Singesar episode is now part of Afghan folklore. Barely 30 months after taking up his rifle, Mullah Omar is the supreme ruler of most of Afghanistan. The mullah, a heavyset 38-year old who lost his right eye in the war against the Russians, is known to his followers as Prince of All Believers. He leads an Islamic religious movement, the Taliban, that has conquered 20 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces.
Mullah Omar's call to arms in Singesar is only part of the story of the rise of the Taliban that emerged from weeks of traveling across Afghanistan and from scores of interviews with Afghans, diplomats and others who followed the movement from its earliest days in 1994. It is a story that is still unfolding, with the Taliban struggling to consolidate their hold on Kabul, the capital. The city fell three months ago to a Taliban force of a few thousand fighters, who entered the city with barely a shot fired.
But the Taliban, despite their protestations of independence, did not score their successes alone. Pakistani leaders saw domestic political gains in supporting the movement, which draws most of support from the ethnic Pashtun who predominate along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
Perhaps more important, Pakistan's leaders, in funneling supplies of ammunition, fuel and food to the Taliban, hoped to advance an old Pakistani dream of linking their country, through Afghanistan, to an economic and political alliance with the Muslim states of Central Asia.
At crucial moments during the two years of the Taliban's rise to power, the United States stood aside. It did little to discourage support for the Afghan mullahs both from Pakistan and from another American ally, Saudi Arabia, which found its own reasons for supporting the Taliban in their conservative brand of Islam.
American officials emphatically deny the assertion, widely believed among the Taliban's opponents in Afghanistan, that the United States offered the movement covert support. American diplomats' frequent visits to Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban's governing body, the officials insist, were mainly exploratory.
In fact, American policy on the Taliban has seesawed back and forth. The Taliban have found favor with some American officials, who see in their implacable hostility toward Iran an important counterweight in the region. But other officials remain uncomfortable about the Taliban's policies on women, which they say have created the most backward-looking and intolerant society anywhere in Islam. And they say that the Taliban, despite promises to the contrary, have done nothing to root out the narcotics traffickers and terrorists who have found a haven in Afghanistan under the mujahedeen.
In its most recent policy statement on Afghanistan, the State Department called on other nations to "engage" with the Taliban in hopes of moderating their policies. But the statement came as the Taliban were tightening still further their Islamic social code, particularly the taboos that have banned women from working, closed girls' schools, and required all women beyond puberty to cloak themselves head to toe in garments called burqas that are the traditional garb of Afghan village women. The result, so far, is that not a single one of the member countries of the United Nations has recognized the Taliban government and none have come forward with offers of the reconstruction aid the Taliban say will be needed to rebuild this shattered country. In the words of Mullah Mohammed Hassan, one of Mullah Omar's partners in the Taliban's ruling council, "We are the pariahs of the world."
 
On the Rise
Catching the Tide Of Discontent
How the Taliban succeeded in pacifying much of a country that had spent years spiraling into chaos is not, as their progress from Singesar to Kabul attests, primarily a question of military prowess. Much more, it was a matter of a group of Islamic nationalists catching a high tide of discontent that built up when the mujahedeen turned from fighting Russians to plundering, and just as often killing, their own people. By 1994, after five years of mujahedeen terror, the Taliban was a movement whose time had come.
One man who has seen more of the Taliban than any other outsider, Rahimullah Yusufzai, a reporter for The News in Pakistan, put it simply: "The story of the Taliban is not one of outsiders imposing a solution, but of the Afghans themselves seeking deliverance from mujahedeen groups that had become cruel and inhuman. The Afghan people had been waiting a long time for relief from their miseries, and they would have accepted anybody who would have freed them from the tyranny."
In any case, Mullah Omar contends that the decision to act at Singesar was not, at the time, envisaged as a step toward power.
Although he is universally known in Afghanistan as mullah, or giver of knowledge, he is a shy man who still calls himself a talib, or seeker after knowledge. He has met only once with a foreign reporter, Mr. Yusufzai. Mullah Omar said at their meeting in Kandahar that the men at Singesar intended originally only to help local villagers.
"We were fighting against Muslims who had gone wrong," he said. "How could we remain quiet when we could see crimes being committed against women, and the poor?"
But appeals were soon coming in from villages all around Kandahar. At about the time the two girls were being abducted in Singesar, which is in the Maiwand district 35 miles to the west, two other mujahedeen commanders had confronted each other with tanks in a bazaar in Kandahar, arguing over possession of a young boy both men wanted as a homosexual partner.
In the ensuing battle, dozens of civilians shopping and trading in the bazaar were killed. After the Taliban took control of Kandahar, those commanders, too, ended up hanging from Taliban nooses.
With each new action against the mujahedeen, the Taliban's manpower, and arsenal, grew. Mujahedeen fighters, and sometimes whole units, switched sides, so that the Taliban quickly came to resemble a coalition of many of the country's fighting groups. The new recruits included many men who had served in crucial military positions as pilots, tank commanders and front-line infantry officers in the Afghan Communist forces that fought under Soviet control in the 1980's.
After a skirmish in September 1994 at Spinbaldak, on the border with Pakistan netted the new movement 800 truckloads of arms and ammunition that had been stored in caves since the Soviet occupation, there was no force to match the Taliban. Moving rapidly east and west of Kandahar in the winter of 1994 and the spring of 1995, they rolled up territory. Sometimes, using money said to have come from Saudi Arabia, Taliban commanders paid mujahedeen commanders to give up.
But mostly, it was enough for Taliban units to appear on the horizon with the fluttering white flags symbolizing their Islamic puritanism. "In most places, the people welcomed the Taliban as a deliverance, so there was no need to fight," recalled Mr. Yusufzai, the Pakistani reporter, who has spent more time with the Taliban than any other outsider.
Another event in September 1994 gave the Taliban their most important external backer. Naseerullah Babar, Pakistan's Interior Minister, had a vision for extricating his wedge-shaped country from the precarious position in which it was placed when it was created in 1947 by the partition of India from territories running along British India's frontiers with Afghanistan.
Mr. Babar saw a Pakistan linked to the newly independent Muslim republics of what had been Soviet Central Asia, along roads and railways running across Afghanistan. He believed that stability in Afghanistan would mean a potential economic bonanza for Pakistan and a strategic breakthrough for the West. "It was in the West's overall interest," he said in an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. "Unless the Central Asian states have an opening to the sea, they will never be free from Russia."
With the rise of Taliban power around Kandahar, Mr. Babar spied a chance to prove the vision's practicability. Using Pakistan Government funds, he arranged a "peace convoy" of heavily loaded trucks to run rice, clothing and other gifts north from Quetta in Pakistan, through Kandahar, and onward to Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenistan.
But outside the American-built airport at Kandahar, a mujahedeen commander guarding one of the thousands of checkpoints that had made an obstacle course of any Afghan journey seized the convoy, demanding ransom. Once again, the Taliban intervened, freeing the convoy and hanging, again from a tank barrel, the commander who hijacked it.
Mr. Babar's subsequent enthusiasm for the Taliban gave rise to a widespread belief among the the group's opponents that they were a Pakistani creation, or at least that their growing military power was sustained by cash, arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Because of Pakistan's close ties with the United States, it was a short step for these Taliban opponents to conclude that Washington was also backing the Taliban.
After Kabul fell in September, Americans venturing into non-Taliban areas north of Kabul faced a common taunt from soldiers of the ousted Government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. "The Taliban are American puppets!" they said.
But while that was not accurate, there were ties between American officials and the growing movement that were considerably broader than those to any other Western country.
From early on, American diplomats in Islamabad had made regular visits to Kandahar to see Taliban leaders. In briefings for reporters, the diplomats cited what they saw as positive aspects of the Taliban, which they listed as a capacity to end the war in Afghanistan and its promises to put an end to the use of Afghanistan as a base for narcotics trafficking and international terrorism.
Unmentioned, but probably most important to Washington, was that the Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims, have a deep hostility for Iran, America's nemesis, where the ruling majority belong to the rival Shiite sect of Islam.
Along the way, Washington developed yet another interest in the Taliban as potential backers for a 1,200-mile gas pipeline that an American energy company, Union Oil Company of California, has proposed building from Quetta, in Pakistan, to Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic that sits atop some of the world's largest gas reserves, but has limited means to export them.
The project, which Unocal executives have estimated could cost $5 billion, would be built in conjunction with the Delta Oil Company, a Saudi Arabian concern that also has close links to the Taliban. Among the advisers Unocal has employed to deal with the Taliban is Robert B. Oakley, a former American Ambassador to Pakistan.
American officials, however, denied providing any direct assistance, covert or otherwise, to the Taliban. Similar assurances were given to Russia and India, as well as indirectly to Iran, countries that were involved in heavy arms shipments of their own to the Taliban's main opponents, the armies of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and President Rabbani that control the 12 northern provinces that continue to resist the Taliban.
"We do not have any relationship with the Taliban, and we never have had," David Cohen, the Central Intelligence Agency official who directs the agency's clandestine operations, told Indian officials in New Delhi in November.
Mr. Babar offered similar denials, asserting that "there has been no financial or material aid to the Taliban from Pakistan." But Western intelligence officials in Pakistan said the denials were a smokescreen for a policy of covert support that Mr. Babar, a retired Pakistani general, had extended to the Taliban after the convoy episode at Kandahar airport.
That support, the intelligence officials said, apart from ammunition and fuel, included the deployment at crucial junctures of Pakistani military advisers. The advisers were easy to hide, since they were almost all ethnic Pashtuns, from the same tribe that make up an overwhelming majority of the Taliban.
 
Gaining Support
To U.S. Diplomats A Rosy Picture
American officials like Robin Raphel, the top State Department official dealing directly with matters involving Afghanistan, have placed heavy emphasis on the hope that contacts with the new rulers in Kabul will encourage them to soften their policies, especially toward women.
They also say that the United States sees the Taliban, with its Islamic conservatism, as the best, and perhaps the only, chance that Afghanistan will halt the poppy growing and opium production that have made Afghanistan, with an estimated 2,500 tons of raw opium a year, the world's biggest single-country source of the narcotic. A similar argument is made on the issue of the network of international terrorists, many of them Arabs, who have set up bases inside Afghanistan.
But as the Taliban consolidate their power in Kabul, the signs of cooperation are not strong. In the week before Christmas, as bitterly cold winds from the 20,000-foot Hindu Kush mountains swept down on Kabul, senior Taliban officials seemed to be in a more pugnacious mood than in October, when a counteroffensive by the Rabbani and Dostum forces came within 10 miles of Kabul.
The attacking forces have since been driven back beyond artillery range, allowing the Taliban to concentrate on tightening their grip on Kabul's restive population of 1.5-million.
The sense that those Taliban leaders now give is that they see little reason to accommodate the West. Reports from United Nations officials monitoring drug flows suggest the Taliban have done nothing to impede the trafficking and that in the key provinces of Helmand and Nangarhar -- accounting for more than 90 per cent of the opium production -- they are in league with the drug producers, taxing them, and storing some of the opium in Taliban-guarded warehouses.
 
Turning Away
Elusive Positions On West's Concerns
Confronted with these reports, Taliban leaders have a stock response. "We intend to stop the drug trafficking, because it is against Islamic laws," they have said. "But until we can rebuild our economy, there are no other jobs, so now is not the time."
The Taliban position on those who support international terrorists is still more elusive. According to Western intelligence estimates, as many as 400 trained terrorists are living in areas under Taliban control, some of them with links to the groups that mounted the bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993 and other major attacks, including the attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Ethiopia in 1995 and attacks in France by Algerian militants.
One of the most-wanted men of all, Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian businessman who has been called one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremists in the world by the State Department, has been spotted within the past month at a heavily guarded home in the Afghan city of Jalalabad, held by the Taliban since early September.
But it is on their treatment of women that Western governments' attitudes seem most likely to hinge, and on that matter the Taliban show no sign of relenting. After a Taliban radio bulletin earlier this month celebrated the fact that 250 Kabul women had been beaten by Taliban in a single day for not observing the dress code, an Australian working as a coordinator for private Western aid agencies in Kabul, Ross Everson, visited one of the city's top Taliban officials, Mullah Mohammed Mutaqi, to appeal for a turn toward what Mr. Everson called "the doctrine of moderation that the Islamic faith is famous for."
Mullah Mutaqi stood up and waved his fist in Mr. Everson's face. "You are insulting us," he said, Then, snuggling back into the blanket that Taliban officials wear around their shoulders for warmth in the unheated offices of Kabul, he made his clinching argument.
"I must ask you, are you the Muslim here, or am I?" he said. "If you Westerners want to help us, you are welcome. Otherwise you are free to leave Afghanistan. You may think we cannot survive without you, but I can tell you, God will provide the Taliban with everything we need."

HEADLINE: Religious Leader Describes Decision to Help Clinton After Hearing of Woes

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif, Dec. 30

 BODY:
The members of an international religious group chipped in $600,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund after a major Democratic fund-raiser made a pilgrimage to its headquarters in Taiwan and described Mr. Clinton's legal problems, the group's leader said.
Suma Ching Hai, the leader of Ching Hai, a religious organization that follows her teachings, said in an interview here this weekend that she learned of Mr. Clinton's legal troubles during a meeting with Charles Yah Lin Trie, an Arkansas businessman and longtime friend of the President. After that meeting, she said, she gave lectures in the United States in March and April, where she wholeheartedly urged her followers to "do all they could" for Mr. Clinton by contributing to his defense fund. 
 "I want to help him so he can be cleared of his mind to help his nation and the world," said the 46-year-old Suma Ching Hai, who is attending a five-day Ching Hai retreat here. "He is the President of the United States, the biggest country in the world, and yet he is dragged into the material world by something so trivial."
After the lectures, inspired by her words, many of her followers, who were interviewed at the retreat, said they sent checks and money orders, which ended up in a fund to defend Mr. Clinton in his various legal battles, including Whitewater.
The fund placed a $1,000 limit on contributions, but members here said some misunderstood and thought this was the amount Suma Ching Hai wanted them to give. Hien Tran Phan, a member of the group's Los Angeles center, said the center quickly issued a clarification, explaining that the $1,000 was a ceiling, not a requirement.
This is the first time Suma Ching Hai, who was born in Vietnam, has offered her own account of the series of contributions that are part of the growing inquiry into fund raising by Mr. Clinton's legal defense fund, called the Presidential Legal Expense Trust, and the Democratic Party. The Clinton fund returned much of the money raised by Ching Hai, after the fund's private investigators became suspicious about the source of the donations.
Last March, Mr. Trie, who Suma Ching Hai said has been initiated into the group, delivered two envelopes containing about $460,000 in checks and money orders to Michael H. Cardozo, executive director of the Clinton defense fund, according to officials at the defense fund. Many of those checks and money orders bore the names of members of Ching Hai, those officials said
In April, Mr. Trie tried to deliver an additional $179,000, the officials said, but Mr. Cardozo told Mr. Trie that the fund would not accept any more money from him until it had finished reviewing the earlier donations.
Mr. Cardozo has said he was concerned about the donations because although they were supposed to have come from contributors all over the country, some were made in sequentially numbered postal money orders, bearing the signatures of the same person, with the same misspelled words. Private investigators hired by the defense fund also found that many contributors did not appear to have the financial means to write such large checks.
The investigators feared that the members of the group may have been used as fronts for wealthier interests who wanted to contribute to Mr. Clinton's legal defense fund.
Some group members offered an explanation in the interviews for why the money orders may have been sequentially ordered. One member, Henry Pham, a musician and and an unemployed engineer from Santa Ana, Calif., said that after a lecture at the group's Los Angeles center, disciples began calling the center with their pledges within hours, and the center bought money orders based on the pledges.
Group members also say the money was theirs. Pamela Millar, a member of Ching Hai and a spokeswoman for the group, said about half of the 200 people, including herself, who attended a lecture at the group's San Jose center wrote checks after the talk, raising some $100,000 on the spot. She said the money was sent to the Los Angeles center. An official there said Suma Ching Hai took most of the money orders with her.
Ching Hai members attributed any irregularities in their donations to their eagerness to please Suma Ching Hai, whom they call "Master."
"When Master told us about President Clinton's problems, people immediately posted the message to contribute on the Internet and called their friends and relatives," said Thomas Tung Ngo, who runs the Los Angeles center. "Many didn't have the time to send out a check. They just called their friends and relatives and told them to put up the money first. They pay it back later. No problem."
Mr. Ngo said he could not be sure if all the money had been paid off. But Mr. Ngo disputed assertions by Clinton fund investigators that many people did not seem to have the financial resources to make such contributions.
"The Vietnamese people, we like to save money," he said. "We don't have many expensive hobbies. We give to worthy causes."
Ching Hai belongs to no established religion; its practices are similar to those of Buddhism, but also include a strong dose of worship for Suma Ching Hai, including an emphasis on the fashions she creates, her paintings and every word she utters.
The organization gained a rapid following in Taiwan and among Vietnamese expatriates in the United States. Over the years, Suma Ching Hai's teachings have attracted more than 100,000 followers worldwide, the group says.
Mr. Trie met Mr. Clinton in Arkansas, where Mr. Trie operated a popular Chinese restaurant. Former friends and associates in Arkansas say he has boasted of his friendship with the President and in recent years has tried to build an international business.
Efforts to interview Mr. Trie about the donations he collected have been unsuccessful.
Suma Ching Hai said Mr. Trie became interested in her group through another disciple and had visited her in Taiwan earlier this year. During a spiritual discussion, she said, Mr. Trie confided in her about Mr. Clinton's problems.
"He was upset that a good man like Clinton was dragged through the mud by other politicians," Suma Ching Hai said. "He was a humble and spiritual person."
She said she decided to help Mr. Clinton even though Mr. Trie did not explicitly ask her to. "I feel sorry for the guy," she said of Mr. Clinton. "He did a lot of good for the country, for the world. It's sad to see no one comes to help him when he needs it. If every American who voted for him donate just $1 each, his legal bills would have been paid off already."
Although the disciples in the group across the United States seem to enjoy a close relationship, Mr. Trie's initiation has been a well-kept secret. Even Mr. Ngo and Ms. Millar, two of Suma Ching Hai's closest aides, did not know about it before the leader told a group of Chinese-language journalists during a Sunday night performance at the retreat.
"I found out about Charlie Trie when the news hit the papers," Ms. Millar said. "I had no idea who he was. I didn't know he was a disciple of Master."
About 3,000 Ching Hai disciples crowded into the theater at the Long Beach Convention Center here on Sunday night for the finale of the retreat: a six-hour concert celebrating Suma Ching Hai's poetry that lasted until after 2 A.M. Suma Ching Hai clapped and hummed along while prominent Vietnamese entertainers paid tribute to her by belting out songs set to her poems.

HEADLINE: Be Resolute, Mr. Clinton. Here's How.

 BODY:
President Clinton's second term officially begins on Jan. 20. But now is the time for New Year's resolutions. Here are a few suggestions, some more serious than others. 

Oseola McCarty
Retired laundrywoman who donated her life savings of $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi.
Well, I think we should all put the Lord first. And I think we should all follow our President, because he is the head of the United States. Everybody should put their shoulders to the wheel, as the saying goes, and push and push him right on in for everything of his convenience. And the Lord will bless us more.
 
George Stephanopoulos
Former senior adviser to President Clinton.
Just what the President needs: free advice from a former adviser. I'll restrain myself, at least until my White House pass is officially canceled at midnight. Instead, a word to my former colleagues on the White House staff.
When we step inside the White House gates, we enjoy things foreign to most of the public -- the Oval Office, the adrenaline buzz of high-stakes politics and the opportunity to get things done on a national scale. But these advantages often obscure the realities of everyday American life.
So resolve that once every day you'll imagine that you are back in high school wondering what it would be like to even meet the President, much less work for him. Next recall the ideals that drove you into public service in the first place. Then get back to work.
 
Gary S. Becker
Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago and the Hoover Institution.
President Clinton should raise the long-term growth rate of the United States. He can do this by rolling back the income tax increases of 1989 and 1993, and significantly reducing Federal spending, including the growth in outlays on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and subsidies to private corporations. He should also privatize Social Security and remove retirement benefits from politics. Private pension funds should invest what workers put aside for old age.
To improve the human capital of inner-city children, he must support choice in education through tuition vouchers that can be used at private schools. And he should expand college loans to lower-income families.
 
Gloria Steinem
Co-founder of Ms. magazine and author of "Moving Beyond Words."
 To commune with F.D.R. at least as much as Hillary does with Eleanor, and to do something about the 25 percent of children under 6 in this country who live in poverty. For instance, why not guarantee an income to every child? Even foster children receive more government money than children living on welfare or near poverty. Do we really want to punish children who live with their own parents?
 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali
Secretary-General of the United Nations, who leaves office today.
President Clinton should keep last year's resolution. He promised to veto the resolution recommending my re-election as Secretary-General, and then to pay what the United States owes the United Nations. He's fulfilled the first part of his pledge; now he is obligated to fulfill the second.
 
Bill Bradley
Democratic Senator from New Jersey, who is retiring.
America needs a genuine dialogue on race relations involving people of all races. The President is in a unique position to lead on this issue because, with the "bully pulpit," he can speak to values in a way that other politicians cannot.
Because Bill Clinton himself possesses a deep commitment to racial healing in this country, he should speak candidly and on a regular basis, not only about his own personal experience but about the experiences of many Americans. By doing so, he would leave an important historical legacy.
 
Stephen Goldsmith
Republican Mayor of Indianapolis.
President Clinton should move beyond welfare reform by working with the Republican Congress to transform government bureaucracies that inhibit the creation of wealth in cities.
Devolution to the states is not good enough. The President must strive to dismantle government monopolies such as public housing and public transportation, return control of public education to parents and local communities, and encourage religious and neighborhood-based organizations to participate in the delivery of social services. Only local, market-based approaches will strengthen families and bring the poor back into the mainstream economy.
 
Marian Wright Edelman
Founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund.
The most important New Year's resolution for President Clinton should be to insure every child a healthy, fair and safe start in life. Providing health coverage for all 10 million uninsured children is the first step, since 90 percent of uninsured children live in working families, 60 percent with two parents. The second step is to invest in children through quality early education and child care. The final step is to provide all youths positive alternatives to the streets, especially after school, on weekends and during the summer.
 
Alan Brinkley
Professor of history at Columbia University.
Second-term Presidents have usually been victims of hubris or lethargy or both. President Clinton is in an unenviable position in his effort to avoid their fate, given his own inclinations and the forces arrayed against him. But if he hopes to succeed and not just survive, he will need to go beyond the modest agenda he defined in his campaign and call for something significant. And he will need to fight for it.
 
Christopher Buckley
Editor of Forbes FYI and author of "Thank You for Smoking."
Put mints on the pillows at night for all those donors to the Democratic Party who are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend a night in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House.

First, President Clinton should secure the nation's borders and in the process help the urban poor for a change -- by sending all those who repeatedly hire illegals to jail.
Second, he should remain resolute in his commitment to welfare reform, but find the means to reduce adult dependency without increasing childhood misery.
Third, he should always remember that Presidents earn the mantle of greatness, not by doing many things competently, or by being politically unsinkable, but by doing one or two great deeds out of moral conviction and by sheer force of will.

Despite all the attacks on his expediency, Bill Clinton surely sees himself as having beliefs. His New Year's resolution should be to tell us what they are -- not the apple-pie ones ("Every child should get a good education"), but the tough ones where he has to value one good over another. He needs to tell us some examples of "I believe A to the exclusion of B."
President Clinton's unwillingness to make statements like that underlies his problems. Some very large proportion of Americans, perhaps a majority, sees no discipline in him, no rigor of conscience, no steadfastness. He has acquired the legal powers of the office, but he is not yet a President. If Bill Clinton conveyed his commitment to a few rock-solid beliefs, it could transform his second term.

Radio talk-show host.
Ignore the either confabulated or exaggerated personal attacks by journalists and talk-show hosts who live by the perverse excitement they generate through meanness and ugliness. However, remember that, while forgiving oneself for past transgressions, continuing in such actions while attempting to project an image or express values to the contrary is hypocrisy. This damages the optimism needed by the young, who not only need to model themselves after someone who tries to do good but who also is good.

Senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
I would like President Clinton to make a deal with the Republicans and immediately cut the cost of living adjustment a full 1.1 percent for Social Security, Federal taxes and pensions. Then, I would like him to shield the budget from any further cuts in programs affecting children, the poor and minority group members.

Author of "Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence and a Bad Haircut."
Since I am a rock-ribbed Republican, President Clinton probably shouldn't be listening to any advice from me, but here goes:
* Let bygones be bygones and send Dick Morris an open-toed pump as a gag gift.
* Have Hillary introduce that health care reform thing again.
* Ask Chechnya to join NATO.
* Turn James Carville loose on Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki.
* Show more bipartisanship -- invite Enid Waldholtz to the White House.
* Send a United Nations peacekeeping force to the Citadel.
* Stay in closer touch with D.N.C. fund-raisers.
* Play the Indonesia card.
* Wear shorts.
* Date.
