HEADLINE: Biden Got Out 'Over His Skis,' Says Obama

BYLINE: JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.


HIGHLIGHT: In his interview with ABC News, President Obama said he wished he had been allowed to announce his change of position on gay marriage on his own timetable, instead of having to quickly follow the vice president's lead. 

 BODY:
President Obama gently chided his vice president for forcing his hand on the issue of gay marriage, but said he would have gotten around to declaring his own change of mind anyway before going to the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina.
"He probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity and spirit," Mr. Obama said when asked whether Mr. Biden had "jumped the gun" by going first a few days earlier.
"Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without I think there being a lot of notice to everybody? Sure. But all's well that ends well," he said in the interview as it was broadcast on "Good Morning America" on Thursday.
One delicate maneuver that Mr. Obama had to execute during his interview, recorded on Wednesday with Robin Roberts of ABC News, in which he formally declared his support for gay marriage, was to explain what he calls his "evolution" without looking either inconstant or opportunistic.
Asked point blank if the change was all about politics, he said, "I've been consistent in my overall trajectory." 
There is no way to completely avoid the charge that, in short, he was against it before he was for it. And until the full interview was broadcast Thursday morning, and a transcript released, his explanation was not given a full airing.
"I have to tell you that part of my hesitation on this has also been I didn't want to nationalize the issue," he said. "There's a tendency when I weigh in to think suddenly it becomes political and it becomes polarized." He went on to say that his opponent, Mitt Romney, "wants to re-federalize the issue and institute a constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay marriage."
That, he said, would be a mistake. But he insisted his change was not driven by politics.
"I think it'd be hard to argue that somehow this is - something that I'd be doing for political advantage - because frankly, you know -- you know, the politics, it's not clear how they cut," the ABC transcript quoted him as saying.
"In some places that are going to be pretty important - in this electoral map - it may hurt me. But - you know, I think it - it was important for me, given how much attention this issue was getting, both here in Washington, but - elsewhere, for me to go ahead, 'Let's be clear. Here's what I believe.' "
He then changed the subject.
"I'm not going to be spending most of my time talking about this, because frankly - my job as president right now, my biggest priority is to make sure that we're growing the economy, that we're putting people back to work, that we're managing the draw down in Afghanistan, effectively. Those are the things that - I'm going to focus on. And, I'm sure there's going to be more than enough to argue about with the other side, when it comes to - when it comes to our politics."

HEADLINE: Once Shorting Subprime, Bass Now Bullish on Mortgage Bonds

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Kyle Bass, a Texas hedge fund investor who profited from betting against the mortgage market, now thinks some of the worst bonds could yield 14%. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Kyle Bass, a Texas hedge fund investor who profited from shorting the mortgage market amid the financial crisis, has had a change of heart.
Mr. Bass now thinks some of the worst bonds, those which are not backed by the government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could yield 14 percent in the coming years.
"I think housing stops going down in the next six to 12 months," he said on a panel Thursday at the SALT conference, a hedge fund industry gathering here.
Mr. Bass, whose Hayman Capital Management oversees more than $1 billion, also gave the audience in attendance (which has notably grown as the day wears on) his unedited perception of Japan. It's not pretty.
Mr. Bass has been short Japan for awhile, and during that time he seems to have perfected the sound bite. He took aim at the entitlement programs and debt in Japan, and how the country is heading for insolvency.
"Madoff taught us something," he said. "You can make promises for a long time as long as you don't have to keep them."
Yet the country's debt still has a low yield and is highly valued in the market, he said. But his sense is that once Europe devolves (he's bearish there, too) the market will ten focus on Japan.
For now, it's cheap to bet against.
"I've never seen more optionality in my life," he added, calling it "the single most obvious thing I've ever set my eyes on."
As for the United States, he does not have much faith in its ability to avoid a troubling future. Having traveled extensively to Washington in recent years, he's not optimistic about the prospects for government to get it together.
"I'm convinced we're not going to get anywhere no matter who takes the presidency," he said, prompting a wave of laughter.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Discloses $2 Billion in Trading Losses

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase disclosed in a regulatory filing that its Chief Investment Office, a group that has come into focus for its proprietary bets, has suffered "significant" paper losses in a portfolio of credit investments. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase, which emerged from the financial crisis as the nation's biggest bank, disclosed on Thursday that it had lost more than $2 billion in trading, a surprising stumble that promises to escalate the debate over whether regulations need to rein in trading by banks.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, blamed "errors, sloppiness and bad judgment" for the loss, which stemmed from a hedging strategy that backfired.
The trading in that hedge roiled markets a month ago, when rumors started circulating of a JPMorgan trader in London whose bets were so big that he was nicknamed "the London Whale" and "Voldemort," after the Harry Potter villain.
For a bank that earned nearly $19 billion last year, the trading loss, which could go higher, will not cripple it in any way. Still it demonstrates how a market blunder can shake even a financial giant that celebrates its "fortress balance sheet."
It is a rare blow to the reputation of Mr. Dimon, 56, a native New Yorker known for his hands-on management style and a confident swagger. After successfully steering his bank through the market turmoil of 2008 and the recession, he is perhaps the most influential bank executive in the country - and a vocal critic of the efforts to write rules under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.
The setback for JPMorgan may strengthen the hand of regulators in Washington who are now writing the rules for Dodd-Frank - in particular the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from trading with their own money.
JPMorgan's setback "casts doubt on Jamie's opposition and adds fuel to anyone who has been pushing for greater regulation," said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. "Oh, how the mighty have fallen."
Throughout the debate around the Volcker Rule, which is named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, Mr. Dimon has said the rule goes too far. Mr. Dimon told CNBC earlier this year that under the Volcker Rule, "if you want to be trading, you have to have a lawyer and a psychiatrist sitting next to you determining what was your intent every time you did something."
Questions over whether banks have been engaging in such trading for themselves while calling it "market-making" or "hedging" came into focus last month, when the reports emerged that a trading unit of JPMorgan in London was taking such large positions in the name of hedging that they were distorting the market.
At the time, Mr. Dimon played down concerns about that trading, in what the bank calls its chief investment office, telling analysts in an April 13 conference call that it was "a complete tempest in a teapot."
In a hastily organized conference call with analysts on Thursday, Mr. Dimon sounded more humble, saying that "egregious mistakes" were made. "They were self-inflicted and this is not how we want to run a business."
Yet while conceding that the bank had "egg on its face," Mr. Dimon refused to concede that the losses necessitated a stronger regulatory framework. Although he did says that it "plays right into the hands of a whole bunch of pundits out there."
And he defended the trading unit, saying that "the C.I.O. has done a great job for a long extended period of time."
The troubles are expected to weigh on the bank's broader earnings. For example, the corporate group, which includes the chief investment office, is now expected to lose $800 million in the second quarter, the company said in the filing. Previously, JPMorgan estimated that the group would report net income of about $200 million.
Shares of JPMorgan tumbled 6.7 percent in after-hours trading. Its Wall Street rivals were also down sharply.
The $2 billion loss came from a complicated trading strategy that involved derivatives, financial instruments that derive their value from the prices of securities and other assets. JPMorgan said the derivatives trades were part of a hedge, meaning they were set up to offset potential losses on the bank's large holdings of bonds and loans. But, in the sort of nightmare situation that bankers dread, the ostensible hedge backfired, producing losses of its own.
Since the financial crisis, several financial institutions have been rocked by risky trading, although under very different circumstances. At UBS, $2 billion in trading losses was attributed to a rogue trader, while MF Global collapsed not because of its bet on troubled European sovereign debt, but as a result of a loss of confidence that trade produced.
But JPMorgan's trade was not so obviously fraught with risk. It produced large losses even without extreme movements in the derivatives markets or underlying bond markets. Indexes that track derivatives tied to corporate bonds have recently increased - reflecting a gloomier outlook for corporate bonds - but the move has not been jarring.
JPMorgan likely structured the trade in such a way that effectively magnified losses. Specifically, the bank bought insurance against losses on corporate debt through credit derivatives that increase in value if the underlying creditworthiness of companies is perceived to have deteriorated. But JPMorgan stumbled when it tried to modify that trade by also making an opposite bet with credit derivatives. Mr. Dimon said that the strategy "to reduce the credit hedge" was "poorly constructed and poorly monitored."
The trades took place in the chief investment office of JPMorgan. These big trades are designed as hedges. Last month big derivatives trades executed in London by the unit appeared to be throwing markets out of kilter. The trades were reportedly put on by "the London whale" - a French trader, Bruno Iksil. On Thursday, Mr. Dimon said losses on the trade could grow.
The loss-making trades will further stoke the debate over whether banks make big bets under the guise of hedging. An old market adage says the best way to hedge is to simply sell an asset, rather than offset it with potentially dangerous derivatives. The Volcker Rule attempts to distinguish between true hedging and trading.
The losses will also raise enduring questions about JPMorgan's ability to manage its risks. When it reported first-quarter earnings in April, it released a metric of risk-taking in the chief investment office that made it look as if the unit was taking risks in line with other parts of the bank. But on Thursday, the bank released a new measure of risk-taking that was nearly twice as high.
"JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. Jamie Dimon has been a relentless critic of financial reform," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which supports tougher regulation of banks. The surprise loss, he said, "proves him wrong."

HEADLINE: On the Trail, Romney Not Eager to Engage on Gay Marriage Issue

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: As Mitt Romney addressed hundreds of supporters in Nebraska, one of the nation's most reliably Republican states, the topic of same-sex marriage did not cross his lips. 

 BODY:
OMAHA - Mitt Romney rarely passes on an opportunity to respond to President Obama or the actions of the White House. But that is precisely what he did here on Thursday.
 As Mr. Romney addressed hundreds of supporters while campaigning in Nebraska, one of the nation's most reliably Republican states, the topic of same-sex marriage did not cross his lips. He urged voters to focus on health care, the expansion of government and the country's debt burdens.
 "I'm concerned about where we're headed with this president," said Mr. Romney, whose message echoed Republican leaders back in Washington who were intent on not becoming distracted by the president's newfound declaration of support for same-sex marriage.
 Since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Romney has struggled to keep the campaign conversation focused squarely on the economy. His economic speeches have been overshadowed by a series of unrelated events, including the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's killing and now, the gay marriage debate. 
 In a 10-minute speech along the Missouri River at Rick's Café Boatyard and during a separate luncheon fund-raising event, Mr. Romney railed against the administration on a variety of topics. Marriage did not make his list.
 But during a Thursday interview on the Fox News Channel, as well as in a series of local television interviews, the subject could not be avoided. He said that he "respects" the president's decision and acknowledged differing viewpoints on gay marriage, adding, "This is something you can't really convince someone about."
 As the president and his re-election team celebrated and sought to rally campaign donors to contribute money in wake of the gay marriage announcement, Mr. Romney said, "I don't think the matter of marriage is a fund-raising matter." And he implored voters to avoid distractions from "shiny objects" held up by Mr. Obama and his advisers.
"You have positions. You describe what they are," Mr. Romney said in the Fox News interview. "Hopefully, people are focused on the major issues of the day."
 In the television interview, he called the marriage issue "tender and sensitive," and renewed his objection to same-sex marriage. He called for "a national standard to define marriage between a man and a woman." He said that he supported allowing gay couples to adopt children, but said that he did not view the gay rights cause as a civil rights issue.
 In a half-dozen interviews with Republicans who came to see Mr. Romney, not a single person voiced an objection at his decision not to dwell on the issue of same-sex marriage. They said the election would be decided on the economy, health care and Mr. Obama's first term.
 "It's none of my business. We don't need to talk about it," said Mo Birkel, 70, a retired custodian from nearby Papillion, Neb., when asked about gay marriage. "I can't say if I'm for it or against it because I don't know what my grandkids will be."
 Hal Daub, a former member of Congress from Nebraska and an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Romney, said that it was wise for Republicans to avoid falling into what he called a "trap being set by Democrats." He said that he hoped Republican activists followed party leaders and did not become distracted by gay marriage debate.
 "There is a more tolerant viewpoint in the Republican Party," Mr. Daub said. "You can see that here in Nebraska."

HEADLINE: If It's Made of Metal, Thieves Aren't Picky

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A rise in commodities price seems to have led to a rash of thefts of manhole covers and other pieces of iron found on city streets. 

 BODY:
 The high price of oil is not the only effect of commodity inflation hitting the streets of New York. A surge in the value of copper, iron and other metals has fueled a wave of thefts from sidewalks, roadways and rail yards in the last few months.
 On Wednesday alone, the New York police arrested three men for stealing hunks of cast iron - grates made to protect tree roots and manhole covers weighing as much as 300 pounds. The arrests followed reports of the disappearance of dozens of the grates and covers across the city and came on top of a continuing spree of thefts of copper wire from utility cables.
 "It's about money," said Kevin Rafferty, president of Dublin Scrap Metal in Newark. "The economy's tough, and people are looking to sell whatever they can find to sell."
Mr. Rafferty, who said his company would not buy manhole covers or pieces of train rail that people showed up with, said the run-up in the prices of metals could also be driving up thefts. Still, he said, stealing a manhole cover from a city street is a true sign of desperation. Iron is worth only about 15 cents a pound, compared with about $3 a pound for copper, he said.
 That disparity helps to explain why utility companies like Consolidated Edison usually have to contend with thefts of copper-filled cables far more often than the pilfering of manhole covers. Last year, Con Ed counted 133 thefts of its cable and just 2 stolen manhole covers.
 But that was before Andrew Modica came along, the police say. On Wednesday night, detectives in Brooklyn arrested Mr. Modica, 46, in connection with the thefts of dozens of Con Ed's manhole covers in Brooklyn and Queens.
 Inside a stolen Ford pickup truck with stolen Connecticut plates, the police said, they found a hydraulic jack and two J-shape metal hooks that Mr. Modica used to hoist the covers from roadbeds into the truck. He admitted that he had taken more than 15 of the missing covers and sold them for about $30 each to two scrap yards in the city, the police said. To avoid suspicion, Mr. Modica wore a reflective vest like the ones used by Con Ed repair crews, the police said.
 The police declined to identify the buyers of the manhole covers.
 Mr. Modica, it turns out, had firsthand knowledge of how to remove manhole covers because he had worked for a company that replaced them for Con Ed. That company, Safeway Construction Enterprises in Maspeth, Queens, employed him until late last year, said Shuta Waki, a manager with Safeway. Mr. Waki would not discuss the circumstances under which Mr. Modica left the company.
 Mr. Waki said removing manhole covers "was part of his job." But Mr. Modica would have been working with one or two other men to lift the covers. He expressed doubt that Mr. Modica could have taken the covers by himself and was surprised to hear that the police said Mr. Modica had left open manholes that posed hazards to drivers and pedestrians.
 Con Ed officials were also dubious that Mr. Modica had worked alone. "To a lot of people here, it was quite surprising that it was one person who was doing this," said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman. He said the company believed Mr. Modica was responsible for the bulk of the missing covers, but "we're certainly not going to assume that there aren't other people out there who might try to do the same thing."
 Mr. Modica was charged with possession of stolen property, reckless endangerment, petit larceny and criminal impersonation, the police said. 
 He was the third man arrested on Wednesday for taking molded metal off the streets. Early that morning, a police officer in Midtown Manhattan stopped a van and found three grates that had protected trees on West 48th Street. The driver admitted that he had previously stolen at least a dozen similar grates from the sidewalks along 46th Street between Eighth and 10th Avenues, the police said.
 A passenger in the van was wearing a reflective vest that belonged to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although he did not work for that agency, the police said.
Business owners along that stretch of 46th Street, known as Restaurant Row, were so distressed about the absence of the grates and fearful that pedestrians would trip over the unprotected tree pits that the Times Square Alliance had offered a $1,000 reward for help catching the thieves. Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance, said that a witness had provided some information to the police about the thefts but that he did not yet know if the person would receive a reward.
 The scrap metal industry has a system for spreading word of the theft of metal items, like the load of used rail spikes and rail plates that disappeared from a New Jersey Transit rail yard in Raritan, last month. But Mr. Rafferty said that even a vigilant metals buyer would have trouble spotting unmarked pieces, like the tree grates, buried in a truckload of junk.
 Kevin Lawlor, a spokesman for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade organization in Washington, said, "We don't like to put the onus on the scrap dealer to make decisions about what's stolen or not stolen." Still, Mr. Lawlor said, "The manhole covers is a unique situation because people should know that everyday citizens don't walk around with a manhole cover."

HEADLINE: Why Would the Feds Investigate the Facebook-Instagram Deal?

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: If the government chooses to take a closer look at the Facebook-Instagram merger, it could be based on a theory that Facebook bought Instagram to cut off potential competition somewhere down the line. 

 BODY:
The Financial Times on Thursday reported that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, a move that, if true, could add a new wrinkle to Silicon Valley's biggest and most anticipated public offering.
The commission said it could neither confirm nor deny the report. A Facebook representative declined to comment. An Instagram co-founder, Kevin Systrom, did not respond to an e-mail.
So is there an investigation? And what does it mean?
The Federal Trade Commission always investigates acquisitions of over $66 million, which is a number tied to inflation. (Hat tip to my colleague in Washington, Ed Wyatt, for pointing that out.) The agency has 30 days to conduct an initial review to make sure the deal does not break anti-competition laws. Some deals are picked for closer scrutiny. It isn't yet clear whether this deal was.
More to the point, how can it be anti-competitive? Instagram, after all, is one of several photo-sharing applications, even for mobile devices. By buying Instagram, at face value, Facebook does not seem to hurt the consumer's ability to choose to use any of the others.
But there is another theory on which antitrust matters can be based. The government could also be interested in whether a company is killing off a potential rival by swallowing it up. Facebook today is the dominant social network, and it commands the lion's share of advertising in the social network market. Instagram had no advertisements, but it could have one day started to attract advertisements.
That would have meant real competition for Facebook, especially on mobile devices, where the social network has been unable to, by its own admission, generate "meaningful revenue."
A rival that happens to be hugely popular on mobiles could have potentially driven down advertising prices.
"This might be cutting off a new giant," is how one lawyer who specializes in antitrust matters described the move. The lawyer, who was not involved with either company, did not want to be named because he did not want to influence a potential inquiry.
Facebook has said in its offering documents that it expects to gain approval in the second quarter of 2012. It cannot integrate Instagram into its site until after its gets approval from regulators. Facebook has promised to give Instagram $200 million for its troubles, in case the merger isn't approved.
Certainly there are other companies -- Twitter for instance -- who would rather not see the Facebook-Instagram merger. Twitter on Thursday declined to comment on the reported F.T.C. inquiry.

HEADLINE: A Shock From JPMorgan Is New Fodder for Reformers

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss could give supporters of tighter industry regulation a huge new piece of ammunition as they fight a last-ditch battle with the banks to strengthen the Volcker Rule. 

 BODY:
It didn't take long for bank reformers to say we told you so.
JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss, which was disclosed on Thursday, could give supporters of tighter industry regulation a huge new piece of ammunition as they fight a last-ditch battle with the banks over new federal rules that may redefine how banks do business.
"The enormous loss JPMorgan announced today is just the latest evidence that what banks call 'hedges' are often risky bets that so-called 'too big to fail' banks have no business making," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the language at the heart of the battle between the financial and government worlds, in a statement. "Today's announcement is a stark reminder of the need for regulators to establish tough, effective standards."
The centerpiece of the new regulations, the so-called Volcker Rule, forbids banks from making bets with their own money, and a final version is expected to be issued by federal officials in the coming months. With the financial crisis fading from view, banks have successfully pushed for some exceptions that critics say will allow them to simply make proprietary trades under a different name, in this case for the purposes of hedging and market-making.
The missteps by JPMorgan could highlight that murky line between proprietary trading and hedging. The bank unit responsible for losses takes positions to hedge activities in other parts of the bank.
"This is a crucial moment in the debate," said Frank Partnoy, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego, who has been a longtime supporter of tighter rules for the nation's banks. "It couldn't have come at a worse time for JPMorgan Chase. After everything we went through in the financial crisis, the fact that something of this magnitude could happen shows that the reform didn't do the job."
On Wall Street, few have been more outspoken about the pitfalls of the Volcker Rule than JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon not only attacked the rule, he personally criticized Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and the regulation's namesake.
"Paul Volcker by his own admission has said he doesn't understand capital markets," Mr. Dimon told Fox Business earlier this year. "He has proven that to me."
The industry reasons that the Volcker Rule would be a costly burden for the banks. But more important, industry officials say, it would hurt the markets and the broader economy.
"Regardless of how the final rule turns out, it will be a shock to the U.S. financial system, as banking entities will need to take extraordinary measures to attempt to implement it," said Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan's executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs, in a letter to federal regulators earlier this year. In the letter, Mr. Zubrow defended exactly this kind of trade.
Even Mr. Dimon had to admit Thursday's disclosure was a setback for JPMorgan and other banks that want more flexibility when the final version of the Volcker Rule is issued. "It plays into the hands of a bunch of pundits but you have to deal with that and that's life," Mr. Dimon said Thursday on a conference call with analysts.
As fuel for industry reformers, JPMorgan provides a compelling case study.
Unlike the collapse of MF Global last fall, JPMorgan is a Wall Street giant, and under Mr. Dimon's oversight, it seemed to have mastered risk management. After all, the bank weathered the financial crisis better than most.
Nor was JPMorgan damaged by rogue traders of the sort that cost UBS $2.3 billion in September, or hit Société Générale with a $7 billion loss in 2008. This was a strategy that the bank itself had devised, with the full knowledge and support of JPMorgan management. In other words, it is the kind of risk that executives like Mr. Dimon say they should be able to manage - but might not be to defend in the wake of the loss disclosed Thursday.
Mr. Dimon and other bank executives argue that hedging, when used properly, allows financial institutions to offset the normal risks they face from economic or market shifts, and doesn't represent the kind of proprietary, directional bet that the Volcker Rule is intended to bar.
In Washington, proponents of stricter regulation say any permitted hedge trade should be tied to a specific position - say a loan to a particular company, or securities being held in inventory for customers on a trading desk. They argue that such trades represent appropriate activities to protect the bank's balance sheet.
Broader hedges, like the one that proved so costly to JPMorgan, should be forbidden, they argue.
JPMorgan suffered losses in a portfolio of credit investments. Mr. Partnoy said broad economic hedging carries risks of its own - and sometimes they can be bigger than proprietary bets like the one that brought down MF Global.
"They're playing with fire," said Mr. Partnoy. "With proprietary trading, you know about the risks. With a hedge, you start to feel safe about it and it lulls people into a false sense of security. It can be a wolf in sheep's clothing."
Even as Mr. Dimon put the blame squarely on his bank, his arguments on Thursday seemed intended to leave the impression that it was poor execution, not the risks inherent in accumulating big trading positions, that caused the huge loss. In fact, he went out of his way not to blame market shifts or trading reverses.
"Just because we're stupid doesn't mean everybody else was," he said. "There were huge moves in the marketplace but we made these positions more complex and they were badly monitored."
"This may not have violated the Volcker Rule, but it violates the Dimon Principle."

HEADLINE: Jobs and the Election: A Weekly Tracker

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: To track the economy, The Times is creating a weekly report on the predicted path of job growth and the unemployment rate between now and the election. 

 BODY:
 Nothing influences presidential elections more than the direction of the economy in the months before Election Day. 
To track the economy this year, The Times is creating a weekly report on the predicted path of job growth and the unemployment rate between now and the election. The forecasts come from Moody's Analytics, a research group whose work is used by the Federal Reserve and private businesses, and are based on a wide range of economic data.
 History suggests that this year's election is likely to be very close if the economy adds 100,000 to 175,000 jobs a month in the six months before Election Day. (These benchmarks come from work by Nate Silver, of The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog.) Job growth above 175,000 would tend to make President Obama a favorite. Growth below 100,000 would make Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, the favorite.
 The current economic forecast suggests that Mr. Obama is better positioned than Mr. Romney, but only slightly. Moody's Analytics predicts that the economy will add an average of 182,000 between now and October. By comparison, it added 188,000 jobs a month in the first four months of the year but only 115,000 in April.
 The economy will obviously not be the only factor in voters' minds. A war or other unexpected event could affect the election as well. But barring a major surprise, the economy's direction will probably shape the campaign more than anything else.
 Historically, nothing - not social issues, campaign advertisements or gaffes - has influenced voters more heavily than the direction of the economy in an election year. In only three races since World War II has the outcome been different from what the economy's direction would have suggested: 1952 (when the popular Dwight D. Eisenhower was running), 1968 (when the Vietnam War hobbled the Democrats) and 1976 (when Watergate hobbled the Republicans).
 The Moody's forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be 8 percent in September and 7.9 percent in October. That would be down from 8.1 percent last month and 8.3 percent in Mr. Obama's first full month in office. 
 Much of the decline since 2009, however, has occurred because people have stopped looking for work and are no longer considered officially unemployed. The percentage of adults with jobs (58.4 percent last month) is likely to be lower on Election Day than when Mr. Obama took office (60.3 percent in mid-February 2009).
The forecast is based on weekly data on jobless claims, surveys that measure business activity and previous monthly jobs reports, among other things. 
 The latest analysis by the Moody's economists Ryan Sweet and Mark Zandi follows. A chart and a discussion of the methodology appear on the firm's Dismal Scientist blog.
New labor data over the past week leave us cautiously optimistic that the U.S. job market is improving. Because of recent gains in small business hiring plans and stable initial claims for unemployment insurance, we expect a net addition to nonfarm payrolls of 165,000 in May, a better performance than the 115,000 initially estimated by the Labor Department for April. The unemployment rate is likely to remain at 8.1%.
It will take time before the economy regains the pace of job creation reached earlier this year. Payback for early growth spurred by the warm winter could continue into May. Factoring in weather and other temporary effects, underlying monthly job growth is probably running between 175,000 and 200,000. This isn't a boom, but it is fast enough growth to lower the unemployment rate, which we forecast will end 2012 below 8%.
The main concern about the spring slowdown in U.S. job and income growth is that it may damage consumer confidence, creating a negative feedback loop. Fortunately there is little evidence of this so far. Although employment growth will not be impressive in May, it will not be weak enough to spur new monetary policy activity by the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Easy Useless Economics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
A few days ago, I read an authoritative-sounding paper in The American Economic Review, one of the leading journals in the field, arguing at length that the nation's high unemployment rate had deep structural roots and wasn't amenable to any quick solution. The author's diagnosis was that the U.S. economy just wasn't flexible enough to cope with rapid technological change. The paper was especially critical of programs like unemployment insurance, which it argued actually hurt workers because they reduced the incentive to adjust.
O.K., there's something I didn't tell you: The paper in question was published in June 1939. Just a few months later, World War II broke out, and the United States -- though not yet at war itself -- began a large military buildup, finally providing fiscal stimulus on a scale commensurate with the depth of the slump. And, in the two years after that article about the impossibility of rapid job creation was published, U.S. nonfarm employment rose 20 percent -- the equivalent of creating 26 million jobs today. 
So now we're in another depression, not as bad as the last one, but bad enough. And, once again, authoritative-sounding figures insist that our problems are ''structural,'' that they can't be fixed quickly. We must focus on the long run, such people say, believing that they are being responsible. But the reality is that they're being deeply irresponsible.
What does it mean to say that we have a structural unemployment problem? The usual version involves the claim that American workers are stuck in the wrong industries or with the wrong skills. A widely cited recent article by Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago asserts that the problem is the need to move workers out of the ''bloated'' housing, finance and government sectors.
Actually, government employment per capita has been more or less flat for decades, but never mind -- the main point is that contrary to what such stories suggest, job losses since the crisis began haven't mainly been in industries that arguably got too big in the bubble years. Instead, the economy has bled jobs across the board, in just about every sector and every occupation, just as it did in the 1930s. Also, if the problem was that many workers have the wrong skills or are in the wrong place, you'd expect workers with the right skills in the right place to be getting big wage increases; in reality, there are very few winners in the work force.
All of this strongly suggests that we're suffering not from the teething pains of some kind of structural transition that must gradually run its course but rather from an overall lack of sufficient demand -- the kind of lack that could and should be cured quickly with government programs designed to boost spending.
So what's with the obsessive push to declare our problems ''structural''? And, yes, I mean obsessive. Economists have been debating this issue for several years, and the structuralistas won't take no for an answer, no matter how much contrary evidence is presented.
The answer, I'd suggest, lies in the way claims that our problems are deep and structural offer an excuse for not acting, for doing nothing to alleviate the plight of the unemployed.
Of course, structuralistas say they are not making excuses. They say that their real point is that we should focus not on quick fixes but on the long run -- although it's usually far from clear what, exactly, the long-run policy is supposed to be, other than the fact that it involves inflicting pain on workers and the poor.
Anyway, John Maynard Keynes had these peoples' number more than 80 years ago. ''But this long run,'' he wrote, ''is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the sea is flat again.''
I would only add that inventing reasons not to do anything about current unemployment isn't just cruel and wasteful, it's bad long-run policy, too. For there is growing evidence that the corrosive effects of high unemployment will cast a shadow over the economy for many years to come. Every time some self-important politician or pundit starts going on about how deficits are a burden on the next generation, remember that the biggest problem facing young Americans today isn't the future burden of debt -- a burden, by the way, that premature spending cuts probably make worse, not better. It is, rather, the lack of jobs, which is preventing many graduates from getting started on their working lives.
So all this talk about structural unemployment isn't about facing up to our real problems; it's about avoiding them, and taking the easy, useless way out. And it's time for it to stop.

HEADLINE: In 2 Sudans, Familiarity With Path To War

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON; Isma'il Kushkush contributed reporting from Khartoum, Sudan.

 BODY:
MAYOM WEL, South Sudan -- On a recent blistering afternoon, this village danced in an open field. Women sashayed, hoisting chairs over their heads. Barefoot children scampered. Old men, with skin as dry and cracked as the bark of a savanna tree, jabbed rifles toward the burning sky.
''We are not cowards, we do not fear!'' cried out the local commissioner, Awet Kiir Awet.
''Contribute food, contribute money,'' he urged the crowd.
South Sudan's years of conflict were meant to be over when it won its independence from Sudan last July after generations of fighting with the people of the north. But the jubilation quickly faded, and now, not even a year later, after weeks of pointed barbs and border skirmishes, this vast and vastly underdeveloped country is once again mobilizing for war -- and asking some of the poorest people on earth to pay for it, with whatever they have at hand. 
The villagers stepped forward, one after another, volunteering packs of tobacco, sacks of flour, goats, peanuts and $2 in wrinkled bills -- not small change here. At the same time, scores of young men from around the area enlisted to be infantrymen, eager to rush to the front.
Sudan and South Sudan have yet to resolve a number of prickly and vital issues, not least of which is how to demarcate a border of more than 1,000 miles and share billions of dollars of oil revenue. Border clashes escalated in late March, killing hundreds, and strategic oil fields have switched hands.
The United States, the African Union and the United Nations have pushed both sides to stop fighting, saying the last thing this region needs is another major conflict. Sudan and South Sudan have agreed in principle in recent days to return to the negotiating table, though officials from the South say Sudan has continued to bomb areas along the border. Most South Sudanese, including top officials, are now convinced that more fighting is not a question of if, but when.
''Khartoum will definitely be attacking us,'' said South Sudan's vice president, Riek Machar, who is leading the nationwide mobilization effort. ''This is our history, this is our inbuilt way of coping with problems.''
In Juba, South Sudan's capital, government representatives move from hotel to hotel, compelling managers to donate 1,000 pounds each -- about $370 -- or essentials like charcoal and beans. In Rumbek, about 100 miles north, more than 850 young men signed up to join the army. In Warrap, a border state neighboring the contested region of Abyei, more than 3,000 young men have enlisted.
Anything from cooking oil to combatants is welcome.
President Salva Kiir likes to portray his country as an underdog, recently saying that South Sudan was ''like a child who has two teeth, up and down,'' whose ''teeth will grow'' and ''bite that man'' referring to his former -- and possibly future nemesis -- Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Both sides, it seems, are gearing up for a major conflict. In Khartoum, Sudan's capital, the government mandated that part of civil servants' salaries be diverted toward the military -- as has the South. And just like the South, Khartoum is trying to spur a grass-roots war effort, asking Sudanese citizens to donate food, goods and other valuables for the defense of the nation.
South Sudan's border areas, like Mayom Wel, bore the brunt of Sudan's two north-south civil wars. The first began in the 1950s, and the second ended only when an American-backed peace treaty was signed in 2005. In the generations between, villages were burned, children spirited away as slaves and many youths, known as the Lost Boys, were left to wander hundreds of miles across the lion-infested veld in search of safety.
Garang Wol Kon, an army recruiter, and his comrades tour these same areas today, asking people to go back to war. Originally, the recruiters said, they would have been happy netting 1,110 new soldiers. Instead, they have signed up triple that number.
''The sons and the daughters of the former liberators are the ones enjoying mobilization,'' Mr. Kon said, under the shade of a tree in Aweil. ''It's something in the blood.''
Nearby, a young boy skipped by the tree, toting two wooden handmade toys he had nailed together himself -- AK-47s.
Recruits are expected to train for several weeks, and then go to the front to fortify the border. But many of the training facilities are full -- because so many young men have signed up to fight -- and officials are now focusing on gathering materiel. At least 8,000 young men, and about 10 young women, have joined the army over the last month, recruiters say.
At one rally last week in Mayom Wel, local chiefs, many of whom fought in South Sudan's first liberation struggle, sat in a ring with ribbon sashes of the South Sudanese flag. About 100 villagers gathered behind them, listening to a visiting convoy from the government and military give updates on the latest deployments and clashes.
Then they call on the community to help. In sequence, a microcosm of the village takes to the microphone, some speaking of their own memories of war, and declare what they can give. Here is a recent list: 11 goats, 6 cows, 1 chicken, 13 bags of sorghum, about 9 pounds of flour, 3 bottles of home-brewed alcohol, 3 rolls of tobacco and 1,207 South Sudanese pounds, around $350. Across South Sudan, tens of thousands of pounds have been collected, sometimes in large donations and sometimes in the tiniest denominations.
Mayom Wel is a scatter of thatched-roof huts on a virtually open savanna, and it could serve as a postcard for the poverty of the whole country, the world's newest and immediately one of the poorest.
The village is in Northern Bahr El Ghazal State, where government figures indicate that 79 percent of the state's population is illiterate and 76 percent live below the poverty line. If a full-fledged war breaks out, ''both sides will run out of money soon,'' said E J Hogendoorn, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, which works to defuse conflicts. ''We could quickly have one, or two, failed states.''
Some analysts have said that war is a convenient out for South Sudan and Sudan, both of which face struggling economies, ethnic tensions and internal rebellions.
In Mayom Wel, many of the young men who signed up as infantrymen did so with no promise of a salary, which is exactly what happened in the past.
''When we took arms against Khartoum, there was no salary, there was no food, there was no water,'' said Gabriel Bol Duth, another mobilization leader. ''We fought them because we wanted freedom.''

HEADLINE: What It Takes to Keep a Factory

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
ROME, N.Y. -- Walking through his high-ceilinged factory here, explaining the production of sheets of copper, M. Brian O'Shaughnessy comes across as a staunch advocate of manufacturing in America. But he invariably adds: ''There is nothing made in the United States that has to be made here -- that can't be shipped in from some other country.''
As chairman and principal owner of Revere Copper Products, Mr. O'Shaughnessy runs one of America's oldest manufacturing companies, started by Paul Revere himself, a fact that exerts considerable pressure. As he put it: ''What kind of a message are you sending to the people of the country if you abandon America?''
But spend a day with him, and a more complex picture emerges. He wonders sometimes about the less patriotic alternative of relocating production to Asia or closing the factory entirely on the ground that Revere's profit margin here is too thin -- less than $1 million on $450 million in annual revenue. 
''If we simply shut down today,'' Mr. O'Shaughnessy said, ''I could sell the inventory and the machinery, which could be moved elsewhere in the world, and pay off our debts and walk away with $35 million to $40 million.''
What staves off those alternatives are labor concessions and a substantial government subsidy, something he and others in the United States say is increasingly important to fuel a nascent recovery in manufacturing. The labor concessions at Revere, in a contract endorsed by the United Automobile Workers, are much like those unions are giving to other manufacturers. The subsidy comes from New York State, which supplies, at cost, the electric power that Revere uses to produce copper sheets and slabs. Mr. O'Shaughnessy says it accounts for half of Revere's profit.
With such support, the key measure of manufacturing's presence in America is ticking upward. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in April that manufacturing's contribution to the gross domestic product rose in 2011 to 12.2 percent from 11.7 percent in 2010 and 11 percent in 2009. The current share is, of course, far less than in the 1950s, when manufacturing reached 28 percent of the economy, and then went into a long, gradual decline. But for the first time since then, the percentage has risen over a three-year period.
''Basically, manufacturers are realizing that the cost structure for making products in America no longer needs to be as unfavorable as it was,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The evidence is easy to spot. An American company, Element Electronics, for example, has made flat-screen televisions for years at a factory in China but is now expanding in America. It recently opened a factory near Detroit that is producing the first televisions made in the United States by any company in years.
At General Electric, local tax breaks and a concessionary union contract contributed to G.E.'s decision to manufacture its latest electric water heater in Louisville, Ky. -- instead of in China. Similarly, the Otis Elevator Company is moving production to a new factory in Florence, S.C., from a plant in Nogales, Mexico, and Master Lock has switched the manufacture of combination locks back to Milwaukee from China.
At P.A.M.A. Furniture, in Jamestown, N.C., the owning Pennisi family has begun to manufacture upholstered chairs and sofas ''from scratch,'' according to Anthony Pennisi, a vice president.
Until recently, the Pennisis imported chair frames from Italy and Indonesia, and finished them at the family's Jamestown factory. Manufacturing everything here is more expensive, Mr. Pennisi said, and he has asked for government help. ''I think we are a prime example of a small manufacturer producing a Made-in-America product and trying to survive,'' he said.
The thread running through these decisions is an acknowledgment by management and labor that manufacturing needs a little help in the form of local, state and national subsidies for survival in a global economy in which Asian and European producers are routinely subsidized.
''The only manufacturers in America who go without government support are those whose markets are so insignificant that they are not noticed by foreign producers,'' said Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who is a co-chairman of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a lobbying group that seeks to strengthen domestic production.
Apart from subsidies, organized labor's givebacks in recent years have contributed significantly to what manufacturers call ''lean'' practices.
At Revere, ''lean'' means that employment has fallen to 360 from 450 two decades ago. The half-hour lunch break is no longer paid time for the 260 hourly workers. (They earn $19 an hour on average.) Employees pay some of their health insurance premium. And management alters factory routines and tasks without first consulting the union, U.A.W. Local 2367, which for months has turned the other cheek. Partly as a result, the time required to turn a 22,000-pound cake of copper into finished sheets of various thicknesses has been reduced to three days from three weeks.
''The company shows us a newsreel that makes the point that since the year 2000, the United States has lost 56,000 factories and five or six million manufacturing jobs,'' said Tom Slocum, chairman of the U.A.W. local's bargaining committee, ''and the message is that, but for the O'Shaughnessys, the factory here could join the 56,000.''
Despite those lost factories, the United States was the world's largest manufacturer in terms of value added for many years -- until China gradually edged into the lead over the last few years. Value added means the value in dollars that is added when a $100 sheet of copper, for example, is cut and shaped into a $150 roof gutter. By that standard, a fully assembled car is worth more than the value of its numerous parts before assembly. Each factory operation adds value, and the measuring gauge speeds along, reaching $1.8 trillion in the United States in 2011.
In China, where the gauge has been rising faster than in the United States, the value added by manufacturing was about $1.9 trillion last year, according to government and private estimates.
That Chinese milestone is reflected in America's merchandise trade deficit, which has remained stubbornly high, mainly because of the imbalance with China. American multinationals have contributed to the shift, frequently making in Asia what they sell in Asia and, in many cases, in the United States. Revere hasn't participated, though, even as its customers moved their production of copper products like pots and pans, electrical wiring and roof gutters offshore. Those customers shifted to foreign suppliers.
''We have lost 30 percent of our business this way,'' Mr. O'Shaughnessy said. ''We had to shrink our staff to stay alive.''
Given his druthers, he would have the United States step up its own mercantilist practices, which means greater government support. A big one, from a manufacturer's point of view, would be a devaluation of the dollar to lower the cost of exports in foreign currencies.
Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who is a vigorous 69, has ceded management of Revere to a son, Michael, now chief executive. Freed of day-to-day responsibilities, he drove a rented Harley-Davidson last month across the Argentine pampas and the Andes, traveling alone from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso, Chile.
But most of his adventure has been here in Rome, where he became, in the late 1980s, the chief executive of Revere. He was hired after Michael Milken, the takeover king, acquired the company in a hostile leveraged buyout.
Mr. Milken's organization sold several divisions, including the one that made pots and pans, and soon sold control to Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who borrowed $64 million to make the purchase. He closed a second factory, in Massachusetts, where Paul Revere started the company in 1801.
Mr. O'Shaughnessy's boast about the potential windfall from closing the remaining factory here is rooted in the belief that conviction and determination, as much as economics, sustains manufacturing in America.
''As manufacturing moves abroad, mostly to China, could Revere follow? Yes,'' he says. ''Will Revere? Never.'' To minimize the risk that his decision will be reversed after he is gone, he is leaving all his shares, he said, to whichever of his three sons is most likely to keep Revere's production in America.
That son might even someday restore electric power to a huge neon-lighted depiction of Paul Revere on horseback, who, back when the sign was lighted, seemed to gallop across the night sky high above the factory's roof. Mr. O'Shaughnessy cut the power to save money, and Rome, N.Y., lost a distinguishing spectacle -- an animated landmark that drew schoolchildren and tourists and that heralded Rome as a proud manufacturing city.

HEADLINE: A Bag of Hammers

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
''A Bag of Hammers,''Brian Crano's low-budget dramedy and first feature, is certainly sure of itself. Any film tossing comic interludes among its closing credits has to be convinced of their hilarity and of the good will the movie has earned with viewers by then. Perhaps the film's naked traffic in sentiment up to that point made Mr. Crano so bold. Whatever; his confidence was unwarranted. 
Two Los Angeles slackers, Alan (Jake Sandvig) and Ben (Jason Ritter), have made a decent income stealing cars at funerals while posing as valets. (They get the keys, you see, and simply drive off.) Alan's sister, Mel (Rebecca Hall), a sensible coffee shop waitress, is leery of their larcenous pursuits.
But soon these charmers -- they must be charmers, so amused are they by their own banter -- are called to adult responsibilities. An unemployed single mother and renter on their two-bungalow property, Lynette (Carrie Preston), has struggled to find work and neglected her son, Kelsey (Chandler Canterbury). When Lynette commits suicide, Alan and Ben decide to take in Kelsey. But an educator at Kelsey's school (Gabriel Macht) isn't about to let them.
The portraits of beleaguered lower-income people by Ms. Hall and especially Ms. Preston lend the movie its only dramatic traction. (The title comes from a term for the misfortunes life can hand you.)
Mr. Canterbury's character is a Hollywood child archetype: wan and withdrawn, all monosyllables and needy stares. Mr. Sandvig's striving for paternal notes falls short, and when Mr. Ritter, despondent over a falling-out with his pal, tearfully hugs a homeless woman and gives her money, all charitable thoughts toward the movie evaporate.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Brian Crano 1 hour 27 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Chemical Plant Safety

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Risk From Chemical Plants'' (editorial, May 4) uses scare tactics to frighten and confuse readers. Chemical and petrochemical facilities in the United States comply with strict federal regulations and standards to ensure the safety of their employees, operations and surrounding communities. 
Facilities throughout the country maintain a high level of security by working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard to enforce the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program and Marine Transportation Security Act regulations. And they regularly adopt even safer approaches when they preserve product quality and make financial sense.
As private companies operating in the free market, our nation's chemical and petrochemical companies thrive on innovation and ingenuity, and that provides the greatest benefit to their customers and the American people. The federal government should not be dictating engineering practices and advances. Physics and sound engineering practices -- not politics and emotions -- determine how chemical processes must be run.
CHARLES T. DREVNA President, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers Washington, May 4, 2012
To the Editor:
''The Risk From Chemical Plants'' promotes solving a problem that no longer exists with an idea that was rejected long ago.
There are a number of programs already in place that regulate safety and security at chemical facilities. Overlooking this progress, the editorial suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency should create a new program by using the general duty clause in the Clean Air Act.
This is an old idea and a bad one, too. When this was proposed years ago, the Justice Department opposed the idea. The Labor Department believed that it was illegal. Even E.P.A. staff members conceded a host of legal and policy hurdles.
The fact is that sensible federal regulation to control risks at chemical facilities is already in place. The ''clear and present danger'' that may still exist comes from the severe economic impacts that would result from duplicative and unnecessary regulations.

HEADLINE: Chinese Economy Losing Some Of Its Sizzle

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- As China's leaders have been preoccupied with a political struggle leading up to a once-in-a-decade leadership change this autumn, there are increasing signs that the Chinese economy may be running into trouble.
China announced Thursday that growth in imports had unexpectedly come to a screeching halt in April -- rising just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier, compared with expectations for an 11 percent increase. Businesses across the country appeared to lose much of their appetite for products as varied as iron ore and computer chips. 
China has been the largest single contributor to global economic growth in recent years, and a sustained slowdown in its economy could pose problems for many other countries. Particularly exposed are countries that export commodities like iron ore and oil and rely on demand from China's steel mills and ever-growing ranks of car owners.
Exports, a cornerstone of China's economic growth over the last three decades, grew 4.9 percent last month -- half as much as economists had expected. And a slump in new orders over the last month at the Canton Fair, China's main marketplace for exporters and foreign buyers, suggests that overseas shipments by the world's second-biggest economy, after that of the United States, may not recover quickly.
Growth in other sectors appears to be slowing, too, particularly in real estate. Soufun Holdings, a Chinese real estate data provider, released figures Monday showing that residential land sales in the country's 20 largest cities had fallen 92 percent last week from the week before, as declining prices for apartments have left developers short of cash and reluctant to start further projects.
In a series of interviews over the last week, bankers and senior executives from provinces all over China, in a range of light and heavy industries, cited a broad deterioration in business conditions. Two of them said that some tax agencies in smaller cities had been telling companies to inflate their sales and profits to make local economic growth look less weak than it really was, while reassuring the companies that their actual tax bills would be left unchanged.
There are early signs of a credit squeeze, at least among private sector companies. Many seem to be asking their suppliers for more time to pay debts and complaining of cash flow problems. Zhang Jinmei, the sales manager at the Qitele Group, a company that makes playground equipment in the coastal city of Wenzhou, said that local investment and lending pools there were starting to charge higher interest rates for loans, a sign of worries about creditworthiness.
''The business environment is getting tougher and tougher,'' said Tom Zhang, the sales manager at the Hebei Haihao High Pressure Flange and Pipe Fitting Group. ''Competition is very intense to get more business -- our domestic sales are down from last year, though our export sales are more or less stable.''
Some sectors are faring better. Car sales rose 12.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced on Wednesday.
The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Friday morning in Beijing that inflation in consumer prices slowed to 3.4 percent in April from 3.6 percent in March, while producer prices, measured at the factory gate, actually fell 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier. The fading of inflation pressures makes it easier for the government to stimulate the economy without pushing up prices. A clearer signal of China's economic health may emerge later Friday when the National Bureau of Statistics announces April figures for industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
China has noticeably not loosened monetary policy in recent months to mitigate the economic slowdown. The government had been moving toward easing through the winter, lowering cash reserve requirements for banks in November and most recently in February, so that the banks could lend more.
But the government has left the reserve ratio unchanged since then. It has also left regulated interest rates unchanged at the fairly high levels set last July, when the economy was much stronger. Changes in the reserve ratio or interest rates are ultimately decided not by the central bank in China but by the country's political leadership.
The government's inactivity has coincided with the biggest political drama in China in more than a decade: the ouster of Bo Xilai, a leading advocate of renewed government control over the economy and public life. The Communist Party removed him March 15 as the party secretary in Chongqing and on April 10 suspended his membership in the Politburo and the larger Central Committee.
On March 12, three days before Mr. Bo lost his job in Chongqing, the governor of the Chinese central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, strongly hinted that the government was prepared to lower the reserve requirement further, but it has done nothing since to follow up.
''We have a lot of room to adjust the reserve ratio,'' Mr. Zhou said at the time. ''On the other hand, it is necessary to see whether there is a necessity to adjust.''
Stock market investors appeared to be betting Thursday that Chinese leaders would be forced to ease policy in response to the latest trade figures. After early gains, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets dropped sharply in late morning when the export and import statistics were released. But both markets later rebounded, and they closed the day little changed.
GaveKal Dragonomics, a research firm specializing in the Chinese economy, said in a report Thursday that it was ''still true the Chinese leadership's obsession with growth and stability is heightened during transition years. This makes it implausible that the leadership would allow the economy to collapse while they fight over who gets what job.''
The sectors doing best in China these days seem to be connected to state-owned enterprises and local governments, which continue to enjoy preferential access to loans from the state-controlled banking system. Projects like rail construction and low-income housing continue to move ahead.
But Chinese officials have long tracked prices of industrial commodities and activities like electricity consumption for signs of the economy's health, said Andy Xie, an independent economist based in Shanghai. Growth in electricity consumption has been slowing. And while commodity prices have begun to weaken worldwide because of worries about European debt, they have particularly slumped in China in the last few weeks, according to corporate buyers and specialty data tracking services.
One result is a lot of unhappy business executives. ''Our industry sector is facing tough times, and some companies in our sector are struggling,'' said Amanda Wang, the sales manager at Steady Shower Technology, a manufacturer of bathroom fixtures in Ningbo.

HEADLINE: With Metal Prices High, Thieves Don't Seem Picky

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
The high price of oil is not the only effect of commodity inflation hitting the streets of New York. A surge in the value of copper, iron and other metals has fueled a wave of thefts from sidewalks, roadways and rail yards in the last few months.
On Wednesday alone, the New York police arrested three men for stealing hunks of cast iron - grates made to protect tree roots and manhole covers weighing as much as 300 pounds. The arrests followed reports of the disappearance of dozens of the grates and covers across the city and came on top of a continuing spree of thefts of copper wire from utility cables. 
''It's about money,'' said Kevin Rafferty, president of Dublin Scrap Metal in Newark. ''The economy's tough, and people are looking to sell whatever they can find to sell.''
Mr. Rafferty, who said his company would not buy manhole covers or pieces of train rail that people showed up with, said the run-up in the prices of metals could also be driving up thefts. Still, he said, stealing a manhole cover from a city street is a true sign of desperation. Iron is worth only about 15 cents a pound, compared with about $3 a pound for copper, he said.
That disparity helps to explain why utility companies like Consolidated Edison usually have to contend with thefts of copper-filled cables far more often than the pilfering of manhole covers. Last year, Con Ed counted 133 thefts of its cable and just 2 stolen manhole covers.
But that was before Andrew Modica came along, the police say. On Wednesday night, detectives in Brooklyn arrested Mr. Modica, 46, in connection with the thefts of dozens of Con Ed's manhole covers in Brooklyn and Queens.
Inside a stolen Ford pickup truck with stolen Connecticut plates, the police said, they found a hydraulic jack and two J-shape metal hooks that Mr. Modica used to hoist the covers from roadbeds into the truck. He admitted that he had taken more than 15 of the missing covers and sold them for about $30 each to two scrap yards in the city, the police said. To avoid suspicion, Mr. Modica wore a reflective vest like the ones used by Con Ed repair crews, the police said.
The police declined to identify the buyers of the manhole covers.
Mr. Modica, it turns out, had firsthand knowledge of how to remove manhole covers because he had worked for a company that replaced them for Con Ed. That company, Safeway Construction Enterprises in Maspeth, Queens, employed him until late last year, said Shuta Waki, a manager with Safeway. Mr. Waki would not discuss the circumstances under which Mr. Modica left the company.
Mr. Waki said removing manhole covers ''was part of his job.'' But Mr. Modica would have been working with one or two other men to lift the covers. He expressed doubt that Mr. Modica could have taken the covers by himself and was surprised to hear that the police said Mr. Modica had left open manholes that posed hazards to drivers and pedestrians.
Con Ed officials were also dubious that Mr. Modica had worked alone. ''To a lot of people here, it was quite surprising that it was one person who was doing this,'' said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman. He said the company believed Mr. Modica was responsible for the bulk of the missing covers, but ''we're certainly not going to assume that there aren't other people out there who might try to do the same thing.''
Mr. Modica was charged with possession of stolen property, reckless endangerment, petit larceny and criminal impersonation, the police said.
He was the third man arrested on Wednesday for taking molded metal off the streets. Early that morning, a police officer in Midtown Manhattan stopped a van and found three grates that had protected trees on West 48th Street. The driver admitted that he had previously stolen at least a dozen similar grates from the sidewalks along 46th Street between Eighth and 10th Avenues, the police said.
A passenger in the van was wearing a reflective vest that belonged to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although he did not work for that agency, the police said.
Business owners along that stretch of 46th Street, known as Restaurant Row, were so distressed about the absence of the grates and fearful that pedestrians would trip over the unprotected tree pits that the Times Square Alliance had offered a $1,000 reward for help catching the thieves. Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance, said that a witness had provided some information to the police about the thefts but that he did not yet know if the person would receive a reward.
The scrap metal industry has a system for spreading word of the theft of metal items, like the load of used rail spikes and rail plates that disappeared from a New Jersey Transit rail yard in Raritan, last month. But Mr. Rafferty said that even a vigilant metals buyer would have trouble spotting unmarked pieces, like the tree grates, buried in a truckload of junk.
Kevin Lawlor, a spokesman for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade organization in Washington, said, ''We don't like to put the onus on the scrap dealer to make decisions about what's stolen or not stolen.'' Still, Mr. Lawlor said, ''The manhole covers is a unique situation because people should know that everyday citizens don't walk around with a manhole cover.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bank to Pay $202 Million To Settle Suit On Mortgages

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank agreed on Thursday to pay the federal government more than $200 million to settle accusations that it knowingly misled the Department of Housing and Urban Development about the quality of mortgages that later defaulted.
The defaults ultimately cost taxpayers about $368 million. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed against Deutsche in May 2011 by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, along with HUD and the Department of Justice.
The home loans were issued by MortgageIT, a mortgage provider that Deutsche Bank bought in 2007. Under the terms of the settlement, Deutsche Bank admitted it should have known that MortgageIT's practices did not conform to HUD rules after it made the acquisition. The $202 million settlement is a significant victory for the federal Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which was established to investigate the abuses that culminated in the financial crisis of 2008 and early 2009. 
MortgageIT insured the loans under a Federal Housing Administration program called Direct Endorsement Lender despite the fact that they did not qualify under the rules of the program and were not eligible for the insurance, according to the suit. When the loans later soured, the government was obligated to cover the losses.
As a Direct Endorsement Lender, MortgageIT had the authority to provide the F.H.A. insurance on the loans it made, without having to seek prior approval from the housing administration. Because of that extra authority, government officials said, the mortgage provider is supposed to do everything it can to assure the mortgages are being given to creditworthy borrowers who can pay back the money.
''MortgageIT and Deutsche Bank treated F.H.A. insurance as free government money to backstop lending practices that did not follow the rules,'' Mr. Bharara said in a statement. ''Their failure to meet these requirements caused substantial losses to the government -- losses that could have and should have been avoided.''
The HUD inspector general, David A. Montoya, said in a statement that every Direct Endorsement Lender participant was expected ''to adhere to the highest level of integrity and accountability.'' When lenders fall short, he said, ''the end result will be both unpleasant and costly to the offending party.''
In a statement, Deutsche Bank said: ''We are very pleased to have reached this settlement, for which we have already fully reserved, and to put this issue behind us. This marks a significant step in resolving our mortgage-related exposures.''
The company has said previously that the 90 percent of the mortgages that later defaulted were made before Deutsche Bank acquired MortgageIT in 2007. That purchase was part of a larger effort by many Wall Street banks to plunge into the mortgage market, which was then booming, a move that has cost Wall Street billions of dollars since then, both from market losses and legal settlements.
Many of the worst-performing mortgages were so-called subprime loans, but MortgageIT was a specialist in Alt-A mortgages, which were supposed to be slightly safer and thus less likely to default. In fact, the Alt-A category also performed very poorly in the wake of the housing market collapse.
An earlier settlement with Citigroup's Citimortgage unit over similar claims in February totaled $158 million, while a Bank of America settlement for its Countrywide unit the same month equaled $1 billion. Still, given the huge losses racked up by the banking industry and the deep recession that followed the crisis, there have been comparatively few prosecutions of wrongdoing connected to the housing bubble and subsequent bust.

HEADLINE: How Pakistan Lets Terrorism Fester

BYLINE: By HUSAIN HAQQANI. 
Husain Haqqani, a professor at Boston University, was Pakistan's ambassador to the United States from 2008 to 2011.

 BODY:
ON the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death last week, Pakistan was the only Muslim country in which hundreds of demonstrators gathered to show solidarity with the dead terrorist figurehead.
Yet rather than asking tough questions about how Bin Laden had managed to live unmolested in Pakistan for years, the Pakistani Supreme Court instead chose to punish the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, by charging him with contempt for failing to carry out the court's own partisan agenda -- in this case, pressuring the Swiss government to reopen a decades-old corruption investigation of President Asif Ali Zardari. (Never mind that Swiss officials say they are unlikely to revisit the charges.)
In handing down the decision, one justice chose to paraphrase the Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran. He held forth in a long appeal to religious-nationalist sentiment that began with the line, ''Pity the nation that achieves nationhood in the name of a religion but pays little heed to truth, righteousness and accountability, which are the essence of every religion.'' 
That a Supreme Court justice would cite poetry instead of law while sentencing an elected leader on questionable charges reflects Pakistan's deep state of denial about its true national priorities at a time when the country is threatened by religious extremism and terrorism.
Today, Pakistan is polarized between those who envision a modern, pluralist country and those who condone violence against minorities and terrorism in the name of Islam. Many are caught in the middle; they support the pluralist vision but dislike the politicians espousing it.
Meanwhile, an elephant in the room remains. We still don't know who enabled Bin Laden to live freely in Pakistan. Documents found on computers in his compound offer no direct evidence of support from Pakistan's government, army or intelligence services. But even if Bin Laden relied on a private support network, our courts should be focused on identifying, arresting and prosecuting the individuals who helped him. Unfortunately, their priorities seem to lie elsewhere.
In Pakistan, most of the debate about Bin Laden has centered on how and why America violated Pakistan's sovereignty by unilaterally carrying out an operation to kill him. There has been little discussion about whether the presence of the world's most-wanted terrorist in a garrison town filled with army officers was itself a threat to the sovereignty and security of Pakistan.
Pakistanis are right to see themselves as victims of terrorism and to be offended by American unilateralism in dealing with it. Last year alone, 4,447 people were killed in 476 major terrorist attacks. Over the last decade, thousands of soldiers and law enforcement officers have died fighting terrorists -- both homegrown, and those inspired by Al Qaeda's nihilist ideology.
But if anything, the reaction should be to gear up and fight jihadist ideology and those who perpetrate terrorist acts in its name; they remain the gravest threat to Pakistan's stability. Instead, our national discourse has been hijacked by those seeking to deflect attention from militant Islamic extremism.
The national mind-set that condones this sort of extremism was cultivated and encouraged under the military dictatorships of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq from 1977 to 1988 and Gen. Pervez Musharraf from 1999 to 2008. A whole generation of Pakistanis has grown up with textbooks that conflate Pakistani nationalism with Islamist exclusivism.
Anti-Western sentiment and a sense of collective victimhood were cultivated as a substitute for serious debate on social or economic policy. Militant groups were given free rein, originally with American support, to resist the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and later became an instrument of Pakistani regional influence there and in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
Pakistan's return to democracy, after the elections of 2008, offered hope. But the elected government has since been hobbled by domestic political infighting and judicial activism on every issue except extremism and terrorism.
Before Mr. Musharraf was ousted, a populist lawyers' movement successfully challenged his firing of Supreme Court justices. The lawyers' willingness to confront Mr. Musharraf in his last days raised hopes of a new era. But over the last four years, the Court has spent most of its energy trying to dislodge the government by insisting on reopening cases of alleged corruption from the 1990s. During the same period, no significant terrorist leader has been convicted, and many have been set free by judges who overtly sympathize with their ideology.
This has happened because the lawyers' movement split into two factions after Mr. Musharraf's fall: those emphasizing the rule of law and those seeking to use the judiciary as a rival to elected leaders.
Asma Jahangir, who helped lead the lawyers' movement, has become a critic of the courts, accusing them of overstepping their constitutional mandate and falling under the influence of the security establishment. And Aitzaz Ahsan, who represented the Supreme Court's chief justice during the lawyers' showdown with Mr. Musharraf, is now Prime Minister Gilani's lawyer in the contempt-of-court case -- a clear indication of the political realignment that has taken place.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's raucous media, whose hard-won freedom is crucial for the success of democracy, has done little to help generate support for eliminating extremism and fighting terrorism. The Supreme Court, conservative opposition parties and the news media insist that confronting alleged incompetence and corruption in the current government is more important than turning Pakistan away from Islamist radicalism.
While fighting Pakistan's endemic corruption is vital, the media and judiciary have helped redirect attention away from the threat of jihadist ideology by constantly targeting the governing party -- a convenient situation for the intelligence services, which would prefer to keep the spotlight on the civilian government rather than on the militant groups they have historically supported.
Convicting the dozens of terrorists released by Pakistani courts should be a greater priority for the country's judiciary than scoring points against the elected executive branch. And the Pakistani media should be more focused on asking why those deemed terrorists internationally are celebrated as heroes at home.
Until their priorities shift, the empty pronouncements of our leaders against terrorism and the sacrifices of our soldiers in battle with militants will not suffice to change the nation's course.

HEADLINE: As Growth Slows, Doubts on China's State-Driven Model

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Li Bibo and Edy Yin contributed research.

 BODY:
CHONGQING, China -- After the economies of Western nations imploded in late 2008, Chinese leaders began boasting of their nation's supremacy. Talk spread, not only in China but also across the West, of the advantages of the so-called China model -- a vaguely defined combination of authoritarian politics and state-guided capitalism -- that was to be the guiding light for this century.
But now, with the recent political upheavals, and a growing number of influential voices demanding a resurrection of freer economic policies, it appears that the sense of triumphalism was, at best, premature, and perhaps seriously misguided. Chinese leaders are grappling with a range of uncertainties, from the once-a-decade leadership transition this year that has been marred by a seismic political scandal, to a slowdown of growth in an economy in which deeply entrenched state-owned enterprises and their political patrons have hobbled market forces and private entrepreneurship.
''Many economic problems that we face are actually political problems in disguise, such as the nature of the economy, the nature of the ownership system in the country and groups of vested interests,'' said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. ''The problems are so serious that they have to be solved now and can no longer be put off.'' 
On Thursday, China released data that showed its economy was continuing to weaken. Many economists have been urging the government to loosen controls over the financial system, to support lending to private businesses while reining in state-owned enterprises, to allow more movement in exchange rates and interest rates, and to improve social benefits.
Such changes would curb the state's role, lessen corruption and encourage competition. But making them would involve a titanic power struggle. Executives of Chinese conglomerates, army generals, Politburo members, local officials and the ''princeling'' children of Communist Party elders have little incentive to refashion a system that fills their coffers.
Another significant aspect of the China model is the growing security apparatus. Its heavy-handed tactics in pursuit of social stability have been called into question by, among other things, more than 30 self-immolations by disaffected Tibetans and a diplomatic crisis between China and the United States precipitated by the plight of a persecuted dissident, Chen Guangcheng. A well-documented uprising last winter against corrupt officials in the southern village of Wukan ignited a debate about how protests should be addressed: by the sword of the security forces, or through mediation by senior officials.
But it is the scandal over Bo Xilai, until recently a member of the party's elite Politburo, that has most humbled those who previously praised the well-oiled nature of China's political system and its appearance of unity.
Before the charismatic Mr. Bo lost his party chief post in Chongqing, other leaders were already starting to view him as an increasingly intolerable maverick. After arriving in Chongqing in late 2007, Mr. Bo began what was billed as a crackdown on crime, along with a revival of Mao-era singalongs and welfare policies, aimed at generating populist backing and winning political support from the ''new left,'' or hard-core socialists, for his bid to join the top-level Politburo Standing Committee, which is scheduled to turn over this year.
Mr. Bo's bid veered sharply from the traditional route of ascension, which since the era of Deng Xiaoping has been one of back-room patronage and shadowy negotiations among party elders. The problem now in China is that the powers of those elders have diminished with each generation -- the current president and party chief, Hu Jintao, is weaker than his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, who was much weaker than Mr. Deng.
With the dissolution of power, a multitude of factions and alliances are emerging under one-party rule, with no one voice able to impose order.
''China needs a system in place more than ever,'' said Wang Kang, a liberal writer from Chongqing. ''Only a system can guarantee stability.''
Some say that the purge of Mr. Bo was a correction in the political system, and that the system has returned to normal. But many others argue that given the growing incoherence at the top, and the diversity and reach of mass media in China, it is inevitable that more politicians will adopt Mr. Bo's populist methods. Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics, noted that at the annual National People's Congress in March, several rising sixth-generation leaders gave prominent news media interviews, a form of self-promotion that was a break from tradition.
''There are no clear and steadfast rules,'' said Wu Si, chief editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu, a journal of politics and history. ''In this confused state, there is bound to be someone like Bo Xilai who deploys various methods to compete to enter the standing committee.''
Mr. Bo's policies also helped expose another fault line in the China model: the priority placed on economic growth through investment projects carried out by state-owned enterprises, with generous loans from state banks. This is the framework propping up the Chinese economy.
Flush with infrastructure projects, Chongqing, with a population of 31 million, had an economic growth rate of 16.4 percent last year, the highest of any municipality. But the municipal government and local state-owned companies have accumulated $160 billion in debt, according to an estimate by Victor Shih, who studies China's political economy. Many of those loans might never be repaid.
Policy makers pushing for a different model across China, one that relies more on consumer spending and encourages private enterprise, insist that long-stalled structural overhauls must be restarted. Some see an opening in the coming leadership transition. But the biggest hurdle may be the fact that both departing and incoming leaders have close ties to state-owned enterprises, which are keen to preserve the status quo.
The hesitancy over the next step is heightened by China's cooling economy. The growth rate slowed to 8.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in March cut the forecast for the year to 7.5 percent. The property market is deflating. The data released on Thursday showed that domestic demand is weakening and exports are flagging.
China warded off the global financial crisis with a $580 billion stimulus package and a loosening of bank lending. Its leaders could fall back on that government-led, investment-driven approach if the economy cools too much.
One thing keeping them in check, however, is fear of rampant inflation, which could increase social unrest. Discontent among the poor and middle class is a major source of anxiety for Chinese leaders, yet there are no easy solutions to the widening wealth gap, as long as rapid growth is the priority.
The surging number of protests arising from this gap is another stress point in the China model. Officials rely heavily on domestic security forces to quell what they call ''mass incidents,'' which one sociologist, Sun Liping, estimated at 180,000 in 2010. In March, the government announced that it planned to spend $111 billion on domestic security this year, a 12 percent increase over 2011, and $5 billion more than this year's military budget.
During the uprising in Wukan last winter, which began because of what villagers called illegal land seizures by local officials, police units surrounded the village, but backed off after Guangdong Province officials negotiated with the residents. Wang Yang, the provincial party chief, took credit for the peaceful settlement and has proposed that that strategy be more widely adopted, in an implicit criticism of the militant tactics used in ''stability maintenance.''
The weakness of those tactics was exposed once again when Mr. Chen, the activist put under house arrest in 2010, made his nighttime escape from village guards who had beaten him and his wife. Mr. Chen, who is blind, fled to the United States Embassy in Beijing. That such brutality could set off a diplomatic crisis between the world's superpower and its rising rival is as obvious a sign as any of the deep flaws in China's security methods.
''From the few times I've engaged with them,'' Mr. Chen said, ''I know they have the intention of reforming, of slowly initiating the rule of law. But I don't know how soon.''

HEADLINE: Motorcyclist Hopes Fans Follow Him to Nascar

BYLINE: By ADAM HIMMELSBACH

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- Travis Pastrana crawled through the window of his No. 99 Toyota, kissed his wife and flashed his magnetic smile. Even though he had placed 22nd in his Nascar Nationwide Series debut last month, he was pleased that he had not wrecked his car or anyone else's.
Pastrana, an action sports star best known for back flips on motorcycles, relaxed outside his car as Richmond International Raceway quietly called it a night. Drivers retreated to their motor homes, maintenance workers filled trash bags, and the stands emptied. Then Pastrana, 28, heard a small group of people screaming to him from the bleachers.
''I'm going over there,'' he said. 
He hopped a small concrete wall, crossed the track and climbed a flight of stairs to the grandstand, where about 15 of his fans had gathered, including William Evans, 7, of Beaverdam, Va.
William persuaded his parents to buy tickets to this race just so he could see Pastrana. He started riding dirt bikes because of him. He watched the X Games because of him. And now here was Pastrana, impossibly, standing next to him.
Pastrana pulled off one of his racing shoes and handed it to William, who tucked it under his arm.
''You're the best motocross driver ever,'' William said.
Now, Pastrana is also a stock car driver. He will make his second Nationwide start Friday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina.
In addition to Pastrana's bringing an instant jolt of celebrity, Nascar executives are hoping he will bring his charisma, his sponsors and, most important, his legions of impressionable supporters.
''His younger fan base is certainly something we're interested in; it's a demographic we're seeking,'' said Steve Phelps, Nascar's chief marketing officer. He added, ''Relative to our other drivers, he's already creating a big buzz because of the fact that he's unique, because he's different, because he's a trendsetter.''
Drivers from other motor sports, like the open-wheel stars Juan Pablo Montoya, Sam Hornish Jr. and Danica Patrick, entered Nascar in recent years. The motocross star Ricky Carmichael entered his first Nascar race in 2009.
These drivers sparked curiosity and new interest in Nascar, and they remain marquee names internationally. But their on-track success has been inconsistent. Pastrana is the latest outsider to carry the weight of hopes and expectations, and his connection to the sought-after 18-to-34-year-old demographic is undeniable. (Pastrana has more than 385,000 Twitter followers. Jimmie Johnson, the five-time Sprint Cup champion, has about 221,000).
''Someone like Travis who has a huge following, it's great for Nascar if those fans are exposed to the sport and begin following it to see how he's doing,'' said Patrick, who is in her first full season on the Nationwide Series, which is a lower-level of competition than the Sprint Cup Series. ''Hopefully, they become fans of Nascar as well. That helps everybody.''
On a motorcycle, Pastrana is a competitor and a showman. He has won motocross races and freestyle trick competitions, performing stunts with quirky names like Backflip Saran Wrap. He has jumped a motorbike into the Grand Canyon with a parachute and jumped out of a plane without one (he met up with a tandem jumper in the air).
''Travis can get away with just about anything,'' Jeff Gordon said. ''He's one of those cool, funny guys.''
But when Pastrana announced he would join Nascar, his core fan base felt abandoned. Pastrana said many were uninterested in stock car racing.
''I've been criticized a lot by the fans who honestly don't understand how you can come from doing back flips and Nitro Circus to racing in a circle,'' he said.
Pastrana was scheduled to make his Nationwide debut in Indianapolis last July. But just days before that race, he crashed while attempting a 720-degree motorcycle flip in the best trick competition at the X Games. He broke his right foot and right ankle, and his start in Nascar was delayed until this year.
Although much of Pastrana's popularity stems from his disregard for danger, he joined Nascar partly for its comparatively safe working conditions. During his action sports career, he has broken more than 60 bones and had more than 30 operations.
''There's only so long your body can take what Travis has put his body through,'' said Dale Jarrett, a former Nascar driver who is now an ESPN analyst.
Pastrana noticed drivers like Mark Martin, who is still competing at 53. Of course, a long career generally requires success, and pre-existing fame will carry a driver only so far.
''We're going to go until either I'm good enough to win a championship or I'm bad enough that I don't get sponsorship,'' Pastrana said. ''People are asking about how I can bring new fans to races, but no one's going to follow someone that's running around in 30th place.''
This season Pastrana is scheduled for seven Nationwide events, and his performance will be watched closely. After years of booming growth, Nascar was waylaid by the recession. Ticket sales slowed, television ratings dipped, sponsors recoiled and the fan base thinned.
If Pastrana succeeds, it could re-energize the sport and accelerate the expected arrival of motocross stars like Brian Deegan and James Stewart.
For now, Pastrana is still adjusting to the demands of his new job. On the day of his debut in Richmond, he was standing outside his team's hauler wearing pants and a T-shirt when his public-relations representative reminded him it was time to put on his fire suit.
On the track, Pastrana performed well, especially considering Richmond's three-quarter-mile D-shaped oval is considered one of the most grueling on the circuit. A penalty for speeding on pit road probably cost him a better finish, but he did not appear out of place.
''At the beginning of the race, he was being a little tentative, which is really not his nature,'' said Dale Jarrett, a former Nascar driver who is now an ESPN analyst. ''But he wanted to get in as many laps as he could. By the end of the race, he was being really aggressive.''
Pastrana believes he can challenge for top-10 finishes next year and win races the year after that, ultimately securing a spot in the Sprint Cup Series.
''I'm going to figure out how to get to the top of this sport,'' he said.
This time, however, Pastrana's ascent will not be aided by ramps, and there will be no parachute if he stumbles.

HEADLINE: Pro Bono for New Lawyers?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A New Lawyer's Duty'' (editorial, May 2): 
While I applaud lawyers who work for the public good, whether paid or unpaid, Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman's requirement for 50 hours of unpaid legal work as a quid pro quo for admission to the New York State bar in, as you say, ''these hard financial times'' strikes this old-time lawyer as insensitive and ivory tower thinking, to say the least.
Law school graduates today face a more hostile economy, fewer prospects of full-time, paid legal employment and a higher debt burden than at any other time in memory. Take the seemingly imminent demise of the enormous Dewey & LeBoeuf as an example of another lost legal employment opportunity.
As a practical matter, how do new lawyers even find these volunteer opportunities? And really, how well do you suppose inexperienced new lawyers help the indigent? All parties deserve much better.

HEADLINE: Maternity Ward Swag

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MITCHELL ARMSTRONG. 
Elizabeth Mitchell Armstrong is an associate professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton.

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
FLOWERS will be arriving on moms' doorsteps this Sunday; cards and homemade presents will be on their breakfast trays. But the newest mothers, in hospitals across the country, will receive a gift that does more harm than good: free starter packs of infant formula.
Breast-feeding offers numerous benefits to babies, including protection against childhood obesity, diabetes, some respiratory and ear infections and sudden infant death syndrome. Mothers who breast-feed have lower risks of breast and ovarian cancer. Yet although three out of four mothers in the United States breast-feed their newborns, fewer than half are still doing so by the time their babies are 6 months old. 
The support of hospitals is crucial to getting more women to begin breast-feeding and to do it longer. And yet many hospitals hand out free formula samples, which, according to a 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office, tend to reduce breast-feeding rates among the women who receive them. It's easy to understand why the hospitals continue to do so: in exchange for giving out samples, formula manufacturers provide hospitals' nurseries and neonatal intensive care units with much needed free supplies like bottles, nipples, pacifiers, sterile water and more formula.
But the practice is opposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, among others. Doctors can recommend breast-feeding all they like; when hospitals send new mothers home with a commercial product that often bears scientific claims on the label about digestion and brain development, it sends a very different message. (Breast milk is better, but it's a rare breast that sports such a label.) Regardless of the medical evidence, the ''science'' behind formula -- not to mention the convenience -- can be difficult for mothers to resist.
The truth is that for many women in the United States, where paid maternity leave and workplace support for pumping are rare, and where breast-feeding in public is stigmatized, formula is the easier choice. Many don't have the option to breast-feed as long or as much as they would like. When hospitals provide formula starter packs, they encourage women to give up on breast-feeding and switch to formula more quickly. Instead, hospitals should help women get breast-feeding off to a good start by adapting baby-friendly policies like helping mothers initiate breast-feeding after birth, allowing mothers and babies to stay in the same room and, most important, ensuring that infant-feeding decisions are free of commercial influence.
Distributing free formula in the hospital is not about empowering women, helping them make informed choices or providing them with needed resources in tough economic times -- all arguments made by supporters of the free samples. Companies provide them for the same reason they distribute swag to celebrities: it drives sales.
The infant formula market is big and growing; last month, Nestle announced that it would buy Pfizer's infant nutrition division for almost $12 billion. Even as hospitals try to reduce the influence of industry by prohibiting pharmaceutical companies from distributing gifts and free lunches to doctors and medical students, they continue to allow these wealthy and powerful manufacturers to promote their goods in maternity wards.
Some hospitals are beginning to push back. Sixteen percent of birthing hospitals now refuse to hand out free samples. Massachusetts nearly banned the practice in its hospitals at the end of 2005, but at the request of Mitt Romney, then the governor, the state's Public Health Council reversed the decision. Last fall, Rhode Island became the first state to end the practice. And on Wednesday, the New York City health department began encouraging hospitals to stop the handouts. More should follow suit.
This Mother's Day, we should remember that birth is a time to celebrate new life, not a time to corner market share. The true gift to new mothers would be to allow them to return home empty-handed, bearing only their babies and their own best intentions.

HEADLINE: Banks Suffer After-Hours On Word of Chase Losses

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stock index futures fell sharply on Thursday evening after JPMorgan Chase stunned investors with news that its chief investment office had incurred ''significant mark-to-market losses'' that it said could ''easily get worse.'' 
JPMorgan closed up 0.1 percent to $40.74 in regular trading but fell sharply after hours, dragging down shares across the entire banking sector. Its executives held a rare conference call with analysts Thursday at which the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said ''egregious'' mistakes had been made.
The news from JPMorgan comes at a difficult juncture for the stock market as investors wrestle with heightened concerns about Europe's debt crisis and signs are emerging that the economic recovery in the United States may be starting to slow.
''When there's uncertainty, investors' first reaction is to sell,'' said Michael Sheldon, the chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Conn. ''This is not the kind of news you expect from a high-quality management team and a well-run bank.''
If there is nothing to reassure investors before the start of trading on Friday, the weakness is likely to spill over into the cash market.
Shares of JPMorgan's peers fell sharply after hours on the news. At one point, Bank of America stock fell 2.9 percent to $7.48 and Goldman Sachs dropped 2.5 percent to $103.65, while Citigroup lost 3.9 percent to $29.45.
The chief investment office is the arm of the bank that JPMorgan has said it uses to make broad bets to hedge its portfolios of individual holdings, like loans to speculative-grade companies. The news about the losses came after a lackluster day for stocks. The Dow and the S.& P. 500 eked out a modest gain as investors had dipped back into the market after a weak stretch, but a disappointing outlook from Cisco Systems capped gains.
Cisco Systems lost 10.5 percent to $16.81, its biggest percentage drop since February 2011, making it the heaviest drag on the market. The company forecast profits below Wall Street's estimates, sparking concerns about technology spending.
On the plus side, News Corporation rose after its profit beat expectations late Wednesday and it announced a $5 billion stock buyback. Its stock climbed 4.9 percent to $20.32. In a positive development overseas, euro zone officials said the bloc's countries are prepared to keep financing Greece until the country forms a new government.
In regular trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.98 points, or 0.16 percent, to 12,855.04. The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 3.41 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,357.99. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.07 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,933.64.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 98 28/32, and the yield rose to 1.87 percent from 1.86 percent late Wednesday.
The latest uncertainty surrounding Greece and the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis helped spark a drop in the S.&. P. 500 in five of the last seven sessions, sending the benchmark index down 4 percent. While the region's difficulties persisted with the political gridlock in Greece, investors used the market's declines as a buying opportunity.

HEADLINE: Dip in Jobless Claims Eases Worries Over Hiring

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans submitting new applications for jobless benefits edged down last week, easing concerns that the labor market was deteriorating after surprisingly weak employment growth in April. 
Another report on Thursday showed that the nation's trade deficit widened in March, with exports surging to a record high and a rise in imports highlighting the economy's firming underlying demand.
Together, the reports indicated the economy remained on a moderate growth path, despite the softer jobs growth and signs that the service sector slowed in April.
''The slowdown we have seen in economic activity and employment growth during the past two months may be in the rearview mirror,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior macrostrategist at TD Securities.
New claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 1,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 367,000, the Labor Department said. Economists who had expected claims to rise to 369,000 said the decline suggested seasonal distortions that had led to a spike in applications last month were probably over.
The four-week moving average for new claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell by 5,250, to 379,000.
Separately, the trade gap widened 14.1 percent to $51.8 billion in March, the biggest jump in nearly a year, as the surge in imports swamped a rise in exports.
Imports grew 5.2 percent, the biggest gain since January. That jump was consistent with the rise in consumer spending during the first quarter. Exports had another good month, rising 2.9 percent, suggesting the global economy had not slowed as much as some had feared.
''With imports for everything surging, it is hard to argue that the economy is softening,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.
While a widening trade deficit is a drag on gross domestic product, the details of the trade report were broadly in line with the government's assumptions when it estimated G.D.P. last month.
Still, the government's gauge of first-quarter G.D.P. growth is expected to be lowered to an annual pace of about 1.9 percent, from 2.2 percent, because of a smaller-than-expected rise in wholesale inventories in March that was reported on Wednesday.
Following on the heels of April's sluggish employment gains, the claims data calmed fears the labor market was stagnating. Companies added 115,000 new jobs to their payrolls in April, the fewest in six months, the government said on Friday.
Most economists have viewed the pullback in job creation as a result of stronger activity during the unusually warm winter and believe the underlying pace of payroll growth is about 175,000 a month, its average for the last three months.
Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James, said the jobless claims figures had ''simmered down after the noises we had earlier.''
''This shows we have moderate job growth,'' he added.
Other data showed no sign of inflation pressures, with the retreat of crude oil prices pushing down the cost of imported goods in April by the most in 10 months.
That should help lower the cost of living for many households and support economic growth.
With external demand, particularly in Europe, and oil prices having eased, ''import price pressures are likely to remain subdued in the coming months,'' said Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays.

HEADLINE: Festivals Are the Newest Thing for New Music

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
It is springtime in New York, and festivalitis has struck again.
A fistful of festivals dedicated to new music have just finished, are happening now or are coming up. Two take place this weekend: the Queens New Music Festival in Long Island City and Look & Listen at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery in Chelsea.
The traditional classical-music festival circuit is vast, including famous brand names like Mostly Mozart, Salzburg, Tanglewood and Spoleto. Pop has its extravaganzas, like Coachella, Bonnaroo, South by Southwest and Lollapalooza.
In recent years the syndrome has grown acute in the world of new music, an ill-defined genre with roots in the classical avant-garde and tints of pop, rock and jazz. In this world they are called festivals, but closer examination shows the term to be rubber-band stretchy. 
Is geography the operative principle? One festival, the Queens series, focuses on a sole neglected borough, while another, MATA -- which took place last month -- promotes composers from nine countries. A third, the Tribeca New Music Festival, doesn't even appear in TriBeCa.
How about time frame? The Tribeca fest spreads six concerts in three locales over two months, while Look & Listen, which specializes in mixing visual arts with music, will present three concerts on three consecutive nights, starting Saturday.
Does there need to be a purpose? The sprawling River to River Festival, of which new music is only a part, was founded to help revive downtown after the Sept. 11 attacks but has become an established supplier of summertime culture for the area's growing number of residents, employees and visitors.
So why call them festivals?
''A festival is a way to raise a flag and say, 'Come see this,' and doesn't depend on any single artist or name recognition or audience,'' said Sam Miller, president of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, which is organizing River to River. A festival also is as much about ''the intersection between the artist and the place,'' he said.
Amy Frawley, the president of Look & Listen, said festivals need to provide a ''particular window'' into a subject, like her festival's idea of performing works of music surrounded by works of visual art and making connections between them.
May is especially attractive for festival feasting, organizers said. The regular concert season is waning, and there is more room in publications for reviews. There are also more open nights for booking. Musicians and audience members -- especially music school students, who form a large corps of new-music fans -- have not left yet for the summer and for summer festivals.
Underlying the growth of new-music festivals is the genre's increasing popularity. ''This is a great time to be a composer in new music,'' said Preston Stahly, the artistic and executive director of the Tribeca festival. ''It's totally reconnected with the public.''
The Tribeca event had its roots in performances in 1999 at the Flea Theater in TriBeCa and became a festival in 2001. As the performance series became established, public relations advisers suggested calling it a festival, Mr. Stahly said. This season's edition began on April 11 and runs through June 4. It includes six concerts: two at Merkin Concert Hall, two at the Cell in Chelsea and two at Roulette in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
Mr. Stahly said he moved out of TriBeCa because the festival far outgrew the Flea, with its 80-seat capacity. Its next show is next Friday, when the avant-garde composer and violinist Ana Milosavljevic performs at the Cell.
The Queens New Music Festival was born in part from selfish reasons, said Allen Schulz, its organizer. He is a founder and president of Random Access Music, a collective of composers who banded together to pool contacts with musicians and to increase performances of their works.
A festival helps with those goals, Mr. Schulz said. He added that he helped start the festival because of a ''chip on his shoulder'' that comes from having lived in Queens for more than 20 years yet never hearing his music there.
''We all travel into Manhattan or down to Brooklyn to have our pieces played, and it's really rare to have concerts in Queens,'' he said. ''It's really sad.''
Mr. Schulz and his fellow composers built the festival around a concert of their music performed by Cadillac Moon Ensemble, which was available only in May. (That concert took place on Thursday night.) The rest of the festival consists of eight concerts, programmed by Random Access Music from 45 submissions by different performers. It will run from Friday through Sunday at the Secret Theater in Long Island City.
The budget for the Queens fest is a meager $4,000, Mr. Schulz said, with the performers earning half of the box office. Look & Listen and the Tribeca festival have budgets of about $50,000. The budget for River to River, which has establishment backers like American Express, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Downtown Alliance, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and local businesses like Century 21 and Moody's, looms over those amounts, at $2 million.
That budget's size reflects the prominence of some its performers. They include contemporary-music luminaries like the Philip Glass Ensemble, Bang on a Can and Alarm Will Sound, as well as Eddie Palmieri, George Clinton and the Trisha Brown Dance Company. The program includes the first performance of a Nico Muhly piece and an Alarm Will Sound performance of ''Song Books'' by John Cage.
River to River runs from June 17 to July 15. Since the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, a major player in supporting downtown contemporary art, took it over last year, the time frame for scores of presentations has been condensed from about three months to one, and site-specific performances have been emphasized.
''Artists can't be stopped,'' Mr. Miller said. ''They're making incredible work in New York City.''
Musical Offerings This Weekend: LOOK & LISTEN: Saturday through Monday at Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, second floor, Greenwich Village; (718) 622-3005, lookandlisten.org; $15; $10 for students and seniors; $35 for an all-festival pass.; THE QUEENS NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL: continues through Sunday at the Secret Theater, Studio 104, 44-02 23rd Street, Long Island City; queensnewmusicfestival.org; $15; $30 for a one-day pass (Saturday or Sunday); $50 for an all-festival pass.

HEADLINE: Dispute Between China and Philippines Over Island Becomes More Heated

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China escalated its quarrel with the Philippines over an island in the South China Sea on Thursday, halting Philippine bananas at customs for longer inspections and starting an official media campaign that suggested that any claims on the island represented an infringement of Chinese sovereignty.
So far, China has not brought the United States into this renewed round of tension with the Philippines, but in the past few weeks the Chinese have said that the Philippines was daring to challenge China around an island in the South China Sea because of its alliance with Washington. 
China and the Philippines have competing claims on the island, known as Huangyan Island by the Chinese and Panatag Shoal by the Philippines.
The South China Sea has become a major testing ground of China's foreign policy and its growing maritime power, even as the top Communist Party leadership is preoccupied by a power struggle before the 18th Party Congress to be held this fall. Some Western analysts have suggested that Beijing's increasing belligerence with the Philippines is aimed at shoring up domestic public opinion during a delicate transition period by using the issue of sovereignty as a popular rallying point.
The People's Liberation Army Daily, the newspaper of the army, ran a tough editorial on Wednesday saying that China would not stand for anyone's snatching the sovereignty of Huangyan Island. ''Not only the Chinese government will not agree, neither will the Chinese people, and the Chinese Army will disagree even more,'' the editorial said.
At the Foreign Ministry, a spokesman, Hong Lei, said at the regular briefing Thursday that the Philippines should stop escalating tensions and warned that Manila must take responsibility for the dispute over the island.
A new round in the longstanding quarrel began earlier in the week when Fu Ying, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told the chief Filipino diplomat in Beijing that Manila was ''severely damaging the atmosphere of the bilateral relations between China and the Philippines.''
An account of the meeting between the Chinese official, Ms. Fu, and the charge d'affaires of the Philippine Embassy in Beijing, Alex Chua, appeared prominently in the Chinese press.
Ms. Fu was quoted as urging the Philippines to withdraw all its vessels from the island waters and to stop operations against Chinese fishing boats and Chinese law enforcement vessels.
At sea, the dispute flared in early April when the Philippines said one of its warships had found eight Chinese fishing vessels near the disputed island. Philippine Navy personnel boarded the Chinese vessels, where the Filipinos claimed they found large quantities of illegal coral and fish. Chinese surveillance ships arrived, preventing the arrest of the Chinese fishermen, the Philippines said at the time.
Soon afterward, the United States held annual maritime exercises with the Philippines, exacerbating China's arguments that Manila was acting with the support of its American ally.
The South China Sea has taken on a new importance for China in the past several years as a promising source of oil and gas close to home.
A recent report on China's involvement in the South China Sea by the International Crisis Group, a nongovernmental research organization that focuses on conflict resolution, noted that much of the attention on the sea stemmed not only from the issue of sovereignty but also ''the region's abundant natural resources and strategic location.''
The uncertainty of China's legal claims and attempts to enforce sovereignty in areas that were far from what was reasonably considered to be part of China's exclusive economic zone put China at odds with other claimants, including Vietnam and the Philippines, the report said.
On Wednesday, China's largest offshore oil producer, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, began drilling a deep-sea well in an area about 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong. The drilling was not believed to be in hotly disputed waters. But the company announcement that it would drill for 56 days and was optimistic about finding oil was heralded in the Chinese press.
The drilling operation is using the first deep-sea drilling platform developed by its own engineers.
The extension of the dispute to banana imports came Thursday when a document by the Chinese government agency in charge of quarantining questionable food imports was made public on a Chinese Web site, saying that 1,200 containers of bananas from the Philippines had been held at various ports on the grounds of ''quarantine concerns.'' The quarantine agency urged the local authorities to increase examinations for harmful organisms, the official Xinhua news agency said.
In what appeared to be another punitive economic action against the Philippines, the China International Travel Service, a large government-run travel agency, said it was postponing trips to the Philippines on grounds of safety. The Chinese Embassy in Manila warned Chinese citizens to be especially vigilant Friday when it said anti-Chinese rallies were planned in the Philippines.

HEADLINE: Germany Signals It Will Permit Small Steps to Promote Growth in Europe

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and JACK EWING

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The outlines of a potential compromise in Europe's battle between deficit-cutting austerity and policies to promote growth have begun to take shape. The question is whether the kind of cautious measures palatable to Germany, austerity's champion, will do enough to combat the Continent's imbalances and do it soon enough to put its weaker countries on more solid economic footing.
In typical German fashion, the steps under discussion are incremental and spread across a range of policy areas so as not to raise the ire of German voters. Germany's rigid central bank has signaled a willingness to tolerate slightly higher inflation, while the government has indicated its openness to modest but real wage growth in Germany. 
Most important for the stricken economies, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, may be prepared to accept a longer timetable for curtailing budget deficits for countries like Spain that are reeling from recession. For Ms. Merkel, the most important prize is ratification of the fiscal compact, signed in March by the leaders of 25 of the 27 European Union countries, to control deficits in the long run.
Ever since the victory of Francois Hollande in the French presidential election on Sunday, the debate in Europe has shifted, with attention focusing on Ms. Merkel's growing isolation over austerity and whether she would yield to calls for stimulus spending to promote short-term economic growth.
The recognition seems to be dawning even here that forcing heavily indebted countries to cut spending too quickly and deeply can be counterproductive. ''The mood appears to be shifting in Germany,'' said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. ''Even conservative economists are beginning to question whether this austerity is too brutal at the moment.''
Despite marked differences in tone, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande may not be so far apart in substance, said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consultancy in New York. Germany may ultimately accept minor adjustments to Greece's aid program if a viable government emerges, Mr. Rahman said.
''This is Germany's way of signaling both to Hollande and the Greek political elite it is willing to be constructive to keep the system together,'' he said.
German officials have been adamant in saying the bailout terms would not be renegotiated with Greece. The sharp reduction in public spending in the teeth of a recession has sent Greek unemployment to over 20 percent and, in Sunday's elections, brought radical parties on the right and left into Parliament.
Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble repeated Germany's mantra that Greece had to stand by its commitments, but this time he added that Berlin could tolerate a slightly higher inflation rate.
Germany has traditionally found inflation ''in the corridor between 2 and 3 percent'' acceptable, Mr. Schauble said, even though the European Central Bank's official target is about 2 percent. Mr. Schauble was echoing a statement to the German Parliament the day before by the German Bundesbank, normally a bastion of price stability, that higher inflation rates in Germany were acceptable as long as the euro zone average remained on target.
The Bundesbank said the country might have inflation above the euro zone average as other countries regained competitiveness. A more flexible line by the powerful German bank, after which the European Central Bank was modeled, would create space for the E.C.B. to cut interest rates further or take other steps to encourage growth.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Schauble said higher wages for German workers could also help combat imbalances in the euro zone, where years of wage discipline have made German companies far more competitive than those in many of Germany's neighbors. His statement coincided with warning strikes across Germany by IG Metall, a powerful union, which is pushing for higher wages for workers in the automobile, steel and electronics industries.
If prices and wages rise in Germany, it will be easier for countries like Spain, Italy and Greece to compete.
Other measures under consideration include increasing financing for the European Investment Bank as well as helping struggling countries tap unspent resources in existing European Union funds. But these proposals would offset just a tiny fraction of the cuts in public outlays pursued by countries trying to rein in their debt.
While her subordinates were talking of compromise, Ms. Merkel maintained her tough line before a domestic audience with little sympathy for Europe's laggards, particularly Greece. Germans will vote in an important election on Sunday in North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's most populous state.
Speaking to Parliament on Thursday, Ms. Merkel rejected proposals to allow more deficit spending in the name of growth. She said ''growth through debt,'' pumping up government spending to stimulate growth, would ''send us back to the beginning of the crisis.''
At the Group of 8 summit meeting next week at Camp David, Ms. Merkel is sure to face pressure from allies -- in particular the United States -- to loosen the purse strings and encourage growth. But in Thursday's address, she rejected ''wonder weapons'' like issuing joint European debt and warned that the Continent faced a long slog.
Mr. Dullien of the European Council on Foreign Relations said deficit spending to stimulate the economy and delaying spending cuts were not the same thing in the eyes of voters here. ''You can sell that much more easily to the German public,'' he said of delays in cuts. ''They are trying to do what's politically palatable to ease the burden and allow more room for growth.''
German policy makers have played down disagreements with Mr. Hollande since his victory on Sunday, pointing to the long and successful cooperation between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a conservative, and President Francois Mitterrand, a socialist. Chancellor Merkel spent her first term combating the financial crisis with a Social Democrat, Peer Steinbruck, as finance minister.
The fiscal compact remains the most important prize for Ms. Merkel, and she needs the Social Democrats' help in Parliament to pass it. She has proved adept at shifting with the circumstances to get what she wants, to the frustration of her opponents.
Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats, said Wednesday that Ms. Merkel ''will make the shift'' toward more growth policies, the German news agency dpa reported. ''She'll even explain that it was her idea.''

HEADLINE: House Approves $310 Billion in Cuts, but Passage in the Senate Is Very Unlikely

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House approved sweeping legislation on Thursday to cut $310 billion from the deficit over the next decade -- much of it from programs for the poor -- and shift some of that savings to the Pentagon to stave off automatic military spending cuts scheduled for next year.
The legislation has no chance of passing the Senate or of becoming law. The White House issued a stern veto threat, saying the bill would ''fail the test of fairness and shared responsibility.'' 
But the legislation's prescriptions and priorities could define the 2012 Congressional elections -- and are likely to affect the race for the White House.
Republicans framed the fight as a test of seriousness, saying their party was the only one willing to make the difficult choices necessary to tame the deficit. President Obama's polices are ''not working'' and need to be changed, said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman.
''We need to grow the economy,'' he said. ''We're leading.''
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stopped short of endorsing the bill, but thrust it into the campaign debate.
''President Obama is trying to force $500 billion in additional defense budget cuts that his own defense secretary has called 'devastating' to our national security,'' said a Romney campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul. ''The president should take the lead in identifying reductions elsewhere in the budget to avoid these cuts, not threaten to veto responsible efforts to do so.''
Democrats said Republicans had become captives to a pledge never to raise taxes, foisting on Congress a draconian plan that ''asks more from those who have less and less from those who have more,'' as Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, put it.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the Budget Committee's ranking Democrat, said: ''If you say from the beginning you're not going to ask people making a million dollars a year to help do a little more to reduce our common deficit, if you say you're not going to ask companies that have these tax loopholes that actually incentivize them to ship jobs overseas to pay a little bit more, what do you do? Your budget has to whack everyone else.''
The bill's political sensitivity came through in the 218-to-199 vote. Democrats were united in their opposition. Sixteen Republicans sided with the Democrats, and one Republican voted present.
''I voted my conscience, and I voted my district,'' said Representative Mike G. Fitzpatrick, a Republican from suburban Philadelphia, who voted no.
The legislation contained a few of the details needed to fill in the broad strokes of the House Republican budget that passed in March. That budget instructed six committees to find at least $261 billion in domestic savings to avoid $55 billion in automatic Pentagon cuts scheduled to hit Jan. 1 under last year's agreement to raise the federal debt limit.
To do that, the committees cut food stamps, children's health insurance and Medicaid, eliminated the Social Services Block Grant to state and local governments (which pay for Meals on Wheels, child abuse prevention and other programs) and eliminated a new fund intended to help the government liquidate failed financial giants.
Of the savings, $23.5 billion came from Medicaid and children's health care; $4.2 billion from hospitals that serve the poor and uninsured; and $33.7 billion from supplemental nutrition assistance. In all, about a quarter of the cuts would come directly from programs that benefit the poor.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that more than 20 million children would face reduced food and nutrition support, almost 300,000 would be knocked off the federal school lunch program and at least 300,000 would lose access to the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
But Republicans said such numbers were misleading. For instance, many of those knocked off the food stamp rolls qualify only through an obscure rule called ''categorical eligibility,'' which automatically provides access if a family qualifies for any other federal assistance.
''That's how lottery winners get food stamps,'' said Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
Illegal immigrants would be knocked off the rolls of families who receive child tax-credit checks because applicants for the first time would have to produce a Social Security number.
Both sides agree that the broad, across-the-board cuts scheduled for defense and nondefense programs next year are unwise. At stake, said Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, is ''saving our men and women in uniform from holding wooden rifles.''
Republicans in the Senate will try next week to force the issue by using parliamentary rules to bring up budget plans that Senate Democrats refuse to produce. That exercise in part is intended to embarrass the president by bringing up his budget, which faces near-unanimous defeat.
But it will also put senators on record as being for or against Mr. Ryan's budget, which has become a centerpiece of many House campaigns and is under attack by Democrats for its sweeping Medicare proposals.

HEADLINE: Bullying Story Spurs Apology From Romney

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
The day after President Obama endorsed gay marriage, Mitt Romney found himself responding to allegations that as a teenager he harassed a prep school classmate who later came out as gay.
The account put Mr. Romney, who has struggled on the campaign trail to cast off his rivals' image of him as privileged and insensitive, on the defensive about events nearly 50 years ago.
The episode, reported by The Washington Post, occurred at Cranbrook, a private school that Mr. Romney, the son of an automobile executive-turned-governor, attended in Michigan. Mr. Romney returned from spring break in his senior year to find that John Lauber, a quiet, offbeat type, had bleached his hair blond. 
Mr. Romney, brandishing a pair of scissors, led other boys on a hunt for Mr. Lauber, teasing him and holding him down while Mr. Romney snipped off his long locks.
''As to pranks that were played back then, I don't remember them all, but again, high school days, if I did stupid things, why, I'm afraid I've got to say sorry for it,'' Mr. Romney, 65, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a Fox News Radio interview on Thursday. He said he also had no reason to believe ''the fellow was homosexual,'' which was ''the furthest thing from my mind back in the 1960s.''
Phillip Maxwell, a lawyer in Michigan, who participated in the episode, recalled it in an interview on Thursday. ''It started out as ribbing, sort of a pointed ribbing about his hair, but it very quickly became an assault, and he was taken down to the ground, pinned,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''It all happened very quickly -- it was like a pack of dogs.''
Mr. Lauber is no longer alive, but several classmates confirmed the account. Others, in interviews on Thursday, said that they were surprised by the accusations, and that they had never known Mr. Romney to act in a vicious or cruel manner.
''One of the last words I would ever use to describe Mitt would be bully,'' said John French, a Cranbrook classmate. ''If you've ever been around guys in a boys' school, you kid each other and pull little pranks on things, what you might call sophomoric humor, but I really, honestly, do not remember anything being malicious.''
Published against the backdrop of Mr. Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage and Tuesday's North Carolina vote to ban it, the Cranbrook story was also a measure of how much social attitudes have shifted since Mr. Romney's youth. Even at his otherwise-strict school, pranks were tolerated with boys-will-be-boys indulgence, and the term ''bullying'' was decades away from being a subject for assemblies and school psychologists.
Reached for comment, Mr. Lauber's family said in a statement that they were ''aggrieved that John would be used to further a political agenda.''
All day Thursday, the Cranbrook account set off a debate: Was this a sole episode of youthful poor judgment by Mr. Romney or a larger statement about his character? Presidential elections are sometimes described as high school popularity contests on a national level, and the Romney campaign clearly was worried that the episode could define Mr. Romney as a familiar yearbook character: the rich kid with a mean streak.
Some friends and associates of Mr. Romney, including several who are gay, said they had a hard time reconciling the seemingly insensitive younger man with the tolerant, considerate one they have known as an adult.
In Massachusetts, the political director of Mr. Romney's campaign for governor was openly gay, as was his secretary of transportation. Jonathan Spampinato, the former political director, described their relationship as warm and easy. Mr. Romney was quick to acknowledge his contributions, he said, and wrote recommendations for him for graduate school when the campaign was finished.
''I have no idea what he was like as an 18-year-old, but that is not the Mitt Romney I worked for,'' Mr. Spampinato said, referring to the account published by The Post.
When Rich Tafel, the founder of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group for gay men and lesbians, met with Mr. Romney during his 1994 Senate campaign, he found the candidate entirely pragmatic.
''He was like, O.K., I have gay people in my company -- what do I need to do to get gay people to support me?'' Mr. Tafel said in an interview. Mr. Romney committed one small faux pas, questioning whether gay men would make good Boy Scout leaders, he said. (The implication was that pedophilia could be an issue, Mr. Tafel said.) But ''in 1994, everyone was offending me with those kinds of comments,'' he said.
For months, the Romney campaign has been trying to turn away from questions about the candidate's character and focus on his proposals to improve the economy. On Thursday, his aides struggled to deal with the account, first telling The Washington Post that Mr. Romney had no recollection of it. Mr. Maxwell, however, said he was skeptical that Mr. Romney did not remember something that had haunted all of the other men involved, even years later.
''I would think this would be seared in his memory,'' said Mr. Maxwell, who identified himself as an independent who tends to vote Democratic. ''Certainly for the other people that were involved, nobody has forgotten.''
As the day went on, campaign aides were e-mailing reporters with quotations from classmates with more positive recollections.
And Mr. Romney's response shifted from a do-not-remember to a vague apology for any high school pranks taken too far, and efforts to deal with any damage.
''There's no question that I did some stupid things in high school, and obviously, if I hurt anyone by virtue of that, I would be very sorry for it and apologize for it,'' he told Fox News's Neil Cavuto.

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign Pushes the Issue Of Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JEFF ZELENY; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Jeff Zeleny from Omaha. Reporting was contributed by Mark Leibovich, Michael D. Shear and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington, Jackie Calmes from Seattle, Jeremy Peters and Michael Barbaro from New York, and Nicholas Confessore from Las Vegas.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. apologized to President Obama for hastening him into an endorsement of same-sex marriage, several people briefed on the exchange said Thursday, even as the White House sought to capitalize in the campaign on Mr. Obama's long-awaited expression of support.
In an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama on Wednesday, hours before the president confirmed his own support, Mr. Biden expressed regret for a statement endorsing same-sex marriage that went considerably further than the president's views on the matter and scrambled the White House's calculation for confronting the charged social issue.
As the president traveled to the West Coast on Thursday, where in Seattle he said Americans should have the chance to succeed ''no matter who you love,'' his presumptive challenger, Mitt Romney, and Republican leaders in Congress, tried, with limited success, to steer the focus of the presidential campaign back to the nation's sluggish economy. 
When Mr. Romney addressed hundreds of donors and other supporters at a pair of campaign stops in Nebraska, one of the nation's most reliable Republican states, he steered clear of the topic of same-sex marriage, underscoring Republican caution over the shifting politics of the gay marriage debate. On Capitol Hill, Speaker John A. Boehner deflected questions about same-sex marriage, declaring: ''The president can talk about it all he wants. I'm going to stay focused on what the American people want us to focus on, and that's jobs.''
Many conservative advocacy groups displayed no such reticence to wade into the debate. These groups, which will play major roles in trying to motivate voters to the polls, see an opportunity to drive a wedge between Mr. Obama and religious voters, a group he made significant inroads with in 2008.
''Just when you thought the conservative movement couldn't be any more energized against President Obama, he gives us another gift,'' said David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. ''Add it to the list of atrocities.''
The Obama campaign saw an opening to galvanize its backers as well. It released a new Web video that features Mr. Romney declaring his opposition to same-sex marriage and to some legal benefits for gay couples. Titled ''Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality,'' the video accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to ''deny rights'' and notes that ''even President Bush supported civil unions.''
While Mr. Obama only alluded to same-sex marriage in his initial appearances in Seattle, he had evidently struck a chord with some residents there. ''Thank You! Mr. President for standing up for my Mommys!'' read a hand-written sign held by a woman with an infant as Mr. Obama's motorcade passed en route to a fund-raiser.
Still, the internal White House tension over Mr. Biden's comments threatened to distract from the presidential endorsement that was seen as overdue in some circles of the gay and Democratic communities.
In an interview with ABC News that aired Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said the vice president had gotten ''a little bit over his skis.'' But he said that he had done so ''out of generosity of spirit.'' And in their Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, the president told Mr. Biden, ''I understand you were speaking from the heart,'' according to a person briefed on the exchange.
While the president bears Mr. Biden no ill will, several officials said, the episode enraged Mr. Obama's senior political advisers and complicated the White House's efforts to reap political dividends from the president's declaration through a campaign e-mail, a video and a three-state fund-raising swing by Mr. Obama.
It was easily the biggest instance of crossed wires between the garrulous vice president and his more buttoned-down boss, in a White House that has been marked by occasional eruptions from Mr. Biden. And the effect was magnified both because it involved a divisive social issue and because it came just as the general election is heating up.
People who know both men said they did not believe that Mr. Biden had an ulterior motive in pre-empting the president, despite the fact that he has not ruled out running for president himself in 2016.
Indeed, several gay-rights activists said whatever affection Mr. Biden's candor might have won him with gay voters, he would still lag behind other potential Democratic candidates, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York or Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, both seen as champions of gay rights.
Mr. Biden has said nothing publicly since his remarks on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' But he told staff members at the White House that he regretted putting the president in an awkward spot, several officials said.
''The president has been the leader on this issue from Day 1, and the vice president never intended to distract from that,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden, Kendra Barkoff, said in a statement.
A high-level campaign official called Mr. Biden's comments as bad a mistake as he has made in a long time -- arguably since October 2008, when he ''guaranteed'' at a Seattle fund-raiser that Mr. Obama would face an international crisis within six months of taking office. (''I think Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes,'' Mr. Obama said at the time.)
This time, too, the president offered a modulated criticism. ''Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without, I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody?'' he said on ABC. ''Sure. But all's well that ends well.''
The last 48 hours have been a heady period for Mr. Biden, according to people close to him. He has heard from many people -- especially gay-rights advocates -- that he is a hero who nudged a reluctant president on an issue of historic resonance.
''There is no dancing in Delaware,'' said former Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, referring to Mr. Biden's penchant for bluntness bred in a home state known for its tradition of not dancing around issues.
On the other hand, Mr. Biden upended a plan by Mr. Obama's political brain trust to follow up last Saturday's campaign rallies with a $25-million advertising purchase in nine battleground states to promote the administration's accomplishments.
''My view has always been that everybody's strength is also their weakness,'' said David Axelrod, a senior strategist. ''I don't think it's terribly consequential.''
Despite the White House friction, by Thursday there were signs that Mr. Obama's comments had compelled a number of liberal donors, who had previously remained on the sidelines, to open their wallets.
Juan Ahonen-Jover, a former technology executive, and his partner, Ken Ahonen-Jover, a doctor, donated a combined $10,000 to Mr. Obama's campaign within minutes of learning that the president had changed course on gay marriage, pulling off the road on their way to Key West, Fla., to find an Internet cafe where they could make the contribution.
On the Republican side, conservative political strategists do not envision their base flocking to the polls based on this issue alone -- nothing like the effect in 2004 when voters in 11 states put initiatives to ban same-sex marriage on the ballot. But at the margins -- especially in battleground states with large evangelical Christian populations, like Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia -- they said that they believed that the president's position could alienate some of the religious voters he won in 2008.
Some conservative groups said they were already making plans to use marriage as part of their outreach efforts. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, the social conservative political organization led by Ralph Reed, said Thursday that it planned to include the president's comments in its campaign to rally conservatives.
But in a half-dozen interviews with Republicans who came to see Mr. Romney in Omaha on Thursday, not a single person voiced an objection at his decision not to dwell on the issue of same-sex marriage. ''It's none of my business. We don't need to talk about it,'' said Mo Birkel, 70, a retired custodian from nearby Papillion, Neb., when asked about gay marriage. ''I can't say if I'm for it or against it, because I don't know what my grandkids will be.''

HEADLINE: Credit Easing in U.S., Fed Chairman Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Many businesses and consumers are finding it easier to borrow as banks shore up their balance sheets, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday.
''Notwithstanding the various headwinds, credit conditions in the United States have improved significantly in a number of areas,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
He said that large companies were selling bonds at historically low interest rates and that people with strong credit had ''ready access'' to credit card and auto loans.
But, he also noted, many creditworthy Americans were finding it difficult to get mortgage loans. Small-business owners who have used their homes as collateral for loans also face ''challenging'' conditions, he said.
Mr. Bernanke's comments were prepared for delivery at a banking conference in Chicago.
The Fed chairman said that banks had made ''considerable progress'' in shedding risk from balance sheets and building cushions against future loan losses. Cash and securities holdings at large banks have doubled since 2009, he said.
He also said that the way banks finance themselves had become safer. Large banks are now ''flush'' with deposits, he said, and depend less on short-term loans from financial institutions for their borrowing needs.
In the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, much of the lending among financial institutions in this so-called wholesale funding market froze, spreading panic and helping push the economy into its deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Mr. Bernanke noted that most of the 19 largest banks passed ''stress tests'' earlier this year, meaning they would probably survive and be able to lend in a financial crisis worse than 2008.
In those tests, regulators supposed the unemployment rate would spike to 13 percent, stocks would drop by half and home values would drop by more than a fifth.
Mr. Bernanke said loans to homeowners had fallen 13 percent from their peak, after adjusting for inflation. A slow economic recovery, a troubled housing market and caution by lenders mean that situation is unlikely to improve quickly, he said.
Turning to small businesses, Mr. Bernanke said small loans from banks, though increasing, were still 15 percent below their 2008 peak at the end of last year.
In response to criticism that heightened scrutiny by regulators has made it difficult for banks to lend, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had emphasized to supervisors on its staff that they should take a ''balanced approach'' in overseeing banks.

HEADLINE: A Shock From JPMorgan Is New Fodder for Reformers

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
It didn't take long for bank reformers to say we told you so.
JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss, which was disclosed on Thursday, could give supporters of tighter industry regulation a huge new piece of ammunition as they fight a last-ditch battle with the banks over new federal rules that may redefine how banks do business.
''The enormous loss JPMorgan announced today is just the latest evidence that what banks call 'hedges' are often risky bets that so-called 'too big to fail' banks have no business making,'' said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the language at the heart of the battle between the financial and government worlds, in a statement. ''Today's announcement is a stark reminder of the need for regulators to establish tough, effective standards.'' 
The centerpiece of the new regulations, the so-called Volcker Rule, forbids banks from making bets with their own money, and a final version is expected to be issued by federal officials in the coming months. With the financial crisis fading from view, banks have successfully pushed for some exceptions that critics say will allow them to simply make proprietary trades under a different name, in this case for the purposes of hedging and market-making.
The missteps by JPMorgan could highlight that murky line between proprietary trading and hedging. The bank unit responsible for losses takes positions to hedge activities in other parts of the bank.
''This is a crucial moment in the debate,'' said Frank Partnoy, a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego, who has been a longtime supporter of tighter rules for the nation's banks. ''It couldn't have come at a worse time for JPMorgan Chase. After everything we went through in the financial crisis, the fact that something of this magnitude could happen shows that the reform didn't do the job.''
On Wall Street, few have been more outspoken about the pitfalls of the Volcker Rule than JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon not only attacked the rule, he personally criticized Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and the regulation's namesake.
''Paul Volcker by his own admission has said he doesn't understand capital markets,'' Mr. Dimon told Fox Business earlier this year. ''He has proven that to me.''
The industry reasons that the Volcker Rule would be a costly burden for the banks. But more important, industry officials say, it would hurt the markets and the broader economy.
''Regardless of how the final rule turns out, it will be a shock to the U.S. financial system, as banking entities will need to take extraordinary measures to attempt to implement it,'' said Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan's executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs, in a letter to federal regulators earlier this year. In the letter, Mr. Zubrow defended exactly this kind of trade.
Even Mr. Dimon had to admit Thursday's disclosure was a setback for JPMorgan and other banks that want more flexibility when the final version of the Volcker Rule is issued. ''It plays into the hands of a bunch of pundits but you have to deal with that and that's life,'' Mr. Dimon said Thursday on a conference call with analysts.
As fuel for industry reformers, JPMorgan provides a compelling case study.
Unlike the collapse of MF Global last fall, JPMorgan is a Wall Street giant, and under Mr. Dimon's oversight, it seemed to have mastered risk management. After all, the bank weathered the financial crisis better than most.
Nor was JPMorgan damaged by rogue traders of the sort that cost UBS $2.3 billion in September, or hit Societe Generale with a $7 billion loss in 2008. This was a strategy that the bank itself had devised, with the full knowledge and support of JPMorgan management. In other words, it is the kind of risk that executives like Mr. Dimon say they should be able to manage - but might not be to defend in the wake of the loss disclosed Thursday.
Mr. Dimon and other bank executives argue that hedging, when used properly, allows financial institutions to offset the normal risks they face from economic or market shifts, and doesn't represent the kind of proprietary, directional bet that the Volcker Rule is intended to bar.
In Washington, proponents of stricter regulation say any permitted hedge trade should be tied to a specific position - say a loan to a particular company, or securities being held in inventory for customers on a trading desk. They argue that such trades represent appropriate activities to protect the bank's balance sheet.
Broader hedges, like the one that proved so costly to JPMorgan, should be forbidden, they argue.
JPMorgan suffered losses in a portfolio of credit investments. Mr. Partnoy said broad economic hedging carries risks of its own - and sometimes they can be bigger than proprietary bets like the one that brought down MF Global.
''They're playing with fire,'' said Mr. Partnoy. ''With proprietary trading, you know about the risks. With a hedge, you start to feel safe about it and it lulls people into a false sense of security. It can be a wolf in sheep's clothing.''
Even as Mr. Dimon put the blame squarely on his bank, his arguments on Thursday seemed intended to leave the impression that it was poor execution, not the risks inherent in accumulating big trading positions, that caused the huge loss. In fact, he went out of his way not to blame market shifts or trading reverses.
''Just because we're stupid doesn't mean everybody else was,'' he said. ''There were huge moves in the marketplace but we made these positions more complex and they were badly monitored.''
''This may not have violated the Volcker Rule, but it violates the Dimon Principle.''

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Chase Loses $2 Billion From Its Trades

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and PETER EAVIS; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase, which emerged from the financial crisis as the nation's biggest bank, disclosed on Thursday that it had lost more than $2 billion in trading, a surprising stumble that promises to escalate the debate over whether regulations need to rein in trading by banks.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, blamed ''errors, sloppiness and bad judgment'' for the loss, which stemmed from a hedging strategy that backfired.
The trading in that hedge roiled markets a month ago, when rumors started circulating of a JPMorgan trader in London whose bets were so big that he was nicknamed ''the London Whale'' and ''Voldemort,'' after the Harry Potter villain.
For a bank that earned nearly $19 billion last year, the trading loss, which could go higher, will not cripple it in any way. Still it demonstrates how a market blunder can shake even a financial giant that celebrates its ''fortress balance sheet.'' 
It is a rare blow to the reputation of Mr. Dimon, 56, a native New Yorker known for his hands-on management style and a confident swagger. After successfully steering his bank through the market turmoil of 2008 and the recession, he is perhaps the most influential bank executive in the country - and a vocal critic of the efforts to write rules under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.
The setback for JPMorgan may strengthen the hand of regulators in Washington who are now writing the rules for Dodd-Frank - in particular the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from trading with their own money.
JPMorgan's setback ''casts doubt on Jamie's opposition and adds fuel to anyone who has been pushing for greater regulation,'' said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. ''Oh, how the mighty have fallen.''
Throughout the debate around the Volcker Rule, which is named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, Mr. Dimon has said the rule goes too far. Mr. Dimon told CNBC earlier this year that under the Volcker Rule, ''if you want to be trading, you have to have a lawyer and a psychiatrist sitting next to you determining what was your intent every time you did something.''
Questions over whether banks have been engaging in such trading for themselves while calling it ''market-making'' or ''hedging'' came into focus last month, when the reports emerged that a trading unit of JPMorgan in London was taking such large positions in the name of hedging that they were distorting the market.
At the time, Mr. Dimon played down concerns about that trading, in what the bank calls its chief investment office, telling analysts in an April 13 conference call that it was ''a complete tempest in a teapot.''
In a hastily organized conference call with analysts on Thursday, Mr. Dimon sounded more humble, saying that ''egregious mistakes'' were made. ''They were self-inflicted and this is not how we want to run a business.''
Yet while conceding that the bank had ''egg on its face,'' Mr. Dimon refused to concede that the losses necessitated a stronger regulatory framework. Although he did says that it ''plays right into the hands of a whole bunch of pundits out there.''
And he defended the trading unit, saying that ''the C.I.O. has done a great job for a long extended period of time.''
The troubles are expected to weigh on the bank's broader earnings. For example, the corporate group, which includes the chief investment office, is now expected to lose $800 million in the second quarter, the company said in the filing. Previously, JPMorgan estimated that the group would report net income of about $200 million.
Shares of JPMorgan tumbled 6.7 percent in after-hours trading. Its Wall Street rivals were also down sharply.
The $2 billion loss came from a complicated trading strategy that involved derivatives, financial instruments that derive their value from the prices of securities and other assets. JPMorgan said the derivatives trades were part of a hedge, meaning they were set up to offset potential losses on the bank's large holdings of bonds and loans. But, in the sort of nightmare situation that bankers dread, the ostensible hedge backfired, producing losses of its own.
Since the financial crisis, several financial institutions have been rocked by risky trading, although under very different circumstances. At UBS, $2 billion in trading losses was attributed to a rogue trader, while MF Global collapsed not because of its bet on troubled European sovereign debt, but as a result of a loss of confidence that trade produced.
But JPMorgan's trade was not so obviously fraught with risk. It produced large losses even without extreme movements in the derivatives markets or underlying bond markets. Indexes that track derivatives tied to corporate bonds have recently increased - reflecting a gloomier outlook for corporate bonds - but the move has not been jarring.
JPMorgan likely structured the trade in such a way that effectively magnified losses. Specifically, the bank bought insurance against losses on corporate debt through credit derivatives that increase in value if the underlying creditworthiness of companies is perceived to have deteriorated. But JPMorgan stumbled when it tried to modify that trade by also making an opposite bet with credit derivatives. Mr. Dimon said that the strategy ''to reduce the credit hedge'' was ''poorly constructed and poorly monitored.''
The trades took place in the chief investment office of JPMorgan. These big trades are designed as hedges. Last month big derivatives trades executed in London by the unit appeared to be throwing markets out of kilter. The trades were reportedly put on by ''the London whale'' - a French trader, Bruno Iksil. On Thursday, Mr. Dimon said losses on the trade could grow.
The loss-making trades will further stoke the debate over whether banks make big bets under the guise of hedging. An old market adage says the best way to hedge is to simply sell an asset, rather than offset it with potentially dangerous derivatives. The Volcker Rule attempts to distinguish between true hedging and trading.
The losses will also raise enduring questions about JPMorgan's ability to manage its risks. When it reported first-quarter earnings in April, it released a metric of risk-taking in the chief investment office that made it look as if the unit was taking risks in line with other parts of the bank. But on Thursday, the bank released a new measure of risk-taking that was nearly twice as high.
''JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. Jamie Dimon has been a relentless critic of financial reform,'' said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, which supports tougher regulation of banks. The surprise loss, he said, ''proves him wrong.''
Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: The Human Cost of Ideology

 BODY:
For more than a year, House Republicans have energetically worked to demolish vital social programs that have made this country both stronger and fairer over the last half-century. At the same time, they have insisted on preserving bloated military spending and unjustifiably low tax rates for the rich. That effort reached a nadir on Thursday when the House voted to prevent $55 billion in automatic cuts imposed on the Pentagon as part of last year's debt-ceiling deal, choosing instead to make all those cuts, and much more, from domestic programs. 
If this bill were enacted, estimates suggest that nearly two million Americans would lose food stamps and 44 million others would find them reduced. The bill would eliminate a program that allows disabled older people to live at home and out of institutions. It cuts money that helps low-income families buy health insurance. At the same time, the House bill actually adds more than $8 billion to the Pentagon budget.
In all, the bill would cut $310 billion from domestic programs; a third of that comes out of programs that serve low- and moderate-income people. Other provisions would slash by half the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was set up after the financial meltdown to protect consumers from predatory lending and other abuses, and reduce the pay of federal workers.
Fortunately, it will never be taken up in the Senate, where the majority leader, Harry Reid, has said it would ''shred the social safety net in order to protect tax breaks for the rich and inflate defense spending.''
House Republicans are already claiming that this bill, along with the equally inhumane overall 2013 budget written by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, shows their seriousness in reducing the deficit and why they should keep control of the House in November. In fact, it does the opposite on both accounts -- and serves as a reminder of their destructive priorities.
As a resolution to the debt-ceiling crisis, Republicans had already agreed to $109 billion a year in automatic spending cuts -- half from defense, half from the domestic side -- if lawmakers failed to agree to lower the deficit in more reasonable ways such as mixing targeted cuts with tax increases on the rich. Even Democrats who supported big defense cuts wanted them chosen carefully, not with the sequester's cleaver. But Republicans refused to take that path when the supercommittee deliberated and now are trying to make all of the cuts on the domestic side.
In just one particularly destructive example, the bill would eliminate the social services block grant, a $1.7 billion fund that is given to the states to help people struggling the hardest. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the fund provides services to 23 million people, including Meals on Wheels and other programs that help older Americans. It also helps pay for child care assistance, foster care and juvenile justice at a time when states are cutting back these programs.
House Democrats offered an alternative bill that would replace the $109 billion sequester by raising taxes on the wealthy, ending oil company tax loopholes and cutting farm subsidies, but it was rejected. Republicans are determined to protect millionaires and defense contractors, no matter the costs to the country.

HEADLINE: Behind the Burden of Regulation

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Regulations and restrictions on business activity often arise in response to misbehavior, but their writing and application are often distorted by special-interest groups during the legislative process, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"Over-regulated America" was the headline in the Feb. 18 issue of The Economist. "The home of laissez-faire is being suffocated by excessive and badly written regulation," began the accompanying article. 
Everyone who manages an American business corporation - be it for profit or not - is likely to agree with that headline. Having served in the past on the boards of two hospital companies, one a for-profit hospital chain and the other a nonprofit academic health center, I can sympathize with the headline as well. 
The question is why this regulatory burden is visited on Americans.
Are we just victims of government, an alien force sent hither by some sinister, extraterrestrial creature - perhaps Darth Vader -- tasked with suffocating us upright earthlings with mindless rules?
Or should we seek the answer in the wisdom of Walt Kelly, the creator of Pogo, who is credited with the phrase, "We have met the enemy and he is us"?

That thought occurred to me as I presented to my students in first-year economics a sketch of what economists call "constrained optimization": 
An investor-owned company, for example, is modeled by economists as seeking to maximize the wealth that the company represents to its owners, without violating the laws of the land. Management is assumed to pursue this objective, subject to the constraints of the input and output markets, technological constraints, legal (regulatory) constraints and ethical constraints. 
The ethical constraints imposed on this process are part of the company's ethical culture - some of it written down in its code of ethics. That culture is thought to be forged by the "tone at the top," that is, a management code of ethics. Another word for these ethical constraints might be "decency." 
What is legal is not necessarily decent. Although one should think that this is obvious, it increasingly seems to escape political and business leaders who, caught in dubious behavior, assert, "I did nothing wrong," and may well even believe it. By "nothing wrong," they mean that they did nothing that a high-priced lawyer could not defend as somehow legal in a court of law.
I am reminded here of the exasperated lament of former Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, after Congressional hearings on the managerial, accounting and financial scandals of the late 1990s. "The real scandal here may be not what is illegal, but what is totally permissible," Mr. Thompson said, adding, "The system is clearly not designed with the interest of the general public or the investor in mind."
There is a trade-off between the ethical and regulatory constraints that limit our actions in business, as elsewhere. The more pervasive the incidence of ethically dubious behavior, the more vigorously the rest of society will respond with ever more government regulations. As The Economist notes, "Governments of both parties keep adding stacks of rules, few of which are ever rescinded."
To illustrate, the predictable response to the scandals of the late 1990s was the highly regulatory American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002, commonly known as Sarbanes-Oxley. 
That bill was drafted by former Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio. It was passed by a Republican House and a Republican Senate and signed into law in 2002 by President George W. Bush, in spite that party's oft-stated misgivings of government regulations. 
Sarbanes-Oxley prescribes strict new accounting and governance standards for American corporations, some of which have been faulted as too burdensome, especially on small business. 
The much-criticized Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 -- widely known as Dodd-Frank - was a predictable reaction to the ethically dubious practices that had crept into the financial sector in the preceding decade. That bill entirely is the handiwork of Democrats.
As The New York Times reported on May 5, federal regulators are trying to prevent the financial disasters that arose out of interest-rate swaps sold to unsophisticated treasurers of municipalities, nonprofit organizations and school districts.
Transactions in modern finance, just as in modern medical practice, must confront the problem of asymmetric information: one side of the transaction (e.g., the physicians or the sellers of financial products) has technically superior knowledge of the product being traded and could exploit that superiority to their financial advantage. Medicine's code of ethics forbids such exploitation. Should there be a parallel in finance as well?
Finally, the myriad and often burdensome regulations imposed on our health care sector did not just rain down on a perfectly well-behaved industry. Act by act and regulation by regulation, they were regulatory responses to some sufficiently widespread mischief by members of a sector that had come to view public treasuries as a commons that could be grazed without inhibition. Pogo's dictum applies here, too.
We are left with the question of why, if regulations are usually a legitimate response to mischievous games played by some parties in the private sector, these regulations are often so inchoate, if not outright silly.
Lack of competence among the rule writers -- especially unfamiliarity with the operations of those they seek to regulate - may be part of the answer, but probably not a large part.
More important, in my view, is the gantlet that legislation and rule-making must run under our system of governance. 
Before an original bill passes Congress, it has been worked over ("marked up"), in each of the two chambers, by sundry committee fiefs whose members may be beholden to a variety of moneyed interest groups, each eager to steer the legislators' hands. 
The specific regulations called for in a bill, once passed, must also survive the scrutiny and influence of special interest groups, which typically work through members of Congress or the upper levels of the executive branch, whose affection they have acquired. 
Even the best-written original bill cannot emerge from that process in the form of a coherent set of rules. Many a rule may appear puzzling to straight-thinking people, and some even silly. Chances are they make sense to some interest group that had purchased it, so to speak.

HEADLINE: Austerity, Safety Nets, and Spending

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Parsing the spending numbers. 

 BODY:
The latest in the attempt to make excuses for the abject failure of austerity is the claim that European countries didn't really practice austerity after all. This is mainly coming from the usual suspects - the people who, for example, used Census hiring to claim that Obama was presiding over a vast expansion of government employment. (What will it take for pundits to realize that if Veronique de Rugy, for example, cites a number you can pretty much assume that it's wrong?) But I have to say that the responses I've seen have been surprisingly weak - some people who should know better are conceding the point that maybe there haven't been big spending cuts. Yes, there have.
For the fact is that you can't just look at spending levels to ask what is happening to spending programs. Here in the United States spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps has risen sharply, not because the welfare state has expanded, but because a lot more people are unemployed and poor. Similar effects are at work in European countries, which have stronger safety nets than we do. Also, some spending represents banking bailouts, not exactly what people have in mind when they talk about big government.
So let's take a look at the example of Ireland. (All data from OECD). Here's total spending in millions of euros, which might look as if there's not much austerity:
But let's parse it a bit. First off, there's "capital transfers" - basically bank bailouts. These bulged in 2010, but continued into 2011:
Then there's "social transfers", which includes means-tested programs and unemployment benefits. These are up, but not because the programs became more generous; instead, they reflect the dire state of the Irish economy:
Finally, there's government spending on consumption and investment:
So yes, Ireland has done austerity - some of it on the tax side, but much of it on the spending side. The same is true in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Don't believe the usual suspects when they say different. In fact, don't believe the usual suspects when they say anything at all.

HEADLINE: Annual Census at Risk in House Budget Bill

BYLINE: SABRINA TAVERNISE


HIGHLIGHT: The survey is valuable because it reaches nearly 3 million households in a kind of mini-census every year. 

 BODY:
One casualty of the sweeping budget bill that passed the House on Thursday was an annual survey conducted by the Census Bureau, a rich source of data that social researchers say is critical to modern demography.
The elimination of the American Community Survey from the bill surprised researchers, who say they depend on it for data on everything from race to migration and poverty. It is also critical to state and local governments, which use it to decide how to spend federal funds. 
"Modern societies need current, detailed social and economic statistics, and the U.S. is losing them," the Census Bureau said in a statement.
The survey is valuable because it reaches nearly three million households every year, generating data that helps determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year, according to the Census Bureau. It gives the only detailed state and local information on marriage, divorce and childbearing.
It is also critical for businesses, which use the data for market research.
"This has the data-user community buzzing pretty hard," said Ken Hodges, chief demographer at Nielsen, the market research company. "Users are now saying that this needs to be taken very seriously."
Congressman Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida who voted to eliminate the survey, argued that some of the questions were "personal," and that spending taxpayer dollars on them "was a little extreme," said Kelly Kwas, a spokeswoman. Ms. Kwas cited questions like "how much shopping do you do?" and "where do you shop?"
The survey's questions are indeed detailed, probing topics such as family income, home ownership and college attainment. Census officials argue that the survey is entirely confidential and that the information gathered is essential for policy makers. businesses and scientists. Those used to be part of the long-form decennial census, but have since been removed and placed in the annual survey, which formally began in 2005.
"Demographers feel betrayed," said Andrew Cherlin, a demographer at Johns Hopkins University. "We were told not to worry about the demise of the census long-form questionnaire because we could still get the detailed information from the A.C.S. Now the House wants to end that, too."
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant and former staff director of the House subcommittee on Census and Population, said conservative lawmakers had objected to the mandatory nature of the survey, but that in a surprise twist, lawmakers ultimately scrapped it entirely.
The amendment is considered highly unlikely to pass the Senate, where Democrats have tended to block Republican-led legislation, and the White House has promised to veto it if it ever gets that far. 
Still, Ms. Lowenthal said it was not a foregone conclusion that the survey would be restored.
"The situation is very serious," she said, adding that there were legal requirements that rely on the survey's data, like implementation of the Voting Rights Act, which draws on detailed neighborhood data on race and ethnicity. "I don't think the leadership in the House has thought through the consequences of this."

HEADLINE: Police Seek Bogus Rental Agent Who Stole Deposits

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER REEVE


HIGHLIGHT: The Crime Stoppers unit is looking for tips to find the man, who defrauded at least six apartment hunters in Queens in the fall. 

 BODY:
Police are looking for a man they say accepted deposits as large as $2,300 from six apartment hunters in Queens, only to disappear with the money. 
The would-be tenants responded to a flier that had been placed on a utility pole advertising vacant apartments in Elmhurst. A man showed them apartments and collected deposits from them, totaling $9,950. After taking each deposit, the man disconnected his phone number and disappeared. The crimes occurred last October and November.
The man, who can be seen on the video above, is a dark-haired Hispanic male. A police advisory says he is in his 30s, weighs about 150 pounds, and is between 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-10.
Anyone with information about the bogus rental agent is asked to contact the Police Department's Crime Stoppers unit.

HEADLINE: Pyramid Power, Over Me

BYLINE: DICK CAVETT


HIGHLIGHT: Living on the edge as a celebrity contestant on 'The $25,000 Pyramid.' 

 BODY:
Dick Clark's death reminded me of how much a part he was of some of the most fun I ever had in my life. I mean being on "The $25,000 Pyramid." 
"Password" was fun, too, and being a panelist on the old "What's My Line?" was a superthrill. But the laughs gotten from my friendly sparring with Dick Clark were great, and the games themselves were a day at the gym for your brain. Five shows in a row taped with only economics-dictated short breaks between them left you all but cortex-dead and, when the show was in Los Angeles, barely qualified to drive yourself home. 
I liked Dick Clark and we had a pleasant, kidding on-air relationship that played well, and it was fun winning money for the civilian contestants. Although I had never been a fan of "American Bandstand," I had admired his defiance on that show of the "too many black ones" crowd who threatened his sponsors. He and I had an odd thing in common: people on the street frequently said to him, "Hey, aren't you Dick - um - Cavett?" And I got the reverse. (Once it was, "Don't try denyin' you're Dick Clark." I didn't.) And whenever we saw each other, we'd compare how many times this had happened to each of us since the last time we'd met.
The show was still in New York the first time I did it. My ABC show had ended, and eerily, the "Pyramid" set was in my old studio in place of mine. 
In those days "Pyramid" was on only once a week, in the evening, and they taped two at once. I'd never seen the show and somewhat foolishly accepted the offer. Not the move of a wise person, but it turned out O.K.

Recklessly, I learned the game on the job, so to speak. Dumb as this was, it was also good in a way. I had nothing to lose, didn't even care whether I won or lost, and this relaxed me to such a degree that in the two tapings I - and my partners, of course - beat the pyramid all four times, costing the company a bundle.
Somehow I was invited back, and having learned how chancy and nerve-wracking the whole thing actually was, I tensed some and, caring now, I with my perfect record began to lose sometimes, like everybody else. What can we learn from this?
Here is a sample of the self-inflicted but pleasant torture of pyramiding.
The host's and my on-camera "feuding" was lighthearted, and Clark's perfect combination of a quick mind, genial on-camera nature and masterful ability to hit just the right note in banter made him perfect for his job. 
A sample of our allegedly humorous joshing: He'd say, "Our next contestant comes all the way from Florida and - yes, what is it, Dick?"
Me: "If she hadn't come 'all the way,' she wouldn't be here, would she?"
He would deftly and expertly express mild exasperation and move briskly on. 
A very few experiences on the show were less than fun.
Memory just coughed this up. A woman I was teamed with got eliminated in the first round when I, seeing the easy clue "aspirin" and with just seconds left, apparently went nuts and said "acetylsalicylic acid." Unforgivable. Was I showing off? Why not just say, in succession, "pill" and then "headache." Anyone breathing would have replied "aspirin." As she was led from the set, she turned for what was usually the inevitable moment of, 
Her version: "Thanks a lot! I needed the money."
I can still ache from this. I owe her a check. I wish I could find her.
A job on that show that I would not have wanted at (almost) any price was the one held by the poor fellow who, watching from the control booth, had to make - under inhuman pressure - the instant on-air decisions about what answers and clues to accept or reject. (Was "calm" acceptable for "relaxed"? "Grasp" for "grab"? Etc.) All the while knowing that his snap decisions might please or infuriate his employer, and delight or break the heart of the civilian contestant. A job, I should think, that would make air-traffic-controlling look simple.
Yet he was a cordial fellow, pleasant of appearance and quite thin, probably from difficulty with keeping solid food down. I hope that in retirement he has found some degree of well-deserved tranquility, perhaps in a rest home in a pleasant setting by the sea. And without ever, ever again having to decide in a flash if "amble" and "stroll" are the same thing.
One of Dick's and my running humor gambits was my joking questioning of some of those decisions. It was harmless, quick and fun, and caused no trouble. And nobody got hurt. Until one day.
First, a kind of secret was revealed in confidence to me by a staff member I'd become friendly with. I assume the statute of limitations is not a factor here, but I shall not identify him further.
Early on, after doing the show a few times, you noticed that the last subject as you climbed - the top square of the pyramid - was harder to convey than the rest. Considerably harder. It was more abstract, or something. Where the bottom rows might have been easy stuff like CHRISTMAS THINGS or BURT REYNOLDS MOVIES, a top square, just as things were going swimmingly, could suddenly bring your brain to a halt. It was like going from, say, U.S. PRESIDENTS to THINGS THAT CHANGE. Or THINGS THAT HAVE ENDS. What would you say to those, instantly and unambiguously with time running out? (Once I got THINGS THAT PENETRATE. I'd give a lot to know if I said the obvious one.) 
It's a triumphant memory, though one not without pain. A contestant and I - and I'd love to find her - were doing fine. We'd won the first round at the desk and thus were promoted to the big pyramid, where the big money lay.
We got through the two lower rows of subjects without much trouble, as I recall, and had plenty of time for the "M-n--y S-v-ng Clue."
It turned around and the mind reeled.
THINGS YOU BIND.
"The nation's wounds" didn't occur until years later. Nothing occurred at all.
I'd recently held a fishing pole and noticed the lacquered "binding" on the handle, so I said "fishing pole handles." And was immediately sorry.
"Things you hold," ventured the contestant.
"Uhh, books," I tried.
"Things you read. Things with paper. Rectangular things."
Not surprisingly, my next clue, "magazines," didn't convey the bound sets in my mind. 
I tried another: "A sprained ankle."
"Things that hurt, painful things "
Time would be up in three seconds at most. I don't actually remember thinking - in any sense of the word "thinking" - this, but my mouth, along with some unconscious recess of the brain, blurted out, "Chinese women's feet."
"Things you BIND?" (.)
Moments like that were glorious. The cheering, the jumping up and down. The jubilant, celebratory, spontaneous joy. The intimate, automatic close-body embrace with the contestant, of either sex, bordered on the erotic. One of life's great moments; or at least so it seemed. Maybe that night, trying to get to sleep, you didn't torture yourself by wishing that, in a blown game that day, you hadn't said "handcuffs" instead of "cuff links."
But, in its own category, there occurred the Fateful Day.
A female contestant and I were climbing smoothly toward the pinnacle and the big bread. And then it happened. 
The deadly top box turned around, revealing: THINGS THAT HAVE PITS.
Me: Coal mines.
Contestant: Things that are dark. Deep things. 
Me: Cherries ... uh plums plums and peaches 
Contestant: Fruits. Things that are round. Things that are sweet. Things with juice.
Me (): Peaches cherries 
Contestant: Juicy things Things on trees.
I thought of, and rejected, "the human arm," and suspected that "tooth-breaking fruits" might have too many words. Though probably, sadly, not.
Although I doubt that the phrase "think outside the box" had been born, it's what I tried, in a panic. The gleaming "$25,000" sign glared at me: the amount that the woman was clearly not going to win in the remaining few seconds. Then, from where I know not, It Hit.
Me: Poe's pendulum.
Contestant: Things that have PITS! (.)
Joy all around. Then tragedy. Dick Clark looking pained and reluctant, announced that his earphones had just conveyed the news from the booth that the upright judge had rejected my clue. Hissing and booing filled the theater.
I blew. "What earthly reason could anyone with half a brain - and it would take half a brain - come up with for rejecting that clue?"
(.)
Clark (): "They say that Poe's pendulum doesn't have a pit."
Me: " Every school kid knows it's 'The Pit and the Pendulum.' It's not 'The Pit and the Cabbage Leaf" or 'The Pit and the Subway Token.' It's 'The Pit and the Pendulum.' Did you ever see Poe's pendulum without its pit? What kind of reasoning? You get an intelligent audience here. Why don't we let them decide this one? Is 'Poe's pendulum' fair?"
(.)
I like to think I was angry on the contestant's behalf and not about the rejection of my clue. 
I don't remember at what point they had to stop tape. Since the shows were timed precisely to the second to avoid editing costs, which I had now incurred for them, plus overtime pay for crew, etc. for the one-after-the-other, five-shows-a-day schedule - you went half brain-dead somewhere in the fourth one - they weren't happy. I was marginally less than persona grata.
Alas, they stuck with their wrongheaded decision. And saved money. It still gets to me as I type this. I wonder if I thought of paying the woman myself?
I'd love to see that show. I missed it on air, and I can't imagine how much of it, with challenging editing, they managed to air to make it presentable. But there's more.
About a year passed, and I was back on "Pyramid" again. In the parking lot, one of the show's staff, looking cautiously both left and right, said, "We were wrong about 'Poe's pendulum.'"
I wondered, did they contact the contestant? His chuckle answered that question. If she's reading this now, she has, at least, the dubious reward of knowing she won. 
In spirit. 
I still wish the show would come back.

HEADLINE: Varied Views on Extreme Weather in a Warming Climate

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A climate scientist critiques a colleagues' conclusions. 

 BODY:
Through decades of work, James E. Hansen of NASA has earned his plaudits as a climate scientist. But his intensifying personal push for aggressive cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases has come with a framing of climate science that is being criticized by some respected researchers for stepping beyond what peer-reviewed studies have concluded.
Here is a critique of "Game Over for Climate," Hansen's Op-Ed article in The Times this week, from Martin Hoerling, who runs an effort by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the forces contributing to extreme weather events, followed by a must-read reaction to both from Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: 
Martin Hoerling:
In his , Jim Hansen asserts:
"Over the next several decades, the Western United States and the semi-arid region from North Dakota to Texas will develop semi-permanent drought, with rain, when it does come, occurring in extreme events with heavy flooding. Economic losses would be incalculable. More and more of the Midwest would be a dust bowl. California's Central Valley could no longer be irrigated. Food prices would rise to unprecedented levels."
He doesnt define "several decades," but a reasonable assumption is that he refers to a period from today through mid-century. I am unaware of any projection for "semi-permanent" drought in this time frame over the expansive region of the Central Great Plains. He implies the drought will be due to a lack of rain (except for the brief, and ineffective downpours). I am unaware of indications, from model projections, for a material decline in mean rainfall. Indeed, that region has seen a general increase in rainfall over the long term during most seasons (certainly no material decline). Also, for the warm season when evaporative loss is especially effective, the climate of the central Great Plains has not become materially warmer (perhaps even cooled) since 1900. In other words, climate conditions in the growing season of the Central Great Plains are today not materially different from those existing 100 years ago. This observational fact belies the expectations from climate simulations and, in truth, our science lacks a good explanation for this discrepancy.
The Hansen piece is policy more than it is science, to be sure, and one can read it for the former. But facts should, and do, matter to some. The vision of a Midwest Dustbowl is a scary one, and the author appears intent to instill fear rather than reason.
The article makes these additional assertions:
"The global warming signal is now louder than the noise of random weather..."
This is patently false. Take temperature over the U.S. as an example. The variability of daily temperature over the U.S. is much larger than the anthropogenic warming signal at the time scales of local weather. Depending on season and location, the disparity is at least a factor of 5 to 10.
I think that a more scientifically justifiable statement, at least for the U.S. and extratropical land areas is that daily weather noise continues to drum out the siren call of climate change on local, weather scales.
Hansen goes on to assert that:
"Extremely hot summers have increased noticeably. We can say with high confidence that the recent heat waves in Texas and Russia, and the one in Europe in 2003, which killed tens of thousands, were not natural events - they were caused by human-induced climate change."
Published scientific studies on the Russian heat wave indicate this claim to be false. Our own study on the Texas heat wave and drought, submitted this week to the Journal of Climate, likewise shows that that event was not caused by human-induced climate change. These are not events, but upon scientific scrutiny, one finds both the Russian and Texas extreme events to be part of the physics of what has driven variability in those regions over the past century. This is not to say that climate change didn't contribute to those cases, but their intensity owes to natural, not human, causes.
The closing comment by Hansen is then all the more ironic, though not surprising knowing he often writes from passion and not reason:
"The science of the situation is clear - it's time for the politics to follow. "
Let me borrow from a recent excellent piece in New Scientist by tornado expert Dr. Harold Brooks regarding the global warming and tornado debate, and state:
"Those who continue to talk in certain terms of how local weather extremes are the result of human climate change are failing to heed all the available evidence."
Kerry Emanuel:
I see overstatements on all sides. Extreme weather begets extreme views. On the Russian heat wave, Marty is citing a single paper that claims it had nothing to do with climate change, but there are other papers that purport to demonstrate that events of that magnitude are now three times more likely than before the industrial era.
This is a collision between the fledgling application of the science of extremes and the inexperience we all have in conveying what we do know about this to the public. A complicating factor is the human psychological need to ascribe every unusual event to a cause. Our Puritan forebears ascribed them to sin, while in the 80's is was fashionable to blame unusual weather on El Niño. Global warming is the latest whipping boy. But even conveying our level of ignorance is hard: Marty's quotation of Harold Brooks makes it sound as though he is saying that the recent uptick in severe weather had nothing to do with climate change. The truth is that we do not know whether it did or did not; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Regular readers of my work will not be surprised that I align with Emanuel.

HEADLINE: Obama's Ad Campaign Targets Indian Call Centers

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: A $25 million advertising blitz connects presidential rival Mitt Romney with outsourcing jobs to India. 

 BODY:
The man at the center of U.S. President Barack Obama's advertising campaign against Mitt Romney is Jim Margolis, "and his job is to make you think of call centers in India every time you hear Mr. Romney's name," Jeremy W. Peters writes in The New York Times. 
This week, the Obama campaign kicked off a $25 million "advertising blitz," Mr. Peters writes. "In their ads, Web videos and online features, the president wants to thwart the influence of 'big oil'; Mr. Romney cashes their campaign checks. The president saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by rescuing the auto industry; Mr. Romney shipped jobs overseas. "It's just what you expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account," one ad says". 
Mr. Margolis did not become a top chef in what Mr. Romney calls the president's "hell's kitchen" of negative ads based solely on his eye for a pretty picture and his flair for boiling down a good résumé in 30 seconds.
His past work shows why he is such an indispensable part of Mr. Obama's media team. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Margolis produced a commercial that repeated John McCain's ill-advised assertion "the fundamentals of our economy are strong" over and over, helping to sear the phrase into voters' minds as the economy imploded that fall.
Two years later, he helped Senator Barbara Boxer of California win re-election against Carly Fiorina, the Republican nominee and former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, with ads that showed Ms. Fiorina being ushered into a chauffeured car as an aide held the door. One of them reminded voters, "While Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets."

HEADLINE: What's the Matter With Kansas? ... What's the Matter With Wall St.?

BYLINE: CHRYSTIA FREELAND


HIGHLIGHT: The Wall St. Rich have turned against President Obama, but his stance on gay marriage threatens to pit their social values against their economic self-interest. Sound familiar? 

 BODY:
Democrats often ask, "What's the Matter with Kansas," referring to the notion, captured by Thomas Frank in his 2004 book of that title, that the Republican establishment has cunningly persuaded the lower-middle class to vote against its economic self-interest by catering to its cultural preferences. The deal, these Democrats say, is low taxes on the rich, in exchange for support of the socially conservative values of the lower middle class. We saw that dynamic at play in the Republican primaries, in which the candidate who most excited the working and middle class base, Rick Santorum, was the one who offered the most aggressively conservative cultural platform.
With his explicit support of gay marriage this week, President Barack Obama may have performed the same jujitsu, only this time with the rich. The upper class has largely turned against the President - on Wall Street, it is a truth universally acknowledged that he is anti-business and anti-wealth, a sentiment made manifest in the checks bankers are writing for Mitt Romney. (As I explain in my latest column, the fact that they turned toward him was news.)
But, just as Mr. Frank argued that the Republicans had succeeded in persuading the lower middle class to vote against its economic interests for the sake of cultural values, Mr. Obama may not be imposing a similar choice on the wealthy. Most upper middle class Americans are socially liberal - indeed, one of the groups that the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, enlisted in his drive to legalize same-sex marriage last year was Wall Street heavy hitters, some of them Republican. 
That makes the choice in November tougher - the 1 percent will now have to choose between a candidate who shares their cultural values, and one who they believe will best protect their pocketbooks.

HEADLINE: May 11, 1973 | Charges Dropped Against Pentagon Papers Leakers

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On May 11, 1973, Judge William M. Byrne dismissed charges of espionage, theft and conspiracy against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo Jr. for their role in leaking the Pentagon Papers. 

 BODY:
On May 11, 1973, Judge William M. Byrne dismissed charges of espionage, theft and conspiracy against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo Jr. for their role in leaking the Pentagon Papers. The judge based his decision on the government's conduct in trying to find evidence against Mr. Ellsberg, whom Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had called "the most dangerous man in America."
During the trial, it had been revealed that a White House-approved "special investigations unit" had broken into the office of Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist and to wiretap Mr. Ellsberg. (Known as "the Plumbers," members of the unit were also responsible for the Watergate break-in and the ensuing scandal.)
The New York Times explained that the decision "did not vindicate the defendants; it chastised the government. Nor did it resolve the important constitutional issues that the case had raised." Judge Byrne offered to let the case go to the jury to address these issues, but Mr. Ellsberg and Mr. Russo declined.
The Pentagon Papers was the media's name for a 7,000-page classified report drafted by the Department of Defense in 1967 that tracked the United States' involvement in Vietnam under the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Mr. Ellsberg had contributed to the report while working at the Pentagon and gained access to it in 1969 while working at the RAND Corporation think tank. 
Once a supporter of the war, Mr. Ellsberg had shifted his view and become strongly anti-war. He felt that he needed to release what he later described as "7,000 pages of documentary evidence of lying by four presidents and their Administrations over 23 years to conceal plans and actions of mass murder" to a wider audience to stop the war. With the help of Mr. Russo, a former RAND colleague, he photocopied the report and, after offering it to a number of Washington officials and finding no takers, decided to leak it to newspapers.
On June 13, 1971, The New York Times published the first in a series of excerpts from the Pentagon Papers. In an introduction to the papers, The Times's Neil Sheehan wrote that the document "demonstrates that four administrations progressively developed a sense of commitment to a non-Communist Vietnam, a readiness to fight the North to protect the South, and an ultimate frustration with this effort -- to a much greater extent than their public statements acknowledged at the time." He also wrote, "It suggests that the predominant American interest was at first containment of Communism and later the defense of the power influence and prestige of the United States in both stages irrespective of conditions in Vietnam."
The public was outraged over the government lies revealed in the Pentagon Papers. The Nixon administration responded by seeking a federal court injunction to halt the publication of the papers on the grounds that prior restraint (the censorship of material before it is published) was necessary to protect national security. The case quickly made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of The Times and The Washington Post, which had also published excerpts, on June 30, 1971. In a 6-3 decision, the court found that the papers' release was not an immediate and direct threat to security.
The Times Topics-Pentagon Papers overview page states, "Victory emboldened the news media, and the contents of the Pentagon Papers themselves guaranteed, at least for the generation of journalists directly involved, that every government utterance would be subject to skeptical (and too often cynical) scrutiny."
In 2011, the National Archives released the Pentagon Papers in their original form. The appears on The New York Times Web site.
Connect to Today:
In October 2010, WikiLeaks, a Web site dedicated to the release of classified materials, released the Iraq War Logs, a collection of 400,000 documents it had received with the aid of Army Pvt. Bradley Manning. Mr. Ellsberg spoke out in defense of WikiLeaks, praising the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as "the most dangerous man in the world" for challenging the United States government. 
In an interview with The Times, Mr. Ellsberg discussed what he would have done with the Pentagon Papers in the Internet age. He said: "As of today, I wouldn't have waited that long. I would have gotten a scanner and put them on the Internet." He said that the Internet would have allowed him to be more independent and to reach a wider audience more quickly, but as he also noted, "I don't think it would have had the same impact, then or now, as having it in The Times" because of the publicity caused by the court case.
How would you compare the WikiLeaks' releases to the Pentagon Papers case? In your opinion, does the proliferation of confidential information due to the Internet make the release of such material less significant? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: A Hollywood Welcome for Obama at Clooney Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: The buddy act that President Obama and George Clooney have developed was on full display on Thursday night at the actor's home in Los Angeles, where they entertained a Hollywood crowd that paid $40,000 a person to support the president's re-election. 

 BODY:
3:40 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES - The buddy act that President Obama and George Clooney have developed was on full display Thursday night at the actor's home here, where they entertained a Hollywood crowd that paid $40,000 a person to support the president's re-election.
The filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief whom Mr. Clooney credited with organizing the dinner, said the event raised nearly $15 million, setting a record for a presidential election fund-raiser. Roughly half came from the donors; the rest came from an Obama campaign sweepstakes online for small contributors, two of whom were picked to attend the event.
"Once again the entertainment industry has stepped forward in a very big way," Mr. Katzenberg told the crowd, naming Presidents John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton as previous beneficiaries of Hollywood support.
The dinner showcased Mr. Obama's popularity in the entertainment industry, whose financial backing has helped offset his lost support from Wall Street. And his stock on the West Coast was up further, just a day after Mr. Obama revealed his change of heart to support same-sex marriage, long a favored cause in Hollywood.
Mr. Obama made only an indirect reference to his decision to endorse gay marriage, just as he had earlier in the day at two fund-raisers in Seattle. But, as at the prior appearances, his allusions were clear enough to elicit cheers and applause. 
"And obviously yesterday we made some news," Mr. Obama said, which was enough to get an appreciative rise from the mix of stars, film studio chiefs and other entertainment executives. "But the truth is," Mr. Obama continued, drawing a distinction between his views and those of Republicans, "it was a logical extension of what America is supposed to be. It grew directly out of this difference in visions."
"Are we a country that includes everybody and gives everybody a shot and treats everybody fairly and is that going to make us stronger? Are we welcoming to immigrants? Are we welcoming to people who aren't like us? Does that make us stronger? I believe it does. So that's what's at stake."
Mr. Obama has said that he intended to announce his support for same-sex marriage before the election, and has acknowledged that his timetable was moved up after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last Sunday endorsed such unions in a television interview. The president, by announcing his own endorsement on Wednesday in an interview on ABC, avoided the awkwardness of coming here seemingly at odds with Mr. Biden on the issue.
Mr. Katzenberg, in introducing Mr. Obama, said, "Yesterday he did the right thing yet again" - sparking applause and cheers even without explicitly mentioning same-sex marriage.
Among the roughly 150 people in a large tent erected on Mr. Clooney's outdoor basketball court were actors and entertainers including Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Salma Hayek, Tobey Maguire, Barbra Streisand and her husband, James Brolin, and the designers Diane von Furstenberg and Trina Turk.
Mr. Obama told the supporters that he would take turns at each of the 14 tables, and he stayed at Mr. Clooney's dinner for nearly four hours; typically the president spends less than an hour at a fund-raiser.
Reporters were allowed inside the tent just for the 20 minutes that Mr. Obama was introduced and spoke. Mr. Clooney -- who sat beside his girlfriend, Stacy Keibler, an actress and former professional wrestler -- listened intently to Mr. Obama throughout the president's remarks, his hands folded as in prayer and his chin resting on them. But the two men cut up as well.
The president, an avid basketball player, thanked Mr. Clooney "for letting us use his basketball court." He added with a motion toward the actor, "This man has been talking smack about his basketball game ever since I've known him." (The two took to the court on Friday morning, along with Mr. Maguire, to settle things before Mr. Obama departed for Reno, Nev.)
Their friendship, Mr. Obama said, began when Mr. Obama was still a senator and Mr. Clooney was pressing Congress for humanitarian aid to victims of war and famine in Sudan. Mr. Clooney has visited the White House several times since Mr. Obama was elected president, pressing the Sudan cause or attending social events.
Mr. Obama told of walking through Mr. Clooney's Tudor-style manse prior to the dinner and seeing a copy of the famous "Hope" poster from the 2008 presidential campaign by the artist Shepard Fairey; Mr. Obama said the photo that was the basis of the poster was a picture of him and Mr. Clooney at a Sudan hearing, but the artist cropped out Mr. Clooney.
"And this is the first time that George Clooney has ever been Photoshopped out of a picture," Mr. Obama said, to laughter and applause. "Never happened before, will never happen again."
The president said Mr. Fairey gave Mr. Clooney a similar poster with both men pictured. "Why he said at the bottom, 'Dope and Hope,' I don't know," Mr. Obama joked.
(The Associated Press has reported that Mr. Fairey actually used another photo of Mr. Obama, by The A.P., but the artist said he used the separate picture of Mr. Obama and Mr. Clooney to escape a copyright infringement case with the news service. In February, Mr. Fairey admitted that he had been mistaken and pleaded guilty to fabricating and destroying evidence.)
When Mr. Obama went through his stump-speech recitation of his work on the economy, energy policy, education, banking regulations and health care, and made his usual cracks about his new wrinkles and gray hair, on this night he added, "George doesn't have to go through these things."
"Look at me!" Mr. Clooney shouted from his table in the audience.
"I like that in you, brother," Mr. Obama said.

HEADLINE: Erdogan's Next Move

BYLINE: ANDREW FINKEL


HIGHLIGHT: Discussion over a new constitution for Turkey is being hijacked by a debate over the future of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 

 BODY:
ISTANBUL - Is Turkey's prime minister past his expiration date? At first glance, the question sounds absurd. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., to three consecutive electoral victories, most recently in June 2011, and few doubt that if there were an election tomorrow he would chalk up victory number four.
A decade of A.K.P. rule has transformed Turkey from a debt-ridden, inflationary economy to one of the fastest-growing in Europe. The increase in confidence and prosperity has allowed Erdogan to tame the country's military and reel in its die-hard judiciary. But there are ominous signs that the prime minister intends to overplay his hand.

This week, Erdogan said that Turks should begin debating a move from the current parliamentary system, in which most of the governing power rests with the prime minister, toward a presidential system with a more powerful executive, along the lines of the United States or France. Everyone knows what his push for a stronger president means: Erdogan would jump ship before his term as prime minister ends in 2015 and stand as president himself when the job becomes vacant in 2014. He would continue leading the country, with more power than ever.
The vehicle for change would be a major revision of the out-of-date Constitution. Most Turks agree that the country needs a new charter -- one that would finally enshrine individual rights and provide for greater accountability and government transparency. In the view of many, the current Constitution concentrates too much power in the hands of an unelected state apparatus. Enacted in 1982 when the country was under military rule, the Constitution is seen as full of fussy provisos designed to protect the government from its citizenry rather than the other way around.
Notoriously, the Constitution tries to resolve Turkish Kurds' demands to be able to express their own identity by pretending that those demands do not exist. Even agitating for regional devolution of power can be interpreted as an assault on the integrity of the state. And the biggest problem is that the Constitution's guarantees of basic rights and freedoms are subject to so many qualifications that they end up being no guarantee at all.
The government is right to want to replace it. But the new Constitution has to be better than the old one. It should not serve as a means for Erdogan to hold on to power.
Under the current system, the president is not powerless: he appoints senior bureaucrats and can veto laws passed by Parliament, but the main power flows from the prime minister. As head of the cabinet, the prime minister has responsibility for the day-to-day running of government.
While no one has yet spelled out what a strong presidency would look like, it can be assumed that it will combine the might of the current office with that of prime minister. To do so without the approval of a popular referendum would mean securing the support of two-thirds of the Parliament and winning the support of at least one other party.
It is already clear that no opposition group would be willing to support a constitutional change that would end up giving Erdogan so much power. But that hasn't stopped the prime minister from trying. His political allies have also joined the fray. Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said this week that a presidential system allows for "the most effective supervision.''
As a result of Erdogan's efforts, discussion over the shape of the future of Turkey under a new Constitution will be hijacked by a debate over the future of just one man. Unfortunately, all of this is a distraction from the real issue of how to make Turkey's government more representative.
At the moment Erdogan resembles a Moses wandering in the desert: having led his people from one sort of bondage, he is unable to lead them to the promised land. If he believes so strongly that Turkey should have a presidential system, then he first needs to declare that he is not a candidate.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Opens Investigation Into JPMorgan's $2 Billion Loss

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission recently opened a preliminary investigation into JPMorgan's accounting practices and public disclosures about the trades. 

 BODY:
Regulators are investigating potential civil violations surrounding the $2 billion loss that JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Thursday, raising further questions about trading activities at the nation's biggest bank. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently opened a preliminary investigation into JPMorgan's accounting practices and public disclosures about the trades, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is not public. Regulators learned about the activities in April, and formally opened an investigation in recent days, the people said.
The inquiry, which is being run out of New York, will probably examine the bank's past regulatory filings about the internal unit that placed the trades, as well as recent statements from the firm's top executives. 
In April, questions surfaced about the group, called the chief investment office, after reports emerged that a London-based trader was taking large bets that distorted the market. At the time, Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, publicly dismissed the concerns about the trading activities, calling them a "complete tempest in a teapot."
On Thursday, JPMorgan revealed that the group had suffered significant losses, which could cost the firm $2 billion or more. A more humble Mr. Dimon on Thursday said "egregious mistakes" were made.
An important avenue for the S.E.C. investigation, the people said, is the firm's accounting methods relating to the trades. Investigators could take a close look at a measure known as value-at-risk. The company disclosed earlier this year that it changed the way it calculates the metric, which may have masked some of the risk surrounding this trade. On a conference call Thursday, Mr. Dimon said the firm had reverted to the old way of measuring value-at-risk.
The people cautioned that the investigation is at an early stage. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of any wrongdoing. JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.
The $2 billion trading loss comes as policy makers put the finishing touches on new industry regulations, including the so-called Volcker Rulethat bans banks from making bets with their own money. Banks, including JPMorgan, have been pushing back on some of the rules, saying they will hurt the markets and the broader economy. But JPMorgan's disclosure on Thursday could provide bank reformers with additional fodder. 
"The enormous loss JPMorgan announced today is just the latest evidence that what banks call 'hedges' are often risky bets that so-called 'too big to fail' banks have no business making," Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday.
United States and British regulators have been taking a look at the JPMorgan unit for nearly a month, after media reports shined a spotlight on the trading group. The bank started talking with the Federal Reserve and Britain's Financial Services Authority about the chief investment office in April, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The S.E.C. became aware of the group's activities around the same time.
In the weeks that followed, regulators asked for more information about the unit's activities. When the losses started to mount, JPMorgan informed regulators in the week prior to Thursday's official announcement, one of the people said. 
"It's not surprising that we've been holding discussions about what has been going on," said one person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: Obama to Skip Economic Summit in Russia

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: As the White House pondered the meaning of President Vladimir Putin's abrupt decision to skip next week's Group of Eight summit meeting at Camp David, the Russians took note of the fact that President Obama is skipping an Asian summit meeting in Russia later this year. 

 BODY:
As the White House pondered the meaning of President Vladimir V. Putin's abrupt decision to skip next week's Group of Eight summit meeting at Camp David, the Russians took note of the fact that President Obama was skipping an Asian summit meeting in Russia later this year.
Russian officials told the Russian media that American officials had notified them that Mr. Obama would not attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in the far east city of Vladivostok in early September. The event will be the first time the summit meeting has been hosted by Russia, a point of pride for the Kremlin.
Mr. Obama was never planning to attend because it coincides with the Democratic National Convention where he will be renominated and the opening of the fall campaign season. The group's meetings are traditionally held in November, but this year the meetings were moved up to September. The White House noted Friday that the president was clear during a meeting with Mr. Putin's predecessor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, in South Korea in March that he would not be coming to Russia before the November election.
 "I already invited you to visit Russia," Mr. Medvedev told Mr. Obama during that meeting, according to a transcript. "I understand that this year will be difficult for you, since it's an election year. But still I hope that you will be able to come. I already invited you to my hometown, St. Petersburg, so I would like to take the occasion to reiterate my invitation on behalf of myself and President-elect Vladimir Putin."
Mr. Obama did not mention the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting specifically, but left little doubt that his travel itinerary would not include Russia. "I would love to visit St. Petersburg," he said then. "He is absolutely right that my next visit to Russia will undoubtedly be after my election."

HEADLINE: Before Big Loss, JPMorgan Was One of Volcker Rule's Fiercest Foes

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase and its chief, Jamie Dimon, have been among the most outspoken opponents of the Volcker Rule, spending significant amounts of both money and time to get their message across. 

 BODY:
The $2 billion trading loss that JPMorgan Chase disclosed late on Thursday provided ample ammunition for supporters of the Volcker Rule, which would restrict government-backed banks' ability to conduct proprietary trading.
But it also prompted a fair amount of finger-wagging toward the company, given JPMorgan's stance as one of the rule's fiercest opponents.
JPMorgan has been among the most outspoken detractors of the proposed financial regulation that is making its way through Washington. 
The firm has laid bare its feelings about the Volcker Rule several times, including in a Feb. 13 comment letter to the Federal Reserve. In that document, JPMorgan argued that the proposal would restrict its efforts to rein in risk-taking and would harm the firm's ability to compete against foreign rivals that did not face the same restrictions.
"Ultimately, we believe that the statute is so flawed that it will be impossible to implement in a way that does not impose unacceptable costs on our economy and financial system," Barry Zubrow, the bank's head of corporate and regulatory affairs, wrote.
In the letter, JPMorgan specifically mentions its chief investment office, the trading group which caused the $2 billion trading loss. The firm described its operation as one meant to "hedge the structural risks of our balance sheet." In other words, it was meant purely to offset risk and not make speculative bets. (More from the letter below.)
JPMorgan also happens to run one of the most active and best-financed lobbying operations within the commercial banking industry. In the first four months of 2012, the firm has spent $1.92 million, barely trailing Wells Fargo in terms of banks' lobbying expenses. Last year, JPMorgan spent $7.62 million; two years ago, it spent $7.41 million, the most in its industry.
And JPMorgan's chief, Jamie Dimon has been among the most frequent visitors to Washington to press his case. According to the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group, a nonprofit organization that tracks government transparency, Mr. Dimon has made 10 visits to regulators to discuss Dodd-Frank, principally at the Treasury Department.
(JPMorgan officials have visited government regulators either on their own or as part of an industry group 72 times, according to the Sunlight Foundation's database.)
Two of Mr. Dimon's meetings were specifically about the Volcker Rule. On Dec. 7, 2010, he and Peter L. Scher, the firm's government relations chief, met with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to discuss how banking operations were designated under the proposed regulation. 
And last week, the JPMorgan chief was one of six financial firm leaders to meet with Daniel K. Tarullo, a Fed governor, to discuss the rule. According to a summary of the meeting, the banking chiefs reiterated their comments about the proposal, while Mr. Tarullo provided no response. 
But Mr. Dimon hasn't felt the need to confine his thoughts about the Volcker Rule to private meetings or carefully worded letters. In fact, he has been openly scornful of the proposal. 
In February, for instance, Mr. Dimon belittled the former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker himself, saying: "Paul Volcker by his own admission has said he doesn't understand capital markets. He has proven that to me."

To protect the Firm against credit losses that, based on its analysis, the Firm perceived were possible to occur in the near term, the Firm's ALM [asset liability management] team used credit derivatives to purchase protection on high yield credit default swap indices with short term maturities and to sell protection on high yield credit default swap indices with longer-term maturities -- in effect, taking a high yield curve flattening position in the credit derivatives market. This strategy resulted in the Firm recognizing some gains as near-term default risks increased. The gains recognized on these derivatives strategies offset in part the losses that occurred on credit assets held by the Firm.
Under the proposed rule, this activity could have been deemed prohibited proprietary trading. The derivatives used in the hedging strategy were booked in the market risk capital trading account and may not have qualified as hedging because (1) the actions taken were forward-looking and anticipatory; (2) the Firm's purchases of the credit derivatives may not have been deemed "reasonably correlated" with the underlying risk, as different instruments were used to effect the hedging strategy than the assets giving rise to the risk; and (3) the gains realized upon the unwind of the hedges could have been determined to be larger than the countervailing risks.

HEADLINE: Times Sells Remaining Stake in Fenway Sports Group

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: The move was the latest effort by the company to shed assets unrelated to its flagship newspaper. 

 BODY:
The New York Times has sold its remaining stake in the Fenway Sports Group, the company that owns the Boston Red Sox, the latest in an ongoing effort to shed assets unrelated to the company's flagship newspaper.
The Times Company received an aggregate of $63 million in cash and will receive an estimated pre-tax gain of $38 million in the second quarter of 2012, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. A company spokeswoman, Abbe Serphos, declined to say who purchased the shares. 
Last summer, the Times Company sold more than half of its minority stake in the group, which owns the Red Sox and several other sports properties, for $117 million. A year earlier the company sold around 50 of its Class B shares in the sports group to the venture capitalist Henry F. McCance.
In 2002, The Times paid $75 million for a 17.75 percent stake in Fenway. But the 2008 recession and the steady decline of print advertising revenue at newspapers like The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune, has prompted the company to shed its nonessential assets.
Late last year, the Times Company sold its 16 regional newspapers, including The Gainesville Sun and The Sarasota Herald Tribune, to Halifax Media Holdings for $143 million in cash.

HEADLINE: Loss Stains JPMorgan's Chief, One of Banking's Top Risk Managers

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss disclosed late Thursday is a rare misstep by the bank's chief, Jamie Dimon, who prides himself on having his fingers on the pulse of his 270,000-employee company. It suggests his vaunted confidence edged toward hubris. 

 BODY:
Days before revelations of JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss rocked Wall Street, the company's always-confident chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was his usual exuberant self.
When the bosses of six of the largest banks gathered at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in downtown Manhattan to meet with a top Fed governor, the others used the underground garage and avoided the cameras. Mr. Dimon came and went through the front door, and even chatted with a CNBC reporter.
It was a stance that was familiar to Mr. Dimon. He had steered his bank successfully through the financial crisis, and was known as Wall Street's best risk manager, not to mention the most influential banker in the country when it came to writing new regulations in Washington.
He was so well regarded by the administration that the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, was even tapped to appear at the bank's board meeting back in 2009 before the appearance was scuttled. More recently, Mr. Dimon has visited Washington numerous times, seeing both allies and sparring partners like Representative Barney Frank.
Now, though, Mr. Dimon's reputation and possibly his influence have been cut down to size.
The trading loss disclosed late Thursday is a rare misstep by a man who prides himself on having his fingers on the pulse of his 270,000-employee company, and it suggests his vaunted confidence edged toward hubris.
Mr. Dimon said in an interview on Friday that he got a call from the company's chief risk officer about the trading problem in late April. He had been briefed about once a quarter on the complicated credit derivatives position and more recently had been looking into the size of the credit bet after press reports in early April.
"Of course I was angry," he said in an interview Friday. "I said, 'Stop, let's learn and get the other people involved,' " he recalled.
"We were meeting constantly," he added. "Believe me, for the past couple of weeks, it was the primary thing going on in my world."
In a post on Twitter, Mr. Frank said that JPMorgan "has lost, in this one set of transactions, five times the amount they claim financial regulation is costing them."
And that reality may cost Mr. Dimon in Washington. He has been marshaling the firm's considerable resources to help sway the regulators who are writing many of the rules in the Dodd-Frank banking reform bill passed in 2010. So far this year, JPMorgan has spent $1.92 million on lobbying. In 2010, it topped the industry in lobbying dollars with $7.41 million.
Mr. Dimon has also been a frequent visitor to Washington to further make his case to lawmakers. According to the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group, he has made 10 visits to regulators over the past two years to discuss Dodd-Frank, principally at the Treasury Department.
Known as a blunt executive not afraid to raise his voice, Mr. Dimon has been one of the few bankers who still commanded respect from analysts and investors as well as regulators. Mr. Dimon routinely grills executives to make sure they are prepared for a variety of contingencies, according to employees at the New York bank.
New York born, Mr. Dimon was the heir apparent at Citigroup, where he was mentored by Sanford Weill. But, in 1998, he abruptly left in a management shake-up by Mr. Weill. It was that move that catapulted him to Chicago, where he took over the top job at Bank One in 2000, then a midsize bank considered a basket case. Under his leadership, the bank's health improved sharply, and he merged it with JPMorgan Chase in 2004.
Since then, JPMorgan Chase's shares have vastly outperformed those of troubled giants like Bank of America and Citigroup. In 2011, Mr. Dimon's overall compensation totaled more than $23 million, an 11 percent increase from 2010.
Mr. Dimon was also known for warning how dangerous one misstep could be. In April 2007, just as the first signs were emerging of what would become the subprime mortgage crisis, Mr. Dimon had a message for 200 new managing directors assembled at the company's headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.
"One deal doesn't make or break us," he said, according to one banker who was present. "But the implications of one bad deal on our franchise is significant."
And while the mortgage mess helped take down Bear Stearns and Lehman, once formidable competitors, JPMorgan Chase largely sidestepped the worst.
So while other bank executives emerged from the 2008 market turmoil more chastened, Mr. Dimon became more confident, emboldened by his successful navigation of the financial crisis, rival bank executives said.
Former JPMorgan employees said that Mr. Dimon's swagger was infectious. "It made everyone more confident," a former JPMorgan trader said. "Maybe too confident because there might not be as much neurotic double checking of everything."
Just weeks before the blowup, that confidence was evident. Doug Braunstein, JPMorgan's chief financial office, dismissed concerns about the trading that would later blow up in the bank's chief investment office. In an interview, Mr. Braunstein said he was "very comfortable with the positions we have." 
Under Mr. Dimon's leadership, the Chief Investment Office - which was responsible for the outsize credit bet - was redesigned to make larger bets with the bank's money, a former employee said. JPMorgan executives say the Chief Investment Office expanded after JPMorgan Chase's 2008 acquisition of Washington Mutual, which added much riskier securities to the company's overall portfolio. The idea behind the broad strategy was to offset that risk.
One part of that expanded strategy - the losing credit derivatives bet - was starting to go against the bank by early April, but it wasn't until after quarterly earnings were released on April 13 that the magnitude of the problem became apparent.
Immediately, Mr. Dimon assembled an eight-person team under John Hogan, the company's chief risk officer, to assess the risks and defuse what had become a ticking time bomb. "I said, 'Let's go get the A-Team,' " he said.
While he was aware of the broader intent, he said he was not aware of the intricacies of the complicated and ultimately dangerous bet until then.
Of course, Mr. Dimon has been a prominent critic of elements of the Volcker Rule, which would impose strict limits on the kind of trading risks banks are permitted to undertake with their own money. The measure, passed into law in 2010, is now being finalized.
With a seat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, Mr. Dimon had a strong voice in the rule-making process.
Now Mr. Dimon, a skilled master of relations with the media, is having to do some fancy footwork. He had taped a segment on NBC's Meet the Press on Wednesday, one day before he revealed the disastrous trade. On Friday, he had to troop back to NBC for a do-over, and apologize again for the losses. In recent days, he has been characteristically blunt and unusually contrite. Despite the trading blowup, many of the same regulators Mr. Dimon has tangled with over the years were quick to defend him.
Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the trade only underscored "that even very good management can miss stuff." She adds that Mr. Dimon does have "a very stellar record of good decision making."

HEADLINE: In JPMorgan Chase Trading Bet, Its Confidence Yields to Loss

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS, ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, MARK SCOTT and NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: While the $2 billion trading loss is not a huge threat to a bank as large and powerful as JPMorgan, it is a stark reminder that the banking system remains vulnerable to market shocks and has heightened concerns that big banks continue to make risky financial bets that could threaten the economy. 

 BODY:
When reports emerged in the first week of April that a JPMorgan Chase trader in London was making bets so big they were distorting a little-known market in credit derivatives, an embedded regulator approached executives.
The senior supervisor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one of roughly 40 Fed officials who work inside the bank, was told that senior management was not overly concerned about the reports, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The executives had been assured that things were fine by Ina Drew, the bank's overall chief investment officer, and Bruno Iksil, the so-called London Whale leading the trade. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, who had been traveling in Dallas and Atlanta that week, returned to tell analysts that the reports were "a complete tempest in a teapot."
That would soon change. A week and a half later, top executives in a conference room on the 48th floor of the bank's Park Avenue headquarters realized they had a problem.
Losses were mounting on the trade as hedge funds' bets against the bank turned profitable. Conference calls between New York and London were not producing satisfactory answers. A team of risk officers now referred to as the Navy Seals began meeting twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., with Mr. Dimon frequently in attendance.
The trading unit, called the chief investment office, was a star performer within the bank, producing profits even while intended to mitigate risk. But questions were being raised about what the trading unit was telling top executives in New York. Concerned risk executives began producing an analysis of the "Whale" trade every day and updating the New York Fed.
JPMorgan also contacted the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the national banking regulator, and Securities and Exchange Commission officials.
People inside the firm say that Ms. Drew campaigned vigorously to keep the trade on initially. These same people now say she and some of her colleagues are likely to be fired or forced to resign; however, no decisions have been made.
The mistakes "were self-inflicted, and this is not how we want to run a business," Mr. Dimon said on Thursday evening when the bank disclosed that it had at least $2 billion of trading losses as a result of the strategy. The bank warned that the losses could grow, and further market turmoil on Friday threatened to add to the tally.
While the loss is not a huge threat to a bank as large and powerful as JPMorgan, whose shares tumbled 9.3 percent on Friday, it is a stark reminder that the banking system remains vulnerable to market shocks more than three years after the financial crisis. It has heightened concerns that big banks continue to make risky financial bets that could threaten the economy.
And additional fallout potentially awaits JPMorgan. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently opened a preliminary investigation into JPMorgan's accounting practices and public disclosures about the trades, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is not public.
The inquiry, which is being run out of New York, will probably examine the bank's past regulatory filings about the internal unit that placed the trades, as well as recent statements from the firm's top executives.
The surprise loss and the regulatory scrutiny has now swung a harsh spotlight on a unit of JPMorgan that few people outside Wall Street knew existed.
The unit, which employs fewer than 40 people across the bank's international offices, was created to manage the bank's exposure to complicated global financial transactions, like interest rate changes and currency movements.
And unlike JPMorgan's deal-making investment banking unit, the chief investment office was supposed to keep its head down, carrying out trades that protected the bank from the volatility caused by the recent financial crisis, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Yet what began as a way to hedge against risk has turned into a major liability. Many of the problems can be traced to the aftermath of the financial crisis.
In 2007, the bank hired Achilles Macris of Greece, who previously was the head of global capital markets at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. He was charged with running the unit's European operations on the sixth floor of JPMorgan's offices near St. Paul's Cathedral in London's financial district.
As part of an expansion, Mr. Macris turned to a number of former hedge fund and investment banking experts to bulk up the European team.
Under the leadership of Mr. Macris in London and Ms. Drew in New York, the group's exposure to financial markets ballooned. Ms. Drew - one of the highest-ranking women and one of the highest-paid executives at the bank, making $15.5 million last year - is widely viewed as a natural trader with an eye for unusual opportunities to strike a profit.
The business's investment securities portfolio more than tripled to $356 billion in 2011, compared with $76.5 billion in 2007, according to company filings. The rise was in part a result of the extra exposure related to JPMorgan's acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008.
The unit's exposure to risk also rose sharply. The group's average "value at risk," or the amount the unit could potentially lose on any given day, stood at $57 million in 2011, according to company filings. That is just shy of the $58 million of average value at risk at JPMorgan's much larger investment banking business, which includes the firm's trading units.
Mr. Dimon knew about the expansion of the unit, whose increasing risks didn't raise concerns presumably because its profits were rising.
In 2009, the unit's net income peaked at $3.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion the previous year. The jump in earnings in 2009 resulted from large purchases of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the United States government, according to a company filing. Net income for last year totaled $411 million.
Last summer the chief investment office began calling brokers at several Wall Street banks, the brokers say. The office was offering to sell insurance on an index of big American corporations like General Mills, Alcoa and McDonald's - known as CDX IG Series 9. If the companies in the index went bankrupt, JPMorgan would have to pay out, but if the companies continued to do well JPMorgan could rake in the fees from financial firms that bought the insurance.
The strategy initially made money for JPMorgan and its position began to grow, as did an appetite for it among a tight-knit segment of hedge funds focused on credit opportunities. The large scale of the trade was permitted as a result of an expansion in the limits placed on the size and the scope of securities the unit could trade in that were adopted after JPMorgan acquired Washington Mutual in the financial crisis. Those limits have now been scaled back.
By January, these hedge funds were getting calls nearly every day from brokers representing the chief investment office, according to hedge fund managers and brokers on the calls.
The seller's identity was not supposed to be known, but the sheer volume of the trade made it hard to hide, and soon enough all fingers in the "small, clubby world" of credit hedge funds pointed to Mr. Iksil's desk at JPMorgan, according to one fund manager.
"A bunch of us started looking at it and talking about it a lot," the manager said. "There was agreement that Bruno was selling."
There were two ways that JPMorgan could win this bet. If the companies in the index did well, the bank's cost of insuring the index would continue to fall. JPMorgan could also artificially drive the price lower by continuing to issue more and more insurance - a distinct possibility thanks to JPMorgan's size and stature.
In January and February, as the price of the insurance continued to drop, lunch meetings and casual conversations between hedge fund managers swirled around the ability of JPMorgan to continue financing this bet.
"A lot of people told me it was a foolish trade," said an official with a hedge fund that bet against JPMorgan. "The naysayers on this trade said, 'Look, this guy has unlimited firepower, he can just keep selling and selling and make your life miserable.' "
Among the hedge funds that began taking positions against JPMorgan were Blue Mountain, a New York fund; Lucidus Capital Partners, a London fund; Hutchin Hill, a New York fund; and Bluecrest, a giant London hedge fund founded by two former traders on JPMorgan's proprietary trading desk.
The trade did not at first make money for the hedge funds. In the improving economy early in the year, the hedge funds had to make regular insurance payments. But in late March, doubts about the economy began to swirl, and the index jumped.
JPMorgan began seeing losses by the end of the first quarter, on March 31, but they were not enormous, allowing bank executives to shrug off the early criticisms of the trade. But the trade drew increasing attention as the index continued to spike, multiplying JPMorgan's potential losses if it had to pay out on the insurance.
Soon United States and British regulators were talking daily with bank executives. (The New York Fed has been following the chief investment office practically since its inception, as part of its regular supervision of the firm.)
The Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is at an early stage. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of any wrongdoing.
An important avenue for the S.E.C. investigation, people briefed on the matter said, is the firm's accounting methods relating to the trades. Investigators could take a close look at how the bank reported risk for the chief investment office and whether changes it made to that measure were adequately disclosed.
In the first quarter, JPMorgan changed its risk measurement to one it felt was more in line with recent regulatory changes involving capital requirements. Yet the bank had issues with the model, and Mr. Dimon said on Thursday that it was later deemed "inadequate."
JPMorgan, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record, did not need regulatory approval to change its risk model, but eventually would have to. Other firms said they tended to work in concert with regulators when altering this model.
The change clearly masked the risk of the trades now under the microscope. Mr. Dimon disclosed that the daily value at risk for the trading unit had almost doubled, from an average of $67 million for the first quarter, to $129 million, after the bank scrapped the new model and revised the figures.
One senior Wall Street executive speculated the change might have assigned a lower risk weighting to big trades, allowing the bank to take more risk than it should have in recent months.
In the case of the trade that generated the huge loss, the insurance on the contract does not come due until 2017, so JPMorgan could potentially hold off any actual losses until then. If the economy improves, the cost of insuring American companies could drop again. But now that the London Whale's trade is public, hedge funds could force the cost of this specific insurance contract up, and with it JPMorgan's paper losses. This is what appears to be happening now.
On Friday, the insurance index spiked sharply, bringing it up 32 percent from its low in March.
"There are no buyers or sellers in the market right now. Because of that, it is impossible for JPMorgan to get out of this trade," said Gennaro Pucci, who oversees the PVE Macro Credit Fund in London. "These positions, which made sense for them to put on, just become impossible to manage when liquidity dries up."
A senior Wall Street executive said on Friday: "JPMorgan violated the cardinal rule of risk: Don't become the market."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths RUZIKA, RICHARD M.

 BODY:
RUZIKA--Richard M.,53, of Greenwich, CT passed away on Monday, May 7, 2012 at a Stamford hospital following a stroke on April 22, three days after surgery on his left knee. Rich was born on April 16, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Frank and Miriam and brother to Keith and Frank, who predeceased him. He studied at West Hempstead High School and Columbia University, where he graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in economics. 
Following college, Rich signed with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League for a brief period. In 1982, Rich joined Goldman Sachs in New York and went on to serve the firm with distinction for nearly three decades. He began his career as a silver and gold trader on the floor of COMEX, moving to the floor of NYMEX in 1984 as one of the original people in the firm's energy platform. He was a member of the board of NYMEX for nine years. Rich moved to the firm's trading floor in 1990, becoming head of Natural Gas Trading in 1996 and in 1998, he relocated to Baltimore as one of the founding members of Goldman Sachs' electricity business. Rich was named head of Commodities in 2000 where he developed the firm's AssetCo business and was later appointed co-head of Global Macro Trading and then co-head of the Global Special Situations Group. He was named a managing director in 1996 and a partner in 1998. Rich retired from Goldman Sachs in April 2011 as head of the Global Special Situations Group and a member of the Management Committee, the Securities Division Executive Committee and the Firmwide Risk Committee. Following his retirement from Goldman Sachs, Rich was planning to start a hedge fund with his longtime friend Joe Howley and former Goldman Sachs partner Lance Bakrow. In 1983, Rich married Ruthanne (nee Millnamow), daughter of James and Marion, who survives him, along with their children Craig, 18, and Caitlin, 17. Their marriage of almost 30 years, was built upon a friendship that started when they were youngsters, grew as they began dating in their teens and only deepened over the years. Their relationship was based upon mutual respect and a shared sense of family. Most of all, it was filled with passion and joy. Those who know Rich also know that beyond his professional success, he was most proud of his role as devoted husband and father.

HEADLINE: An Issue of Gay Rights, but Not a Simple One

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- North Carolina is as good a place as any and possibly better than most to explore the often contradictory sentiments at the heart of the same-sex marriage debate.
On Tuesday, the voters in this state went to their polling stations and, by a landslide margin, elected to join the voters in 30 other states in enshrining a ban on same-sex marriages in the State Constitution. The next day, President Obama, perhaps buoyed by repeated polls showing support for same-sex marriage nationally, announced his personal support for it.
And in the days after that, people here and elsewhere concluded that, when November rolls around, this public disagreement between the president and a large majority of voters in this state on a burning social issue will not make much difference at all.
''To be quite candid, I would say probably a small factor with equal push each way,'' is how State Representative Paul Stam, the Republican majority leader in the state's House, put it. 
The political facets of this are varied, and include political allegiances and the more pressing urgency of economic troubles.
But there are cultural facets, too, and they go deeper, reflecting that for many voters, gay rights are not an all-or-nothing matter, but something more nuanced.
''Someone's religion teaches them to condemn homosexuality, and yet they are in some kind of relationship, whether a family member or close friend'' who is gay, said the Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, a North Carolina native and the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, a gay rights group based in Asheville. Reconciling that, she said, ''doesn't typically happen in the time frame of a ballot initiative.''
It came as a surprise to many on both sides that the vote was so decisive in North Carolina, where a poll in March by Elon University, a liberal arts university in the state, found that two-thirds of residents supported some legal recognition of same-sex couples. The state also has a moderate reputation and is the site of this year's Democratic Convention.
But North Carolina has long been at peace with its seeming inconsistency, electing a liberal like Terry Sanford and a conservative like Jesse Helms to serve in the Senate at the same time.
Social and religious conservatism and economic populism have historically gone hand-in-hand in a state that, for many decades, consisted largely of small farms and mill towns. Thus in a state that became known for first-rate universities, it was illegal to buy a cocktail for most of the 20th century.
''If you look at all the progressive politicians in this state, most of them have used religious talk in their speeches in a way that would startle a Northern politician,'' said Rob Christensen, a columnist for The News and Observer in Raleigh and the author of ''The Paradox of Tar Heel Politics.'' ''Yes, it's progressive in a lot of ways, yes, it's moderate on racial issues, but at the same time it's still socially conservative.''
Those strains are increasingly diverging, as transplants move in and the urban areas expand, as seen in Tuesday's vote. Most cities and college towns voted against the marriage ban, with corporate leaders and even some Republican politicians from urban areas speaking openly against it.
But from the mountain hamlets to the tobacco towns on the coastal plains, the amendment was deeply popular. In all, 93 of the state's 100 counties voted for it, most by wide margins.
To the disappointment of some gay rights advocates here, who wanted to see a more candid debate, the main argument advanced by the opposition was that the amendment was simply bad law and would produce unintended consequences for children and unmarried couples.
Most voters were unconvinced that this was the real crux.
''In the rural counties, it's just such a visceral issue,'' said W. Glenn Jonas Jr., chairman of the religion department at Campbell University, which is affiliated with the Baptist Church.
Evangelical Protestant leaders declared the choice unambiguous. Days before the vote, the Rev. Billy Graham, a native and one of the most respected figures in the state, took out a full-page advertisement in 14 newspapers.
''At 93, I never thought we would have to debate the definition of marriage,'' he said in it. ''The Bible is clear -- God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.''
For the most part, black religious leaders were also unequivocal, and remained so even after the president declared his personal approval of same-sex marriage on Wednesday.
''I'm very clear on that one,'' said the Rev. Barrington B. Ross, pastor at Pearson Chapel A.M.E. Church in Yanceyville. ''He's the leader of the free world, but I won't change my view on marriage.'' Mr. Ross said that he was still a supporter of the president, and that they would simply have to agree to disagree on this one.
State residents who opposed the ban, meanwhile, have spent days defending the reputation of North Carolina to disdainful same-sex marriage supporters. There have been calls for the Democratic Convention to be moved from Charlotte, jokes about the state have circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page dedicated to North Carolina tourism became a free-for-all of North Carolina bashing.
While some residents pointed out that most states had passed amendments similar to this one, others lamented that outsiders -- and even people who live in the liberal enclaves within the state -- just did not appreciate the difficult morality of the issue for a population that remains deeply religious.
Many of the people who voted against same-sex marriage ''genuinely and honestly believe it violates their fundamental religious beliefs,'' said Gary Pearce, a former adviser to Jim Hunt, a Democrat who was the state's longest serving governor and who would often describe his progressive policies in the language of faith. ''They don't really want to hurt people.''
Those particular religious convictions are not necessarily shared by the state's younger generation. State Representative Thom Tillis, a Republican and speaker of the House, even acknowledged as much several weeks ago, when he said that the amendment would probably be repealed in 20 years.
As the younger voters shift in their opinions, more gay people are also willing to live openly in parts of the country where they would not have done so before, adding further moral complications to those firmly opposed to same-sex marriage.
''One of the things that's been a factor is they've become aware in these little towns and everywhere else of gay people they know, especially in their own families,'' said Hastings Wyman, the founding editor of the Southern Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.
Mr. Wyman, who is gay and spent several years working in Republican politics in his home state, South Carolina, including as a legislative aide for Senator Strom Thurmond, talked about his experiences among his own family and friends from growing up.
''It just kind of eats away at the general public custom,'' he said. ''It's just harder for them because it puts them at odds with other people they know.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Wholesale Prices Falls

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Producer prices unexpectedly fell in the United States in April as energy costs dropped by the most in six months, the Labor Department said Friday. Any sign of easing inflation pressures could give the Federal Reserve more room to help the economy should growth weaken. 
The government's seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index dropped 0.2 percent last month, the first drop of the year and the biggest decline since October.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index, which measures prices at farms, factories and refineries, to be flat.
The decline means wholesale prices in April were 1.9 percent higher compared with a year earlier, the weakest reading since October 2009.
Wholesale prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rose in line with economists' expectations, up 0.2 percent after March's 0.3 percent gain.
The drop in the overall index was because of a 1.4 percent decline in energy prices, the biggest drop since October. Gasoline costs slumped 1.7 percent while prices also fell for residential natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.
The Producer Price Index outside food and energy was pushed up by a 0.4 percent increase in the index for pharmaceuticals. Higher prices for civilian aircraft also pushed up the core index.
In the 12 months through April, core producer prices increased 2.7 percent. That was the lowest since August and just below analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: A New Focus for Lawyers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Cautionary Tale of Dewey & LeBoeuf'' (editorial, May 7): 
As law firms tackle the pressures that can undermine their effectiveness and durability, law school graduates and students have an opportunity to take a fresh look at what it means to be a lawyer. We need to shift the focus of lawyers from serving the interests of corporations to serving the interests of families under severe economic strain who are struggling without urgently needed legal assistance.
Since its inception, the City University of New York School of Law has been devoted to ''law in the service of human needs.'' Our student body and alumni provide legal representation to underserved communities grappling with life-altering issues, like eviction, foreclosure, the withdrawal of government benefits, deportation, racial profiling and human rights abuses.
While public-interest law may not be as lucrative as private firm work, our graduates say the satisfaction of helping families and communities is priceless.

HEADLINE: Outside Europe, German Trade Surplus Soars

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
GERMANY'S trade surplus with its fellow euro nations has fallen to the lowest level in nearly a decade. But its trade surplus with countries outside Europe is soaring. 
The German government reported this week that the country's trade surplus with the other 16 countries in the euro zone was 62.2 billion euros in the 12 months through March. That was down 29 percent from the level a year ago, and was the lowest for any 12-month period since 2002.
But the country's trade surplus with countries not in the European Union has risen, offsetting the decline within the euro zone. That figure climbed to 62.9 billion euros, a record figure that is up 115 percent over the previous year.
As can be seen from the accompanying charts, this is the first time that figure exceeded the euro zone surplus.
Trade has declined only a little with other countries that are members of the European Union but do not use the euro currency, leaving Germany's overall trade surplus at 162.7 billion euros, 3 percent higher than it was a year ago.
The financial crisis in much of the euro zone helps to explain both trends. Many countries in the zone are in deep recessions and unable to easily borrow, and German exports to them have plunged.
But the problem has also helped to depress the value of the euro, making German goods more competitive against exports from other developed countries, including the United States and Britain. Exports to countries outside the European Union have risen to their highest level ever.
German exports to other euro zone countries with economies that are still relatively healthy continue to rise, with exports to the Netherlands 24 percent higher in the 12 months through January -- the latest number available -- than they were in 2006.
But exports to Portugal and Italy have been declining in recent months after showing signs of recovery in 2010 and early 2011. Germany's exports to Greece, by far the sickest economy in Europe, have been falling steadily throughout the crisis. A recovery in exports to Ireland seems to have stalled.
Another economic statistic released by Germany this week indicated that the trends were likely to continue. German factories say orders continue to rise from buyers outside the euro zone, and continue to decline from companies within the zone.

HEADLINE: New York Times Company Sells Final Stake in Fenway Sports

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said on Friday that it had sold its remaining stake in the Fenway Sports Group, the company that owns the Boston Red Sox, the latest move in a continuing effort to shed assets unrelated to the company's flagship newspaper. 
The Times Company received $63 million for the stake and expects to record a pretax gain of about $38 million in the second quarter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. A company spokeswoman, Abbe Serphos, declined to say who had bought the shares.
Last summer, the Times Company sold more than half of its minority stake in the group, which owns the Red Sox and several other sports properties, for $117 million. A year earlier, the company sold a portion of its stake in the sports group to the venture capitalist Henry F. McCance.
In 2002, the Times Company paid $75 million for a 17.75 percent stake in Fenway. But the 2008 recession and the steady decline of print advertising revenue at newspapers like The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune have prompted the company to shed its nonessential assets.
Late last year, the Times Company sold its 16 regional newspapers, including The Gainesville Sun and The Sarasota Herald Tribune, to Halifax Media Holdings for $143 million.

HEADLINE: The Mother of All Bad TV Moms

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Sorry to bring this up on a weekend devoted to celebrating mothers, but you know all the things that have been wrong with young people for the past half-century? Mom's fault.
I've reached this conclusion after an exhaustive study of an inadvertent historical record that has been left to us: the decades' worth of sitcom mothers who have been caught on tape, as it were, giving dubious advice to children present and past.
At the start of this research, which consisted of watching whatever shows happened to be on TVLand-like channels in recent weeks or are in my DVD collection, I expected that modern-day mothers would be revealed to be shockingly lax, and they were. What I didn't expect was to learn that their mothers, and their mothers' mothers, were similarly irresponsible. And just as scientists have traced human lineage back to a mitochondrial Eve, the decline of motherhood can be traced to a single sitcom moment and a single sitcom matriarch. A momochondrial Margaret. 
But let's begin in the present. We all know instinctively that, though there are probably exceptions, in general kids today are immoral, nihilistic dunderheads. If American children are being outdone by young scholars in other countries, you need look no further than Mom to know why. Specifically, you need look no further than a recent episode of the ABC sitcom ''Last Man Standing.''
Vanessa Baxter (Nancy Travis), the mother in the family, is playing Scrabble with two of her daughters when one of them tries to play T-H-A-N-G. ''That's not a word,'' Vanessa says. The child who made the play stands by her ''thang,'' and the other child invites Vanessa to go look it up.
''Where's the dictionary?'' Vanessa asks.
''Upstairs,'' she is told. To which this lax mom responds, ''Fine; it's a word.''
Mothers, it seems, can't even be bothered to climb a flight of stairs in the interest of instilling good grammar in their offspring. No wonder American children are being outperformed academically all over the globe.
Why are our young people spending their time sexting instead of studying? Because for years Mom has been setting an appalling moral example. Take a 2006 episode of the CBS sitcom ''Still Standing'' called ''Still Sweet.''
The family teenager wants a Sweet 16 party and is looking through a magazine with her mother, Judy (Jami Gertz), for dresses. They come across one that Judy describes as ''just the kind of slutty thing Paris Hilton would wear.'' Then she adds, ''And I have just the shoes.''
From this we can conclude that mothers are responsible for the epidemic of scantily clad young people in the land. But where specifically did these kids lose their sense of modesty? Perhaps in a bar. Was that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) telling all sorts of lies to get her under-age daughter into an alcohol-serving establishment in a 2001 episode of ''Gilmore Girls''? Yes, it was.
The line of questionable mothering extends into the last century, with ABC's ''Roseanne'' perhaps the standout for its 221 episodes' worth of turpitude. Let's parse one small example, ''Lovers' Lane,'' from the first season, in 1988. Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) has extorted information about her older daughter's love interest from her younger daughter, Darlene. The child pleads with Mom not to tell big sister the source of the information.
''Oh, Honey, you know I'm smarter than that,'' Roseanne tells Darlene. ''I'll just hold it over your head for the rest of your life.'' How did all those manipulative bond traders and mortgage writers who destroyed the economy in 2008 become so unprincipled? In 1988, they, like Darlene, were impressionable kids, learning by example.
''Sure,'' you're thinking, ''but that was the '80s, a time of unrestrained wickedness. Go back a little further and you'll hit the golden age of mothering: Carol Brady, Laura Petrie, Harriet Nelson. And June Cleaver! You can't fault June Cleaver, can you?''
Actually, yes, I can. Look at ''Beaver and Chuey,'' a 1958 episode of ''Leave It to Beaver.'' Eddie Haskell has played a trick on the Beaver, and the Beav's older brother is rushing out the door to exact revenge.
''Wally,'' says June (Barbara Billingsley), ''where are you going?''
He replies, ''I'm going to go over and slug Eddie.''
To which this seminal, peerless mother says: ''Wally! That's no way to talk. This is Sunday.''
Wally grasps the moral relativism of the coming age instantly. He considers his mother's input, then tells her, ''Oh, yeah; I'll wait till tomorrow and slug him in the cafeteria.''
For young people in the ensuing decades, there would be no right or wrong, only arbitrary, fickle rules, which would soon be easily discarded, leading to unkempt hair, draft dodging, pot smoking and the drift and disorder that have been with us ever since.
But we can't really blame June Cleaver for all this. Turns out she was merely expanding on the example of momochondrial Margaret: Margaret Anderson (Jane Wyatt), a foundational television matriarch first seen four years earlier, when ''Father Knows Best'' had its premiere.
We don't often think of Margaret when we consider early TV mothers; this was, after all, a series centered on Robert Young's father figure, Jim Anderson. But isn't that how all societal decline starts? A trend or abuse slips in unnoticed, and the next thing you know, kids are being counseled to slug their playmates, dress like tramps and talk their way into bars.
I believe I have found the moment when mothers began sliding down the long, slippery slope. It's subtle; barely noticeable, really. It comes in Season 1, in an episode titled ''Live My Own Life.''
The Andersons' son, Bud, wants to move out. Jim is faking indifference to try to get him to change his mind, a strategy that Mom does not endorse.
''I'm not so sure he's handling it right,'' she tells her older daughter, Betty. ''Oh, it's not that I don't think your father has wonderful ideas. It's just that, well, they don't work.''
This was the moment that civilization began to fall apart. A mother has told her child that Father, the universal authority figure who for centuries has kept society from devolving into chaos, is an incompetent boob, and she has done so on a show named ''Father Knows Best.'' There can be no stability, no constancy after this. Margaret has effectively neutered the only thing standing between us and social and political anarchy, the Omniscient Patriarch. All of the bad TV mothering that followed was inevitable.
Perhaps you're thinking that this is a lot to hang on a few random bits of dialogue from fictional TV series, and that a half-dozen examples of good mothering could be found in the very same shows. Maybe. But here's the thing: I too am a product of one of these postmodern mothers. Where in the world would I have acquired the discipline and academic rigor to construct a well-researched, fully realized argument? Not from watching television, that's for sure.

HEADLINE: Oil Seen as Plentiful, but Expensive

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
LONDON (Reuters) -- Tension between Iran and the West is likely to keep oil prices high despite a significant improvement in world supply and a big buildup of oil stocks, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. 
The agency, which advises 28 industrialized nations on energy policy, said the soaring global oil supply from OPEC countries and the United States far outpaced global demand, curbed by poor economic activity in developed nations.
The agency said global oil supply rose to 91 million barrels a day in April, an increase of 600,000 barrels a day from March. But it said in its monthly oil market report that uncertainty remained because of ''geopolitical risks.''
In March, North Sea Brent crude futures rose above $128 per barrel as investors worried that a conflict between Iran and the West could cut off oil supplies from the Middle East.
But prices have fallen sharply over the past two months on the disappointing economic performances of European nations and the United States, and as geopolitical tensions have eased.
''The oil market is still jittery, but it is much less uneasy now that supplies and stocks have improved,'' said David Fyfe of the energy agency. ''A lot will depend on how much Iranian crude is lost to the market.''

HEADLINE: Chesapeake Energy Might Delay Asset Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Chesapeake Energy Corporation might delay asset sales to preserve cash flow needed to comply with requirements of its corporate credit facility, the company said on Friday, pushing its stock down to its lowest level in more than three years. Chesapeake, the nation's second-largest natural gas producer, faces a funding gap that Fitch Ratings estimated at $10 billion this year. To fill the void and trim its debt, the company intends to raise as much as $14 billion through the sale of assets and other deals. The company said that although asset sales would help its liquidity, selling properties currently producing oil and gas could reduce its cash flow and the value of collateral used to back its debt. Michael Kehs, a spokesman for the company, said the statement in the company's filing did not indicate a change in its efforts to raise money. Stock in Chesapeake, which is based in Oklahoma City, Okla., fell $2.37, or 13.8 percent, to $14.81 a share.

HEADLINE: New Guidelines May Sharply Increase Addiction Diagnoses

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In what could prove to be one of their most far-reaching decisions, psychiatrists and other specialists who are rewriting the manual that serves as the nation's arbiter of mental illness have agreed to revise the definition of addiction, which could result in millions more people being diagnosed as addicts and pose huge consequences for health insurers and taxpayers.
The revision to the manual, known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or D.S.M., would expand the list of recognized symptoms for drug and alcohol addiction, while also reducing the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis, according to proposed changes posted on the Web site of the American Psychiatric Association, which produces the book.
In addition, the manual for the first time would include gambling as an addiction, and it might introduce a catchall category -- ''behavioral addiction -- not otherwise specified'' -- that some public health experts warn would be too readily used by doctors, despite a dearth of research, to diagnose addictions to shopping, sex, using the Internet or playing video games. 
Part medical guidebook, part legal reference, the manual has long been embraced by government and industry. It dictates whether insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will pay for treatment, and whether schools will expand financing for certain special-education services. Courts use it to assess whether a criminal defendant is mentally impaired, and pharmaceutical companies rely on it to guide their research.
The broader language involving addiction, which was debated this week at the association's annual conference, is intended to promote more accurate diagnoses, earlier intervention and better outcomes, the association said. ''The biggest problem in all of psychiatry is untreated illness, and that has huge social costs,'' said Dr. James H. Scully Jr., chief executive of the group.
But the addiction revisions in the manual, scheduled for release in May 2013, have already provoked controversy similar to concerns previously raised about proposals on autism, depression and other conditions. Critics worry that changes to the definitions of these conditions would also sharply alter the number of people with diagnoses.
While the association says that the addiction definition changes would lead to health care savings in the long run, some economists say that 20 million substance abusers could be newly categorized as addicts, costing hundreds of millions of dollars in additional expenses.
''The chances of getting a diagnosis are going to be much greater, and this will artificially inflate the statistics considerably,'' said Thomas F. Babor, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who is an editor of the international journal Addiction. Many of those who get addiction diagnoses under the new guidelines would have only a mild problem, he said, and scarce resources for drug treatment in schools, prisons and health care settings would be misdirected.
''These sorts of diagnoses could be a real embarrassment,'' Dr. Babor added.
The scientific review panel of the psychiatric association has demanded more evidence to support the revisions on addiction, but several researchers involved with the manual have said that the panel is not likely to change its proposal significantly.
The controversies about the revisions have highlighted the outsize influence of the manual, which brings in more than $5 million annually to the association and is written by a group of 162 specialists in relative secrecy. Besieged from all sides, the association has received about 25,000 comments on the proposed changes from treatment centers, hospital representatives, government agencies, advocates for patient groups and researchers. The organization has declined to make these comments public.
While other medical specialties rely on similar diagnostic manuals, none have such influence. ''The D.S.M. is distinct from all other diagnostic manuals because it has an enormous, perhaps too large, impact on society and millions of people's lives,'' said Dr. Allen J. Frances, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke, who oversaw the writing of the current version of the manual and worked on previous editions. ''Unlike many other fields, psychiatric illnesses have no clear biological gold standard for diagnosing them. They present in different ways, and illnesses often overlap with each other.''
Dr. Frances has been one of the most outspoken critics of the new draft version, saying that overly broad and vaguely worded definitions will create more ''false epidemics'' and ''medicalization of everyday behavior.'' Like some others, he has also questioned whether a private association, whose members stand to gain from treating more patients, should be writing the manual, rather than an independent group or a federal agency.
Under the new criteria, people who often drink more than intended and crave alcohol may be considered mild addicts. Under the old criteria, more serious symptoms, like repeatedly missing work or school, being arrested or driving under the influence, were required before a person could receive a diagnosis as an alcohol abuser.
Dr. George E. Woody, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said that by describing addiction as a spectrum, the manual would reflect more accurately the distinction between occasional drug users and full-blown addicts. Currently, only about 2 million of the nation's more than 22 million addicts get treatment, partly because many of them lack health insurance.
Dr. Keith Humphreys, a psychology professor at Stanford who specializes in health care policy and who served as a drug control policy adviser to the White House from 2009 to 2010, predicted that as many as 20 million people who were previously not recognized as having a substance abuse problem would probably be included under the new definition, with the biggest increase among people who are unhealthy users, rather than severe abusers, of drugs.
''This represents the single biggest expansion in the quality and quantity of addiction treatment this country has seen in 40 years,'' Dr. Humphreys said, adding that the new federal health care law may allow an additional 30 million people who abuse drugs or alcohol to gain insurance coverage and access to treatment. Some economists have said that the number could be much lower, though, because many insurers will avoid or limit coverage of addiction treatment.
The savings from early intervention usually show up within a year, Dr. Humphreys said, and most patients with a new diagnosis would get consultations with nurses, doctors or therapists, rather than expensive prescriptions for medicines typically reserved for more severe abusers.
Many scholars believe that the new manual will increase addiction rates. A study by Australian researchers found, for example, that about 60 percent more people would be considered addicted to alcohol under the new manual's standards. Association officials expressed doubt, however, that the expanded addiction definitions would sharply increase the number of new patients, and they said that identifying abusers sooner could prevent serious complications and expensive hospitalizations.
''We can treat them earlier,'' said Dr. Charles P. O'Brien, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and the head of the group of researchers devising the manual's new addiction standards. ''And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants.''
Some critics of the new manual have said that it has been tainted by researchers' ties to pharmaceutical companies.
''The ties between the D.S.M. panel members and the pharmaceutical industry are so extensive that there is the real risk of corrupting the public health mission of the manual,'' said Dr. Lisa Cosgrove, a fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard, who published a study in March that said two-thirds of the manual's advisory task force members reported ties to the pharmaceutical industry or other financial conflicts of interest.
Dr. Scully, the association's chief, said the group had required researchers involved with writing the manual to disclose more about financial conflicts of interest than was previously required.
Dr. O'Brien, who led the addiction working group, has been a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis, all of which make drugs marketed to combat addiction.
He has also worked extensively as a paid consultant for Alkermes, a pharmaceutical company, studying a drug, Vivitrol, that combats alcohol and heroin addiction by preventing craving. He was the driving force behind adding ''craving'' to the new manual's list of recognized symptoms of addiction.
''I'm quite proud to have played a role, because I know that craving plays such an important role in addiction,'' Dr. O'Brien said, adding that he had never made any money from the sale of drugs that treat craving.
Dr. Howard B. Moss, associate director for clinical and translational research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, in Bethesda, Md., described opposition from many researchers to adding ''craving'' as a symptom of addiction. He added that he quit the group working on the addiction chapter partly out of frustration with what he described as a lack of scientific basis in the decision making.
''The more people diagnosed with cravings,'' Dr. Moss said, ''the more sales of anticraving drugs like Vivitrol or naltrexone.''

HEADLINE: Habitat for Humanity Tries A Large-Scale Approach To Housing in Oregon

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- John D. Gray, 92, got wind about three years ago, near the bottom of the Great Recession, that Habitat for Humanity was doing something pretty interesting here in Oregon's largest city. In a depressed real estate market, Habitat, the nonprofit housing group, was betting big: trying to buy vacant land on the cheap, shopping from banks in repossession and foreclosure sales to squirrel away for housing projects years in the future.
Mr. Gray knows a thing or two about business cycles and buying opportunities. He made his fortune after World War II selling chain-saw equipment for a once-burly timber industry in the Pacific Northwest, riding the crest of America's first real housing boom. So he called a friend, who set up a meeting with Habitat's local chief executive in east Portland. ''Would $1 million in cash help out in the effort?'' Mr. Gray asked.
His philanthropy in turn opened doors with other donors, including a lumber company heir who had never given to Habitat, but who was inspired by Mr. Gray's example to chip in $250,000. Mr. Gray then upped the ante again, adding another $1 million to the statewide Habitat for Humanity office. 
This spring, the first 22 homes in the largest Habitat project in Oregon history -- a 65-unit subdivision left partly built by a private developer who abandoned it when the market crashed -- are rising on Portland's east side. Habitat, meanwhile, has become the 10th-largest home builder in the Portland metropolitan area by housing volume, according to a local building trades association, and even more dominant on the lower-income east side through the $10 million land-bank fund that Mr. Gray helped anchor.
The 150 lots bought by the fund will keep the group busy for five years or more, even as it has increased its home-building output by 50 percent, to 30 homes a year from 20.
''Recirculation,'' Mr. Gray said in describing his money's new path, from the old lumber and construction scene of the 1950s and 1960s -- the G.I. Bill, suburbia on the rise, America in its lion phase on the world stage -- to the new era of wounded, postcrash housing economics. ''What they were doing seemed like a smart idea,'' he said.
Other Habitat branches have also pivoted in the recession, trying different angles in a dark time. In Nevada and Florida, for example, some Habitat groups stopped new construction entirely and shifted to renovation, buying abandoned properties in cities racked by high foreclosure rates. Across most of the nation, one-at-a-time houses, financed by church suppers and staffed by volunteer hammer swingers, are still the norm for Habitat, an ecumenical Christian group that was founded in 1976 in Georgia.
But business leaders and housing experts said Portland -- partly through Habitat's timing in betting big in a down market, partly through a donor network led by Mr. Gray that stepped up to help even as corporate support mostly collapsed -- was creating something that would resonate long after the recession: Habitat neighborhoods.
''That fact that John Gray had given us $1 million gave us legitimacy,'' said Steve Messinetti, the president and chief executive of Habitat Portland/ Metro East. ''And then the market, and the depressed prices, allowed us to carry out our goals.''
The scale and scope of the new Habitat projects, city officials say, will allow entire blocks on the east side to be anchored by owner-occupied housing. Those owners, under Habitat's model, would earn 30 percent to 60 percent of the median Portland area household income (around $20,000 to $40,000 a year for a family of four), living in homes they helped build themselves, and paying down their mortgages with zero-interest nonprofit loans.
''As a housing commissioner, we feel like we're trying to plug a lot of leaks in the dike,'' said Nick Fish, a Portland city commissioner in charge of the housing bureau and parks and recreation. And the city's budget has still not recovered from the downturn. Habitat, especially in east Portland, he said, is filling the gap.
''One of the ideas that they have floated is a plan, outside government, to take back blocks of the city, block by block, using their tool kit, with modest government contributions,'' he said. ''We can start building around their work.''
There was a kind of bleakly fortuitous stroke of luck in the Habitat capital project, Mr. Fish and other housing experts said. The area that Mr. Messinetti's Habitat branch was focused on, east Portland, was also the hardest hit by what Mr. Fish called the ''predatory lending and foreclosure mess.'' The city expanded its boundary east into what had been an unincorporated area in 1988, he said, and the final, frothy wave of the easy-money era broke there in an area that never shared the hip West Coast prosperity of downtown.
Now, as the economy here and along much of the coastal strip north to Seattle is recovering, vacant land in Portland is being snatched up. A big national homebuilder based in Miami, the Lennar Corporation, said in December that it was expanding in the Portland and Seattle markets, and prices for vacant land have soared, said Dave Nielsen, the chief executive of the Homebuilders Association of Metro Portland. ''Good for them,'' he said, referring to Habitat. ''If they were trying to do it now, they'd be in a bidding battle.''
Mr. Gray said that for him part of the appeal of a big Habitat play was the idea that social stability of families and neighborhoods and economic stability in housing go together. It is a lesson, he said, from personal experience. He grew up in the 1920s and '30s, the son of a rural schoolteacher who was widowed young and raised three boys in a four-room house with no running water.
On the dining room table of his downtown apartment, he pulled out a family album, stabbing a picture of the house with his finger, still amazed after more than 80 years that his mother's landlord, a farm family, never raised the rent -- $2.50 a month -- even after rural electrification came through in the 1930s.
Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who started his career at Habitat for Humanity, said he thought the housing bust, and Habitat's new chapter here, had validated the idea that different economic models have value.
Many of the families he worked with two decades ago in east Portland, for example, are still in their homes, he said, and the homes those families bought for $30,000 to $50,000 back then are now in some cases worth five times as much.

HEADLINE: Obama Returns to Topic Of Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
RENO, Nev. -- After unexpectedly endorsing same-sex marriage and injecting a volatile social issue into the 2012 race, President Obama returned to the topic of the economy Friday, promoting his proposals to allow more Americans to get low-interest mortgage refinancing.
His venue once again was Nevada, the state hardest hit by the housing bust four years ago, and also a swing state whose support he needs to win re-election. Last October, Mr. Obama chose Las Vegas to announce changes to an administration program that had produced disappointing results in three years; like then, he appeared here with homeowners who have benefited from the new policies. 
''It's going to take a long time for the economy to fully recover -- more time than any of us would like,'' Mr. Obama said as he stood with Valerie and Paul Keller in the driveway of their home, which they refinanced after hearing the president describe the changes in October -- saving, they estimated, $3,000 annually in lower mortgage payments.
In time for Mr. Obama's visit here, the administration released figures showing that nationwide, refinancing applications have increased by 50 percent since October, with the policy changes made that month accounting for about two-thirds of the additional activity.
The increases were greatest in the states hardest hit, the figures show. In Nevada, where six out of 10 homeowners owe more than their residence's value, refinancing applications are up 237 percent; in Arizona, where nearly half of borrowers are ''underwater,'' refinances are up 181 percent; and in Florida, with 44 percent underwater, refinances are up 126 percent. All three states are among the most competitive battlegrounds between Mr. Obama and his presumptive Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.
Eligibility restrictions and refinancing costs had kept many Americans from taking advantage of a 2009 program the administration put in place at the height of the crisis, officials said. Mr. Obama's moves last fall were designed to open up the program to homeowners who did not have enough equity in their properties to qualify for low-interest loans.
Those changes benefited people with mortgages backed by government-supported housing finance agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who had been keeping up with their mortgage payments.
Mrs. Keller, who told The Reno Gazette-Journal in an interview published on Friday that she did not necessarily support Mr. Obama, said she approached lenders in October after hearing the president's comments in Las Vegas; in April the Kellers closed on a new mortgage. Because the Kellers were underwater -- that is, their home was worth about $100,000, less than they paid for it 14 years ago and less than their $168,000 mortgage -- they had not previously qualified for refinancing.
While Mr. Obama was able last fall to expand refinancing options by executive order, and more recently to similarly reduce refinancing fees, the White House said further steps to make home financing easier would require Congress to act on legislation recently introduced by Democrats in the Senate. The housing proposals comprise one element of a five-point ''to-do list'' that Mr. Obama publicized this week to goad Republicans to pass legislation not only on housing finance but on small business and veterans.
According to the administration, the proposed changes would remove additional barriers so more borrowers whose homes have lost value in the housing crisis could get new mortgages, for example by waiving a requirement for costly new home appraisals. They would also provide incentives for lenders to compete for homeowners' business, and make several million more people eligible for refinancing by expanding the existing three-year-old program to those who do not have mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac but who are current on their payments.
To encourage homeowners to rebuild their equity, Mr. Obama has also proposed that closing costs be covered for borrowers who apply their mortgage savings to their principal.
''I'm calling on Congress to give every responsible homeowner a chance to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage,'' he said.
The White House and the Obama campaign have been eager to promote initiatives to spur the housing market and to put more money in homeowners' pockets, not only because the housing slump remains a drag on the economy. They also believe Mr. Romney is vulnerable on the issue, given his past statements that the housing market should be allowed to bottom out without government intervention.

HEADLINE: Bet by a Bank: Its Confidence Yields to Loss

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS, ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, MARK SCOTT and NATHANIEL POPPER; Reporting was contributed by Azam Ahmed, Susanne Craig, Michael J. de la Merced, Julie Creswell and Nelson D. Schwartz.

 BODY:
When reports emerged in the first week of April that a JPMorgan Chase trader in London was making bets so big they were distorting a little-known market in credit derivatives, an embedded regulator approached executives.
The senior supervisor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one of roughly 40 Fed officials who work inside the bank, was told that senior management was not overly concerned about the reports, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The executives had been assured that things were fine by Ina Drew, the bank's overall chief investment officer, and Bruno Iksil, the so-called London Whale leading the trade. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, who had been traveling in Dallas and Atlanta that week, returned to tell analysts that the reports were ''a complete tempest in a teapot.''
That would soon change. A week and a half later, top executives in a conference room on the 48th floor of the bank's Park Avenue headquarters realized they had a problem. 
Losses were mounting on the trade as hedge funds' bets against the bank turned profitable. Conference calls between New York and London were not producing satisfactory answers. A team of risk officers now referred to as the Navy Seals began meeting twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., with Mr. Dimon frequently in attendance.
The trading unit, called the chief investment office, was a star performer within the bank, producing profits even while intended to mitigate risk. But questions were being raised about what the trading unit was telling top executives in New York. Concerned risk executives began producing an analysis of the ''Whale'' trade every day and updating the New York Fed.
JPMorgan also contacted the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the national banking regulator, and Securities and Exchange Commission officials.
People inside the firm say that Ms. Drew campaigned vigorously to keep the trade on initially. These same people now say she and some of her colleagues are likely to be fired or forced to resign; however, no decisions have been made.
The mistakes ''were self-inflicted, and this is not how we want to run a business,'' Mr. Dimon said on Thursday evening when the bank disclosed that it had at least $2 billion of trading losses as a result of the strategy. The bank warned that the losses could grow, and further market turmoil on Friday threatened to add to the tally.
While the loss is not a huge threat to a bank as large and powerful as JPMorgan, whose shares tumbled 9.3 percent on Friday, it is a stark reminder that the banking system remains vulnerable to market shocks more than three years after the financial crisis. It has heightened concerns that big banks continue to make risky financial bets that could threaten the economy.
And additional fallout potentially awaits JPMorgan. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently opened a preliminary investigation into JPMorgan's accounting practices and public disclosures about the trades, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is not public.
The inquiry, which is being run out of New York, will probably examine the bank's past regulatory filings about the internal unit that placed the trades, as well as recent statements from the firm's top executives.
The surprise loss and the regulatory scrutiny has now swung a harsh spotlight on a unit of JPMorgan that few people outside Wall Street knew existed.
The unit, which employs fewer than 40 people across the bank's international offices, was created to manage the bank's exposure to complicated global financial transactions, like interest rate changes and currency movements.
And unlike JPMorgan's deal-making investment banking unit, the chief investment office was supposed to keep its head down, carrying out trades that protected the bank from the volatility caused by the recent financial crisis, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Yet what began as a way to hedge against risk has turned into a major liability. Many of the problems can be traced to the aftermath of the financial crisis.
In 2007, the bank hired Achilles Macris of Greece, who previously was the head of global capital markets at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. He was charged with running the unit's European operations on the sixth floor of JPMorgan's offices near St. Paul's Cathedral in London's financial district.
As part of an expansion, Mr. Macris turned to a number of former hedge fund and investment banking experts to bulk up the European team.
Under the leadership of Mr. Macris in London and Ms. Drew in New York, the group's exposure to financial markets ballooned. Ms. Drew - one of the highest-ranking women and one of the highest-paid executives at the bank, making $15.5 million last year - is widely viewed as a natural trader with an eye for unusual opportunities to strike a profit.
The business's investment securities portfolio more than tripled to $356 billion in 2011, compared with $76.5 billion in 2007, according to company filings. The rise was in part a result of the extra exposure related to JPMorgan's acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008.
The unit's exposure to risk also rose sharply. The group's average ''value at risk,'' or the amount the unit could potentially lose on any given day, stood at $57 million in 2011, according to company filings. That is just shy of the $58 million of average value at risk at JPMorgan's much larger investment banking business, which includes the firm's trading units.
Mr. Dimon knew about the expansion of the unit, whose increasing risks didn't raise concerns presumably because its profits were rising.
In 2009, the unit's net income peaked at $3.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion the previous year. The jump in earnings in 2009 resulted from large purchases of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the United States government, according to a company filing. Net income for last year totaled $411 million.
Last summer the chief investment office began calling brokers at several Wall Street banks, the brokers say. The office was offering to sell insurance on an index of big American corporations like General Mills, Alcoa and McDonald's - known as CDX IG Series 9. If the companies in the index went bankrupt, JPMorgan would have to pay out, but if the companies continued to do well JPMorgan could rake in the fees from financial firms that bought the insurance.
The strategy initially made money for JPMorgan and its position began to grow, as did an appetite for it among a tight-knit segment of hedge funds focused on credit opportunities. The large scale of the trade was permitted as a result of an expansion in the limits placed on the size and the scope of securities the unit could trade in that were adopted after JPMorgan acquired Washington Mutual in the financial crisis. Those limits have now been scaled back.
By January, these hedge funds were getting calls nearly every day from brokers representing the chief investment office, according to hedge fund managers and brokers on the calls.
The seller's identity was not supposed to be known, but the sheer volume of the trade made it hard to hide, and soon enough all fingers in the ''small, clubby world'' of credit hedge funds pointed to Mr. Iksil's desk at JPMorgan, according to one fund manager.
''A bunch of us started looking at it and talking about it a lot,'' the manager said. ''There was agreement that Bruno was selling.''
There were two ways that JPMorgan could win this bet. If the companies in the index did well, the bank's cost of insuring the index would continue to fall. JPMorgan could also artificially drive the price lower by continuing to issue more and more insurance - a distinct possibility thanks to JPMorgan's size and stature.
In January and February, as the price of the insurance continued to drop, lunch meetings and casual conversations between hedge fund managers swirled around the ability of JPMorgan to continue financing this bet.
''A lot of people told me it was a foolish trade,'' said an official with a hedge fund that bet against JPMorgan. ''The naysayers on this trade said, 'Look, this guy has unlimited firepower, he can just keep selling and selling and make your life miserable.' ''
Among the hedge funds that began taking positions against JPMorgan were Blue Mountain, a New York fund; Lucidus Capital Partners, a London fund; Hutchin Hill, a New York fund; and Bluecrest, a giant London hedge fund founded by two former traders on JPMorgan's proprietary trading desk.
The trade did not at first make money for the hedge funds. In the improving economy early in the year, the hedge funds had to make regular insurance payments. But in late March, doubts about the economy began to swirl, and the index jumped.
JPMorgan began seeing losses by the end of the first quarter, on March 31, but they were not enormous, allowing bank executives to shrug off the early criticisms of the trade. But the trade drew increasing attention as the index continued to spike, multiplying JPMorgan's potential losses if it had to pay out on the insurance.
Soon United States and British regulators were talking daily with bank executives. (The New York Fed has been following the chief investment office practically since its inception, as part of its regular supervision of the firm.)
The Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is at an early stage. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of any wrongdoing.
An important avenue for the S.E.C. investigation, people briefed on the matter said, is the firm's accounting methods relating to the trades. Investigators could take a close look at how the bank reported risk for the chief investment office and whether changes it made to that measure were adequately disclosed.
In the first quarter, JPMorgan changed its risk measurement to one it felt was more in line with recent regulatory changes involving capital requirements. Yet the bank had issues with the model, and Mr. Dimon said on Thursday that it was later deemed ''inadequate.''
JPMorgan, said a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record, did not need regulatory approval to change its risk model, but eventually would have to. Other firms said they tended to work in concert with regulators when altering this model.
The change clearly masked the risk of the trades now under the microscope. Mr. Dimon disclosed that the daily value at risk for the trading unit had almost doubled, from an average of $67 million for the first quarter, to $129 million, after the bank scrapped the new model and revised the figures.
One senior Wall Street executive speculated the change might have assigned a lower risk weighting to big trades, allowing the bank to take more risk than it should have in recent months.
In the case of the trade that generated the huge loss, the insurance on the contract does not come due until 2017, so JPMorgan could potentially hold off any actual losses until then. If the economy improves, the cost of insuring American companies could drop again. But now that the London Whale's trade is public, hedge funds could force the cost of this specific insurance contract up, and with it JPMorgan's paper losses. This is what appears to be happening now.
On Friday, the insurance index spiked sharply, bringing it up 32 percent from its low in March.
''There are no buyers or sellers in the market right now. Because of that, it is impossible for JPMorgan to get out of this trade,'' said Gennaro Pucci, who oversees the PVE Macro Credit Fund in London. ''These positions, which made sense for them to put on, just become impossible to manage when liquidity dries up.''
A senior Wall Street executive said on Friday: ''JPMorgan violated the cardinal rule of risk: Don't become the market.''

HEADLINE: When Will They Learn?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
''It plays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there,'' sighed Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, on Thursday.
He was on a conference call to analysts and reporters, and he tossed off that throwaway line in the course of acknowledging that his bank has lost some $2 billion on a complicated hedging strategy that had gone terribly awry. And, yes, he's right: The giant loss, which involved credit default swaps -- the same derivatives that had done so much damage during the financial crisis -- does, indeed, play into the hands of the pundits. As well it should.
For much of the last three years, as the Obama administration and Congress have grappled with how to rein in a financial system that had lost both its moorings and its ethical compass, no one has been more vocal in his opposition to a more regulated banking system than Dimon. He has complained repeatedly about higher capital requirements. He has said that some proposed regulations were ''anti-American.'' He has consistently flayed the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, which was ultimately Congress's attempt to prevent another Lehman Brothers-style meltdown. 
As for derivatives, Dimon took the view that most of what Dodd-Frank proposes to do -- such as make derivatives more transparent, while eliminating the ability of banks to make proprietary trades, thanks to the so-called Volcker Rule -- was unnecessary if not downright counterproductive.
What gave Dimon the stature to be the standard-bearer against Dodd-Frank -- even as other major bank executives lay low -- was that JPMorgan had shrewdly avoided the problems that had crushed most other large financial institutions during the crisis. Give Dimon credit for that.
But in his hubris, Dimon was never willing to acknowledge that just because he had sidestepped yesterday's problems didn't mean he was going to sidestep tomorrow's. Or that institutions that are ultimately backstopped by the taxpayer have a special responsibility to the country to stay out of trouble. Even if it means a lower share price. Or a smaller pay package. Or less risk-taking. Keeping banks from harming themselves is exactly what Dodd-Frank is intended to do.
One clever pundit has described the criticism heaped on Dimon ever since he announced the big trading loss as ''Dimonfreude.'' Who can deny that there is something delicious about seeing so public a comeuppance? But there is an important policy point here, too. The big loss -- which, it's worth pointing out, was not the result of a rogue trader, but was rather part of a strategy that had the backing of the bank's risk executives -- gives the lie to Dimon's antiregulatory rhetoric like almost nothing else could.
As Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland -- and a former official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- explained in an e-mail that landed in my in-box early Friday morning, it is quite likely that the loss would never have occurred if Dodd-Frank's proposed rules about derivatives had been in place. For starters, if the trades turn out to be proprietary trades -- and we don't yet know if they are -- they would have been forbidden under the Volcker Rule.
But even if JPMorgan wasn't trading for its own account, the transparency Dodd-Frank mandates would have alerted the markets and ''losses would not have piled up opaquely,'' Greenberger wrote. The Federal Reserve would have seen the trades, and would likely have forced JPMorgan to back away from them.
(That the rules are not in place, two years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, is partly a function of their complexity, and partly a function of fierce lobbying by the banks -- led by JPMorgan -- to water them down.)
In his conference call, Dimon claimed that the disastrous hedging strategy had not violated the Volcker Rule. Rather, he said, it violated the ''Dimon principle.'' By which he meant, I think, that it was an example of the kind of dumb risk-taking that JPMorgan usually avoids.
But that's just the point, isn't it? Even at a bank as ostensibly well-run as JPMorgan, the incentives still exist for giant, risky bets to be made that can go very wrong. JPMorgan can withstand a $2 billion hit, but not every bank can -- and who's to say that the next derivatives debacle won't be $5 billion or $10 billion? Jamie Dimon is undoubtedly a very good bank chieftain, but he's only one man in a large institution; he can't oversee every trade. The only way to change incentives industrywide -- and get bank risk-taking under better control -- is through a combination of tougher rules and more transparency. Which is precisely what Dodd-Frank aims to do.
It is unlikely, of course, that Jamie Dimon will come around to that view in the wake of this debacle. But, with any luck, the rest of us will, Congress and the regulators very much included.

HEADLINE: Intolerance May Carry A Price For States

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Last weekend, former President Bill Clinton took to North Carolina phone lines with a recorded message warning of the perils of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and civil unions. ''What it will change is North Carolina's ability to keep good businesses, attract new jobs, and attract and keep talented entrepreneurs,'' Mr. Clinton asserted. ''If it passes, your ability to keep those businesses, get those jobs and get those talented entrepreneurs will be weakened.''
That argument landed with a thud, as North Carolina voters resoundingly supported the amendment by a margin of 20 percentage points, and 93 of the state's 100 counties voted for the proposition that marriage is exclusively between a man and a woman. Notwithstanding President Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage this week, North Carolina joins 30 other states with constitutional bans on same-sex marriage that now stretch in an uninterrupted swath from Florida to Oregon. 
Mr. Clinton's message that constitutional bans on same-sex marriage are bad for business hardly seems self-evident. North Carolina is perennially ranked at or near the top of the best states in which to do business. Two of its major rivals for the top honor, Texas and Virginia, also have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages and civil unions, and Virginia even bans ''any marriagelike contract'' between unmarried persons. New York and Massachusetts, both tolerant of same-sex marriage, usually rank at or near the bottom of states in which to do business.
If banning same-sex unions is really bad for business, no one would know it from major North Carolina corporations, whose silence was deafening. In contrast was New York, where Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, appeared in a video supporting same-sex marriage, and other businesses openly and enthusiastically supported the campaign to legalize it. In Washington State, Microsoft, Starbucks, Nike and Amazon have all supported it. But not one of the 15 Fortune 500 corporations based in North Carolina did. These include such major national companies as Bank of America, Lowe's, Nucor, VF Corporation (best known for its Wrangler and Timberland brands) and BB&T Corporation.
Moreover, ''there's little or no evidence that same-sex couples consider the issue of lesbian-bisexual-gay-transgender laws in deciding where to move,'' Gary Gates told me this week. Mr. Gates is a demographer, co-author of the book ''The Gay and Lesbian Atlas'' and distinguished fellow at the Williams Institute of the University of California, Los Angeles, which studies lesbian-bisexual-gay-transgender issues. ''Their patterns look like the broader patterns in the U.S. They're moving south and west. For everyone who moves, the main reason is for a job. Even for the L.G.B.T. community, the top issue is the job. Marriage rights are secondary.''
And yet there's mounting evidence that a state's support for same-sex marriage yields important benefits for business, especially with the younger, highly educated, affluent population avidly courted by most employers. Brian Ellner, who led the successful Human Rights Campaign for marriage equality in New York, said, ''We heard over and over from the C.E.O.'s of major corporations that they don't want any impediments to recruiting the best people, period, whether they're people who want to live in a tolerant city or state or gay people who want to live where they feel their families will be protected and safe.''
He described business support in New York as enormously important. ''They're the job creators and the engines of the economy and so important to the health and well-being of the state. And they were on our side.''
In Washington State, where same-sex marriages are scheduled to begin June 7 unless opponents gather enough signatures to force a referendum, major employers have been sounding similar themes. Starbucks said in January as the state Legislature was considering allowing same-sex marriage that it ''strives to create a company culture that puts our partners first, and our company has a lengthy history of leading and supporting policies that promote equality and inclusion.'' Microsoft, the first Fortune 500 company to provide same-sex domestic partnership benefits in 1993, said, ''Washington's employers are at a disadvantage if we cannot offer a similar, inclusive environment to our talented employees, our top recruits and their families'' as states that permit same-sex marriage. ''Employers in the technology sector,'' it went on, ''face an unprecedented national and global competition for top talent.''
In response, the antigay-marriage National Organization for Marriage called in March for a nationwide boycott of Starbucks that so far seems to have had scant effect. Starbucks revenue grew 15 percent in the most recent quarter, to a record $3.2 billion.
''It would be great if they were taking a stand because it's the right thing to do,'' said Mr. Gates, the demographer, who lives with his husband in Seattle. ''But they understand that marriage equality is a mechanism for them to attract and retain talent. It's not just about gay people, because the truth is, there aren't enough gay people to make a huge impact. But it signals a kind of openness to people who are different. It sends a signal to people, straight or gay, that this is a place where they can potentially thrive. That's especially critical for companies that rely on people who have to be creative, entrepreneurial and innovative.''
There is data to suggest that members of the so-called creative class, a phrase coined by Richard Florida in his 2003 book ''The Rise of the Creative Class,'' with an updated version due out next month, are disproportionately influenced by a state's attitude on issues like same-sex marriage. This group, which Mr. Florida estimates at more than 35 million people, tends to be mobile, affluent and well educated. ''These people have choices,'' Mr. Ellner noted, ''and if you're gay and you can be married in New York or Boston, would you opt for that over North Carolina? Of course you would.''
Mr. Florida, now a professor at the University of Toronto, and Mr. Gates collaborated on a 2002 study for the Brookings Institution, called ''Technology and Tolerance: The Importance of Diversity to High-Technology Growth.'' The two concluded that ''perhaps our most striking finding is that a leading indicator of a metropolitan area's high-technology success is a large gay population.'' They continued, ''Frequently cited as a harbinger of redevelopment and gentrification in distressed urban neighborhoods, the presence of gays in a metro area signals a diverse and progressive environment.'' They noted that the five metro areas with the highest concentration of gay residents -- San Francisco, Washington, Austin, Atlanta and San Diego -- are among the nation's top 15 high-tech areas.
''Why the correlation? It's not that gays and lesbians equal economic growth or are more entrepreneurial,'' Professor Florida told me this week, ''but because places that are open-minded and diverse attract people who are original thinkers, and these communities percolate with entrepreneurial and creative ideas.''
Typical of such areas is Raleigh-Durham, site of North Carolina's vaunted Research Triangle, and located in one of the few counties that voted against the ban on same-sex marriage. ''The Triangle is tolerant and has a long legacy as a home to colleges and universities where gays and lesbians are welcome,'' Professor Florida said. ''I wouldn't doubt that they're up in arms. North Carolina has just put itself further beyond the eight ball.''
Jim Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy, with its headquarters in Charlotte, was one of the few executives in the state to speak out against the amendment, though he stressed he was giving his personal views and not speaking for Duke Energy. ''I'm old-fashioned,'' he told an audience at the Carmel Country Club in April. ''I believe we're all the children of God, and we shouldn't have special rules for some and not for others. I will go a step further. If this amendment passes, we're going to look back 20 years from now or 10 years from now, and we're going to think about that amendment the same way we think about the Jim Crow laws that were passed in this state many, many years ago.'' He added: ''We're competing with people around the world. We've got to be inclusive and open.''
Stuart Campbell, the executive director of Equality North Carolina, a gay lobbying group that campaigned against the amendment, said the North Carolina vote sent the wrong message. ''If I was offered a job in a state that was actively hostile to gays and lesbians, I'd have second thoughts about taking the job.'' He said 80 North Carolina businesses opposed the amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and many business leaders spoke privately in opposition to it. But only one sizable company -- the privately owned Replacements Inc., which sells silver, china and glassware and has a gay founder and chief executive -- publicly opposed the amendment. ''Given that this is a Southern state in the Bible Belt, there is still a concern among business leaders about not getting out in front of social issues.'' Mr. Campbell said. ''It's not Washington or New York.''

HEADLINE: The Bet That Blew Up For Chase: A Huge Loss Stains Dimon, One of Banking's Top Risk Managers

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Days before revelations of JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss rocked Wall Street, the company's always-confident chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was his usual exuberant self.
When the bosses of six of the largest banks gathered at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in downtown Manhattan to meet with a top Fed governor, the others used the underground garage and avoided the cameras. Mr. Dimon came and went through the front door, and even chatted with a CNBC reporter.
It was a stance familiar to Mr. Dimon. He had steered his bank successfully through the financial crisis, and was known as Wall Street's best risk manager, not to mention the most influential banker in the country when it came to writing new regulations in Washington.
He was so well regarded by the administration that the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, was even tapped to appear at the bank's board meeting back in 2009 before the appearance was scuttled. More recently, Mr. Dimon has visited Washington numerous times, seeing both allies and sparring partners like Representative Barney Frank. 
Now, though, Mr. Dimon's reputation and possibly his influence have been cut down to size.
The trading loss disclosed late Thursday is a rare misstep by a man who prides himself on having his fingers on the pulse of his 270,000-employee company, and it suggests his vaunted confidence edged toward hubris.
Mr. Dimon said in an interview on Friday that he got a call from the company's chief risk officer about the trading problem in late April. He had been briefed about once a quarter on the complicated credit derivatives position and more recently had been looking into the size of the credit bet after press reports in early April.
''Of course I was angry,'' he said in an interview Friday. ''I said, 'Stop, let's learn and get the other people involved,' '' he recalled.
''We were meeting constantly,'' he added. ''Believe me, for the past couple of weeks, it was the primary thing going on in my world.''
In a statement, Mr. Frank said that JPMorgan ''has lost, in this one set of transactions, five times the amount they claim financial regulation is costing them.''And that reality may cost Mr. Dimon in Washington. He has been marshaling the firm's considerable resources to help sway the regulators who are writing many of the rules in the Dodd-Frank banking reform bill passed in 2010. So far this year, JPMorgan has spent $1.92 million on lobbying. In 2010, it topped the industry in lobbying dollars with $7.41 million.
Mr. Dimon has also been a frequent visitor to Washington to further make his case to lawmakers. According to the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group, he has made 10 visits to regulators over the past two years to discuss Dodd-Frank, principally at the Treasury Department.
Known as a blunt executive not afraid to raise his voice, Mr. Dimon has been one of the few bankers who still commanded respect from analysts and investors as well as regulators. Mr. Dimon routinely grills executives to make sure they are prepared for a variety of contingencies, according to employees at the New York bank.
New York born, Mr. Dimon was the heir apparent at Citigroup, where he was mentored by Sanford I. Weill. But, in 1998, he abruptly left in a management shake-up by Mr. Weill. It was that move that catapulted him to Chicago, where he took over the top job at Bank One in 2000, then a midsize bank considered a basket case. Under his leadership, the bank's health improved sharply, and he merged it with JPMorgan Chase in 2004.
Since then, JPMorgan Chase's shares have vastly outperformed those of troubled giants like Bank of America and Citigroup. In 2011, Mr. Dimon's overall compensation totaled more than $23 million, an 11 percent increase from 2010.
Mr. Dimon was also known for warning how dangerous one misstep could be. In April 2007, just as the first signs were emerging of what would become the subprime mortgage crisis, Mr. Dimon had a message for 200 new managing directors assembled at the company's headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.
''One deal doesn't make or break us,'' he said, according to one banker who was present. ''But the implications of one bad deal on our franchise are significant.''
And while the mortgage mess helped take down Bear Stearns and Lehman, once formidable rivals, JPMorgan Chase largely sidestepped the worst.
So while other bank executives emerged from the 2008 market turmoil more chastened, Mr. Dimon became more confident, emboldened by his successful navigation of the financial crisis, rival bank executives said.
Former JPMorgan employees said that Mr. Dimon's swagger was infectious. ''It made everyone more confident,'' a former JPMorgan trader said. ''Maybe too confident because there might not be as much neurotic double-checking of everything.''
Just weeks before the blowup, that confidence was evident. Doug Braunstein, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, dismissed concerns about the trading that would later blow up in the bank's chief investment office. In an interview, Mr. Braunstein said he was ''very comfortable with the positions we have.''
Under Mr. Dimon's leadership, the chief investment office - which was responsible for the outsize credit bet - was retooled to make larger bets with the bank's money, a former employee said. Bank executives said the chief investment office expanded after JPMorgan Chase's 2008 acquisition of Washington Mutual, which added riskier securities to the company's portfolio. The idea behind the strategy was to offset that risk.
One part of that expanded strategy - the losing credit derivatives bet - was starting to go against the bank by early April, but it wasn't until after quarterly earnings were released on April 13 that the magnitude of the problem became apparent.
Immediately, Mr. Dimon assembled an eight-person team under John Hogan, the company's chief risk officer, to assess the risks and defuse what had become a ticking time bomb. ''I said, 'Let's go get the A-Team.' ''
While he was aware of the broader intent, he said he was not aware of the intricacies of the complicated and ultimately dangerous bet until then.
Mr. Dimon has been a prominent critic of elements of the Volcker Rule, which would impose strict limits on the kind of trading risks banks are permitted to undertake with their own money. The measure, passed in 2010, is now being completed.
With a seat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, Mr. Dimon had a strong voice in the rule-making process.
Now Mr. Dimon, a skilled master of relations with the media, is having to do some fancy footwork. He taped a segment on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Wednesday, one day before he revealed the disastrous trade. On Friday, he went back to apologize again for the losses. In recent days, he has been characteristically blunt but unusually contrite.
''We never said we never make mistakes,'' Mr. Dimon added Friday. ''Hopefully, the smaller the better, but this one is not so small.'' Despite the trading blowup, many of the same regulators Mr. Dimon has tangled with over the years were quick to defend him.
Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said ''even very good management can miss stuff.'' She added that Mr. Dimon did have ''a very stellar record of good decision-making.''

HEADLINE: Bank's Lobbyists Sought Loophole On Risky Trading

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington and Ben Protess from Chicago.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Soon after lawmakers finished work on the nation's new financial regulatory law, a team of JPMorgan Chase lobbyists descended on Washington. Their goal was to obtain special breaks that would allow banks to make big bets in their portfolios, including some of the types of trading that led to the $2 billion loss now rocking the bank.
Several visits over months by the bank's well-connected chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and his top aides were aimed at persuading regulators to create a loophole in the law, known as the Volcker Rule. The rule was designed by Congress to limit the very kind of proprietary trading that JPMorgan was seeking.
Even after the official draft of the Volcker Rule regulations was released last October, JPMorgan and other banks continued their full-court press to avoid limits. 
In early February, a group of JPMorgan executives met with Federal Reserve officials and warned that anything but a loose interpretation of the trading ban would hurt the bank's hedging activities, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. In the past, the bank argued that it needed to hedge risk stemming from its large retail banking business, but it has also said that it supported portions of the Volcker Rule.
In the February meeting was Ina Drew, the head of JPMorgan's chief investment office, the unit that suffered the $2 billion loss.
JPMorgan officials declined to comment for this article. But in the company's annual report, Mr. Dimon wrote: ''If the intent of the Volcker Rule was to eliminate pure proprietary trading and to ensure that market making is done in a way that won't jeopardize a financial institution, we agree.''
He added: ''We, however, do disagree with some of the proposed specifics because we think they could have huge negative unintended consequences for American competitiveness and economic growth.''
JPMorgan wasn't the only large institution making a special plea, but it stood out because of Mr. Dimon's prominence as a skilled Washington operator and because of his bank's nearly unblemished record during the financial crisis.
''JPMorgan was the one that made the strongest arguments to allow hedging, and specifically to allow this type of portfolio hedging,'' said a former Treasury official who was present during the Dodd-Frank debates.
Those efforts produced ''a big enough loophole that a Mack truck could drive right through it,'' Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the legislation that led to the Volcker Rule, said Friday after the disclosure of the JPMorgan loss.
The loophole is known as portfolio hedging, a strategy that essentially allows banks to view an investment portfolio as a whole and take actions to offset the risks of the entire portfolio. That contrasts with the traditional definition of hedging, which matches an individual security or trading position with an inversely related investment -- so when one goes up, the other goes down.
Portfolio hedging ''is a license to do pretty much anything,'' Mr. Levin said. He and Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who worked on the law with Mr. Levin, sent a letter to regulators in February, making clear that hedging on that scale was not their intention.
''There is no statutory basis to support the proposed portfolio hedging language,'' they wrote, ''nor is there anything in the legislative history to suggest that it should be allowed.''
While the banks lobbied furiously, they were in some ways pushing on an open door. Officials at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, the main overseer of the banks, as well as the Comptroller of the Currency, also wanted a loose set of restrictions, according to people who took part in the drafting of the Volcker Rule who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no regulatory agencies would officially talk about the rule on Friday.
The Fed and the Treasury's views prevailed in the face of opposition from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulate markets and companies' reporting of their financial positions. Both commissions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits, pushed for tighter restrictions, the people said.
Even some of those who have said the Volcker Rule is fatally flawed agree that, in its current form, the rule would have allowed JPMorgan Chase to do what it did.
''Would the Dodd-Frank law have stopped this?'' asked Peter J. Wallison, a fellow in financial policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who has been a consistent critic of the postfinancial crisis reforms. ''No,'' he answered. ''Dodd-Frank specifically allows hedging and market-making transactions.''
The Volcker Rule was not intended to offer such a broad exemption to the ban on proprietary trading. People involved with the drafting of the Dodd-Frank law itself say that the authors fought repeatedly to tighten the language, in part to specifically exclude portfolio hedging.
In its earliest form, the Merkley-Levin amendment to the Dodd-Frank regulatory law said that any ''risk-mitigating hedging activity'' -- or hedging positions that reduced a bank's risk -- would be allowed. Through several drafts, that exception was steadily narrowed. The final law permitted only hedges tied to specific investments.
But when the proposed rules were released in October 2011, more than a year after Dodd-Frank went into effect, the exemptions were much broader, and allowing a bank to use hedging techniques in a portfolio was included as a potential loophole.
The drafters recognized that the exemption could be a potential problem. In soliciting comments from bankers, they specifically asked if portfolio hedging created ''the potential for abuse of the hedging exemption'' or make it too difficult to tell whether certain bets are hedging or prohibited trading.
Paul A. Volcker thinks there is a potential for abuse. Mr. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman whose advocacy for the proprietary trading ban was so fierce that his name was attached to it, told a Congressional hearing this year that with hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives being traded, ''you have to wonder whether they're all directed toward some explicit protection against some explicit risk.''
Mr. Dimon said on Thursday that JPMorgan's ''synthetic credit portfolio,'' an amalgam of derivatives and hedging bets that blew up in recent weeks, was part of ''a strategy to hedge the firm's overall credit exposure.'' But ''Volcker allows that,'' he said.
That was not the intent of the law, said Phil Angelides, who headed the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. ''I think the regulators need to go back and sharpen their pencils,'' Mr. Angelides said. ''The intent of the law was to stop insured depositories from doing propriety trading with this kind of risk profile.'' And whatever JPMorgan calls it, ''it sure looks like proprietary trading, which Dodd-Frank was designed to stop insured depositories from engaging in.''

HEADLINE: Romney's Adversarial View of Russia Stirs Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney's recent declaration that Russia is America's top geopolitical adversary drew raised eyebrows and worse from many Democrats, some Republicans and the Russians themselves, all of whom suggested that Mr. Romney was misguidedly stuck in a cold war mind-set.
But his statement was not off the cuff -- and it was not the first time Mr. Romney had stirred debate over his hawkish views on Russia. Interviews with Republican foreign policy experts close to his campaign and his writings on the subject show that his stance toward Russia reflects a broader foreign policy view that gives great weight to economic power and control of natural resources. It also exhibits Mr. Romney's confidence that his private-sector experience would make him a better negotiator on national security issues than President Obama has been.
Mr. Romney's views on Russia have set off disagreements among some of his foreign policy advisers. They put him in sync with the more conservative members of his party in Congress, who have similarly criticized Mr. Obama as being too accommodating to Russia, and generally reflect the posture of some neoconservatives. 
But they have frequently put him at odds with members of the Republican foreign policy establishment, like Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who was defeated in a primary this week, and the party's shrinking band of foreign policy ''realists'' -- those who advocate a less ideological and more pragmatic view of relations with rival powers.
The Romney campaign has been critical of Mr. Obama's record and positions on a variety of national security issues, including containing Iran's nuclear ambitions and confronting China's rise. But many of the positions taken by Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, have either been vague or not fundamentally different from those of the administration.
Russia, however, is an exception, one where Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has carved out a clear contrast to Mr. Obama, who came to office promising to ''reset'' relations with Moscow, only to find that Russia can be a difficult partner. Just this week, President Vladimir V. Putin abruptly canceled his plans to visit the United States next week for the Group of 8 summit meeting and for talks with Mr. Obama at Camp David.
Mr. Romney was a leading opponent of the most recent arms-reduction treaty with Russia, ratified by the Senate and signed last year by Mr. Obama. Russia figures prominently in Mr. Romney's book, where he calls it one of four competitors for world leadership, along with the United States, China and ''violent jihadism'' embraced by Iran and terrorist groups.
Some advisers close to Mr. Romney, who declined to be quoted or identified by name, say Russia is a good illustration of his belief that national security threats are closely tied to economic power -- in this case stemming from Russia's oil and gas reserves, which it has used to muscle European countries dependent on energy imports.
They also cite his tendency to view foreign policy conflicts as zero-sum negotiations. Mr. Romney, an accomplished deal-maker at Bain Capital, views his negotiating skills as an advantage he holds over Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney signaled his stance toward Russia two years ago, when he argued that the New Start missile treaty with Russia should be rejected, putting him at odds with a long line of former Republican secretaries of state and defense. A number of arms control specialists said they were startled by some of Mr. Romney's assertions, like fretting about intercontinental ballistic missiles mounted on bombers.
''It would be really fun to watch a Russian bomber with an SS-25 strung to its stomach try to take off,'' said Steve Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine and now director of the Arms Control Initiative at the Brookings Institution. ''Some of the arguments just left people scratching their heads.''
Within hours, rebuttal pieces to Mr. Romney's position, laid out in an op-ed article in The Washington Post, were being circulated among arms control experts. Mr. Lugar, who had spent decades working on arms control issues, publicly disparaged some of Mr. Romney's arguments as ''discredited objections.''
Mr. Romney felt the missile treaty was a bad deal partly because it would impede American defenses by preventing ballistic missile silos from being converted to missile defense sites, while treaty supporters said that was not an issue because American officials prefer to build missile defense installations from the ground up.
Mr. Romney also criticized a White House decision scrapping a proposed antiballistic missile shield in Eastern Europe and building in its place a reconfigured system to shoot down short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Obama had caved to Russian pressure, trading away a crucial program with little in return. Administration officials say their reconfigured system offers better protection for American allies.
Mr. Romney's more recent statements on Russia have also drawn criticism from nonpartisan Russia experts who say he mischaracterizes Russia's potential economic power and paints an inaccurate picture of Russian recalcitrance. Republicans close to Mr. Romney acknowledge that politics are a factor, but they also say Mr. Romney is driven by fears that Mr. Putin will continue political repression and use his country's energy wealth to finance military expansion.
Some former diplomats and Russia specialists, and some leading Republicans in Congress, have also questioned his characterization of the country as America's major foe. Many experts, including some close to his campaign, see a declining power that the United States will need to help manage global challenges. Some analysts also say Mr. Romney understates the help Russia has provided in dealing with rogue states, like backing a heavy-arms embargo and other sanctions against Iran in 2010.
''There's a whole school of thought that Russia is one you need to work with to solve other problems in the world, rather than being the problem,'' said Thomas de Waal, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Russia has blocked United Nations Security Council efforts to end violence in Syria, drawing a rebuke from the Obama administration. But analysts also point out Russia's support for the Iran arms embargo, its cancellation of a surface-to-air missile system sale to Iran and its allowing supplies to be sent through Russia to troops in Afghanistan.
Mr. Romney says natural resources could vault Russia to a position of global influence rivaling any nation by midcentury. But many analysts say Russia's fate is so closely tied to oil exports that anything short of a sustained rise in prices will lead to cuts in spending on the military and social programs. Citigroup estimates that oil must reach $150 a barrel in coming years (from current export prices of $120) for Russia to pay for Mr. Putin's spending promises.
The co-chairman of Mr. Romney's Russia working group, Leon Aron, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote this month that in the short term, ''Russia's most serious risk stems from a near-fatal dependence on the price of oil,'' and that it could face a fiscal crisis as soon as 2014 that depletes cash for the military and other commitments. (Mr. Aron declined to comment, but friends say he would never argue, as Mr. Romney has, that Russia is America's ''No. 1 geopolitical foe.'')
Some experts add that the only way the Russian economy could reach the heights Mr. Romney fears would be through a wholesale economic liberalization -- one that would be cheered by Western countries.
''It would mean radically reforming and changing the Putin system,'' said Angela Stent, a Russia expert at Georgetown University and a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia.

HEADLINE: Bank Regulations Gain Fresh Support

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. and EDWARD WYATT; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington and Ben Protess from Chicago.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leading members of Congress on Friday demanded that federal regulators strengthen proposed banking rules and scrutinize trading closely in the wake of JPMorgan Chase's disclosures of trading losses.
''The fact that this can happen at a bank with a solid reputation like JPMorgan is evidence that our banking regulators must remain vigilant,'' said Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, ''and why opponents of Wall Street reform must not be allowed to gut important protections for the financial system and taxpayers.'' The bank has been a leader of industry lobbying against new strictures on trading practices.
The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro, said the agency was focused on JPMorgan Chase's newly disclosed trading losses, and other people with knowledge of the agency's activities said it was already examining possible civil violations involving the bank's public statements and disclosures. 
Two Senate authors of the law restricting certain kinds of high-risk trading by banks blasted federal regulators, saying that the agency's draft regulations would not adequately address trading of the kind that has now cost JPMorgan Chase enormous losses.
Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, both Democrats, said in a conference call with reporters that as currently drafted by the agencies charged with carrying out the new law, the Volcker Rule, governing a bank's proprietary trading, allows banks to amass a single, large bet as a hedge against possible declines in an entire portfolio of securities.
That, Mr. Levin said, ''is a big enough loophole that a Mack truck could drive right through it.''
And that is what JPMorgan Chase did, the senators contend. Where the law was written to allow hedging of individual investments by banks to protect them from possible losses, it was not meant to allow hedging an entire portfolio or hedging in favor of or against movements in the economy, they said.
''That is a license pretty much to do anything,'' Mr. Levin said.
Mr. Merkley, asked if he had a message for Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan chief executive, said, ''Yes. If you want to be the head of a hedge fund, be a hedge fund,'' Mr. Merkley said. ''Terminate your access to the Fed's discount window, terminate your access to deposits, and then we have no quarrel.''
Ms. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, told reporters after a speech that ''I think it's safe to say that all the regulators are very focused on this.''
But she did not comment on the implications of the JPMorgan trades for the shaping of the Volcker Rule, which is scheduled to take effect this summer and which Morgan and other banks have been working hard to get relaxed.
The rule, part of the Dodd-Frank bill, is aimed at preventing federally insured banks from making investing bets from their own accounts that might put taxpayers at risk for another bailout.
Other Dodd-Frank rules that are still being drafted and that JPMorgan and other banks oppose include limitations on credit-default swaps and requirements to trade derivatives in the open. They too could have applied to JPMorgan's trades, depending on whether the trades are found to have been legitimate hedges or more speculative bets.
The debate on those rules, which never really wound down after the passage of the landmark legislation, is likely to become amplified once again.
''The argument that financial institutions do not need the new rules to help them avoid the irresponsible actions that led to the crisis of 2008 is at least $2 billion harder to make today,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat of Massachusetts and one of the principal authors of the financial regulatory overhaul legislation that bears his name.
Reuters quoted Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has called for the breakup of the top five American banks, as saying he is worried that the biggest banks do not have adequate risk management.
''What concerns me is risk management, size, scope,'' he said when asked about JPMorgan's trading loss. ''At what point do you get to the point that you don't know what's going on underneath you? That's the point where you've got too big.''
At a Senate hearing the day before the JPMorgan losses were disclosed, the patron of the Volcker Rule defended it against charges that it was too complicated or costly to enforce.
Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, said that whatever the complexities, it should be possible for bank executives and regulators alike to know when the rules against proprietary trading are broken.
''All banks, unless they're totally irresponsible, and I don't think these big banks are totally irresponsible, will have strong controls on their trading desks in their own interest,'' he said on Wednesday.
Regulators, too, should be able to detect outsize trades and other telltale signs of proprietary trading, Mr. Volcker said, and ''if you see those telltale signs, there's no question the regulator ought to get in there to supervise, ought to go in there and raise questions.''
But he warned that regulatory barriers intended to fence off risky bets could be circumvented.
''My experience with ring fences is the gophers go underneath and the deer jump over it, and you get a lot of lawyers to help them,'' Mr. Volcker said.

HEADLINE: Europe Slips in World Influence Stakes

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The rest of the world has traditionally looked up to Europe as an example to be emulated, but a new survey suggests its reputation is declining. Should nations worry about how much, or little, they are loved? 

 BODY:
LONDON - Surprise, surprise! The international standing of European nations has declined in the past year, according to a survey published this week, and Germany is no longer the state most admired by the rest of the world.
In a survey of more than 24,000 people in 22 countries around the world, the opinion research organization GlobeScan found that positive views of European states fell sharply over the past year as their leaders struggled to find solutions to the continent's chronic economic crisis. 
The standing of the 27-nation European Union as a whole fared even worse, with an 8 percent fall since last year.
Nations such as Germany and Britain are still in positive territory among the top five but China is coming up from behind in the admiration stakes, while Japan squeezed into first place with a positive rating of 58 percent.
Positive views of China rose from 46 to 50 percent, putting it at fifth place in the league table of states that others most look up to. 
"The turmoil in the EU, long seen as an attractive bastion of political and economic stability, has raised doubts in people's minds about its continued ability to be a global leader. Hopes are turning to China," said Chris Coulter, GlobeScan's president.
His organization conducted the survey jointly with University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes on behalf of the BBC World Service. The detailed results available online include the questions posed and the methodology used.
China received a boost, notably among respondents in Europe, because of its economy, products, and services. What held it down was a negative perception of its foreign policy and how it treats its people.
Perceptions of a nation's influence should not, of course, be confused with the real thing.
Down at eighth place and with a positive rating of just 47 percent, the United States still lags behind even the European Union. Significantly more respondents disapproved rather than approved of U.S. foreign policy.
The findings raise the question of how much states are likely to be influenced by where they stand in the global beauty contest. It is hard to see Iran making much effort to switch course just in order to drag itself from the bottom of the table. 
World powers invariably follow Nicollo Machiavelli's dictum that it is better to be feared than to be loved, if you can't be both.
In an interview I once had with Silvan Shalom, then Israeli foreign minister, the conversation drifted towards his well-known expertise about the English soccer leagues. I asked him if he knew the slogan of my local London team, Millwall, whose fans are known for their aggressive misanthropy.
He didn't, so I enlightened him. "It's: 'No one likes us, we don't care'," I said, adding that I had always felt it would be a good motto for Israel.
He seemed rather pleased with the idea.

HIGHLIGHT: Inequality and teen births. 

 BODY:
That's one of the subject headings in this recent survey paper (pdf) on teen births, which are much higher in America than in other advanced countries. The authors find evidence suggesting that inequality and lack of mobility are central, another sign that Wilkinson-type views about the corrosive effects of inequality are going seriously mainstream.
Here's the money graph:
I was wondering how this would look if we got down to individual states. Here's the scatterplot, with inequality from the Census and teen births from KFF:
I find this interesting, both for the apparent relationship between inequality and teen births and for the somewhat surprising social health of the Northeast Corridor; how do the states of Acelaland manage to have relatively few teenage births despite high inequality? Is it the nature of the inequality? Is it more liberal contraception policies?
No answers today. But interesting stuff -- and more evidence that we are gradually poisoning our society with inequity.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the weekly addresses and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Pivoting away from volatile social issues, President Obama spoke to homeowners Friday in Nevada -- the state hardest hit by the housing bust -- about his proposals to allow more Americans to get low-interest mortgage refinancing, Jackie Calmes reports.

        
Mitt Romney's recent declaration that Russia is America's top geopolitical adversary made Democrats, Republicans and Russians themselves suggest that Mr. Romney is stuck in a cold-war mind-set, Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports. Interviews with Republican foreign policy experts close to his campaign and Mr. Romney's writings on the subject indicate that his stance toward Russia reflects a broader foreign policy view that gives great weight to economic power and control of natural resources.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama acknowledged the slow pace of the economic recovery but outlined a number ofsteps the nation could take to spur financial growth. Though he already announced his "to-do" list for Congress, he used his weekly address to make a second appeal to lawmakers on their legislative priorities. "Democrats and Republicans have already done some important work together - from passing tax cuts for workers, to opening up new markets for American products, to reforming out the patent system," he said. "But now we need to do more." The list instructed Congress to:

        
Stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and use the money to cover moving expenses for companies that bring jobs back to America.
        
Help homeowners refinance their mortgages at lower rates.
        
Give tax breaks to small businesses that hire more workers.
        
Extend tax credits for clean energy companies.
        
Help veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan by creating a Veterans Job Corps.
"So that's Congress's 'to-do' list," he said. "But now we need them to start crossing things off."

        
Representative Kristi Noem of South Dakota delivered the weekly Republican address, sharing news of her recent graduation from college. "After many years, I returned to school in 2008, and was grateful to walk across the stage at South Dakota State University last Saturday with my political science degree in hand," she said. But the celebrating was short-lived, because of her growing concern over "the challenges that this year's graduates will face." "Last week's disappointing unemployment figures were a sobering reminder that our economy continues to struggle," she said. "Over half of the recent college graduates cannot get a job in President Obama's economy." Accusing the White House of politicizing issues like student loan rates, Ms. Noem said Mr. Obama's focus should be on the job-growth legislation being promoted by House Republicans. "All told, more than two dozen House-passed jobs bills are awaiting action in the Democratic-controlled Senate," she said. "If the president is truly serious about doing what's best for women, young people - and all Americans - working on these jobs bills should be our focus."
Around the Web

        
Representative Bill Owens, Democrat of New York, has announced that he will personally reimburse a Taiwan university for a $22,132 trip he took there in December, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will honor the 2012 National Association of Police Organization's Top Cops winners with a ceremony in the Rose Garden.

        
European embassies throughout Washington will be on display for the European Union's "Open House Day."

        
Education Secretary Arne Duncan will deliver the commencement address at Howard University.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LEE, KIE, HONG DANIEL

 BODY:
LEE--Kie-Hong Daniel, passed away on April 29, 2012, in Seoul, Korea. Born on April 13, 1922, Kie-Hong Lee studied at Hiroshima Imperial Normal College, Seoul National University, Amherst College, Princeton University and Columbia University. A prominent economist, Kie-Hong Lee was the primary architect of Korea's first 5-year economic plan after the Korean War, laying the path for Korea to grow from a stagnant, tradition-oriented, agricultural society into a modern, dynamic, economic powerhouse. 
Among his many contributions to Korea's development, the reforestation of the peninsula following its devastation from Japanese occupation, World War II, and the Korean War is probably the most beautiful and lasting. Mr. Lee was the first Korean citizen to work as part of the professional staff at the United Nations, ECAFE, beginning in 1958. On May 16, 1961, when a coup d'etat in South Korea deposed the popularly elected government in South Korea, Mr. Lee was in Washington, D.C. to discuss Korea's economic development plans with Walt W. Rostow, Deputy Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and McGeorge Bundy, National Security Advisor. Mr. Lee declined an offer of refuge from the US government, and returned to the post-coup Korea to continue his work as an economist with the new government, quickly rising to the position of Assistant Minister, Economic Planning Board. Over the course of his long career, Mr. Lee worked as an economist at The World Bank, Managing Director of Korea-US Economic Council, Managing Director of Korea Trade Association, and publisher of Business Korea and Korea Business World magazines. A strong advocate of advanced education for women, Mr. Lee was a former president of the Amherst College Alumni Association in Korea. He was also president of the Seoul Rotary Club. In 1989 he became one of the founding members of the Committee of 300 Free Thinkers, an outspoken group of former Korean government ministers and influential leaders in fields of economics, education, law, finance and industry dedicated to maintaining the development of the Republic by publishing loyal critiques of unwise government policies, while espousing values of truth, intellectual freedom, market economics, and integrity in leadership. Mr. Lee is survived by his wife Young-Ja, four children, Margaret, Thai, Celeste, and Changsuk, sons-in-law Al Njoo and Kevin C. McCann, daughter-in-law Young Wook Kang, and grandchildren Albert Njoo, Andrew Njoo, Daniel Njoo, Victor Leo, Hanah Lee, Noel McCann, Saymin Lee, Minjoon Lee, and Andy Whang.

HEADLINE: Slippery-Slope Logic, Applied to Health Care

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
THERE are lots of important things to worry about these days: terrorism, the economy, climate change and, for Yankee fans, the loss of Mariano Rivera. But worry is a scarce commodity. Even a mother -- Jewish or not -- can't worry about everything. So it is important that we limit our worries to real as opposed to imaginary risks.
One pernicious category of imaginary risks involves those created by users of the dreaded ''slippery slope'' arguments. Such arguments are dangerous because they are popular, versatile and often convincing, yet completely fallacious. Worse, they are creeping into an arena that should be above this sort of thing: the Supreme Court, in its deliberations on health care reform.
There is a DirecTV ad that humorously illustrates the basic form of the slippery-slope argument. A foreboding announcer intones a list of syllogisms that are enacted on screen: ''When your cable company puts you on hold, you get angry. When you get angry, you go blow off steam. When you go blow off steam, accidents happen.'' Later, we reach the finale: ''You wake up in a roadside ditch. Don't wake up in a roadside ditch.'' 
Although this ad is intended to be funny, arguments that make no more sense can and do affect public policy. The idea is that while Policy X may be acceptable, it will inevitably lead to the terrible Outcome Y, so it is vital that we prevent Policy X from ever being enacted. The problem is that such arguments are often made without any evidence that doing X makes Y more likely, much less inevitable. What percentage of people who are left on hold on the telephone end up in a roadside ditch?
The anecdotal track record of people making slippery-slope predictions in the political domain is replete with bad forecasts. An opponent of women's suffrage once predicted that giving women the right to vote would create a ''race of masculine women and effeminate men and the mating of these would result in the procreation of a race of degenerates.'' Another opponent, noting that women represent more than half the population, predicted that allowing women to vote would mean that all our political leaders would soon be women. For the record, women now hold 17 percent of the seats in Congress.
Of course, it sometimes happens that society takes successive steps in one direction. Although women don't control the government, there is thankfully much more gender -- and racial -- equality now than a century ago. But I think that few would be tempted to compare the pace of that progress with that of an skier on a downhill training run.
Eugene Volokh, a legal scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, has written extensively on the theoretical mechanisms that could cause such effects. But he rightly notes that the topic ''cries out for empirical research'' to determine whether slope risk is predictable. Such research does not exist, he says, perhaps because it is so hard to do.
ONE reason for the lack of conclusive research is that a society evolves slowly, and it can be impossible to attribute any particular change to the initial step that sent us sliding. Additional complications arise because our laws and norms often ebb and flow. The passage of Prohibition did not start us down some puritanical slippery slope, for example. Instead, Americans noticed that it was bad policy and repealed it.
Michael Klarman, the Harvard legal historian, has even argued that court cases can create what he calls a backlash. The idea is that some law or legal ruling creates such a stir that people rise up and push things back further away from the initial starting point. In this case the slope is up, not down.
Given how flimsy slippery-slope arguments can be, it is downright scary that they might play an important role in the Supreme Court decision on the new health care law. The case before the court is whether it is constitutional for the federal government to penalize people who fail to buy health insurance.
As everyone concedes, we can't include the popular rule that forbids insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions unless we encourage nearly everyone to buy health insurance. Although most legal scholars seem to think that the law is constitutional, there is considerable question about whether the Supreme Court will rule that way. And the slippery-slope arguments being used here are just wacky.
Consider these now-famous comments about broccoli from Justice Antonin G. Scalia during the oral arguments. ''Everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food,'' he said. ''Therefore, everybody is in the market. Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.'' Showing remarkable restraint, he did not mention anything about ending up in a roadside ditch.
Justice Scalia is arguing that if the court lets Congress create a mandate to buy health insurance, nothing could stop Congress from passing laws requiring everyone to buy broccoli and to join a gym. He and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. were asking the solicitor general to explain what the principle would be to stop the government from going so far. If the law stands, Justice Roberts suggested, ''it seems to me that we can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power.'' He added, ''Given the significant deference we accord to Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could regulate that market in any rational way.''
Please stop! The very fact that a slippery slope is being cited as grounds for declaring the law unconstitutional -- despite that ''significant deference'' usually given to laws passed by Congress -- tells you all that you need to know about the argument's validity. Can anyone imagine Congress passing a broccoli mandate law, much less the court allowing it to take effect?
The irony is that Justices Roberts and Scalia are warning of a risk that they and their colleagues have the power to prevent. Surely, the justices have the conceptual resources to draw a distinction between the health care market and the market for broccoli. And even if they don't, then all the briefs, the zillions of blog posts and a generation's worth of economic literature can help them.
More generally, we would be better off as a society if we could collectively agree to ignore all slippery-slope arguments that aren't accompanied by evidence that said slope exists. If you are opposed to a policy, state your case based on the merits -- not on the imagined risk of what else might happen down the road. The path of that road is so unpredictable that it may even produce a U-turn.

HEADLINE: The Blog: Hypermilers Set Distance Record in a VW

BYLINE: By TAMARA WARREN

 BODY:
John and Helen Taylor, the Australian hypermilers who made news in the United States in 2009 by averaging 67.9 miles per gallon in a tour of the 48 contiguous states, recently added another record to their considerable tally. The couple drove 1,626.1 miles in a 2012 Volkswagen Passat TDI SE from Houston to Sterling, Va., breaking the Guinness record for the longest drive in a passenger car on a single tank of diesel fuel.
They departed May 3 and passed through nine states, averaging 84.1 miles per gallon during the excursion, and finished on May 5. By Wednesday the Taylors were on a plane, en route to their home in Australia. 
''We drove the Passat only two days prior to the record drive, and test results showed figures of 93, so we were very encouraged,'' Mr. Taylor wrote in an e-mail, referencing the miles per gallon he and his wife observed in pre-drive testing. ''We believed we could reach Sterling Shell Station, Va., which we managed to achieve without running out of diesel.''
Their record more than doubled the 795-mile highway range estimated for the Passat TDI by Volkswagen, based on a highway fuel-economy rating of 43 m.p.g. Volkswagen provided a showroom-stock Passat for the Taylors' record attempt.
The couple improved on the previous record, 1,526.6 miles, set in a 2010 Passat 1.6 BlueMotion diesel in Europe by Gavin Conway, a writer for The Sunday Times. Both cars had fuel capacity of 18.5 gallons and had 6-speed manual transmissions. The Taylors typically share driving duties, but on this trip Mr. Taylor drove slightly more, he said, while his wife monitored social media from the front passenger seat.
To simulate real-world driving conditions, the Taylors brought along 120 pounds of luggage and limited their driving to daylight hours. ''We wanted the drive to be realistic, hence daylight driving and carrying holiday luggage, inspiring Americans to save on their upcoming summer driving holidays,'' Mr. Taylor said. Based on current diesel prices, the Taylors calculated their per-mile fuel cost at 4.65 cents.
''The hardest part of the drive was getting stuck in several long traffic jams, but we remained calm and worked through it,'' Mr. Taylor added. The couple shared some tricks for eking out gaudy fuel-economy numbers with The Times in 2009, after completing the 48-state tour in the Jetta TDI. Further tips can be found at the couple's Web site, FuelAcademy.com.
The Taylors have been setting fuel-economy records since 1982, having set or broken well over 40. Such dedication has earned them the unofficial title of the world's most fuel-efficient couple.
''We work always as a team to achieve not only driving goals but in our marriage,'' Mr. Taylor said. He views the road trips as an opportunity for cultural enrichment and marriage maintenance. On the road, he and his wife talk ''about how we brought up the kids, how we can educate the world about efficiency, listening to music, learning German, telling my wife how much I love sharing these dream drives with her.''
Their next record attempt is scheduled for September -- a drive around Australia.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: This Column Is Not Sponsored by Anyone

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
The public editor is off today.

 BODY:
PORING through Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel's new book, ''What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets,'' I found myself over and over again turning pages and saying, ''I had no idea.''
I had no idea that in the year 2000, as Sandel notes, ''a Russian rocket emblazoned with a giant Pizza Hut logo carried advertising into outer space,'' or that in 2001, the British novelist Fay Weldon wrote a book commissioned by the jewelry company Bulgari and that, in exchange for payment, ''the author agreed to mention Bulgari jewelry in the novel at least a dozen times.'' I knew that stadiums are now named for corporations, but had no idea that now ''even sliding into home is a corporate-sponsored event,'' writes Sandel. ''New York Life Insurance Company has a deal with 10 Major League Baseball teams that triggers a promotional plug every time a player slides safely into base. When the umpire calls the runner safe at home plate, a corporate logo appears on the television screen, and the play-by-play announcer must say, 'Safe at home. Safe and secure. New York Life.' '' 
And while I knew that retired baseball players sell their autographs for $15 a pop, I had no idea that Pete Rose, who was banished from baseball for life for betting, has a Web site that, Sandel writes, ''sells memorabilia related to his banishment. For $299, plus shipping and handling, you can buy a baseball autographed by Rose and inscribed with an apology: 'I'm sorry I bet on baseball.' For $500, Rose will send you an autographed copy of the document banishing him from the game.''
I had no idea that in 2001 an elementary school in New Jersey became America's first public school ''to sell naming rights to a corporate sponsor,'' Sandel writes. ''In exchange for a $100,000 donation from a local supermarket, it renamed its gym 'ShopRite of Brooklawn Center.' ... A high school in Newburyport, Mass., offered naming rights to the principal's office for $10,000. ... By 2011, seven states had approved advertising on the sides of school buses.''
Seen in isolation, these commercial encroachments seem innocuous enough. But Sandel sees them as signs of a bad trend: ''Over the last three decades,'' he states, ''we have drifted from having a market economy to becoming a market society. A market economy is a tool -- a valuable and effective tool -- for organizing productive activity. But a 'market society' is a place where everything is up for sale. It is a way of life where market values govern every sphere of life.''
Why worry about this trend? Because, Sandel argues, market values are crowding out civic practices. When public schools are plastered with commercial advertising, they teach students to be consumers rather than citizens. When we outsource war to private military contractors, and when we have separate, shorter lines for airport security for those who can afford them, the result is that the affluent and those of modest means live increasingly separate lives, and the class-mixing institutions and public spaces that forge a sense of common experience and shared citizenship get eroded.
This reach of markets into every aspect of life was partly a result of the end of the cold war, he argues, when America's victory was interpreted as a victory for unfettered markets, thus propelling the notion that markets are the primary instruments for achieving the public good. It was also the result of Americans wanting more public services than they were willing to pay taxes for, thus inviting corporations to fill in the gap with school gyms brought to you by ShopRite.
Sandel is now a renowned professor at Harvard, but we first became friends when we grew up together in Minneapolis in the 1960s. Both our fathers took us to the 1965 World Series, when the Dodgers beat the Twins in seven games. In 1965, the best tickets in Metropolitan Stadium cost $3; bleachers were $1.50. Sandel's third-deck seat to the World Series cost $8. Today, alas, not only are most stadiums named for companies, but the wealthy now sit in skyboxes -- even at college games -- that cost tens of thousands of dollars a season, and hoi polloi sit out in the rain.
Throughout our society, we are losing the places and institutions that used to bring people together from different walks of life. Sandel calls this the ''skyboxification of American life,'' and it is troubling. Unless the rich and poor encounter one another in everyday life, it is hard to think of ourselves as engaged in a common project. At a time when to fix our society we need to do big, hard things together, the marketization of public life becomes one more thing pulling us apart. ''The great missing debate in contemporary politics,'' Sandel writes, ''is about the role and reach of markets.'' We should be asking where markets serve the public good, and where they don't belong, he argues. And we should be asking how to rebuild class-mixing institutions.
''Democracy does not require perfect equality,'' he concludes, ''but it does require that citizens share in a common life. ... For this is how we learn to negotiate and abide our differences, and how we come to care for the common good.''

HEADLINE: The Wisdom of Slime

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAMATZKY and ANDREW ILACHINSKI. 
Andrew Adamatzky is a professor of computer science at the University of the West of England in Bristol. Andrew Ilachinski is the principal research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses.

 BODY:
THE United States interstate highway system is often celebrated as a simple yet highly efficient transportation scheme -- one that, starting in the 1950s, transformed the American economy and lifestyle. Its network of roads was designed to maximally span the country with a minimal number of links, while still allowing for enough redundancy to help drivers overcome wrong turns and missed exits.
But it's worth remembering that the highway system was created by mere humans, using only human intelligence. To find out if it's optimally designed, we need to consult a higher authority. Namely, slime mold. 
Let us explain.
There is a slime mold known as Physarum polycephalum that lives in forests around the world. It feeds on various kinds of microscopic particles. As it forages for food, protoplasmic tubes of slime extend out and bifurcate like tree branches; whenever it happens upon a source of nutrients, it gathers into a bloblike formation. The whole thing -- blobs connected by tubes -- is a single organism, and the network serves to transport nutrients throughout its ''body.''
An interesting fact about this slime mold is that it is highly intelligent -- or at least it behaves as if it is. In locating food in its environment, it builds networks that have been shown to be optimally efficient in transporting the nutrients over the area in question. If placed in a maze, for instance, with a source of food outside the maze, the slime mold will discover the shortest path out.
The Japanese researcher Toshiyuki Nakagaki and his colleagues have demonstrated that the slime mold's foraging behavior can be used to perform sophisticated computations, as long as the problems are represented spatially. Problems solved by the slime mold include not only the shortest path out of a maze, but also other complex mathematical challenges (like creating a Voronoi diagram and a Delaunay triangulation).
Despite its ability to solve an array of problems, the slime mold was designed by evolution to solve just one problem: how to build an optimal transport network (for its nutrients). So we decided to investigate how the slime mold, when presented with the task of connecting the major urban areas of the United States, would design a transport system. Would its design resemble that of the United States highway system, or would the slime mold propose a superior one?
Here's how our experiment worked. As we detail in a forthcoming article in the journal Complex Systems, we took a large dish in the shape of the United States and placed rolled oats (a food for the slime mold) in the locations of 20 major urban areas. Then we put the slime mold on the rolled oats representing the New York area. The slime mold propagated out from New York toward the other urban areas and eventually spanned them all with its network of protoplasmic tubes. We performed this experiment a number of times.
What did the resulting network look like? It looked remarkably like the United States interstate highway system.
We found that the slime mold approximated almost all interstates. Links from Dallas to Houston, from Chicago to Milwaukee and from New York to Boston were reproduced by the slime mold in almost all experiments. We also found that in three out of four experiments, the slime mold approximated the routes from the San Jose, Calif., area to Las Vegas; the chain of links connecting Denver to Albuquerque to the Phoenix area to the Los Angeles area; and the chain of links connecting Kansas City, Mo., to Oklahoma City to the Dallas area to the Houston area.
It also approximated two chains -- one connecting Milwaukee to the Chicago area to Nashville to Memphis; the other connecting Boston to the New York area to Charlotte, N.C., to Atlanta to Jacksonville, Fla. -- that are bridged by a link from the Chicago area to New York. (Routes that weren't approximated were those directly connecting Denver to the San Jose area, the Houston area to Albuquerque and Jacksonville, the New York area to Nashville, and Boston to the Chicago area.)
From the slime mold's point of view, Interstates 10 and 20 represent the core backbone of the United States transport network: when these interstates are removed, the network separates into disconnected western and eastern parts.
The United States is not alone in having an interstate highway system that gets the slime mold's seal of approval. We have done similar experiments with various colleagues, using slime mold to approximate the highway systems of Britain, Mexico, the Netherlands, Canada and Brazil.
For all of these countries, we found that the slime mold network matched, at least partly, the network of human-made transport systems, though the closeness of fit varied from country to country. The United States highway system, for instance, is less slime-mold-like than that of Canada.
How Americans feel about that fact depends, presumably, on how they feel about the wisdom of slime.

HEADLINE: The Human Disaster of Unemployment

BYLINE: By DEAN BAKER and KEVIN HASSETT. 
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Kevin Hassett is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

 BODY:
THE American economy is experiencing a crisis in long-term unemployment that has enormous human and economic costs.
In 2007, before the Great Recession, people who were looking for work for more than six months -- the definition of long-term unemployment -- accounted for just 0.8 percent of the labor force. The recession has radically changed this picture. In 2010, the long-term unemployed accounted for 4.2 percent of the work force. That figure would be 50 percent higher if we added the people who gave up looking for work.
Long-term unemployment is experienced disproportionately by the young, the old, the less educated, and African-American and Latino workers. 
While older workers are less likely to be laid off than younger workers, they are about half as likely to be rehired. One result is that older workers have seen the largest proportionate increase in unemployment in this downturn. The number of unemployed people between ages 50 and 65 has more than doubled.
The prospects for the re-employment of older workers deteriorate sharply the longer they are unemployed. A worker between ages 50 and 61 who has been unemployed for 17 months has only about a 9 percent chance of finding a new job in the next three months. A worker who is 62 or older and in the same situation has only about a 6 percent chance. As unemployment increases in duration, these slim chances drop steadily.
The result is nothing short of a national emergency. Millions of workers have been disconnected from the work force, and possibly even from society. If they are not reconnected, the costs to them and to society will be grim.
Unemployment is almost always a traumatic event, especially for older workers. A paper by the economists Daniel Sullivan and Till von Wachter estimates a 50 to 100 percent increase in death rates for older male workers in the years immediately following a job loss, if they previously had been consistently employed. This higher mortality rate implies that a male worker displaced in midcareer can expect to live about one and a half years less than a worker who keeps his job.
There are various reasons for this rise in mortality. One is suicide. A recent study found that a 10 percent increase in the unemployment rate (say from 8 to 8.8 percent) would increase the suicide rate for males by 1.47 percent. This is not a small effect. Assuming a link of that scale, the increase in unemployment would lead to an additional 128 suicides per month in the United States. The picture for the long-term unemployed is especially disturbing. The duration of unemployment is the dominant force in the relationship between joblessness and the risk of suicide.
Joblessness is also associated with some serious illnesses, although the causal links are poorly understood. Studies have found strong links between unemployment and cancer, with unemployed men facing a 25 percent higher risk of dying of the disease. Similarly higher risks have been found for heart disease and psychiatric problems.
The physical and psychological consequences of unemployment are significant enough to affect family members. The economists Kerwin Charles and Melvin Stephens recently found an 18 percent increase in the probability of divorce following a husband's job loss and 13 percent after a wife's. Unemployment of parents also has a negative impact on achievement of their children. In the long run, children whose fathers lose a job when they are kids have reduced earnings as adults -- about 9 percent lower annually than children whose fathers do not experience unemployment.
We all understand how the human costs can be so high. For many people, their very identity is their occupation. Few events rival the emotional strain of job loss.
IT seems clear that neither political party was prepared to deal with the crisis of long-term unemployment. In spite of the severity of the downturn, there was a general expectation that the economy would bounce back, as it had after previous downturns.
Some countries that were more familiar with long-term unemployment, notably Germany, were much better prepared to deal with the fallout from the crisis. The German government aggressively pushed work-sharing measures. This meant that instead of workers' being laid off and receiving unemployment benefits, the German government helped companies keep employees, working fewer hours, on their payrolls by subsidizing their wages with the money saved on unemployment benefits.
The result of this policy is that Germany's unemployment rate is now lower than it was at the start of the downturn, even though its growth has been no better than ours.
Thankfully, there is some effort to learn from this model. The recent bill that extended the payroll tax cut included a provision that covered the cost of work-sharing programs in the 23 states that already had them as part of their unemployment insurance systems, and it helped other states start such programs. This should slow job destruction in those states, which will improve chances for all workers seeking employment. From now on, the first line of defense during a recession should be to expand work sharing rather than simply extend unemployment benefits.
But these changes come late, and we must get much better at sending a lifeline to those who are hardest to reconnect.
In the United States and elsewhere, government training programs have a mixed record at best. Some people have suggested that the unemployed be encouraged to start their own businesses, and entrepreneurship is one valid option for some. But given that most new businesses will fail, it may not be the best advice to tell older workers who have lost their jobs to also put their savings at risk to start a new business.
Clearly, an improving economy will help some, but those who have been out of work for an extended period have a difficult time finding jobs for many reasons. They are more likely to be discouraged, more likely to have seen their skills wane, and more likely to be seen as a risk by a prospective employer.
Policy makers must come together and recognize that this is an emergency, and fashion a comprehensive re-employment policy that addresses the specific needs of the long-term unemployed. A policy package that as a whole should appeal to the left and the right should spend money to help expand public and private training programs with proven track records; expand entrepreneurial opportunities by increasing access to small-business financing; reduce government hurdles to the formation of new businesses; and explore subsidies for private employers who hire the long-term unemployed. Those who hire for government jobs must do their share, too: managers who are filling open positions should be given explicit incentives to reconnect these lost workers.
Every month of delay is a month in which our unemployed friends and neighbors drift further away.

PERSON: Angelica Garnett 

HEADLINE: Angelica Garnett, 93; Wrote Frank Memoir of a Bloomsbury Childhood

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Angelica Garnett, the last direct link to the Bloomsbury set, whose memoir of growing up amid its potent brew of sex, secrets, artistry and renown is notable for offering a child's-eye view of that darkly charmed circle, died on May 4 in the South of France. She was 93.
Her death was announced on the Web site of the Charleston Trust, the organization she helped found to preserve the Sussex farmhouse, known as Charleston, that was the Bloomsbury group's country retreat, and in which she had been born and reared. Ms. Garnett had long acknowledged that she could not completely shake its hold on her, despite having lived in France for many years. 
Published in 1985, her memoir, ''Deceived With Kindness: A Bloomsbury Childhood,'' describes the luminous orbit around Ms. Garnett's mother, the painter Vanessa Bell, a sister of Virginia Woolf. It was a self-reflexive, self-congratulatory milieu in which art was all, sex was the coin of the realm and the only real transgression was the unpardonable sin of being ordinary.
For the young Ms. Garnett, who grew up in a household that often included her mother, her presumed father and her actual father under one amicable roof, the threads binding the principals -- who loved whom, who seduced whom, who married whom, who fathered whom -- formed not so much a densely woven tapestry as a Gordian knot.
It was in an attempt to unravel this knot in middle age that she began work on her memoir, which Newsweek called ''a work of moving honesty and thoughtful, refined prose.'' In it, Ms. Garnett depicts the exquisite blend of Victorian libertinism and Victorian repression that defined the Bloomsbury ethos: she was not told who her real father was, for instance, until she was nearly grown.
She also recounts her marriage to a man twice her age -- he too was part of her parents' circle -- who had been her biological father's lover, a fact of which no one had dared inform her.
Her husband, David Garnett, would write a novella, ''Aspects of Love'' (1955), that was more than loosely based on their singular family constellation. The book was later adapted into an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that opened on Broadway in 1990 and ran for nearly a year.
Angelica Bell was born at Charleston in 1918, on Christmas Day -- a date, her mother told her, that only affirmed her specialness. For years she believed her father to be Vanessa's husband, the art critic Clive Bell. He was the father of her two older brothers (in reality her half-brothers): Julian Bell, a poet who was killed in the Spanish Civil War, and Quentin Bell, a renowned art historian who died in 1996.
Angelica's actual father was Duncan Grant, a gay painter whose brief liaison with Vanessa -- he continued to live platonically with the Bells -- had resulted in her birth.
In keeping with Vanessa's preference for aesthetic sensibility over cold, hard fact, Angelica received little formal education. Her real school was Charleston, which glowed with art by Vanessa and Grant and swirled with heady conversation among a group that included the biographer Lytton Strachey and the economist John Maynard Keynes, both frequent visitors, and, until her suicide in 1941, Virginia Woolf.
As a young woman, Angelica briefly studied drama in London but abandoned it, concluding that she was not good enough. She became a painter, like her mother, and had a measure of success but no renown.
When Angelica was 17, her mother had taken her aside and divulged her true parentage. Fearful that further discussion would disrupt their durable if unconventional household, Vanessa told her not to raise the subject with either Clive Bell (who knew the truth but preferred to ignore it) or Grant (who was fond of Angelica but disinclined to assume a fatherly role).
''My dream of the perfect father -- unrealized -- possessed me, and has done so for the rest of my life,'' Ms. Garnett wrote in her memoir. ''My marriage was but a continuation of it, and almost engulfed me.''
In 1942, at 23, she married David Garnett, then nearly 50. A writer and publisher, he was the son of Constance Garnett, a well-known translator of Russian literature. (In a fittingly Bloomsbury rite of passage, Garnett deflowered Angelica in H. G. Wells's spare bedroom.)
Their marriage, which produced four daughters, was not a happy one. Ms. Garnett eventually deduced the relationship between her husband and her birth father, realizing that Garnett had married her as a way of maintaining a hold over Grant, whom he still loved, and Vanessa, whom he had tried to seduce only to be rebuffed.
Ms. Garnett left her husband after more than a quarter-century of marriage. Vanessa Bell died in 1961; after Grant's death in 1978, Ms. Garnett, her children grown and gone, looked in the mirror and saw, as she wrote, ''a vagueness, almost a hole, where I myself should have been.''
She began her memoir, she wrote, ''to describe my own ghosts, and, in doing so, to exorcise them.'' Her other books include a volume of autobiographical fiction, ''The Unspoken Truth'' (2010).
Two of Ms. Garnett's four daughters died before her.
''My eldest daughter, Amaryllis, who was very beautiful and deeply intelligent, drowned in the Thames when she was 26; I think it was suicide,'' Ms. Garnett said in an interview quoted in her obituary in The Telegraph, the British newspaper. ''Henrietta, my second, married when she was 17, and her husband died less than a year later. Then she tried to commit suicide when she was 25 by jumping out of a window. She was broken from top to bottom and has remained fragile ever since.'' A third daughter, Nerissa, died of a brain tumor in 2004.
Besides Henrietta, Ms. Garnett is survived by another daughter, Frances, who was ''described by her mother as 'a kind of mystic,' '' The Telegraph reported.
In interviews after her memoir appeared, Ms. Garnett spoke of having taken pains to ensure that the legacy of Bloomsbury was not visited on the next generation.
''Everyone has a certain difficulty in growing up, even my children, although I've been a good mother,'' she told The Australian Financial Review in 2010. ''I'm still not grown up in some ways compared with other people I know.''

HEADLINE: 'Why Don't We Have Any White Kids?'

BYLINE: By N.R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
IN seventh-grade English class, sun leaked in through the windows. Horns bleated outside. The assignment was for the arrayed students to identify a turning point in their lives. Was it positive or negative? They hunched over and wrote fervidly.
Floriande Augustin, a first-year teacher at the school, invited students to share their choices. Hands waved for attention. One girl said it was when she got a cat, though she was unsure why. Another selected a car crash. A third brought up the time when her cousin got shot and ''it was positive because he felt his life was crazy and he went to college so he couldn't get shot anymore.''
The lesson detoured into Martin Luther King Jr. and his turning points. Ms. Augustin listed things like how his father took him shopping for shoes and they were made to wait in the back. How a bus driver told him to relinquish his seat to a white passenger and stand in the rear. How he wasn't allowed to play with his white friends once he started school, because he went to a black school and his white friends went to a white school. 
The students scribbled notes. Unmentioned was a ticklish incongruity that hung glaringly obvious in the air. This classroom at Explore Charter School in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was full of black students in a school almost entirely full of black students. As Ms. Augustin, who is also black, later reflected, ''There was something about, 'Huh, here we are talking about that and look at us -- we're all the same.' ''
In the broad resegregation of the nation's schools that has transpired over recent decades, New York's public-school system looms as one of the most segregated. While the city's public-school population looks diverse -- 40.3 percent Hispanic, 32 percent black, 14.9 percent white and 13.7 percent Asian -- many of its schools are nothing of the sort.
About 650 of the nearly 1,700 schools in the system have populations that are 70 percent a single race, a New York Times analysis of schools data for the 2009-10 school year found; more than half the city's schools are at least 90 percent black and Hispanic. Explore Charter is one of them: of the school's 502 students from kindergarten through eighth grade this school year, 92.7 percent are black, 5.7 percent are Hispanic, and a scattering are of mixed race. None are white or Asian. There is a good deal of cultural diversity, with students, for instance, of Haitian, Guyanese and Nigerian heritage. But not of class. Nearly 80 percent of the students qualify for subsidized lunch, a mark of poverty. The school's makeup is in line with charter schools nationally, which are over all less integrated than traditional public schools.
At Explore, as at many schools in New York City, children trundle from segregated neighborhoods to segregated schools, living a hermetic reality.
The school's enrollment is even more racially lopsided than its catchment area. Students are chosen by lottery, with preference given to District 17, its community school district, which encompasses neighborhoods like Flatbush, East Flatbush, Crown Heights and Farragut. Census data for District 17 put the kindergarten-through-eighth-grade population at 75 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic, 12 percent white and 1 percent Asian. But the white students go elsewhere -- many to yeshivas or other private schools.
Tim Thomas, a fund-raiser who is white and lives in Flatbush, writes a blog called The Q at Parkside, about the neighborhood. He has spoken to white parents trying to comprehend why the local schools aren't more integrated, even as white people move in. ''They say things like they don't want to be guinea pigs,'' he said. ''The other day, one said, 'I don't want to be the only drop of cream in the coffee.' ''
Decades of academic studies point to the corroding effects of segregation on students, especially minorities, both in diminished academic performance and in the failure to equip them for the interracial world that awaits them.
''The preponderance of evidence shows that attending schools that are diverse has positive effects on children throughout the grades, and it grows over time,'' said Roslyn Mickelson, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who has reviewed hundreds of studies of integrated schooling. ''To put it another way, the problems of segregation are accentuated over time,'' she said.
Even if a segregated school provides a solid education, studies suggest, students are at a disadvantage. ''What is a good education?'' Dr. Mickelson said. ''That you scored well on a test?''
One way race presents itself at Explore is in the makeup of the teaching staff. It is 61 percent white and 35 percent black, a sensitive subject among many students and parents who would prefer more black teachers. Most of the administration and central staff members -- including the school's founder, the current principal, the upper-school's academic head and the lower-school's academic head, as well as the high school counselor and social worker -- are white.
As Ms. Augustin said: ''When I came here and started to talk about myself, the students were shocked that I was here. I started to wonder, did they really have role models?''
AFTER school one Tuesday, 10 students assembled in a classroom to talk about the school and race. The school paid for snacks: Doritos and Oreo cookies, Coke and 7Up.
What did they think of the absence of racial diversity?
''It doesn't really prepare us for the real world,'' said Tori Williams, an eighth grader. ''You see one race, and you're going to be accustomed to one race.''
Jahmir Duran-Abreu, another eight grader, said: ''It seems it's black kids and white teachers. Like one time we were talking and I said I like listening to Eminem and my teacher said this was ghetto. She was white. I was pretty upset. I was wondering why she would say something like that. She apologized, but it sticks with me.''
Jahmir, one of Explore's few Hispanic students, is its first student to get into Stuyvesant High School, one of the city's premier schools. He was also admitted to Dalton, an elite private school, where he intends to go. He wants someday to become an actor.
Shakeare Cobham, in sixth grade, offered a different view: ''It's more comfortable to be with people of your own race than to be with a lot of different races.''
Tori came back: ''I disagree. It doesn't prepare us.''
Yata Pierre, in eighth grade, said, ''It doesn't really matter as long as your teachers are good teachers.''
Trevon Roberts-Walker, a sixth grader, responded, ''When we are in high school and college, it's not going to be all one race.''
Jahmir: ''Yeah, in my high school there will be predominantly white kids, and I think this school will be so much better if it were more diverse.''
Kenny Wright, in eighth grade, piped in, ''You could have more discussion instead of all the same thoughts.''
Ashira Mayers, in seventh grade, said: ''We'd like to hear from other races. How do they feel? What's happening with them?''
Later on, Ashira elaborated: ''We will sometimes talk about why don't we have any white kids? We wonder what their schools are like. We see them on TV, with the soccer fields and the biology labs and all that cool stuff. Sometimes I feel I have to work harder because I don't have all that they have. A lot of us think that way.''
EXPLORE'S founder, Morty Ballen, 42, grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs, where his father ran several delis. A product of Teach for America, he taught English in a high school in Baton Rouge, La., that went from being all white to half-black. The white teachers would tell racist jokes in the faculty lounge, he said. He taught at an all-black school in South Africa started by a white woman, then at a largely black-and-Hispanic middle school on the Lower East Side. The experiences soaked in.
''I'm very cognizant of my whiteness, and that I have power,'' he said. ''I need to incorporate this reality in my leadership.''
He is also gay and knows about feeling different in school. ''The only people who were like me were two kids who went to drugs,'' he said. ''One died in high school, and the other died recently.''
Mr. Ballen founded Explore in 2002, resolute that a public school could deliver a good education to disadvantaged students. He now leads a Brooklyn charter network. (His fourth school is scheduled to open in September.) The school began in Downtown Brooklyn. In 2004, it relocated to a former bakery factory in Flatbush, where most classrooms were windowless. In August, the Education Department moved it to 655 Parkside Avenue, squeezing it into the fourth floor and portions of the third in a building occupied by Middle School 2 and Public School K141, a special-education school.
The shared building is relatively new and in good shape, but the library is half the size of a classroom, the space so tight that a few thousand books must be kept in storage. The cafeteria, auditorium, gym and playground are shared. Instead of a computer lab, the school has a rolling computer cart of laptops, used mostly for math classes. There is no playground equipment for the younger grades. There are a limited number of musical instruments, so the school has no band, or much in the way of after-school athletics. There are no accelerated classes for high-performing students.
Explore students wear uniforms and have a longer school day and year than the students in the other schools in the building, schools with which they have a difficult relationship. A great deal of teaching is done to the state tests, the all-important metric by which schools are largely judged. In the hallway this spring, before the tests, a calendar counted down the days remaining until the next round.
Explore's academic performance has been inconsistent. Last year, the school got its charter renewed for another five years, and this year, for the first time, three students, including Jahmir, got into specialized high schools. Yet, on Explore's progress report for the 2010-11 school year, the Education Department gave it a C (after a B the previous year). In student progress, it rated a D.
''We weren't doing right by our students,'' Mr. Ballen said.
In response, a new literacy curriculum was introduced and greater emphasis was put on applauding academic achievement. School walls are emblazoned with motivational signs: ''Getting the knowledge to go to college''; ''When we graduate ... we are going to be doctors.'' Teachers are encouraged to refer to students as ''scholars.''
Convinced that student unruliness was impeding learning, the school installed a rigid discipline system. Infractions -- for transgressions like calling out without permission, frowning after being given a demerit, being off task -- lead to detention for upper-school students. On some days, 50 students land in detention, a quarter of the upper school.
Positive behavior does bring rewards, like making the Respect Corps, which allows a student to wear an honorary T-shirt. Winning an attendance contest can lead to treats for the class or the freedom to wear jeans.
Still, some students have taken to referring to Explore as ''the prison school.''
OUT of uniform and barefoot, Amiyah Young was getting her books in order for homework. She was at home, two blocks from school, in an apartment she shares with her grandparents, mother and 2-year-old brother. She is in sixth grade, willowy, with watchful eyes, a dexterous thinker, one of the school's top students. She hopes to go to a university like Princeton and become a veterinarian, because she has noticed lots of people own animals.
She blithely showed her snug room, a converted dining nook containing her bed, her books, her stuffed animals, her cluster of snow globes. She said that some of her friends slept with their mothers or siblings, or on the couch.
Her mother, Shonette Kingston, 36, calm with an outreaching smile, works as an operating-room technician and attends nursing school. She separated from Amiyah's father when the girl was born. He is unemployed, and lives elsewhere in Brooklyn, but remains involved in her life.
''It's a bit weird,'' Amiyah said of the school's racial composition. ''All my friends are predominantly black, and all the teachers are predominantly white. I think white kids go to different schools. I don't know. I haven't seen many white people in a big space before.''
Would it be better if it were integrated?
''I think they would stop calling me white girl if there were white kids,'' she said. ''Because my skin is a little lighter and I can't dance, they call me that. Some of them can't dance, either.''
What else?
''I could talk the way I talk.''
Other students speak street slang that she repudiates: ''They will say to me, 'You are so white.' I tell them, I have two black parents. Do I look white?''
She had been having trouble making friends. This year, her mother noticed a speech change. ''She's slacking off more to fit in,'' Ms. Kingston said. ''She's saying: 'I been there.' 'I done that.' ''
Amiyah confirmed this: ''I speak a bit more freelance with my friends. Not full sentences. I don't use big words. They hate it when I do that.''
She said she had become more popular.
Other students also relate the use of parlance linked to skin color. Shakeare Cobham, one of Amiyah's friends, said: ''If you're darker, they'll call them burnt. Light-skinned ones get called white.''
Zierra Page, who is in eighth grade, said: ''The lighter-skinned girls think they're prettier. They'll say: 'She's mad dark. Look at me, I'm much prettier.' ''
Amiyah's parents are bothered by the abundance of white teachers. Her mother said: ''What do they know of our lives? They may be good teachers, but what do they know? You're coming from Milwaukee. You went to Harvard. Her dad complains about this all the time -- what can they bring to these African-American kids? I'm trying to keep an open mind. I'm happy with the education.''
Amiyah said, ''The white teachers can't relate as much to us no matter how hard they try -- and they really try.''
To extract her from the synthetic isolation of her environment, Amiyah's parents have enrolled her in programs with more racial diversity like an acting class in Manhattan.
She is curious about better-off white children. ''I'd like to see how they would react in the classroom when we have dance parties,'' she said. ''I'd like to see how they would react to a birthday party. And to being around so many of us. I'd like to see what they would think of some of the girls in our school who have big hair and those big earrings.''
Anything else?
She mulled that a moment, and said, ''I wonder if it's fun.''
EXPLORE'S administration neither encourages nor discourages discussion of race. Rarely is it openly examined.
A diversity task force was patched together over a year ago to look into things like how to bridge the divide among staff and students and their parents, and what the makeup of the staff should be. The group is preparing some recommendations.
Race, and its attendant baggage, of course, is a tricky subject. Teachers are of different minds about what to do with it.
Marc Engel, a former investment banker turned librarian and media coordinator at Explore, is 53 and white. He frets about power differentials and how to transcend race, how to steer the students' inner compass. ''I worry so much about their role models,'' he said. ''The rap stars. The fashion models. The basketball players.''
He has his way of trying to fit in. ''I call every kid brother and sister,'' he said. ''I say, hey, brother; hey, sister. One kid once asked me, 'Are you my uncle?' ''
OTHER staff members also wonder about the isolation of the students. Adunni Clarke, 34, who is black and is the lead intervention teacher who helps students and teachers who need extra support, said: ''I don't know that our kids get their placement in the world. I don't know that they realize that they're competing against all these other cultures.''
Talking about race ''could be a Pandora's box to some extent,'' said Corey Gray, 27, who is white and in his first year at Explore as an eighth-grade language-arts teacher. ''Is there a proper effective way to bring it in? There probably is. Do I know the way? No, I don't.''
Many of the teachers are young, from different backgrounds, and there is steady turnover -- from 25 percent to 35 percent in each of the past three years, a persistent issue at charter and high-poverty schools.
Tracy Rebe, the principal, is leaving this year. Her replacement, the fourth in the school's short history, will be the first black principal, though not by design.
Early in the year, Mauricia Gardiner, 30, who teaches fifth-grade math and is of mixed race, was listening as students read a story about a black teenager who tried to rob a woman. Instead of reporting him, the woman took him home and tried to set him straight. The woman's race wasn't mentioned.
Ms. Gardiner asked the class what race they imagined the woman to be. They said black, that no white woman would do that. Why? she asked.
''They would be scared of us,'' a student said.
''It's frustrating,'' Ms. Gardiner said. ''We don't have a forum to address this. You can get all the education in the world. But you have to function in the world.''
Darren Nielsen, 25, white, from Salt Lake City, is in his second year teaching, assigned to third grade. Last year, when he taught fourth grade, a student got miffed at him and said, ''Oh, this white guy.'' He later spoke to the student about singling out someone in a negative way because of his or her race. He overheard students call one another ''light-skinned crackers'' and ''dark-skinned crackers.''
''We had discussions about that being inappropriate,'' Mr. Nielsen said. ''I even said:I'm the lightest-skinned one of all. What does that make me?''
The discussion was quick. ''I probably should have done more,'' he said. ''It was hard on me as a first-year teacher and not knowing what to do.''
He added: ''I realize most of these kids are going to go to segregated schools until college. I wonder, am I preparing these kids for what goes on in college?''
Karen Hicks, 41, a former businesswoman who is now in her first year teaching fifth-grade math and science and is black, used to have a son in the school. ''I would have put him in an integrated school if I had that option,'' she said.
Ms. Hicks recalled her first conference as a parent, with a white teacher, now gone: ''The teacher said, 'Oh, you're so involved.' It felt patronizing. That should have been the expectation.''
IF anyone can relate to the students, it is James McDonald. Mr. McDonald, 41, black, the beloved gym teacher, has been with Explore since it opened. He grew up on the Lower East Side, where his father ran a liquor store and left home when Mr. McDonald was 9. He went to predominantly black and Latino schools, and says he didn't learn what he needed to learn.
In high school, he showed a college application essay to a scholarship committee member, who told him, ''If you want to go to college, you better learn how to spell it.'' He had written ''colledge.'' He realized the holes in his education. ''It deflated me,'' he said.
He thinks Explore students are getting a much better education than he did. Still, he is concerned.
''Outside the school the kids are being reminded of what their race is,'' he said. ''When they come to school, it's as if they are asked to ignore who they are.''
''I don't see that a lot of them have aspirations to do great things,'' he added. ''Some of them say, yeah, I want to be a doctor. But some, you ask them and they don't have an answer. I'd like to know how many actually believe they can do whatever they can.''
THE sixth-grade social studies students swept into Alexis Rubin's classroom. She slapped them five, bid them good afternoon. To settle them down, Ms. Rubin said, ''Students are earning demerits in one ... two ...''
She handed out a test on Colonial Williamsburg. She said, ''Every scholar in this room will get a sheet of loose-leaf paper for your short response.''
Of Explore's teachers, Ms. Rubin, 31, is perhaps the keenest about openly addressing race. She is in her third year at the school, is white and grew up on the Upper West Side.
Outside school, she is the co-chairperson of Border Crossers, an 11-year-old organization troubled by New York's segregated system that instructs elementary-school teachers how to talk about race in the classrooms.
As Jaime-Jin Lewis, the organization's executive director, puts it: ''You don't want kids learning about sex on the playground. You don't want them to learn about race and class and power on the playground.''
Ms. Rubin does Border Crossers exercises with her students like MeMaps, in which both students and teachers list characteristics about themselves, then create a ''diversity flower,'' with petals listing each participant's unique traits.
During Ms. Rubin's first year at Explore, a parent called her up, screaming that she ignored her son and called only on the white students. Ms. Rubin pointed out that there actually weren't any white students to call on.
She said schools needed to ''unpack'' the issue of race and dismantle stereotypes.
''The beginning is naming it,'' she said.
A GAUZY night in early spring, and the PTA meeting in the auditorium drew about three dozen parents. Details were given about picture day, about students needing to show up for preparation for the state tests, about neighborhood ne'er-do-wells who tried to rob some students, MetroCards and hats their targets.
Lakisha Adams, 35, who has three children in the school, spoke brightly of a Harlem mentoring program: ''It teaches about how to shake someone's hand, how to walk without your pants dragging down. This is all black. We put our kids in a lot of programs with kids that don't look like us. Our kids don't relate to Great Neck.''
Parents say they like Explore over all and the education it offers. To many, that is enough.
Sheryl Davis, 57, the PTA president, grew up in Brooklyn, and when she was in sixth grade, was bused out of her mostly black East New York school to a ''lily-white school.''
''I do remember the hate from the white students,'' she said. The next year, she was back in her former school.
''As I got older, I didn't really see that I gained from that experience,'' she said.
''I don't know that segregation is this horrible thing,'' Ms. Adams said. ''The problem with segregation is the assumption that black is bad and white is good. Black can be great. That's what I instill my kids with.''
Would she prefer an integrated school? ''I can't say that I would.''
Families often disagree among themselves. Calandra Maijeh, 38, and her husband, Ife Maijeh, 43, were at the school one evening with their four children, all Explore students.
''Color for me is not an issue,'' Ms. Maijeh said. ''As long as the learning is up to par.''
Mr. Maijeh said: ''My thoughts are very different from my wife. I agree that everybody deserves an education. But I want white and black to be together as one.''
Jean McCauley, 47, is a single mother with two sons by different fathers, both gone from her life. When her older son, now 26, began school, his father had a friend in TriBeCa, and they used his address to get him into Public School 234, a well-regarded, largely white school. ''I feel so grateful for my son being in that environment,'' she said. ''Expectations were so high. That school had everything. It was a world apart.''
He graduated from college and works at a real estate agency.
For her younger son, Brandon Worrell, she didn't have that option. He is in sixth grade at Explore. She considers it a good school, but fears he doesn't learn racial tolerance. ''At Explore he can't compare to anything,'' she said. ''He won't know how to communicate with other races. He won't know there is a difference. I think color will always be the first thing he sees.''
She added, ''I speak to Brandon about race. But he doesn't get it. It's abstract.''
A WEEK wound up. Education was occurring. In kindergarten, they were reading ''Sheep Take a Hike,'' while in first grade, students wrote about a small moment that happened to them. A girl wrote: ''This morning my mom pulled out my tooth. Ow. Ow. Ow.''
In sixth-grade math, they were reviewing order of operations, and in fifth-grade science they were learning about chyme. In third grade, they were writing a response to: How does Jimmy feel about raising goats? Use at least two details in your answer.
A student was told: ''You have the right to be mad. You don't have the right to kick things.''
Mr. Engel, teaching library, went around the room with the first graders and had them fill in the blank of ''America is...''
The answers shot back: ''America is ... my mommy.''
''Pie.''
''Whipped cream.''
''Burger King''
''Our life.''
A System Divided: This is the second article in a series examining the changing racial distribution of students in New York City's public schools and its impact on their opportunities and achievements. The previous article chronicled the experience of Rudi-Ann Miller, one of 40 black students at Stuyvesant High School, which has 3,295 students.

HEADLINE: Action-Oriented Sedan With a Predatory Spirit

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
GIVEN an unforeseen economic slump, an overblown unintended-acceleration drama and an unimaginable earthquake in Japan, it's clear that the recent wounds suffered by Lexus and its parent, Toyota, weren't all self-inflicted.
But while external factors and random disasters partly explain how Lexus lost its crown in 2011 -- after 11 consecutive years as America's best-selling luxury nameplate -- the brand's managers can't merely shake their fists at the heavens.
Well before the tsunami, what ailed Lexus (and Toyota) was the calm before the storm: a by-the-book conservatism shaded into complacency, seemingly born of the belief that bulletproof reliability would always carry the day and set these brands apart.
That quasi-religious belief, of course, helped Toyota to conquer the world. But as the company now recognizes, such a belief blinded it to customers' desire for cars that speak to the heart as well as the brain. That's especially true for models bought as a splurge. Zestier models from BMW and Mercedes have been dusting Lexus's sales even as Audi, once an underdog, has become the toast of industry tastemakers. 
Akio Toyoda himself, the race-driving chairman who is a grandson of Toyota's founder, has vowed to restore passion to his brands, which Internet provocateurs have dismissed as ''beige.''
Mr. Toyoda formed a new Global Lexus Division, separate from Toyota, with handpicked leaders who report directly to him. And last August in Pebble Beach, Calif., Mr. Toyoda introduced the redesigned GS 350 sport sedan. He heralded the car's signature ''spindle grille'' -- previewed on the outrageous LF-Gh concept car seen at the New York auto show last year -- as ''the new face of Lexus.''
Grimacing and glowering, it's a face that induced deja vu: where had I seen that mug, and those mandibles, before?
Then it hit me: it was in the Central American jungle, in '87. Mr. Toyoda may not realize it, but the new face of Lexus is a dead ringer for the Predator of sci-fi movie fame.
Mr. Toyoda has revealed that he initially opposed the styling, but he now thanks his team for fighting him until he gave the project a green light. And there's certainly no denying the passion of a creature, however repulsive it may appear, that skins its victims and keeps their skulls as trophies.
Yet the 2013 GS 350 isn't ugly, just mildly odd and alien, and you cannot order one in Slime Green. But because I enjoyed driving the car so much, I declared a truce with the styling. Still, I need to take issue with the huge gaps between the wheel wells and the tires that make the sport sedan appear less hunkered-down than it should.
More important, the fourth-generation GS is the most entertaining midrange Lexus sedan in memory.
Most unexpectedly, it defies the current midrange trend in which carmakers are prioritizing luxury over performance. Even the BMW 5 Series, the benchmark for action-oriented sedans, has gone softer; the latest model is built on the chassis of the larger 7 Series.
How's this for a Hollywood shocker: this Lexus not only has a more overtly aggressive demeanor than the 5 Series, the Audi A6 or the Mercedes E-Class, but its steering also feels more lively and connected.
Power is no issue. With 306 horses from a 3.5-liter direct-injection V-6, the rear-drive Lexus manages a 5.7-second sprint from 0 to 60 miles per hour, the company says, in line with the car's main rivals. The all-wheel-drive model is just a bit slower, at 6 seconds.
Unlike BMW, Benz and Infiniti, Lexus won't offer a V-8 engine. Instead, the new GS 450h hybrid model will pair a 3.5-liter V-6 with an electric motor and battery for a total of 338 horsepower.
A 6-speed transmission does give up one or two gears to its German competitors, though the GS still manages 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 28 on the highway. The all-wheel-drive version is rated 2 m.p.g. less on the freeway; the hybrid leads the lineup with a 29/34 m.p.g. rating.
While most of my passengers were ambivalent or tactful about the exterior styling, the contemporary cabin drew universal applause. The interior feels spacious, yet intimate, with expensive-looking surfaces and a tasteful mix of modern and traditional elements.
Like its competitors, the Lexus seeks to justify its $50,000-ish price with what I'll call the disconnect of connectivity: the GS wants occupants to feel cocooned in safety and protected from distracted drivers. It has ubiquitous, watchful monitors for blind spots, for drifting out of the lane and for impending collisions. Yet Lexus also insists that technology will free its own drivers to be entertained and informed with no threat to others.
For Lexus, as with BMW's original, groundbreaking iDrive, the solution looks good on paper -- except that you don't read the paper while you're driving. And in automotive terms, the GS's combination of a touchy joystick and a large 12.3-inch screen is like trying to paint an illuminated text while bouncing down a cobblestone street.
To prove it, I drove down my cobblestone Brooklyn street. Here and elsewhere, Lexus's leather-padded console joystick and wrist rest felt beautifully designed for a driver's hand. To help keep eyes on the road, Lexus developed a ''snap to'' function, a bit of haptic feedback through the joystick that draws the cursor to screen icons and freezes it there. And yes, it works fine when you're at the curb.
But when you're trying to make sense of New Jersey road signs, there are just too many icons, windows and choices, spread across that Pacific-sized screen like an archipelago. Your tiny boat, the onscreen cursor, has an annoying tendency to slip its moorings if you don't row it with precision. Having a left-handed passenger aboard works great, but the system requires too much of a driver's limited attention. Lexus, we await version 3.0.
The car's new smartphone-based Enform system does allow voice control of apps including Pandora Radio and Open Table's reservations system, or to check in on Facebook. But the dirty secret of voice commands, whether for phones or cars, is how rarely anyone actually uses them.
Using the Lexus Link system, I connected with a live operator who promptly sent navigation instructions into the car, letting me focus on the road.
That focus -- we all remember driving, right? -- is where the Lexus scored its best points, including some surprising aces. The GS isn't the fastest car in its class, and it can't claim a fancy dual-clutch transmission. But the car does something more important, something that's the antithesis of the usual Lexus. It loves to go fast, rather than isolate and hypnotize its occupants. The car remains whisper-quiet and comfortable, but it really encourages its driver to come out and play.
So play I did. Over an exhilarating four hours in rural Connecticut, I ended up getting just 17 m.p.g. -- a testament to how lustily I hammered the gas pedal. I did better on highways, but still averaged only about 23 m.p.g. And with a smallish 17-gallon tank, that consumption resulted in a stingy driving range of barely 350 miles.
I tested the most performance-oriented GS, with the F Sport package that adds $5,695 to the $50,325 base price of the all-wheel-drive model. (The rear-drive GS starts at $47,775.) F Sport features include smoky graphite 19-inch alloy wheels, a driver-selectable suspension (including slick onscreen graphics that highlight components within an X-ray transparency of the car), a 16-way sport driver's seat, aluminum cabin trim, racier body panels and more.
If buyers do make peace with the new corporate look, the GS could end up being the Lexus analog to the BMW 7 Series that made the designer Chris Bangle a household name. That love-it-or-hate-it sedan outraged traditionalists in 2002. Yet looking back, that car presaged a bold new era at BMW and began a winning streak that carried the brand to the American luxury-sales title for the first time in 2011.
Regarding their entire lineups, if Toyota and Lexus ever succeed in melding the emotional and practical sides of their brain, they may unleash a monster, like the fearsome Toyota of old, that could conquer America all over again.

HEADLINE: Welcome-Home Houses

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
THEY met eight years ago at a Marine Corps combat center: Michael Roushion, 25, of Oakland, Calif., had served one tour of duty and was re-enlisting; Nicole Burnett, 18, newly graduated from Lincoln High School in Yonkers, was fulfilling her childhood dream of becoming a Marine.
As Sergeant Roushion tells their story, it was love at first sight. The problem was that he and Corporal Burnett were awaiting deployment to Iraq. 
Once there, they served in different parts of the country, keeping in touch by e-mail and phone, meeting when they could and planning for a future that seemed at best uncertain. But their story, unlike that of many others, had a happy ending. They returned safely, married and are now raising a family: Michael Jr., 3, and Kimora, 9 weeks old.
These days, they are also pursuing the increasingly elusive American dream of owning a home, although saving for a down payment is a tall order. Mr. Roushion, an electrician's apprentice, and Ms. Roushion, who is applying to nursing school, pay $1,600 a month for a three-bedroom apartment in Yonkers.
But the picture brightened for them a few months ago, when the Westchester affiliate of Habitat for Humanity, one of 1,500 in the country, joined the parent organization's campaign to help veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan become homeowners. Mr. and Mrs. Roushion never imagined they could afford a residence in Westchester, where the median price of a single-family home -- about $500,000 -- is among the highest in the nation.
Throughout the country, as troops return from Iraq and Afghanistan, Habitat is focusing on ways to support their transition, especially given the economic climate. According to the group: ''More than 72,000 veterans spend at least half of their monthly income on rent. And as a result, home equity is out of their reach.''
In his New Rochelle office, Jim Killoran, the executive director of the Westchester affiliate, has earmarked six foreclosed homes in a downtrodden section of Yonkers to be among the first of about 20 to be renovated and sold to veterans like the Roushions.
The Westchester division, which operates on a $1.7 million annual budget for all of its projects, has already bought several of the homes for about $50,000 each from lending institutions, using donations from corporations like Cisco Systems, a global networking company in San Jose, Calif.; the Lanza Family Foundation in Harrison; and Silverstein Properties, the real estate firm rebuilding the World Trade Center.
Habitat will provide qualified veterans the mortgages -- an estimated $175,000 each -- interest-free with no down payment required. Under the terms of the sale, the house cannot be resold for 10 years.
Among the Yonkers properties that will probably be redone for returning veterans: a 2,400-square-foot house being converted to a two-family, and an abandoned three-bedroom colonial (vandals stole its copper plumbing months ago), which Mr. and Mrs. Roushion hope to move into within a year. They are to work alongside volunteers to rebuild the place, and to clear the brush obscuring views of the Hudson River and the New York City skyline. Mr. Killoran describes the houses as ''diamonds in the rough.''
They are on the west side of Yonkers in a formerly industrial area of mostly run-down buildings, many of them abandoned and pockmarked by broken windows. There is scattered evidence of the new energy that Habitat for Humanity is infusing into the neighborhood: freshly painted buildings, tidy community gardens and, at street corners, wooden planters filled with spring flowers.
''You can't just renovate a few houses and leave it at that,'' Mr. Killoran said. ''You have to bring up the whole neighborhood along with them.'' Cisco has worked with more than 150 Habitat for Humanity groups worldwide and contributed more than $9 million to the organization's various projects since 1998, said William DeKnatel, a Cisco client service director. In addition to money for construction, the company offers grants to provide Internet wiring for low-income families ''who often have less access to information on the Web,'' said Mr. DeKnatel, who works in Cisco's Manhattan offices and lives in Westchester.
He met Mr. Killoran several years ago at a Sunday service at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in New Rochelle and has since recruited church congregants, members of his Boy Scout troop and clients to volunteer for Habitat in Westchester.
At Silverstein Properties, Marty Burger, who shares the chief executive post with Larry Silverstein, says he met Mr. Killoran three years ago when one of Mr. Burger's sons expressed an interest in volunteering for the group.
Now Mr. Burger's synagogue, Congregation Emanu-El of Westchester in Rye, has become involved, its members installing kitchen cabinets, replacing door frames, windows and siding, and otherwise remaking substandard housing.
Also, subcontractors at the World Trade Center site, Mr. Burger said, have trucked in gravel, poured foundations and installed electrical circuitry for Habitat projects.
Mr. Burger described the burly 50-year-old Mr. Killoran, who has a master's degree in divinity and says he believes in the ''theology of the hammer,'' as ''a soldier who's out there every week gathering troops from temples, mosques, churches and colleges.''

HEADLINE: New Spending Cuts as California Shortfall Swells by Almost $7 Billion

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The state budget shortfall in California has increased dramatically in the last six months, forcing state officials to assemble a series of new spending cuts that are likely to mean further reductions to schools, health care and other social programs already battered by nearly five years of budget retrenchment, state officials announced on Saturday. 
Gov. Jerry Brown, disclosing the development in a video posted on YouTube, said that California's shortfall was now projected to be $16 billion, up from $9.2 billion in January. Mr. Brown said that he would propose a revised budget on Monday to deal with it.
''We are now facing a $16 billion hole, not the $9 billion we thought in January,'' Mr. Brown said. ''This means we will have to go much further and make cuts far greater than I asked for at the beginning of the year.''
Mr. Brown disclosed the news in a video that had all the trappings of a campaign announcement. In it, he aggressively accounted for the steps he said he had taken to try to scale back a $26 billion deficit he found upon taking office. And he urged viewers to back an initiative he is putting on the November ballot that would increase sales taxes by 0.25 percent and impose an income tax surcharge on wealthy Californians to try to stave off more cuts.
State officials said Mr. Brown's proposal would include a package of immediate cuts, as well as others that would be triggered only if voters failed to approve his tax plan. The sales tax increase would expire after four years, while the income tax surcharge would last for seven years.
State officials said the shortfall was a result of disappointing revenue collections in April as California continued to struggle to pull out of the recession. ''We are still recovering from the worst recession since the 1930s,'' Mr. Brown said.
Still, the state controller reported that the state had exceeded spending by $2.1 billion as well, though Mr. Brown said court rulings and other actions that restricted California from making the cuts were at least partly to blame.
At the same time, the deficit projections -- which have been increasing since Mr. Brown and the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a budget last summer -- suggest that the state may have been overly optimistic in estimating what kind of revenue it would take in. That has been a repeated problem in Sacramento as officials have struggled over the past five years with the state's worst financial crisis since the Depression. Mr. Brown, in taking office last year, pledged to end what he said were the tricks lawmakers regularly used to paper over budget shortfalls.

HEADLINE: Chronicling the Pounds, Their Risks and Causes

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
DURING the production of ''The Weight of the Nation,'' a set of films about obesity that HBO will start showing this week, John Hoffman watched over and over again the commercials for sugary snacks and gut-busting meals that appear in excerpts. He knew exactly which buttons the ads were trying to push and why, yet he still was not immune to them.
''When salt is sprinkled over fries and juicy meats are sliced open in front of my eyes, I can feel myself going, 'Oh, that looks good,' '' Mr. Hoffman said in an interview, recounting a day when one of the advertising sequences was being stitched together by editors. The ads, he said, ''were operating in parts of my brain that are outside my control.'' 
It's rare to hear a television executive like Mr. Hoffman, vice president for documentary films at HBO, talk about the psychological effects of advertising, and rarer still to see it talked about on television, a medium that depends in large part on advertising revenue. But ''The Weight of the Nation,'' which is billed as a wake-up call about an American obesity epidemic, would be incomplete without an acknowledgment of the billions of dollars that are spent to promote unhealthy foods on television and on the Internet. And so the series addresses food marketing at several points along the way, particularly as it affects children, many of whom grow up with affinities for McDonald's Happy Meals and Taco Bell burritos. Examples flash by on the screen: Britney Spears drinking Pepsi; Eminem hawking Brisk Iced Tea; characters on ''The Simpsons'' drinking Cokes.
One expert featured in the series, Kelly Brownell of the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, says in one of the films that food marketing to children is ''powerful, it's pernicious, and it's predatory.'' Another, William Dietz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says, ''It is the advertising which drives the food supply which drives the likelihood of obesity.''
Mr. Hoffman, an executive producer of the obesity series, said he agreed. ''It's not a coincidence that the foods that are marketed the most are the foods that are the most processed and the most profitable,'' he said. ''Those foods shape the cravings of the public. That then shapes the diet and is now shaping the nation.''
Of course, because ''The Weight of the Nation'' is a production of HBO, which carries no commercials, the network had no need to worry about advertiser blowback. The films were financed by HBO: a series of public health initiatives surrounding the films were supported by the health insurer Kaiser Permanente and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which concentrates on health and education.
Mr. Hoffman said he doubted he would have been able to scrutinize food and beverage marketing practices if he had been making the films for another broadcaster. ''A commercial network would be biting the hand that feeds it,'' he said.
The president of HBO documentary films, Sheila Nevins, added this: ''We don't have time to duck any bullets.'' She said she didn't know if other networks would have pursued the topic of food marketing, and she added slyly, ''I just know that sometimes food looks awfully good on television.''
HBO embarks on a health series like ''The Weight of the Nation'' every few years. It previously produced multipart series about addiction and Alzheimer's disease. This time around, four films have their premieres: ''Consequences'' and ''Choices'' on Monday night and ''Children in Crisis'' and ''Challenges'' on Tuesday night.
The four films are intentionally somewhat repetitive, recognizing that many viewers won't watch all four. At their roots the films all assert that obesity is an American epidemic that deserves urgent attention from policy makers, educators and ordinary eaters. Solving the problem, Mr. Hoffman said, ''is going to require a massive renovation of the way we live our lives.''
He said his intention is not to ''villainize'' the food industry but to ''sound a very loud alarm'' about the products that Americans are eating.
The films try to reorient conversations about obesity away solely from personal responsibility and toward a combination of environmental circumstances to explain why 70 percent of Americans are, according to federal statistics, either overweight or obese. While personal responsibility is an important piece, ''you cannot say that all these people have lost all their willpower,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''There's clearly something more powerful going on.'' Factors cited by the films include federal farm subsidies, marketing strategies, changes in the work force, the content of high-caloric foods and the genetic makeup of individuals.
To rope in the latest research on obesity the filmmakers worked with the nonprofit Institute of Medicine and two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. What particularly fascinated Mr. Hoffman during his research, he said, was the notion of a biological mismatch between a human species whose genes evolved in a world of scarcity but that now exist in a world of abundance. ''We're hard-wired to respond to the colors of red and yellow -- ripeness,'' he said. ''Why do you think McDonald's and most fast-food companies use red and yellow?''
In an interview Phil Marineau, a former president of Pepsi-Cola North America and Quaker Oats, put it this way: ''Our DNA has programmed us to want more, and our economic and cultural systems have delivered more.''
Mr. Marineau was the member of an Institute of Medicine committee about how to accelerate progress in obesity prevention whose meetings were filmed for ''The Weight of the Nation.'' The meetings in 2010 and 2011 give the films a narrative arc, as do the personal stories of people trying to lose weight with the help of medical experts. Still, the films can feel academic at times, as if intended as much for classrooms as for living rooms. In fact they are. They will be distributed via DVD to thousands of community organizations and streamed on hbo.com so nonsubscribers can see them. And a companion series specially made for children will be shown in the fall.
Margo Wootan, a director at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, said she was thankful HBO had targeted obesity prevention through the series and had included marketing in the conversations.
''It is challenging to get educational messages out to parents about the impact and the importance of marketing, because almost everyone who usually shares information with parents -- especially broadcast media -- has a conflict of interest, because they're all running junk food ads aimed at kids,'' said Ms. Wootan, who is quoted throughout the HBO series.
An increasing body of research has shown that advertising content affects eating behavior, and, as a couple of experts ruefully point out in the films, viewers would probably be hard-pressed to remember the last time they saw an ad for fruits or vegetables.
The food and beverage industries have self-regulated their marketing to youth, but they spend $2 billion a year on ads and other forms of outreach to children and teenagers, according to the Federal Trade Commission. ''The food companies are participating in self-regulation a lot more than the media companies,'' Ms. Wootan said.
Ms. Nevins said she sensed the films had already affected the consciousness of her staff at HBO. Some people there have lost ''a considerable amount of weight,'' she said, and others seem more aware of the foods and beverages they're consuming. ''They may not make the right choices,'' she said, ''but they know when they're making the wrong ones.''

HEADLINE: Office Detectives

BYLINE: By BETSEY STEVENSON. 
Betsey Stevenson, the Ethicist this week, is a visiting assistant professor of economics at Princeton University.

 BODY:
At my office, we were feeling a nagging concern about a candidate we were strongly considering for a position. So we decided to call someone at a company the person had listed on the resume but had not provided a reference for. Wow, did we get earful on the person (not in a good way)! But then we weren't sure if it was ethical to use this information in assessing the person. Of course, it was awfully hard to forget. We ultimately didn't hire the person. NAME WITHHELD, OAKLAND 
Shrewd folks ask their references if they plan on saying good things about them, and ethical people answer them honestly. And so references are invariably good. So how does a potential employer learn about a person's shortcomings? Employers should dig into an applicant's work history to try to assess his potential fit. This means that it is perfectly acceptable to call a former employer not listed as a reference. The alternative to your thorough information-gathering is potentially hiring the wrong candidate, which is bad, not just for your office but also for the better candidate you would have hired had you done your homework. Another alternative to the hard work of assessing an unknown candidate is to rely on personal recommendations from your friends or co-workers, but that shortcut discriminates against folks who aren't fortunate enough to have well-connected friends.
But did you discuss the bad reference with the candidate? He (or she) deserved a chance to respond, and you should have asked him in the interview what didn't work out in his previous position, what he learned from it and how those lessons would translate into better performance in the job you were filling. If you didn't give the candidate a chance to talk candidly about his experience, then I think you failed both your company and the candidate. Otherwise, congratulations on avoiding a potentially disastrous hire. And I'm sure that the person you did hire is grateful for your intense vetting of the candidates.
OCCUPY DISNEY
We are planning a trip to Orlando to take my son to Disney World for Memorial Day weekend. Everything was booked, and then the Trayvon Martin case happened. We are quite angry at the murder of this child, the Stand Your Ground law and the deliberate negligence of the Florida authorities. Are we obligated to cancel our trip? Our son very much wants to go, but even if we lose a lot of money, I feel that ethically we shouldn't be spending our tourist dollars in Florida. NAME WITHHELD
Voting with your dollars is powerful, so your desire to curtail your spending in Florida, given your beliefs, makes a lot of sense. But have your dollars already voted? If the trip is prepaid and nonrefundable, then staying home won't register as any kind of protest, and you will succeed only in hurting your family.
Instead, go on the trip, pack peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches -- so no more of your dollars are spent in Florida -- and stay at the park from dawn to dusk to really get your money's worth. But be careful sharing your amazing vacation photos with friends, lest you inadvertently encourage them to spend their tourist dollars in Florida.
JUST A TASTE
My mom and I argue whenever we head to the mall or go grocery shopping. I think it's fine to duck into Sephora and try on some makeup, even though it is out of my price range. Similarly, it's fine to grab a free sample at Trader Joe's or a food store, even if I have no intention of buying it. My mom happily takes free samples, but won't try on makeup with me. Is there a difference? Is either ethical? NAME WITHHELD
Both Trader Joe's and Sephora provide free samples to entice people who don't yet know that they want to buy the item they are sampling. Your mom may be worried that if you never plan to buy the sampled product at Sephora, then you are not its intended audience. That logic also would apply to samples at Trader Joe's. What probably doesn't occur to her is that you also are not the target audience if you definitely are going to buy the product before you sample it. In both cases, taking the sample is ethical.
Even though you may be quite confident that you will never buy a product from Sephora, we are all notoriously bad at predicting what our future selves will do. The store's bet is that it is offering such a transformative product that, after trying it, you will be willing to make a sacrifice, like giving up coffee for a month, to afford it. Why should your mom deny Sephora the chance to persuade you or her?

HEADLINE: Still Flaunting the Luxe Life

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Last year, Joseph C. Nunes, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California, published a paper with two colleagues in the Journal of Consumer Psychology titled ''Conspicuous Consumption in a Recession: Toning It Down or Turning It Up?'' Examining product lines from Louis Vuitton and Gucci developed right before the financial crisis of 2008 and during the recession, the researchers concluded that despite the predictable musings of the popular press forecasting diminished ostentation, showiness was thriving. Logos were far more prominently displayed on products introduced during the recession than they were on products that went out of circulation, they determined. Prices were raised, and the profits of the companies hardly suffered as a result.
While those living in TriBeCa lofts furnished with reclaimed wood, folk art and flax bed linens might find this paradoxical, marketing theorists do not. Citing previous research on luxury shopping that divides affluent consumers into two groups -- ''patricians'' and ''parvenus'' -- Dr. Nunes and his partners argued that the latter group, ever intent on deriving status through what it buys, remained resistant to the pressures others felt during difficult times to appear restrained in their habits. 
While patricians (by which we mean both third-generation occupants of Park Avenue apartments and those who might shop at ABC Carpet) seek an even more quiet tastefulness, parvenus angle to dissociate themselves more obviously from the less-well-off. Some luxury companies, realizing this, begin to focus more aggressively on those unburdened by sensitivities to distress.
Few experiences in New York could have lent this theory greater credence than the peculiar event known as the Luxury Review, which took place at the Metropolitan Pavilion, an event space in Chelsea, on Thursday night. Created by Bradford Rand, who is in the business of putting on job fairs, particularly for the intelligence community, the Luxury Review is a trade show for high-end jewelers, watchmakers, boat builders, automotive dealers and so on who come to market themselves to people who buy expensive things and also to market themselves to one another in the hope of forging various alliances.
Outside the pavilion, a stretch of West 18th Street was given over to two Aston Martins -- a 2011 DB9-Volante and a 2012 Vantage S Coupe -- and a 34-foot Hacker-Craft runabout, a mahogany boat that took 2,000 production hours and costs $289,000. Midway through the evening, guests were asked to turn their attention to the debut of a Champagne (actually from Champagne) called Billionaires Row.
Inside was a new Bentley, the Silverlake 2012 Bentley Continental GTC convertible, eventually unveiled, and beside it was the president of Bentley Americas, Christophe Georges, who informed me that sales of Bentleys in the United States increased 32 percent last year over sales from 2010. The United States is now the company's biggest market.
When I asked Mr. Georges to outline in specific terms the profile of his customer base, he explained that the Bentley owner typically has five or six luxury vehicles. These are the kind of wealthy people, he said, ''who want to reward themselves for their great achievements.''
The scene at the pavilion begged for broad generalizations about what those achievements might be. One young woman in a lace minidress, orange platform stilettos and a Hermes Kelly bag -- a uniform one has not come to associate with Meg Whitman -- wandered about aimlessly deflecting male attention. Another woman, Natalia Darialova, 20 or so years older, described herself in quick succession as a fashion designer, a television executive and, as she said some referred to her, ''the Oprah of Russia.''
She was there as the guest of Sean Koh, the scion of an entrepreneurial family whose holdings include Manhattan Woods, a golf club in West Nyack, N.Y., that had a booth in the pavilion. If you are the kind of person who might be reluctant to join a club that would have you as a member, then you would presumably ingest your 9-irons, spit them out and repeatedly stab yourself with the prongs of your golf shoes before you would affiliate yourself with one that sought to promote itself at a miniaturized convention at which Ivanka Trump's jewelry line was also on display. Mr. Koh seemed to realize his predicament, stressing that ''we are not here actively seeking membership,'' and describing the club as ''very exclusive.''
The difference between New York and a place like Los Angeles or Moscow or Chengdu is that we believe patrician tastes dominate here. We believe that a certain ambivalence about money still clings to some fraction of the well-to-do. The city is more virtuous in part because its excesses are less visible. We might walk down Fifth Avenue in the 80s knowing we are walking past some of the most expensive real estate in the world, but because we are not bombarded by a view of gates and fountains and garden attendants, we imagine ourselves in a more sacred place.
And yet, hasn't this view become ever harder to maintain? On Thursday evening, I met only one person who seemed aggrieved by what surrounded her, Miriam Luan, a former investment banker who divides her time between private-equity work in Manhattan and winemaking in Argentina. ''This,'' she said, surveying the room, ''is not luxury.''

HEADLINE: Human Rights, Not So Pure Anymore

BYLINE: By SAMUEL MOYN. 
A professor of history at Columbia University and the author of ''The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History.''

 BODY:
THE international commotion around the blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng aroused memories of earlier dissidents like Andrei D. Sakharov and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Eastern bloc heroes of another age who first made ''international human rights'' a rallying cry for activists across the globe and a high-profile item on Western governments' agendas.
All the familiar elements were there: the lone icon speaking for moral principle against totalitarian rule, the anonymous but courageous network at home that sheltered him, the supporters abroad who rallied around his cause, and the governments that made their choices based on a difficult calculus of moral ideals and geopolitical interests. The cat-and-mouse game of Mr. Chen's surreptitious flight and America's response resembled cold war cloak-and-dagger intrigue, too, but dissidents then sometimes were pushed into their own underground railroads, and often states bargained over their ultimate fate. 
The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- which Peng-Chun Chang, a representative of Nationalist China, helped draft -- had virtually no impact on world politics in its time. It was only 30 years later that Soviet dissidents and refugees from Latin American dictatorships catapulted human rights to visibility. In part because it was so new, the idea of international human rights initially seemed an uncontroversial effort to establish moral norms above the fray of the cold war's ideological battles.
Forty years into the era that Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn and many less famous dissidents founded, the meaning of human rights has now become familiar. In reporting on Mr. Chen, most publications, including this newspaper, used the terms ''dissident'' and even ''prisoner of conscience'' to refer to him.
However, since the time Amnesty International and other groups popularized those phrases, human rights -- a term that once meant the defense of individuals against the oppression of an unjust state -- has come to imply other things, too.
Today, it is just as likely to be invoked by powerful states to wage war in distant corners of the globe, much to the chagrin of authoritarian leaders in wealthy rising powers like Russia and China, who see such ''humanitarian interventions'' as a violation of states' sovereignty -- not to mention a threat to their manner of rule.
The West's continuing reckoning with China is not likely to play out according to familiar protocols. China has always had a much more distant relationship with international human rights norms than the Communist states of yesteryear. In the cold war, an era when America didn't ratify any human rights treaties, the Soviet Union did. The fact that their governments had done so gave dissidents' appeals to international human rights tremendous power at home.
It was Communist Czechoslovakia's ratification of the main international human rights covenants in 1976 that brought them into legal force -- and helped inspire the creation of the dissident manifesto, Charter 77, the next year. Prompted by the arrest of members of the rock band Plastic People of the Universe, Vaclav Havel and his fellow signatories criticized the government for failing to abide by the human rights treaties it had signed. Communist China, excluded from the United Nations at the time the first human rights treaties were drafted, still hasn't ratified the covenant for political and civil rights.
Another reason China's Charter 08 -- formed by Chinese dissidents on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration -- hasn't had an impact comparable to that of its famous Czech predecessor is primarily because today's geopolitical balance of power is very different from the one that favored cold war dissidents.
Although America was weathering its own economic storm as the human rights era dawned in the 1970s, it was not faced with the prospect of a rising Soviet Union at the time, especially not one whose productivity had supported their extensive borrowing.
Today, China is rising, and because it controls so much Western debt, it is unlikely to be as easy to target for its internal conduct. Some claim that international human rights norms undid the Soviet empire, while others say that it declined and fell because of political mismanagement and economic collapse -- things that seem much more prevalent in the West than in China now.
This geopolitical shift gives today's dissidents and their foreign allies much less leverage than their predecessors had.
BUT the main difference between then and now is that the whole idea of human rights has lost some of its romantic appeal and moral purity. Today, the issue of human rights is no longer just about limiting power in the global arena but also about how to deploy it.
For many, defending human rights implies the activist prevention of atrocity, after Bosnia and Rwanda stoked our consciences. Following America's protective bombing of Kosovo in 1999, George W. Bush in 2003 inveighed against Saddam Hussein's torture chambers before going to war (though a few new torture chambers were set up once Americans got there).
Barack Obama, along with other concerned politicians, appealed to human rights to justify what became regime change in Libya, going far beyond the cause of saving civilians from carnage.
That China and post-Soviet Russia have erected obstacles to a rerun of that human rights war in Syria is easy to chalk up to retrograde interests. But the fact is that they know that the idea of human rights today is about getting things done and not just keeping evil at bay.
It is true that human rights allow their most hopeful partisans to claim that the movement means something beyond the chastening of extremist governments. In Europe, the idea of human rights has penetrated deeply into the way the Continent governs itself, becoming a source of appeal to all comers, not just a weapon against totalitarianism.
But it is in this broader realm that human rights have proved most politically divisive and disappointing. For some dreamers, human rights mean ensuring citizen welfare in the form of economic justice, both within and among states. Yet the idea of international human rights has become prominent in an era when many governments are turning away from the welfare state in the name of the free market.
For those who long for a state and a world that not only protect liberties but also promote well-being, the human rights movement hasn't made enough of a difference. Human rights have succeeded in combating totalitarianism and preventing atrocities but have proved less able to promote the good life for people suffering less spectacular wrongs.
That human rights have come down to earth since the days of the glamorous dissidents doesn't make them useless. But it does mean that the utopia they call to mind is now inseparable from the realities of the world as it exists -- from states to international bodies to transnational movements. For that reason, Chinese dissidents and their Western allies will need to be even more creative than their predecessors were in using human rights norms to achieve a reformed government.
Most of all, when they appeal to international human rights, they will have to face the fact that these once pure ideals are now much harder to separate from the impure world of daily policy making, international power and unfulfilled hopes.

HEADLINE: Honduras Takes a Mulligan

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Shortly after the 2009 coup that overthrew Manuel Zelaya, Honduras's newly elected president, Porfirio Lobo, asked his aides to think big, really big. How could Honduras, the original banana republic, reform a political and economic system that kept nearly two-thirds of its people in grim poverty?
One young aide, Octavio Ruben Sanchez Barrientos, had no idea how to undo the entrenched power networks. Honduras's economy is dominated by a handful of wealthy families; two American conglomerates, Dole and Chiquita, have controlled its agricultural exports; and desperately poor farmers barely eke out subsistence wages. Then a friend showed him a video lecture of the economist Paul Romer, which got Sanchez thinking of a ridiculously big idea: What if Honduras just started all over again? 
Romer, in a series of papers in the 1980s, fundamentally changed the way economists think about the role of technology in economic growth. Since then, he has studied why some countries stay poor even when they have access to the same technology as wealthier ones. He eventually realized something that seems obvious to any nonacademic, that poor countries are saddled with laws and, crucially, customs that prevent new ideas from taking shape. He concluded that if they want to be rich, poor countries need to somehow undo their invidious systems (corruption, oppression of minorities, bureaucracy) and create an environment more conducive to business. Or they could just start from scratch.
Then he decided to put the theory into practice. In 2009, Romer developed the idea of charter cities -- economic zones founded on the land of poor countries but governed with the legal and political system of, often, rich ones. There were a couple of interested parties. (The president of Madagascar was intrigued by a preliminary version of the idea, Romer told me, but he was soon ousted in a coup.) Then, in late 2010, Sanchez met with Romer, and the two hurriedly persuaded President Lobo to make Honduras the site of an economic experiment. The country quickly passed a constitutional amendment that allowed for the creation of a separately ruled Special Development Region.
According to Romer, becoming a wealthy country requires better-run cities because that's where people are headed. Cities might offer horribly paying jobs in factories and domestic service, but many families make the move because they're still earning far more than they can make by farming. In 1900, nearly 90 percent of the world's population was rural. By 2000, three-quarters of people in the United States, Western Europe and other wealthy countries were city dwellers. In the next 40 years, the United Nations estimates, the world's urban population will grow by nearly three billion, largely in poor countries.
It has been an ugly transition. I saw it firsthand a few years back, when I visited a family in San Pedro Sula, Honduras's business capital. Jose Avila and Gloria Rodriguez, who worked much of their lives on a banana plantation for 25 cents a day, had recently moved to a lawless slum outside the city so that their children might have a better future. By the time I met them, they had just earned enough money to turn their shack into a concrete house. Jose was selling computers, and his oldest daughter, Joheny, was a star sock-machine repairwoman. Joheny insisted that she was one of the lucky ones. Many of the other women her age were able to work only as prostitutes or for drug dealers.
Romer's charter city is trying to avoid this dark side of urbanization by adapting older, more successful models. The United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Singapore were able to build well-designed cities that housed and employed millions, in part by persuading foreigners to invest heavily. Dubai created a number of micro/cities -- one of which, for instance, is governed by a system resembling English common law with judges from Britain, Singapore and New Zealand.
Each has had well-known flaws, but Romer said the core idea can be replicated without them. The new Honduran charter city can work, he said, if its foreign leadership can similarly assure investors that they've created a secure place to do business -- somewhere that money is safe from corrupt political cronyism or the occasional coup. If a multinational company commits to building new factories, real estate developers will follow and build apartments, which then provide the capital for electricity, sewers, telecom and a police force.
Romer hasn't yet been able to persuade any nations to take on the role of custodian (Sweden and Britain both passed), so Honduras has named a board of overseers until there are enough people to form a democracy. Romer, who is expected to be chairman, is hoping to build a city that can accommodate 10 million people, which is 2 million more than the current population of Honduras. His charter city will have extremely open immigration policies to attract foreign workers from all over. It will also tactically dissuade some from coming. Singapore, Romer said, provides a good (if sometimes overzealous) model. Its strict penalties for things like not flushing a public toilet may make for late-night jokes, but they signal to potential immigrants that it is a great place if you want to work hard and play by the rules.
There will be many rules in Romer's charter city too. Even though he expects most initial opportunities will be fairly low-paying basic industrial jobs, the local government will mandate policies that ensure retirement savings, health care and education. According to Romer's plan, the immigrants who arrive will not get rich, but their children will eventually be ready to climb the economic-development ladder.
Romer told me that the response to his charter city has been polarized. ''Some people said, 'This reeks of colonialism,' '' he explained. ''Other people said that everything we've been trying to do has had so little impact, maybe we should consider something different.'' There are, of course, countless ways that this charter city could go wrong, but Romer has a point. Huge numbers of people are already moving to the world's cities, too many of which are set up to create unstable poverty. Wealthy countries spend billions per year on projects designed to reform governments, build modern utilities or teach their workers new agricultural techniques. For all the cash, there has been very little success. Sponsoring a charter city, Romer said, may be a better (and cheaper) way to help.
It's easy to criticize experimenting with the livelihoods of the poor, but having spent time in the chaotic slums of Honduras, Haiti, Jordan and Indonesia, I've found that the poor are already conducting daily experiments in how to make life better outside the formal economy. By and large, it isn't working. We have to try some new things, probably many new things. And we have to accept that some of them won't work.
Deep Thoughts This Week
1. The world is becoming overwhelmingly urban.
2. Multinationals rarely invest in unstable nations.
3. There must be a better way for rich countries to help poorer ones.

HEADLINE: Flights To Safety Can't Hide The Dangers

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE pattern has been repeated so many times that it might be comforting if it weren't so disturbing.
During a relatively calm stretch early in the year, the stock market rallied. But then the financial and political problems of the euro zone made headlines. At the same time, the outlook for the global economy dimmed.
Stock markets around the world began to stumble. Investors reduced the level of risk in their portfolios and started to pour their cash into all the usual places, with United States Treasuries near the top of just about everyone's list. A bond rally was in full swing again. 
''When people are worried, all roads lead to Treasuries, and that just doesn't seem likely to change anytime soon,'' said Kathy A. Jones, fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab.
Even in an election year in the United States, with fiscal policy in a state of disarray and with a budget deficit of more than $1 trillion, Treasuries remain in great demand. Last week, prices rose, and 10-year yields fell as low as 1.84 percent.
German government bonds have been another consistent favorite for risk-averse investors over the last few years. Last week, despite pressure on Germany to shoulder more of the euro zone's debt burden, they were, if anything, even more highly prized than Treasuries. Yields on 10-year bunds, as they are called, touched 1.49 percent during the week. And in Britain, where the government has been slashing costs, long-term bond yields fell to 1.88 percent -- the lowest since the Bank of England started collecting data in 1703, according to The Financial Times.
''We are living in very unusual times,'' said Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, the world's largest bond manager. ''History may not be as reliable a guide as it's been in the past.''
JPMorgan Chase's disclosure on Thursday night that it had lost an estimated $2 billion in a portfolio of credit investments put pressure on financial stocks on Friday, contributing to the global equity sell-off and to the bond market's momentum. But this month's elections in the euro zone were perhaps the most immediate cause of last week's flight to safety.
In Greece, voters repudiated the government that had negotiated its bailout, placing the country's future in the euro zone in doubt. In the French presidential election, voters embraced Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate, who demanded an end to single-minded budget-cutting for its own sake and called for a new ''growth compact'' for Europe.
''Obviously,'' Ms. Jones said, ''the people have spoken in Europe and they don't like austerity.'' Bond investors tend to like austerity, however, because it may increase the likelihood that debt will be repaid. While traders flocked to Germany and Britain for sovereign bonds, they drove down prices of bonds perceived as riskier, like Spain's; yields on its bonds moved above the critical 6 percent level for a time last week.
CONCERN about a ''soft patch of economic data,'' including a slowdown in China and a disappointing United States employment report, also weighed on investors, said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners. He says the long-term trend for government bond yields is ''undoubtedly upward,'' but adds that its emergence has been delayed by the protracted economic malaise.
''Right now, if the economy slows down further, bond yields could go even lower,'' he said, suggesting that the Federal Reserve would be likely to intervene again in an effort to stimulate the economy.
Sovereign bond yields have traditionally defined the ''risk-free rate'' used to value a vast array of financial assets and investments, but after the traumas of the last few years, these yields are so low that such valuations are very hard to make, said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University. ''I think the main factor holding long-term rates down now is very weak global economic growth, and I don't see that changing soon,'' he said. One indication that the world had truly recovered from the financial crisis would be a rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 4 percent, he said, but he did not see that prospect as imminent.
David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, has been writing bearish reports on the equity markets and the global economy for many months. He said in an interview that the debilitating effects of ''global debt deleveraging'' would continue for the foreseeable future. The economic recovery in the United States is precarious, he said, and ''gridlock in Washington at this moment is not contributing to a solution of the country's problems.''
He cited Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has warned that unless Congress and the White House take action later this year, the United States could hurtle over a ''massive fiscal cliff.'' That's a reference to the impending Dec. 31 expiration of the tax cuts of President George W. Bush, and to the start of billions of dollars of across-the-board spending reductions passed in last year's deal to raise the debt ceiling. Combining the tax increase and spending cuts would ensure a recession, Mr. Rosenberg said.
Government action to forestall these effects is urgent, Mr. El-Erian said. ''It's only a matter of weeks before the markets begin to really focus on that 'fiscal cliff,' '' he said. ''It hasn't really been priced into the market.''
If these fiscal issues aren't resolved, he said, there will probably be far greater market volatility than we have seen recently, with major declines in stocks and a further rally in bonds. Investors would want to have ''some dry powder'' -- cash on hand -- to avoid excessive losses and to take advantage of opportunities that arise, he said.
We can't derive too much comfort from the repetition of patterns in the markets, he said, noting the adage that while history doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes. ''At some point,'' Mr. El-Erian said, ''it will stop rhyming.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Making Taxation Fairer

 BODY:
Readers offer ideas for tax reform but doubt it will happen.
The Letter
To the Editor:
While Occupy Wall Street and the Buffett tax focus on the top 1 percent, many more Americans should expect to pay additional taxes regardless of who becomes our next president. When the economy recovers sufficiently, Congress must consider eliminating the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for most taxpayers and other tax breaks.
Raising taxes only on the top 3 percent or so -- couples with $250,000 or more of income, and others with more than $200,000, as President Obama advocates -- yields far too little revenue to sustain basic government programs most Americans embrace and to bring down the nation's unsustainable deficits. Extending the Bush tax cuts to the bottom 97 percent would likely reduce revenues by more than $2 trillion in just 10 years.
Any additional income taxes should come from fundamental tax reform. With interest deductions on up to $1 million of home mortgage loans, a free pass on unlimited health insurance paid at work and myriad other tax breaks, our current system shelters at least half of all individual income from income tax -- $6 trillion or so last year. Consequently, the tax liabilities of the bottom 97 percent, as well as the top 3 percent, too often depend on their ability to avoid taxes. 
By addressing tax breaks that make neither social nor economic sense, Congress would advance a basic tenet of tax fairness: equals should pay equally. For example, families of equal size with equal incomes would generally pay the same amount. People who previously benefited disproportionately from tax breaks would pay disproportionately more of any additional taxes. And with far more income to tax, Congress could collect more revenue yet lower tax rates on wages and salaries, and tax unearned and earned income at the same rates.
Best of all, this simpler, fairer system would promote economic growth. Yes, fundamental tax reform would be good for America.
JOHN O. FOX Amherst, Mass., May 8, 2012
The writer is a former tax lawyer and is updating his 2008 book ''10 Tax Questions the Candidates Don't Want You to Ask.''
Readers React
Any time you hear the word ''reform'' in American politics, you can be 90 percent certain that you're being deceived, and when you hear ''tax reform,'' that little bit of uncertainty should disappear. Everybody wants tax reform, but to conservatives that means further cuts (despite our tax rates being at historic lows), to liberals it means taxing the rich (despite the fact that it would raise insignificant revenue), and to everyone in Congress it would mean preserving the tax breaks that go to their biggest donors.
And it's the last point that speaks to our nation's central problem. The great contribution of democracy to the history of civilization was that it broke the age-old link between money and power and redistributed power to everyone, one vote at a time.
What we are now living through is a crisis of counterreformation, in which the corrosive influence of money in our politics, made quasi-legitimate by the Supreme Court's catastrophic decision in Citizens United, has made the government more responsive to the donor than to the voter. It has made the democracy nearly moot.
This is why we have a population that supports Medicare and Social Security and the Veterans Administration and student loans, to name just a few popular government programs, but we have a Congress that wants to defund them. Our democracy is broken, it was broken by money, and to fix it we must get the money out.
So should our tax code be simplified? Sure. Should loopholes be closed? Of course. But as long as our lawmakers are primarily beholden to fund-raisers and lobbyists, any proposed tax reform will go nowhere.
DAVID BERMAN New York, May 9, 2012
Tax reform based on ''simplification'' and sharply cutting exemptions might be good in the short run, but in the long run it may prove to be a Trojan horse. Look to history.
The Reagan-era tax reform law sharply reduced exemptions, lowered income tax rates and equalized taxation of unearned and earned income. This trade-off of ''simplification'' and lower tax rates is the essence of Mr. Fox's recommendation.
The trade-off was ultimately a bad bargain. Tax rates have remained low, especially for the highest-paid, but exemptions have proliferated; rates for capital gains and dividends have been reduced below those for earned income.
If history repeats itself under the banner of tax reform, ordinary Americans will end up stuck with a higher fraction of the tax bill. Moreover, the resulting loss of tax revenues could impel additional retrenchment of the federal budget. To avoid this, any tax reform will require measures that prevent it from being undermined during later years.
MICHAEL N. ALEXANDER Lexington, Mass., May 9, 2012
Income tax in modern form came into being only in 1913 through the 16th Amendment. For most of the first 137 years of our Republic, we had no income tax at all. We need to return to our roots.
The concept of an income tax is flawed both in practice and theory. Taxing consumption rather than income allows the unfettered accumulation of wealth, encouraging production; you pay taxes only when you spend. The economy and the environment both benefit by taxing that which really has societal costs.
This is both progressive and regressive: progressive because our tax burden is proportional to ability and willingness to pay. Regressive because the poor will pay a greater percentage of their total income on consumption tax.
The regressivity can be partly offset with savings from dismantling the Internal Revenue Service (about $13 billion) and through measures like exempting food and social necessities.
Taxing income makes little sense. Time to call this a failed experiment.
JEFF SCHWEITZER Spicewood, Tex., May 9, 2012
Mr. Fox's suggestions are sensible and can generally be backed up by sound economic data. Whether they could ever be enacted is another issue. As long as Congressional action can be blocked by a minority that refuses to countenance any change that can be construed as a tax increase, I see no prospect for genuine income tax reform.
Another problem that Mr. Fox brushes over is that for many people certain tax breaks do make some social or economic sense. Personally, I think there are valid social reasons to encourage savings, charitable giving and homeownership.
Rather than abolishing these tax benefits outright, I would impose reasonable restrictions, like limiting mortgage exemptions to a single home of moderate size, tightening the definition of charitable organizations, and providing some tax relief for interest and dividends only when accrued in retirement savings accounts of reasonable size.
I also see the growing disparity in wage and income levels as having serious potential social effects that can best be counteracted by a more steeply graded tax structure. Unfortunately, given the ability of special interest groups to provide unlimited financial support to their selected candidates, I do not expect to live long enough to see any of these ideas adopted.
JOHN D. ALDEN Delmar, N.Y., May 9, 2012
Not all income is equally socially beneficial. I suggest that the tax code be based not on just the quantity of income but the quality as well.
For example, if someone makes $100 million from curing a disease or a technological breakthrough that helps society, then he or she should be taxed at a lower level than someone who makes the same amount as, say, a lottery winner. The tax system makes moral distinctions already when it does not tax charitable contributions or creates tax-free economic zones to promote economic development, so why not go one step further and have the tax code reflect the fact that not all income is equally socially useful?
To be sure, many questions need to be answered about the implementation of this policy, but a discussion about how income is earned and whom it benefits should, I think, be part of any debate on taxation.
JOSEPH GRCIC Terre Haute, Ind., May 9, 2012
The writer is a professor of philosophy at Indiana State University.
When I was in law school some 50 years ago, I took a course in federal income taxation. All I remember from that semester is the professor saying that only 10 people in the country understood the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations, and that he wasn't one of them.
In all the years since, just about every political leader has called for some kind of tax reform, but all that has happened is the expansion of the code with lots of new paragraphs understood only by those for whom they were written. A fair and simple system seems to be an impossible dream.
RONALD B. HELLMAN Douglaston, Queens, May 9, 2012
The Writer Responds
Many of the letters in response to my proposal for fundamental tax reform understandably express deeply felt cynicism about this dysfunctional Congress.
Only a relative handful of Americans now believe that Congress will do the right thing, compared with a majority of Americans some 50 years ago.
Noting how the tax laws have become increasingly impenetrable, Mr. Hellman concludes that ''a fair and simple system seems to be an impossible dream.''
Trillions of dollars of debt pile up because Congress refuses to require Americans to pay for the programs they want or the wars we fight. And the corrosive influence of money on politics, as Mr. Berman writes, magnified by Citizens United, ''has made the government more responsive to the donor than to the voter.''
But we owe our children and grandchildren, and our country, something better. Moreover, history teaches us not to discount the possibility of real change even in the darkest of times.
Mr. Schweitzer favors replacing the income tax with a consumption tax, yet admits that it would allow ''the unfettered accumulation of wealth,'' which would be better addressed by a progressive income tax on all forms of income.
Mr. Alden would like to see the reforms I suggest accommodate more focused deductions to encourage homeownership, charitable gifts and savings. But any deduction saves the most taxes for people in the highest marginal tax bracket, rather than helping most those who need the most help. Equitable tax credits would offer a better compromise.
Mr. Alexander worries that real reform, which he favors, will unravel over time unless Congress puts in place ''measures that prevent it from being undermined during later years,'' a worthy if complicated recommendation.
I'll continue to promote the benefits of a fairer, simpler and more economically productive income tax, and just maybe, someday, we will elect enough leaders capable of restoring that once honorable idea that we are the ''United'' States of America.

HEADLINE: Forklifts to Photography

BYLINE: By JEFFREY T. HOUSENBOLD. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I GREW up in Brooklyn, on Flatbush Avenue near Prospect Park. One of my earliest memories is of learning to use a hand dolly to move boxes. My father, who was a truck driver, later taught me how to operate a forklift and, when I was old enough, to drive an 18-wheeler.
I had two older sisters, and when one of them was mugged for the third time, my parents decided to move to Old Bridge in Middlesex County, N.J. Starting at age 10, I had a lot of odd jobs-- helping out at a local flea market and working at a fast-food outlet, in a jewelry store and at a nursing home. 
When some classmates and I saw the ''Wall Street'' movie in 1987, it changed my perception of the world because I had never known anyone who made more than my father's $19,000 salary. I decided that finance was where I wanted to work.
In high school, I threw the javelin and discus on the track team, but I wasn't a very focused student. My guidance counselor initially encouraged me to consider a career as a construction worker. I brought up my grades, and in 1987 was accepted at Carnegie Mellon, where I majored in business and economics.
To help pay college tuition, I did odd jobs and played some professional poker. I also interned at Citibank's currency swaps and options department, but that work did not interest me because I didn't feel I was creating anything.
After graduating in 1991, I joined a management consulting firm, Peterson Consulting, which later became part of Navigant Consulting, in Philadelphia. At Peterson I met Ruth, my future wife. Three years later, I entered Harvard Business School. In 1996, I earned my M.B.A., and Ruth enrolled at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Cooking was a hobby of mine, and at business school I started the Harvard Wine and Cuisine Society, which still exists. I was also an intern for the chief marketing officer at McDonald's one summer.
In 1998, I joined Andersen Consulting, which later became Accenture, where I helped found and manage its media and entertainment strategy group and helped my clients make sense of the Internet. After a brief time there, I moved to Andover, Mass., to help start Raging Bull, a community finance portal. A year later, we sold it to AltaVista, the Internet search service, and I moved back to California to work as AltaVista's vice president and general manager. I was a regular traveler on red-eye flights between the East and West Coasts until Ruth and I married in 2000. We now have three boys.
In 2001, I joined eBay as vice president for mergers and acquisitions. After that, I was general manager of eBay's business-to-consumer group, then oversaw its business development and Internet marketing.
Four years later, I joined Shutterfly, which at that point had about 100 employees and $54 million in annual revenue. Its lead investor, Jim Clark, hired me to help take it public, which we did in 2006. Last year, we had $473 million in revenue, with 5.5 million paying customers. We now have four sites: Shutterfly, Tiny Prints, Wedding Paper Divas and, starting earlier this year, Treat.com, a personalized greeting card site.
About 75 percent of our business is repeat customers who create their own photo books, calendars, greeting cards and other items, share them with friends and store them with us.
I have had great mentors, a good education and a generous sprinkling of good luck. And I am able to make use of my personal passion for photography. One of my favorite activities is our annual family photo day at Shutterfly, where we take a photo of every one of our employees and their families.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Hurt Washington State's Response to Whooping Cough Outbreak

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MOUNT VERNON, Wash. -- Whooping cough, or pertussis, a highly infectious respiratory disease once considered doomed by science, has struck Washington State this spring with a severity that health officials say could surpass the toll of any year since the 1940s, before a vaccine went into wide use.
Although no deaths have been reported so far this year, the state has declared an epidemic and public health officials say the numbers are staggering: 1,284 cases through early May, the most in at least three decades and 10 times last year's total at this time, 128. 
The response to the epidemic has been hampered by the recession, which has left state and local health departments on the front lines of defense weakened by years of sustained budget cuts.
Here in Skagit County, about an hour's drive north of Seattle -- the hardest-hit corner of the state, based on pertussis cases per capita -- the local Public Health Department has half the staff it did in 2008. Preventive care programs, intended to keep people healthy, are mostly gone.
The county's top medical officer, Dr. Howard Leibrand, who is also a full-time emergency room physician, said that in the crushing triage of a combined health crisis and budget crisis, he had gone so far as to urge local physicians to stop testing patients to confirm a whooping cough diagnosis.
If the signs are there, he said -- especially a persistent, deep cough and indication of contact with a confirmed victim -- doctors should simply treat patients with antibiotics. The pertussis test can cost up to $400 and delay treatment by days. About 14.6 percent of Skagit County residents have no health insurance, according to a state study conducted last year, up from 11.6 percent in 2008.
''There has been half a million dollars spent on testing in this county,'' Dr. Leibrand said late last week. ''Do you know how much vaccination you can buy for half a million dollars?'' And testing, he added, benefits only the epidemiologists, not the patients. ''It's an outrageous way to spend your health care dollar.''
State health officials estimate that because of incomplete testing and the assumption that many people with mild cases are not seeking medical treatment, perhaps as few as one in five pertussis cases is being recorded and tracked, suggesting that the outbreak is far more widespread than the numbers indicate.
Pertussis was once a dreaded disease of childhood -- killing 5,000 to 10,000 Americans a year from the 1920s through the 1940s -- but is now a risk mostly to infants, to whom it is fatal in about 1 percent of cases. Most of the victims in Washington, as in previous outbreaks in other states, are between 8 and 12.
''It's the largest epidemic I've ever seen,'' said Becky Neff, the only registered nurse in the 3,700-student Burlington-Edison School District, in Skagit County. Ms. Neff said she had seen 142 suspected and confirmed cases, or about 3.8 percent of the student population from kindergarten through 12th grade.
But with only two nurses processing the disease reports she sends over to the county, down from five a few years ago, Ms. Neff said she had stopped even trying to ask for confirmation.
''They don't have time to call and say who's positive and who's negative,'' she said.
The pertussis vaccine is commonly given in childhood, and many states require it for children of school age. But Washington State, according to a federal study last year of kindergarten-age children, had the highest percentage of parents in the nation who voluntarily exempted their children from one or more vaccines, out of fear of side effects or for philosophical reasons.
So-called underimmunization -- in which children do not get the full series of vaccinations -- could also be a factor in compounding the outbreak, said Mary Selecky, Washington State's secretary of health.
Last year, the Washington Legislature passed a law requiring parents to prove that they had consulted a physician before declining vaccinations for their children.
''We had the easiest opt-out law in the nation until last year, so what we also had was the highest percent of parents opting out,'' Ms. Selecky said.
Officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sent three epidemiologist investigators to Washington last week, said the number of pertussis cases had been rising gradually nationwide for several decades, with periodic regional outbreaks. In 2010, California had its worst bout with pertussis in decades.
Dr. Thomas Clark, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C., said changes in the vaccine may be partly responsible. The formula was altered beginning in the early 1990s to reduce side effects, which means that its immunizing effects do not last as long, he said.
Most of the victims in the Washington outbreak and other recent ones received their early childhood vaccinations, Dr. Clark said. An early immunization, even if it does not keep a patient from getting the illness, generally produces a milder case, he said, since the victim would still have some residual resistance.
Ms. Selecky said immunizations were meant to protect not only individuals but also the broader population: the so-called herd immunity threshold. If a large enough segment of the population is unprotected from a disease -- generally considered 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the disease -- even people with some degree of immunity through vaccination can have an elevated risk, she said.
Before the law was passed, Washington's vaccination exemption rate was more than 6 percent.
But the drumbeat of publicity about the pertussis outbreak could be changing some minds.
Mary Ann Mercer, 74, a retired schoolteacher, went to Skagit County's walk-in clinic on Thursday morning for a vaccination after hearing news reports. She never had whooping cough as a child, she said, and never thought of it much until recently.
''It's just precautionary,'' she said after receiving her shot.
Her husband, Roger Mercer, who ran a local Blue Cross insurance plan before his retirement, sat anchored to his chair in the waiting area.
''I'm a coward,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Generation Hobbled by College Debt

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and ANDREW W. LEHREN; Andrew Martin reported from Ada, Ohio, and Andrew W. Lehren from New York.

 BODY:
ADA, Ohio -- Kelsey Griffith graduates on Sunday from Ohio Northern University. To start paying off her $120,000 in student debt, she is already working two restaurant jobs and will soon give up her apartment here to live with her parents. Her mother, who co-signed on the loans, is taking out a life insurance policy on her daughter.
''If anything ever happened, God forbid, that is my debt also,'' said Ms. Griffith's mother, Marlene Griffith.
Ms. Griffith, 23, wouldn't seem a perfect financial fit for a college that costs nearly $50,000 a year. Her father, a paramedic, and mother, a preschool teacher, have modest incomes, and she has four sisters. But when she visited Ohio Northern, she was won over by faculty and admissions staff members who urge students to pursue their dreams rather than obsess on the sticker price. 
''As an 18-year-old, it sounded like a good fit to me, and the school really sold it,'' said Ms. Griffith, a marketing major. ''I knew a private school would cost a lot of money. But when I graduate, I'm going to owe like $900 a month. No one told me that.''
With more than $1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. As prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden.
About two-thirds of bachelor's degree recipients borrow money to attend college, either from the government or private lenders, according to a Department of Education survey of 2007-8 graduates; the total number of borrowers is most likely higher since the survey does not track borrowing from family members.
By contrast, 45 percent of 1992-93 graduates borrowed money; that survey included family borrowing as well as government and private loans.
For all borrowers, the average debt in 2011 was $23,300, with 10 percent owing more than $54,000 and 3 percent more than $100,000, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports. Average debt for bachelor degree graduates who took out loans ranges from under $10,000 at elite schools like Princeton and Williams College, which have plenty of wealthy students and enormous endowments, to nearly $50,000 at some private colleges with less affluent students and less financial aid.
Here at Ohio Northern, recent graduates with bachelor's degrees are among the most indebted of any college in the country, and statewide, graduates of Ohio's more than 200 colleges and universities carry some of the highest average debt in the country, according to data reported by the colleges and compiled by an educational advocacy group. The current balance of federal student loans nationwide is $902 billion, with an additional $140 billion or so in private student loans.
''If one is not thinking about where this is headed over the next two or three years, you are just completely missing the warning signs,'' said Rajeev V. Date, deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog created after the financial crisis.
Mr. Date likened excessive student borrowing to risky mortgages. And as with the housing bubble before the economic collapse, the extraordinary growth in student loans has caught many by surprise. But its roots are in fact deep, and the cast of contributing characters -- including college marketing officers, state lawmakers wielding a budget ax and wide-eyed students and families -- has been enabled by a basic economic dynamic: an insatiable demand for a college education, at almost any price, and plenty of easy-to-secure loans, primarily from the federal government.
The roots of the borrowing binge date to the 1980s, when tuition for four-year colleges began to rise faster than family incomes. In the 1990s, for-profit colleges boomed by spending heavily on marketing and recruiting. Despite some ethical lapses and fraud, enrollment more than doubled in the last decade and Wall Street swooned over the stocks. Roughly 11 percent of college students now attend for-profit colleges, and they receive about a quarter of federal student loans and grants.
In the last decade, even as enrollment at state colleges and universities has grown, some states have cut spending for higher education and many others have not allocated enough money to keep pace with the growing student body. That trend has accelerated as state budgets have shrunk because of the recent financial crisis and the unpopularity of tax increases.
Nationally, state and local spending per college student, adjusted for inflation, reached a 25-year low this year, jeopardizing the long-held conviction that state-subsidized higher education is an affordable steppingstone for the lower and middle classes. All the while, the cost of tuition and fees has continued to increase faster than the rate of inflation, faster even than medical spending. If the trends continue through 2016, the average cost of a public college will have more than doubled in just 15 years, according to the Department of Education.
Much like the mortgage brokers who promised pain-free borrowing to homeowners just a few years back, many colleges don't offer warnings about student debt in the glossy brochures and pitch letters mailed to prospective students. Instead, reading from the same handbook as for-profit colleges, they urge students not to worry about the costs. That's because most students don't pay full price.
Even discounted, the price is beyond the means of many. Yet too often, students and their parents listen without question.
''I readily admit it,'' said E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State University, who has also served as president of Vanderbilt and Brown, among others. ''I didn't think a lot about costs. I do not think we have given significant thought to the impact of college costs on families.''
Of course, economists and many parents say that the only thing worse than graduating with lots of debt is not going to college at all, since study after study has shown that graduates earn more over a lifetime. And most college students in the United States manage to eventually pay back their student loans.
To that end, the Obama administration has given out more grants and loans than ever to more and more college students with the goal of making the United States first among developed nations in college completion. The balance of federal student loans has grown by more than 60 percent in the last five years. And in 2007, Congress made sure the interest rates on many of those loans were well below commercial rates; currently, a debate over keeping those lower rates from doubling in July is roiling lawmakers.
But even if student loans are what many economists consider ''good debt,'' an increasing number of borrowers are struggling to pay them off, and in the process becoming mired in a financial morass.
Education Department data shows that payments are being made on just 38 percent of the balance of federal student loans, down from 46 percent five years ago. The balances are unpaid because the borrowers are still in school, have postponed payments or have stopped paying altogether.
Nearly one in 10 borrowers who started repayment in 2009 defaulted within two years, the latest data available -- about double the rate in 2005.
Economists do not predict a collapse of the student loan system, which would, in essence, mean wholesale default. And if there were one, it would be unlikely to ripple through the economy with the same devastating impact as the mortgage crash. Though now larger than credit card and other consumer debt, the student loan balance remains smaller than the mortgage market, and most student loans are issued by the federal government, meaning banks wouldn't be affected as much.
Still, economists say, growing student debt hangs over the economic recovery like a dark cloud for a generation of college graduates and indebted dropouts. A study of recent college graduates conducted by researchers at Rutgers University and released last week found that 40 percent of the participants had delayed making a major purchase, like a home or car, because of college debt, while slightly more than a quarter had put off continuing their education or had moved in with relatives to save money. Roughly half of the surveyed graduates had a full-time job.
''I'll be paying this forever,'' said Chelsea Grove, 24, who dropped out of Bowling Green State University and owes $70,000 in student loans. She is working three jobs to pay her $510 monthly obligation and has no intention of going back.
''For me to finish it would mean borrowing more money,'' she said. ''It makes me puke to think about borrowing more money.''
'Nothing Is Free'
Christina Hagan is an Ohio lawmaker who says students need to understand that attending college is not an entitlement. Last year, she was appointed to fill a seat once occupied by her father in the Ohio House of Representatives.
Ms. Hagan, 23, is also a college student.
She will graduate shortly from Malone University, an evangelical college in Canton, Ohio, with more than $65,000 in student debt (among her loans is one from a farm lender; she had to plant a garden to become eligible). Though she makes $60,000 a year as a state representative, she plans to begin waiting tables in the next few weeks at Don Pancho's, a Mexican restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, to help pay down her student loans and credit cards. She pays about $1,000 a month.
''I placed a priority on a Christian education and I didn't think about the debt,'' said Ms. Hagan, who says she takes responsibility for her debt and others should do the same. ''I need my generation to understand that nothing is free.''
While Ms. Hagan's perspective is unusually personal, it is a common view among lawmakers here in Ohio and many states. Across the country, elected officials are increasingly unwilling to assume a large share of the bill for public colleges and universities, which seven out of 10 students attend. The change has contributed to sharp increases in tuition and more fund-raising -- and the need for students to borrow more.
From 2001 to 2011, state and local financing per student declined by 24 percent nationally. Over the same period, tuition and fees at state schools increased 72 percent, compared with 29 percent for nonprofit private institutions, according to the College Board. Many of the cuts were the result of a sluggish economy that reduced tax revenue, but the sharp drop in per-student spending also reflects a change: an increasing number of lawmakers voted to transfer more of the financial burden of college from taxpayers to students and their families. (Local funding is a small percentage of the total, and mostly goes to community colleges.)
''To say that tuition goes up because the state doesn't pay enough money, well, that is the taxpayers' money,'' said Ohio's governor, John Kasich, a Republican elected in 2010 whose budget included cuts to higher education because of the end of federal stimulus money.
Donald E. Heller, an expert on higher education, said elected officials in both parties had figured out that colleges were one of the few parts of state government that could raise money on their own. If lawmakers cut state financing, the schools could make it up by raising tuition.
''It lets legislators off the hook and makes universities look like the bad guy,'' said Mr. Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University.
Ohio's flagship university, Ohio State, now receives 7 percent of its budget from the state, down from 15 percent a decade ago and 25 percent in 1990. The price of tuition and fees since 2002 increased about 60 percent in today's dollars.
The consequence? Three out of five undergraduates at Ohio State take out loans, and the average debt is $24,840.
If any state is representative of the role government has played in the growth of student debt, Ohio makes a good candidate. While other states have made steeper cuts in recent years because of the recession, Ohio has been chipping away at it far longer. It now ranks sixth from the bottom in financing per student, at $4,480.
In the late 1970s, higher education in Ohio accounted for 17 percent of the state's expenditures. Now it is 11 percent. By contrast, prisons were 4 percent of the state's budget in the late 1970s; now they account for 8 percent. Federal mandates and court orders have compelled lawmakers to spend more money on Medicaid and primary education, too. Legislators could designate a greater percentage of the budget to higher education by raising taxes, but there is no appetite for that. Governor Kasich has signed a pledge not to raise taxes, as have about two dozen legislators.
Some Ohio elected officials say state colleges and universities have brought the debt problem upon themselves.
They suggest, for example, that state schools are bloated, antiquated and don't do a good enough job graduating students or training them for the work force. Some complain about the salaries of football coaches and college presidents, like Mr. Gee, who has a compensation package of $2 million a year as president of Ohio State. Mr. Kasich questions why all state universities need to offer every major, like journalism or engineering, instead of parceling those programs among the schools.
''It's not just inefficiencies,'' said the governor, an Ohio State graduate. ''It's, 'I want to be the best in this.' It's duplication of resources. It's a sweeping change that is needed across academia.''
There is an ideological and political tug of war as well. State Representative John Patrick Carney, a Democrat, said if legislators were serious about financing higher education they could find a way, like eliminating tax breaks for corporations. He noted that even as funds for higher education were being reduced, Mr. Kasich and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the state's estate tax, which will cost the state an estimated $72 million a year.
Mr. Carney said he worried that the constant tuition and fee increases would limit access to college for lower- and middle-income students -- a founding principle of public universities. At least two-thirds of Ohio lawmakers attended public colleges or universities, including Mr. Carney, an Ohio State graduate.
''It's hard to say it's affordable when students leave with that much debt,'' he said.
The new financial reality for colleges has left administrators scrambling to maintain academic quality and all-important rankings with diminished state resources. That puts an even higher premium on attracting top-tier students -- the rankings depend on them -- and playing down the burdens of college debt.
Buy Now, Pay Later
At Ohio State, ''college can be a reality for everyone, no matter your income or background,'' its Web site says, while at Ohio Northern, future students are urged to get over the ''sticker shock,'' and focus instead on ''return on investment.''
Oberlin College's Web site tells prospective students that its financial aid policy is simple: ''We meet the full demonstrated financial need of every admitted student.'' The University of Dayton declares itself ''one of the most affordable private Catholic schools in the country'' and a ''lifetime investment, appreciating over the course of time.''
The costs for these colleges? At Ohio State, about $25,000 a year for tuition and fees, room and board and living expenses; at Ohio Northern, about $48,000; at Oberlin $60,000; and at Dayton $48,000.
Colleges are aggressively recruiting students, regardless of their financial circumstances. In admissions offices across the country, professional marketing companies and talented alumni are being enlisted to devise catchy slogans, build enticing Web sites -- and essentially outpitch the competition.
Affordability, or at least promising that the finances will work out, is increasingly a piece of the pitch.
Almost all colleges promote the money they give away in financial aid, though generally only the most elite schools -- like Oberlin in Ohio -- are able to provide enough in grants and scholarships to significantly keep student debt down.
College marketing firms encourage school officials to focus on the value of the education rather than the cost. For example, an article on the cover of Enrollment Management, a newsletter aimed at college admissions officials, urged writers of admissions materials to ''avoid bad words like 'cost,' 'pay' (try 'and you get all this for...'), 'contract' and 'buy' in your piece and avoid the conflicting feelings they generate.''
''There are direct marketing 'words' that can make or break your piece,'' the article, published in 2009, added.
The financial aid award letters to newly admitted students can also be a minefield for students and parents sorting through the true costs of a school. Some are written in a manner that suggests the student is getting a great deal, by blurring the line between grants and loans or not making clear how much the student may have to pay or borrow.
A quick reading of an award letter from Drexel University, received by a New Jersey applicant in March, implied that the student would owe nothing and might actually walk away with money. The expected payment to Drexel, it said in highlighted bright yellow, would be a negative $5,900. The calculation presumed grants, student loans and a $42,120 loan taken out by the parents toward the $63,620 estimated cost -- figures also included in the letter but not highlighted.
A Drexel spokeswoman said that the letter was not misleading and that it had not received complaints about it. But for many students, the financial realities of attending a college conflict with the optimistic rhetoric of campus tours, financial aid materials and salesmanlike admissions officers. And many of them don't realize it until it is much too late.
''The overall message was, 'It's doable and normal to go into that much debt,' '' said Jillian Potter, 23, who grew up in Ohio and attended Anderson University, a nonprofit private Christian school in neighboring Indiana.
Ms. Potter figured she would have to borrow about $10,000 a year. But the tuition increased every year, and because she didn't declare a major until her junior year, she needed five years to graduate.
A social worker, she now owes $80,000. ''I try not to think about it because it's really depressing,'' she said.
For Evan Frank, Ashland University, a nonprofit private school in Ohio, dangled the possibility of a sports scholarship, he said. Mr. Frank liked the campus and was promised a spot on the football team. His high school guidance counselor encouraged him and so did his family, though they couldn't help financially.
Ashland offered to knock about $12,000 off the costs, and when Mr. Frank called financial aid to ask for more, they suggested he keep applying for scholarships. No one at the time said to consider a cheaper alternative, he said. Ashland costs about $42,000 a year.
''Maybe at the time I was a little naive,'' said Mr. Frank, 22, a senior who owes $80,000. ''Everyone was like, 'You can get grants, you can always get loans.' I wanted to play football really bad, and I hoped eventually I'd get a football scholarship.''
Many students and parents don't have a firm understanding of the cost of attending college, or the amount of debt they will incur. And most colleges aren't much help. Student debt is not their primary concern in the end -- the loan money usually gets deposited directly with the colleges, so they get paid either way -- and the main job of the admissions staff, after all, is to admit students.
''Ultimately with everything in financial aid, from start to finish, the student and their family need to take responsibility and monitor their aid,'' Melanie K. Weaver, the director of financial aid at Ohio Northern, said in an e-mail. ''With over 3,000 on aid it is difficult for our office of 10 staff members to stay on top of every student.''
While there are standardized disclosure forms for buying a car or a house or even signing up for a credit card, no such thing exists for colleges.
Instead, college pricing is complicated by constant tuition increases, a vast array of grants and loans and a financial-aid system that discounts tuition for most students based on opaque formulas. ''No one has a vested interest in simplifying the process but families,'' said Mark Kantrowitz, the founder of FinAid, a Web site devoted to explaining college financial aid. ''It obscures the price of a college and makes the choice of college not depend on the price but other factors.''
Federal regulations require financial aid officers to counsel students when they take federal loans and again when they graduate. The counseling typically consists of making sure they complete a brief online course about student loans and repayment.
Beyond that, it is up to the college to decide what, if any, debt counseling to provide. With a few exceptions, their track record is not very good, according to students and experts on college finance. Until Congress banned the practice a few years ago, some colleges outsourced counseling to private lenders, the same ones offering loans. Now many colleges do little beyond what is required by law, experts say.
Ohio Northern administrators said they were trying to come to grips with the growing debt of their students -- an average of $48,886 for borrowers -- at a time when enrollment is down slightly, as it is at many of the small nonprofit private colleges with which it competes.
Financial aid officers have not yet told any prospective students that they cannot afford to attend, school administrators said. But Ms. Weaver, the director of financial aid, noted, ''We are having that conversation.''
Mr. Frank, at Ashland, said he did eventually receive financial counseling -- on the day he arrived for football camp as a freshman.
A financial aid adviser suggested Mr. Frank rethink his decision to attend ''because the way it's looking you are going to be looking at a high amount of debt if you are going to stay here,'' he recalled. ''I wanted to play football really bad, and I was already moving in for camp,'' he said. ''I wasn't going to turn back then.'' He never did receive a football scholarship.
Officials at both Ashland and Anderson Universities said they provided thorough financial aid counseling to incoming students.
Ms. Griffith, the Ohio Northern student whose mother is taking out life insurance on her -- a precaution that might be unnecessary because some lenders forgive loans upon death -- said she wished someone had been frank with her about the consequences of taking on so much debt. (She also received grants.) She is searching for a full-time job in marketing, her major, while earning $225 a week at two restaurants.
''When I was young, I wanted to get out of Putnam County, get out of the cornfields,'' said Ms. Griffith, who is from rural Ottawa, Ohio. ''I would love to get away. But it would be more financially responsible if I got a job near here and lived with my parents.''
The Shadow of For-Profits
Wanda McGill has stopped opening her student loan bills.
She isn't sure how much debt she has accumulated, though she thinks it's about $100,000. But Ms. McGill, a 38-year-old single mother, knows for sure she cannot pay it.
Ms. McGill said she dropped out of DeVry University, a for-profit college with a branch in Columbus, two years ago after she ran out of money -- even with the loans. She now makes $8.50 an hour working for an employment training center in Florida.
''I was promised the world and was given a garbage dump to clean up,'' she wrote in an online complaint at consumeraffairs.com. ''Like my life was not already screwed up with welfare and all.''
The student loan crisis has spread from for-profit colleges to more traditional institutions, but the for-profit colleges continue to represent the worst of the problem. Students complain that they were misled about the costs of education and that their job prospects were exaggerated. Government reports and lawsuits have accused some for-profit colleges of outright fraud, including doctoring attendance records or peddling near-worthless degrees.
The result? Students at for-profit colleges are twice as likely as other students to default on their student loans. Moreover, among students seeking a bachelor's degree, only 22 percent succeed within six years, compared with 65 percent at nonprofit private schools and 55 percent at public institutions. (For-profit students, however, tend to do better at obtaining associate degrees and certificates.)
Leaders of the for-profit industry defended themselves, saying they were providing higher education for lower-class students that traditional colleges had left behind. ''The reality is the type of students we attract have no other opportunity,'' said Steven Gunderson, head of a leading trade organization. ''We are the ones that provide a path to the middle class.''
Still, the outcomes for many students have been so poor -- and the reported abuses and misdeeds by the colleges so abundant -- that the for-profit colleges have played another role in the worsening debt problem: drawing attention away from nonprofit private and public colleges and universities, which have been slow to face public scrutiny.
The situation has parallels to the mortgage crisis of a few years ago, said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The for-profit colleges are like the subprime lenders -- attracting the limelight because they represent the worst of the problem, he said.
''Mainstream higher ed can really self-righteously look at the big problem out there and say, 'The problem lies with the other guy,' '' Mr. Nassirian said. ''If you are looking at highway robbery and raping and pillaging, that is true. But there are all kinds of unfortunate practices in traditional higher education that are equally as problematic that are reaching the crisis point.'' Last year, Congress approved regulations to curb abuses in the for-profit sector, but there has been less focus on establishing broader rules for traditional colleges and universities.
The Obama administration has tried to make college pricing easier to understand; as of last year, colleges and universities were required to post calculators on their Web sites that explain the net price after grants and loans, but critics say they can be confusing, misleading or hard to find. And the administration has proposed that colleges be required to offer a ''shopping sheet'' to make it easier for families to measure the true costs and benefits.
''We just have to get them much more information,'' said Education Secretary Arne Duncan. ''If you're going to college, you need to know not what the first year costs. You need to know what it's going to cost for the long haul.''
But even with more information, students and their parents seem willing to pay the ever-escalating price of a college degree, which remains the key rung up the ladder of economic mobility.
Denise Entingh, 44, dropped out after two quarters at Columbus State Community College because she didn't want to wait any longer to get into the nursing program. So she signed on at the Hondros School of Nursing, a for-profit college that advertises ''No Waitlist!'' on a billboard a few blocks from Columbus State.
Ms. Entingh said she expected to borrow about $45,000 to get a bachelor's degree in nursing from Hondros, which costs more than three times as much as Columbus State.
''It scares the hell out of me,'' she said of her debt load. ''But I think it will be all right. I'm not going to worry about it right now. I had to take that plunge.''

HEADLINE: Tea Party Focus Turns to Senate And Shake-Up

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The primary victory of a Tea Party-blessed candidate in Indiana illustrates how closely Republican hopes for a majority in the Senate are tied to candidates who pledge to infuse the chamber with the deep-seated conservatism that has been the hallmark of the House since the Republicans gained control in 2010.
Richard E. Mourdock, who last week defeated Senator Richard G. Lugar, a six-term incumbent, promises to bring an uncompromising ideology to Capitol Hill if he prevails in November. And he is not the only Senate candidate who contends that Senate Republicans are badly in need of new blood.
In Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska and Texas, Republican Senate candidates are vying for the mantle of Tea Party outsider. A number of them say that they would seek to press an agenda that is generally to the right of the minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and that they would demand a deeper policy role for the Senate's growing circle of staunch conservatives. 
Some say they have not decided whether they would support Mr. McConnell, who could find himself contending with the type of fractious rank and file that has vexed the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio.
''We need to shake up the Republicans,'' said Sarah Steelman, the Missouri state treasurer, who is seeking her party's nomination to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat. Asked if that meant new leadership in the Senate, Ms. Steelman replied, ''Possibly.''
John Brunner, another Missouri candidate, said conservatives needed to have a louder voice in the Senate leadership. ''When you bring more people to the team, it raises the bar for everyone,'' he said. Referring to Mr. McConnell, he added, ''There could be people up there who could be sputtering now who could take it up a notch.''
Representative Todd Akin, a third Missouri Senate hopeful, said, ''I haven't made any commitments to anybody, and they haven't made very many commitments to me either.''
Deb Fischer, who is seeking the Republican Senate nomination in Nebraska, said, ''I don't think anything is automatic.''
Mr. McConnell's leadership does not appear to be in jeopardy. Aides to Mr. McConnell say he has already secured enough votes for his re-election as leader, regardless of the November results. And supporters say such threats have surfaced in the past, only to fizzle after Election Day.
Rand Paul of Kentucky made headlines in 2010 while running for the Senate when he declined to say whether he would back Mr. McConnell for leader after Mr. McConnell supported another Republican in the primary. Ultimately, Mr. McConnell was unanimously re-elected as leader, and his standing has remained solid among Senate Republicans even as he has faced sniping from some on the right who say he is too much of a Washington insider.
Mr. McConnell evinced no concern.
''In November, if the American people give us the ability to set the agenda in the Senate, I'm confident our conference will have broad unity around our efforts to repeal Obamacare, reduce the size and scope of government, and prevent job-killing tax hikes,'' he said in a statement.
Mr. McConnell has already made adjustments. He recently enlisted Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a freshman elected with Tea Party backing, to lead efforts to coordinate the Republican messages and agenda in the Senate and the House with the party's presidential nominee. A spokesman for Mr. McConnell, Don Stewart, said Mr. McConnell was exploring joining Mr. Mourdock on the campaign trail.
But pressure remains. Several Republican freshmen in the Senate -- among them Mr. Paul, Mr. Johnson, Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida -- under the tutelage of the Tea Party kingmaker Jim DeMint of South Carolina, have laid the groundwork for a more conservative path in the Senate, often throwing their own logs on the fire of gridlock that has seized Congress.
The stakes are considerable. The country faces what the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has called a ''fiscal cliff'' on Jan. 1, when the Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are set to expire and across-the-board spending cuts of more than $1 trillion are to go into effect. If a bipartisan agreement cannot be reached before the end of the year, nearly $8 trillion in deficit reduction could go into force in a sudden rush, a boon to budget hawks but a potential disaster for the fragile economic recovery.
After the election, the losing party is more likely to limp back to a lame-duck session of Congress aggrieved at its perceived mistreatment, and the winners will feel more empowered.
But Mr. McConnell's room to maneuver is shrinking with the rising calls against compromise and the diminishing ranks of Republican deal makers.
In recent months, Mr. McConnell has been trying to keep the right flank at bay, voting against a bipartisan highway bill, for example, that conservative members disliked. He has also endorsed an earmark ban, in sharp contrast to former years, when his earmarks for Kentucky were the stuff of campaign fodder.
At times, his attempts to navigate the treacherous divide between placating conservatives and not appearing obstinate fall flat. Late last year, he insisted on a vote on his own alternative to the Senate Democrats' version of the payroll tax cut bill, to demonstrate that Republicans supported the continued cut. But Mr. DeMint and other conservatives led a rebellion, and the bill received a humiliating 20 votes. When Mr. McConnell talked his conference into approving a short-term measure instead, it blew up in the House, with conservative members there complaining that Mr. McConnell had sold them out.
On Thursday evening, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, tried to take up and quickly pass a bill to reauthorize the United States Export-Import Bank, an entity established in the 1930s whose authority to exist was to expire at the end of the month. The bill that Mr. Reid was turning to had passed the House on Wednesday, 330 to 93. But Mr. McConnell held out for amendments requested by Mr. DeMint and other conservative members who had denounced the bank as a government boondoggle.
''I used to just talk about the House wing of the Tea Party,'' Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor on Thursday, ''but it is over here now.''
Mr. Reid was so frustrated on Thursday that he suggested he might abrogate a gentleman's agreement with Mr. McConnell and sign on to Democratic efforts to change the Senate's filibuster rule. Republicans now use the filibuster routinely, not just to prevent final votes on legislation but to prevent bills from even reaching the floor for consideration.
Now, Republican hopefuls want the Senate to act more like the house. Dan Liljenquist, a Tea Party-backed Republican challenging Senator Orrin G. Hatch in Utah's Primary next month, said Republican leaders in the House, many of them young upstarts themselves, ditched traditional rules of seniority last year and let energetic up-and-comers take on powerful roles. At 42, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, has become perhaps his party's most important policy maker.
In the Senate, Mr. Liljenquist said, ''The leaders most anxious to take on the entitlement system and the entrenched problems the nation faces are being benched by a system that puts them at the bottom rung.''
Mr. McConnell, who has been the minority leader since 2007, also finds himself increasingly in the cross hairs of deeply conservative outside groups. Erick Erickson, a blogger, posted a Twitter message on Tuesday night that read: ''Dear Mitch McConnell, I hope you heard the Tea Party of Indiana tonight. Heheheh. If not, you will come January.'' A conservative radio host, Laura Ingraham, fired off her own Twitter missive: ''Is Senate leadership effective under Leader McConnell?''
In some ways, Mr. McConnell has always been suspect to conservatives because of his history of supporting federal spending projects and because of his well-known deal-making ability, and recently because he voted for the bank bailout bill that was the match that lighted the Tea Party fire. But he has shown a formidable ability to survive the shifts in the Senate, including a loss of seats under his watch in 2008.

HEADLINE: After Divisive Primary, Shifting to the Center

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Presidential nominees have several options for repositioning after ideologically charged primary campaigns: strategic silence, new proposals, a different tone on the brighter general election stage.
And sometimes they can do nothing and watch their rivals do the shifting.
The long-term political implications of President Obama's historic announcement that he supports same-sex marriage remain unclear and subject to cultural, legal and generational crosscurrents. The response from many Republicans, including Mitt Romney, was relatively muted. 
But by adopting a clear position on a divisive social issue, Mr. Obama gave hope to some conservatives that the resulting contrast would make Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, ''look more centrist,'' as Ken Khachigian, a Republican strategist in California, put it.
That is a priority after a primary battle that tugged Mr. Romney, now the presumptive Republican nominee, toward the right. His ability to resist the Obama campaign's attempts to brand him as ''extreme'' could determine the outcome in November.
''The biggest unknown element in the election is whether or not he can achieve a relaunch that's different from the primary experience,'' said Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster and onetime adviser to Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''It's difficult, but surely not impossible.''
Polls diverge on the two candidates' standing among the voters most up for grabs, independents. A recent Politico/George Washington University survey showed Mr. Romney leading Mr. Obama by 10 percentage points among independents; a New York Times/CBS News survey last month showed them splitting the independent vote evenly. And an Associated Press/GfK poll conducted in the first week of May showed Mr. Obama with a 12 point edge.
But the Obama team asserts that it can hold down Mr. Romney's support in the center by invoking his past statements on issues like assistance to hard-pressed homeowners, the auto industry bailout and changes to Medicare. On same-sex marriage, Democrats say calling attention to Mr. Romney's support for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman will turn many swing voters away from him.
But the techniques used by past nominees -- some of which Mr. Romney is already employing -- offer a road map for how he will try to discard his primary baggage and broaden his appeal.
They may not require Mr. Romney to erase past positions in an Etch A Sketch style, in the infelicitous imagery of one of his advisers. Shifts of emphasis, altered language and the absence of intraparty skirmishes all can help convey new impressions.
''During the primaries, you're small bore,'' said Mark McKinnon, a media strategist and past adviser to President George W. Bush. The general election, he said, ''is an opportunity to widen the canvas. It's not like people have a fixed view of Romney -- they don't.''
After a primary debate over contraception that party strategists feared would repel centrist women, Mr. Romney has signaled that he would not seek to change a pay equity law broadly opposed by Republicans.
After his hard line against illegal immigration appeared to jeopardize his ability to woo Hispanic voters, Mr. Romney has embraced the idea of a Republican version of the Dream Act -- an Obama-backed measure that Mr. Romney had said he would veto if he were president.
The Romney campaign has similarly clarified his vow to declare China a ''currency manipulator'' on his first day in office, which some Democrats and Republicans warn could cause a trade war -- saying he would take that step ''if China is still manipulating its currency when Governor Romney takes office.''
In 2000, George W. Bush separated himself from an unpopular Republican Congress by criticizing its budget-cutting priorities. Mr. Romney recently executed a similar if limited maneuver by pressing House Republicans to extend a college loan subsidy that Mr. Obama has promoted.
And after emphasizing for months his determination to repeal the new Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, Mr. Romney made a different point on Friday after the revelation of JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss. He said the debacle underscored his support for ''common sense'' regulation of Wall Street.
It is ''a checklist to remove whatever horns'' the Obama campaign will seek to pin on the Republican ticket, Mr. Khachigian said. That is what Mr. Khachigian and others on Ronald Reagan's campaign did when President Jimmy Carter attacked him as a right-wing extremist.
Mr. Reagan abandoned his support for abolishing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, went mute on past calls to abolish the Departments of Education and Energy and pledged not to tamper with Social Security. He answered Mr. Carter's attacks with a relentless focus on the Democratic incumbent's economic failures.
Mr. Romney is attempting the same approach. Aides believe that Mr. Obama's shift on same-sex marriage could help the Republican ticket in swing states such as North Carolina, which voted lopsidedly for a state ban on same-sex marriage last week.
But Mr. Romney personally has shied away from the subject, chiding a Colorado reporter who pressed him on same-sex marriage and medical marijuana and pointing to his economic plan.
Kevin Madden, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said, ''You've got to be able to frame all the issues under the bigger umbrella of an economic argument.''
High-profile events can also shift perceptions. In 1992, Bill Clinton used his ''Man From Hope'' convention video and post-convention bus tour to move past the controversies that troubled his primary campaign.
Four years ago, the relatively inexperienced Mr. Obama sought to build his stature with a speech before a crowd of 200,000 in Berlin. Mr. Romney will travel to London for the Olympic Games -- underscoring his identification with a unifying event he oversaw in Salt Lake City in 2002.

HEADLINE: Is There A Romney Doctrine?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER. 
The chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times and author of the forthcoming ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
DURING the Republican primary debates in January, when Mitt Romney was still trying to outmaneuver the challengers who were questioning his conservative bona fides, he made a declaration about Afghanistan that led a faction of his foreign policy advisers to shake their heads in wonderment.
''We should not negotiate with the Taliban,'' the former Massachusetts governor declared, just as diplomats dispatched by the president were in Qatar trying to get those negotiations going. ''We should defeat the Taliban.'' In case anyone missed his meaning, he drove home the point, saying the best strategy was, ''We go anywhere they are and we kill them.'' 
Set aside for the moment that many of Mr. Romney's supporters and foreign policy advisers argue that after a decade at war, the only option is a political settlement, which means talking to some elements of the Taliban. Stephen Hadley, the former national security adviser to George W. Bush, has argued this ''would not -- as some have suggested -- constitute 'surrender' to America's enemies.'' A co-chairman of Mr. Romney's working group on Afghanistan and Pakistan, James Shinn, who also served Mr. Bush, was co-author of perhaps the best single unclassified document on the complexities of those negotiations, entitled ''Afghan Peace Talks: A Primer.'' It argued that a negotiated deal would ''obviously be desirable'' if elements of the Taliban could be persuaded to renounce violence and take ''some role in Afghan governance short of total control.''
It was just one example of what Mr. Romney's advisers call a perplexing pattern: Dozens of subtle position papers flow through the candidate's policy shop and yet seem to have little influence on Mr. Romney's hawkish-sounding pronouncements, on everything from war to nuclear proliferation to the trade-offs in dealing with China. In the Afghanistan case, ''none of us could quite figure out what he was advocating,'' one of Mr. Romney's advisers said. He insisted on anonymity -- as did a half-dozen others interviewed over the past two weeks -- because the Romney campaign has banned any discussion of the process by which the candidate formulates his positions.
''It begged the obvious question,'' the adviser added. ''Do we stay another decade? How many forces, and how long, does that take? Do we really want to go into the general election telling Americans that we should stay a few more years to eradicate the whole Taliban movement?'' In phase one of a long presidential campaign, Mr. Romney could duck those questions: the spotlight moved to the wisdom of the economic stimulus and the auto-industry bailout, contraception and, now, same-sex marriage and high school bullying.
But in the long stretch before the Republican convention in August, the battle for Mr. Romney's mind on the key foreign policy questions that have defined the past few decades will have to be joined: When is a threat to America so urgent that the United States should intervene unilaterally? Is it worth the cost and casualties to rebuild broken societies? Should America feel it must always be in the lead -- as Mr. Romney seems to argue -- or let other powers play that role when their interests are more directly affected?
On these questions, Mr. Romney's own advisers, judging by their public writing and comments, possess widely differing views -- often a result of the scar tissue they developed in Iraq, Afghanistan and other Bush-era experiments in the exercise of American power. But what has struck both his advisers and outside Republicans is that in his effort to secure the nomination, Mr. Romney's public comments have usually rejected mainstream Republican orthodoxy. They sound more like the talking points of the neoconservatives -- the ''Bolton faction,'' as insiders call the group led by John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations. In a stormy tenure in the Bush administration, Mr. Bolton was often arguing that international institutions, the United Nations included, should be routed around because they so often frustrate American interests.
Curiously for a Republican candidate with virtually no foreign policy record, Mr. Romney has made little effort to court the old-timers of Republican internationalism, from the former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to the former secretaries of state James A. Baker III, George P. Shultz and even the grandmaster of realism, Henry A. Kissinger. And in seeking to define himself in opposition to President Obama, Mr. Romney has openly rejected positions that George W. Bush came around to in his humbler second term.
This may change as the arrival of the general election requires Mr. Romney to grapple with the question of how to attack a Democratic president whose affection for unilateral use of force -- from drones over Pakistan and Yemen to a far greater role for the Special Operations command -- has immunized him a bit from the traditional claim that Democrats can't stand the sight of hard power. So far Mr. Romney's most nuanced line of attack was laid out in the introduction to a campaign white paper last fall written by Eliot Cohen, a historian and security expert who worked for Condoleezza Rice in the State Department, that the ''high council of the Obama administration'' views the ''United States as a power in decline,'' a ''condition that can and should be managed for the global good rather than reversed.'' It also alleged a ''torrent of criticism, unprecedented for an American president, that Barack Obama has directed at his own country.''
But in a campaign likely to be dominated by a slow-burning nuclear crisis with Iran, the likelihood of a North Korean nuclear test, the kind of eruptions with China that have dominated headlines for the past two weeks and the end of the surge in Afghanistan come September, the internal struggles between the various factions within the Romney campaign are likely to become evident.
Iran may be a first test. Mr. Romney put it pretty bluntly, in another line that caused some of his advisers to cringe and others to celebrate, when he declared late in 2011: ''If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon. If you elect me as president, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.''
BUT when pressed on how, exactly, his strategy would differ from Mr. Obama's, Mr. Romney had a hard time responding. The economic sanctions Mr. Obama has imposed have been far more crippling to the Iranian economy than anything President Bush did between the public revelation of Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities in 2003 and the end of Mr. Bush's term in early 2009. Covert action has been stepped up, too. Mr. Bolton has called efforts to negotiate with Iran ''delusional,'' but other advisers -- mostly those who dealt with the issue during the Bush administration -- say they are a critical step in holding together the European allies and, if conflict looms, proving to Russia and China that every effort was made to come to a peaceful resolution. Several e-mails to the campaign asking for Mr. Romney's position on the talks yielded no response.
''There are two very different worldviews in this campaign,'' said one adviser who aligns more often with Mr. Bolton. ''But as in any campaign, there are outer circles, inner circles and inner-inner circles, and I'm not sure that anyone knows if the candidate has a strong view of his own on this.'' Another adviser, saying he would be ''cashiered'' if the campaign caught him talking to a reporter without approval, said the real answer was that ''Romney doesn't want to really engage these issues until he is in office'' and for now was ''just happy to leave the impression that when Obama says he'll stop an Iranian bomb he doesn't mean it, and Mitt does.''
On some issues, Mr. Romney clearly does have his own views: He drafted an op-ed opposing the ratification of the New Start treaty with Russia, which cut in half the two countries' nuclear launchers but left huge stockpiles of non-deployed nuclear weapons largely untouched -- without much input from his staff. In recent days, Mr. Romney's advisers argued that the candidate's declaration that Russia is ''our No. 1 geopolitical foe'' looks less out of touch now that President Vladimir V. Putin reclaimed his office with a brutal crackdown on dissent. Mr. Romney's best line: He will ''reset the reset.''
More complicated for Mr. Romney, given his business credentials, is his position on China. He argues for more arms to Taiwan and much tougher use of trade sanctions to respond to China's currency and market manipulations.
In the past, such actions have frozen Chinese cooperation with the United States, but, the white paper insists, ''Romney will work to persuade China to commit to North Korea's disarmament,'' as if the last three presidents have not.
Such trade-offs are, of course, a bit too subtle for any presidential campaign. Yet so far this year Mr. Romney has spent little time on foreign policy, understandable given the length of the primary battles. The Romney strategy for now may simply be to portray Mr. Obama as a weak apologizer and figure out the details later.

HEADLINE: The Education of Zuck

BYLINE: By EVELYN RUSLI, NICOLE PERLROTH and NICK BILTON

 BODY:
His audience this Monday morning, a Who's Who of Wall Street heavy-hitters, with untold billions to command, shifts in its seats. Papers rustle. BlackBerrys buzz. Cue Mr. Zuckerberg and --
Wait: where the heck is Zuck?
Mr. Zuckerberg, the hoodied man-child of Facebook, is stuck in the men's room. Apparently, the suits can wait.
Up on the stage, Sheryl K. Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg's No. 2 and the polished, corporate yin to his nerdy, coder yang, vamps a little: You know Zuck, she shrugs. And the money types laugh: yes, we know Zuck.
It's May 7, a week before Mr. Zuckerberg's 28th birthday. And, as Wall Street, Silicon Valley and the wider world all know, something big is coming. It is the deal that will either prove once and for all that Facebook is changing just about everything, everywhere, or that the mania over social media and this company, its apotheosis, is spiraling out of control. 
Inside a ballroom at the Sheraton New York in Midtown Manhattan, Facebook's executives, spinmeisters and bankers are choreographing its initial public stock offering. This is no mere I.P.O. It feels like a cultural event, a pinnacle in the history of tech, a moment. The deep pockets have arrived at the Sheraton for a multibillion-dollar sales pitch. If all goes well, Facebook will go public on Friday in an I.P.O. that could value it at nearly $100 billion.
One hundred billion dollars -- for a company that, eight years ago, didn't even exist.
No one has more riding on this than Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, hero-villain of ''The Social Network,'' destroyer of worlds, devourer of time and, for better and worse, the latest in a line of revolutionaries stretching back to Gutenberg who have upended the way we communicate and think.
The outlines of the Zuckerberg story thus far -- the boyhood in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., the Harvard wars over ''thefacebook,'' the relentless rise in Silicon Valley -- are by now well known. But Facebook's I.P.O. will begin a new chapter -- indeed, a new volume -- in one of the great business narratives of our time. It will also make Mr. Zuckerberg almost impossibly rich. In an instant, his stake could be worth upward of $18.7 billion.
Mind-boggling figures aside, the question on many minds is this: Is Mr. Zuckerberg really ready for this? Is he -- there's no sugarcoating it -- grown up enough to lead a public corporation that is more valuable than McDonald's or Goldman Sachs? The answer to those questions will determine the future of Facebook, as well as the fortunes of its new, public shareholders. For the first time, Mr. Zuckerberg will be judged, in real time, by a relentless stock market. And that market, as C.E.O.'s everywhere know, is merciless.
''You're making a bet, and the bet is always on 'Can the founder go somewhere?' '' Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, an adviser to Mr. Zuckerberg and an early financial backer of Facebook, said in an earlier interview. ''And Zuck's done great.''
It's hard to argue. The question, however, is where Mr. Zuckerberg goes from here as a chief executive. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but interviews with dozens of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, as well as with Facebook colleagues and outsiders who have mentored him along his climb, paint a promising picture. Beneath that hoodie, these people say, is an increasingly assured leader, one tempered by failures -- and there have been some big ones -- as well as astonishing successes.
Friends and colleagues agree that Mr. Zuckerberg's goal is be a C.E.O. for the long haul. Like a software engineer writing a program, he has tried to fill in the gaps in his personal code, and to ensure, as a programmer might put it, that his code doesn't break.
Even now, with a multibillion-dollar brass ring at hand, Mr. Zuckerberg remains intensely aware of his limitations, these people say. Where he is strong -- in product design and strategy -- he tends to micromanage. Where he is weak -- day-to-day management, operations -- he hires people with a defter touch. He has enlisted top engineers and managers, including the formidable Ms. Sandberg, 42. Friends and colleagues say she has coached the often-awkward Mr. Zuckerberg on how to interact with employees and to build Facebook's business.
But Mr. Zuckerberg has also invested in a personal brain trust beyond Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. He cultivated as advisers such tech giants as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as well as others as varied as Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, and Donald E. Graham, the chairman and chief executive of the Washington Post Company.
One venture capitalist tells how, when he met Mr. Zuckerberg in 2005, the young man wanted more than the V.C.'s money. He wanted an introduction to Mr. Gates. (He eventually got one, on his own. Today, Mr. Gates regularly advises him on philanthropy and management issues.)
''What's most interesting about Mark is how he developed himself as a leader,'' says Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, who has known Mr. Zuckerberg for years. ''Not only did he have an incredible vision for the industry, but he had an incredible vision for himself.''
Granted, Mr. Zuckerberg can still come across as a bit of a social misfit, particularly on buttoned-down Wall Street. Last Monday at the Sheraton, for instance, some took issue with his dorm-room wear, considering it a snub to the financial industry.
''Mark and his signature hoodie: He's actually showing investors he doesn't care that much,'' Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg TV. ''He's going to be him and he's going to do what he's always done.'' Mr. Pachter added: ''I think that's a mark of immaturity. I think that he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now, and I think he's got to show them the respect that they deserve because he's asking them for their money.''
Yet there's no denying that those on Wall Street, as well as Facebook's 901 million monthly users worldwide, have grown accustomed to Mr. Zuckerberg, quirks and all. Sure, techno-gods like Mr. Jobs and Mr. Gates long ago challenged the old stereotypes of how C.E.O.'s should look, sound and act. But when Mr. Zuckerberg burst onto the scene, Facebook's success pushed the boundaries even further.
''He is a sponge in terms of learning. He has a higher ask-to-talk ratio than anyone I know,'' says one of Mr. Zuckerberg's friends, who, like many people interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the imminent I.P.O. ''He is constantly asking 'Why? Why? Why?' and he has a very clear sense of what he is good at and somewhere between average and mediocre at.''
MUCH has been written in recent years about the death of the ''imperial C.E.O.,'' the executive who leads from a glorious distance, screaming orders at underlings.
To look at him, Mark Zuckerberg might seem just the opposite. But most people who know him say he harbors more than a hint of C.E.O. imperialism. Joe Green, his roommate at Harvard, says that, particularly in the early days, Mr. Zuckerberg was so confident that he often came across as aloof. He wasn't the best communicator, Mr. Green says.
''You can see that as a bad thing, but you have to have an irrational level of self-confidence to start something like Facebook,'' says Mr. Green, now a co-founder of Causes, a popular Facebook application.
Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that Mr. Zuckerberg is fascinated by ancient Greece and Rome. As a boy, a favorite video game was Civilization, the object of which is to ''build an empire to stand the test of time.''
Civilization, one friend says, was ''training wheels for starting Facebook.''
But, in 2006, Mr. Zuckerberg almost lost his grip on the company, in an episode he has since come to view one of his biggest failures as a C.E.O.
At the time, the Yahoo executive Daniel L. Rosensweig was doggedly courting Facebook, hoping for Yahoo to buy it. Mr. Zuckerberg's price, $1 billion, was roughly 1/100 of what Facebook is expected to be valued at in its I.P.O. this week.
Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Rosensweig, who is now C.E.O. of Chegg, informally sealed the deal with a handshake. Then Yahoo's share price tumbled abruptly on the stock market, and Yahoo reduced its offer to $850 million.
Relieved, Mr. Zuckerberg walked away -- and vowed that he would never make the same mistake again. ''If you don't want to sell your company, don't get into a process where you're talking to people about selling your company,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said at a start-up conference at Stanford University last October. He resolved to retain control of Facebook. And he then pushed out colleagues who had supported the Yahoo deal.
His conviction has been on display -- often controversially -- as Facebook has confronted the thorny issues of online privacy. When Facebook introduced its News Feed feature in 2006, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg was convinced that it would be a hit. Instead, many users were outraged that their home pages would automatically broadcast every profile change and activity.
At one point, Facebook got a call from the Palo Alto, Calif., police department, asking if the company could turn off the News Feed. People were threatening to stage a protest march downtown.
Mr. Zuckerberg eventually apologized -- but he left News Feed largely intact. Indeed, even now, he is pressing users to share more information, often without their full understanding, and dials back only when the complaints grow loud. Beacon, an advertising program that automatically publicized consumers' purchases on sites like Amazon to Facebook, turned out to be a flop. Mr. Zuckerberg abandoned it and later settled a related class action by paying $9.5 million to set up a privacy foundation.
Then he simply moved on.
''The dude is relentless,'' one former Facebook employee says. ''If it doesn't work one way, he keeps coming back.''
THE humdrum offices of The Washington Post, in northwest Washington, are a world away from Silicon Valley. But the Facebook story took a crucial turn there in early 2005, when, through a Harvard classmate, Mark Zuckerberg met Donald Graham of the Washington Post Company.
Mr. Zuckerberg and Sean Parker -- a co-founder of Napster, an early confidant and the company's first president -- traveled to Washington to see if the company would invest in Facebook.
As David Kirkpatrick later recounted in ''The Facebook Effect,'' Mr. Zuckerberg was struck by the differences between the Post Company and technology companies in Silicon Valley.
''I was just blown away by the difference in culture, that it's just a long-term focus there, and that they're so focused on the brand,'' Mr. Zuckerberg recalled in the book.
Mr. Zuckerberg would later shadow Mr. Graham for four days, sitting in on meetings and analyst presentations, trying to learn what it was like to run a large company. In 2009, Mr. Zuckerberg invited him to join his board.
The Post never did invest in Facebook.
Mr. Zuckerberg was impressed not only with Mr. Graham's long-term view, but also with the Post Company's shareholder structure. Like many media companies, it has two classes of stock. This setup gives the Graham family significant voting power.
Mr. Zuckerberg emulated that structure. When Facebook goes public, he will own a minority stake in the company -- but will control more than half of the voting power.
Mr. Parker's story, too, provided valuable lessons. Mr. Parker, now 32, taught Mr. Zuckerberg the importance of maintaining power over his company. For Mr. Parker, the matter was personal. As a founder of Plaxo, the online address book, he had fought bitterly with his venture capital backers and eventually left the company poorer than he'd hoped.
Eager to protect Mr. Zuckerberg, he helped come up with legal documents that guaranteed Mr. Zuckerberg two Facebook board seats. (Mr. Parker got one.) As long as Mr. Zuckerberg held a seat, his shares couldn't be taken from him. When Mr. Parker left Facebook, he gave his seat to Mr. Zuckerberg.
SEAN PARKER played another crucial role at Facebook: he helped recruit many of its early employees. Among them were Matt Cohler, then a rising star at LinkedIn; Kevin Colleran, one of Facebook's first sales executives; and Aaron Sittig, who worked with Mr. Parker at Napster and became Facebook's lead designer. Mr. Parker also ran Facebook's early financing rounds, acting as a go-between to influential investors like Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal.
But Mr. Jobs, too, taught Mr. Zuckerberg about hiring. In his early days at Apple, Mr. Jobs often sounded out potential hires during long walks around Palo Alto.
Mr. Zuckerberg sought out Mr. Jobs early on at Facebook. The two were known to take afternoon walks in Palo Alto, and they nurtured what many describe as a meaningful personal relationship despite their eventual business rivalries. (Mr. Zuckerberg was also inspired by Apple designs, and modeled Facebook's F8 conferences on annual Macworld conferences. Mr. Zuckerberg later adopted Mr. Job's walkabout approach to hiring. When Facebook was headquartered in Palo Alto, he often took high-level new recruits on hikes along the wooded trails near his offices.
Several people who were hired this way say the strolls usually meandered along the trail -- with Mr. Zuckerberg asking questions of the new recruit along the way -- and ended atop a lookout. There, Mr. Zuckerberg would explain the terrain in front of them and his vision for the future.
''He pointed out Apple's headquarters, then Hewlett-Packard and a number of other big tech companies,'' one person who was recruited by Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times last year. ''Then he pointed to Facebook and said that it would eventually be bigger than all of the companies he had just mentioned, and that if I joined the company, I could be a part of it all.''
''WE don't need to get any lawyers involved. Let's just talk alone.''
Those are the words Mr. Zuckerberg often uses, over the phone or by Facebook Instant Messenger, in an initial overture to a company he wants to buy. Over the past eight years, Facebook has bought a string of start-ups, such as FriendFeed, Snaptu and Gowalla, and announced in April it would buy Instagram for $1 billion.
As chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg has proved himself a savvy negotiator of deals.
''Mark will convince companies he is going to acquire that they should accept a deal on a projected valuation,'' says one C.E.O. who held talks with Mr. Zuckerberg. ''Then, he'll go back to investors who want to put money into Facebook and say, look, this start-up was going to join us at this valuation, so you should invest at that number.''
For example, during the closing hours of the Instagram talks, Mr. Zuckerberg and Kevin Systrom, the Instagram chief executive, reached a deal in private, at Mr. Zuckerberg's $7 million, five-bedroom home in Palo Alto, while their lawyers and advisers watched from afar.
''As the deal came to a close, Mark and Kevin sat outside and ate steaks and ice cream, while the lawyers all sat inside watching 'Game of Thrones,' '' said a person who was present. It wasn't lost on those there, this person said, that ''two 20-somethings were alone hammering out the terms of the deal.''
The Instagram deal underscored how Mr. Zuckerberg has cemented his power over the last eight years. Facebook's board, which got a brief e-mail about the deal a few days before it was announced, according to those close to the company, never pushed back.
And so now, as C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg has never been more secure -- or, given the coming I.P.O., more exposed. By most accounts, he has few close friends outside the company. He has a girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, and a dog, Beast. Like his master, Beast, a Puli with thick dreadlocks, has a page on Facebook. (It has 541,786 ''likes.'')
On some evenings, as dusk falls in Menlo Park, Mr. Zuckerberg and a small circle of his lieutenants play roller hockey, and maybe knock back a beer or two, outside Facebook's headquarters. The game is a relatively recent arrival there, although Mr. Zuckerberg has played it since his boyhood in Dobbs Ferry.
Out in the courtyard, the crew -- almost all of them men, almost all in their 20s -- hoot and skate until it is almost too dark to see much of anything. Across the courtyard floor, giant black tiles spell out the word ''hack.'' They've nicknamed their rink ''Hack Stadium.''
The Facebook boys and their captain, Mark Zuckerberg, skate hard. They line up shots with care. And they play to win.

HEADLINE: Winning the News Cycle, Losing the Race

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
FOR a generation or more, liberals have complained that the Republican Party uses social and cultural debates to distract voters from pocketbook issues. From Howard Dean's 2003 lament about Southerners voting on ''race, guns, God and gays'' to Thomas Frank's musings on what's supposedly the matter with Kansas, the Republican focus on social issues has been regularly portrayed as a bait-and-switch, designed to bamboozle Americans into voting against their economic interests.
In 2012, though, liberals have learned to stop worrying and love the social issues. Ever since Rick Santorum's campaign provided an opportunity to paint Republicans as nostalgists for the Comstock laws (if not the Inquisition), the Obama White House has consistently sought to change the subject from the unemployment rate to contraception, or immigration, or now even gay marriage. 
For the president, talking about social issues is a way to activate key constituencies (young people, Hispanics, unmarried women) and woo crucial donor bases (he raised $15 million at a Hollywood fund-raiser after giving his support to same-sex wedlock). Above all, though, it's a way to talk about something -- anything! -- besides his economic record.
It must be said that the White House has executed this strategy effectively. Twice in the last few months, a cultural controversy has threatened President Obama with embarrassment or worse: first in January, when the health care mandate requiring most religious employers to pay for sterilization, contraception and the morning-after pill prompted a chorus of opposition, and then again a week ago when it became clear that the media would no longer give the president cover for his ''evolving'' position on gay marriage.
In both cases, though, Obama quickly regained the initiative. In the case of the mandate, he combined a hasty compromise proposal with a ''war on women'' counterattack -- and received a crucial gift from Rush Limbaugh, whose ''slut'' monologue seemed to vindicate the White House's portrayal of its opponents as troglodytes and bigots.
In the case of gay marriage, meanwhile, Obama benefited from the press's eagerness to cover capital-H History, earning a wave of glowing publicity for what amounted to a tacit admission that he had been deceiving voters about his convictions all along. And again, the White House benefited from an unexpected political gift, this time from a Washington Post story on Mitt Romney's teenage bullying of a (possibly gay) prep school classmate.
The question, though, is what this successful maneuvering is actually gaining the White House. The weaknesses it's trying to exploit are real enough: the country is moving leftward on many social issues, and Romney's mix of squareness and weirdness -- the moneyed background, the Mormonism, the 1950s persona -- makes it relatively easy to portray him as culturally out of touch.
But this would be a bigger problem for Republicans if the 2012 campaign were taking place amid prosperity and plenty. At times, the Obama White House seems to be attempting to run a liberal version of George H. W. Bush's 1988 campaign, which used cultural arguments to delegitimize Michael Dukakis. But today's economic landscape looks more like 1992, when Bush the elder discovered that the same arguments availed him little with a recession-weary electorate -- even in a race against a slick, womanizing draft-dodger.
Making Americans feel uncomfortable with Romney, in other words, won't be enough if the economy keeps sputtering along. What Obama needs, instead, is to make voters fear a Romney presidency, even more than they fear four more years of high deficits and slow growth. And a re-election campaign that focuses on gay marriage, or the Dream Act, or birth control, or how Romney treated his dog and high school classmates is unlikely to stoke that kind of fear.
What might? Well, in a pocketbook election it helps to focus on pocketbook anxieties. It's true that every day the White House spends talking about social issues is a day it isn't stuck talking about the economy. But it's also a day when it hasn't talked about how Mitt Romney wants to take away your retirement security to pay for tax cuts for the rich.
This is a predictable Democratic argument, and a demagogic one. But it's an argument that might actually make economically stressed Americans afraid of what a Romney presidency would bring.
Instead, Obama is currently running for re-election as an opponent of sexism, homophobia and social reaction in all its forms. This is a decent strategy for winning news cycles, which the administration clearly did last week -- playing the media brilliantly and watching as Romney was thrown on the defensive yet again.
But Obama has won news cycle after news cycle this spring, and yet the president and his unloved, out-of-step-with-the-times challenger are almost dead even in the polls. That's a sign that something isn't working -- and that this White House, not for the first time, has mistaken a clever strategy for a winning one.

HEADLINE: At JPMorgan, the Ghost of Dinner Parties Past

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WHAT goes around comes around. Sometimes it happens sooner than you'd think.
That round wheel turned on JPMorgan Chase last week, which disclosed that it had suffered a $2 billion trading loss in credit derivatives. That such a hit had befallen the mightiest of banks was perhaps more stunning than the size of the loss.
So where does the karma come in? The loss, and the embarrassment it held for Jamie Dimon, the bank's imperious chief executive, came just one month after a private dinner party in Dallas at which he assailed two respected public figures who have pushed for policies that would make banks like JPMorgan smaller and less risky. 
One was Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, whose remedy for risky trading by too-big-to-fail banks is known as the Volcker Rule. The other was Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has also argued that large institutions should be slimmed down or limited in their risky trading practices.
The party, sponsored by JPMorgan for a group of its wealthy private clients, took place at the sumptuous Mansion on Turtle Creek hotel. Mr. Dimon was on hand to thank the guests for their patronage and their trust.
During the party, Mr. Dimon took questions from the crowd, according to an attendee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of alienating the bank. One guest asked about the problem of too-big-to-fail banks and the arguments made by Mr. Volcker and Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Dimon responded that he had just two words to describe them: ''infantile'' and ''nonfactual.'' He went on to lambaste Mr. Fisher further, according to the attendee. Some in the room were taken aback by the comments.
Neither Mr. Fisher nor Mr. Volcker would comment on the remarks. But it appears to have been a classic performance from Mr. Dimon. In-your-face. Pugnacious. My way or the highway.
Mr. Dimon declined to comment.
AS overseer of the bank that emerged in the best shape from the credit crisis, Mr. Dimon has gained in stature in recent years. Hailed for his management skill, he has also become the financial industry's point man in the war against tighter regulation of derivatives and proprietary trading. Almost since the financial crisis began, JPMorgan Chase and its legion of lobbyists have swarmed lawmakers and regulators in an effort to beat back efforts to bring transparency to derivatives and to separate risk-taking activities like proprietary trading from commercial lending units.
JPMorgan has not been alone in these efforts. But it has had more clout because of its position as the grown-up in the financial industry's playground.
The industry's efforts to curtail or derail both derivatives transparency and the Volcker Rule -- which would eliminate proprietary trading at commercial banks -- have had significant effects. In the case of the Volcker Rule, lobbying has made the proposed regulation vastly more complex. Mr. Volcker himself told lawmakers at a Congressional hearing last week that ''I could give you stories all day about lobbyists making things more complicated.''
The financial industry's opposition has delayed the effective dates of regulatory changes. Had those delays not occurred, it's possible that JPMorgan would not have incurred its big and jarring loss.
Mr. Dimon does not agree with this assessment, judging from his comments in a conference call last Thursday. But it's an argument made persuasively by Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and an authority on derivatives. He said that if two still-pending aspects of the Dodd-Frank legislation had been in effect, JPMorgan's trading position probably wouldn't have been allowed to grow as large as it did. Even better, the trades might not have been made by the bank at all.
''If the trades at issue were proprietary trading, as now appears to be the case, they would be banned by the Volcker Rule,'' Mr. Greenberger said. ''And if derivatives rules under Dodd-Frank had been in effect, these trades would almost certainly have been required to be cleared and transparently executed. The losing nature of the trades, therefore, would have been obvious to market observers and regulators for quite some time and the losses would not have piled up opaquely.''
Mr. Greenberger is talking about Title VII, the section of the Dodd-Frank law dealing with over-the-counter derivatives, which were at the heart of the JPMorgan trades. It would require clearing on an exchange and transparent execution of these derivatives. Under these rules, when trades go against an institution, additional capital would have to be supplied. ''A Title VII clearing facility would have priced this trade regularly, and if it kept moving away, the facility would have been asking for margin,'' Mr. Greenberger said. ''That kind of discipline tends to head people off from these positions.''
But regulators are still hammering out the Title VII rules, and the lobbyists are hellbent on weakening them. This much is clear: If the Glass-Steagall law were still around, the problematic trading at JPMorgan would not have occurred.
The hypocrisy is that our nation's big financial institutions, protected by implied taxpayer guarantees, oppose regulation on the grounds that it would increase their costs and reduce their profit. Such rules are unfair, they contend. But in discussing fairness, they never talk about how fair it is to require taxpayers to bail out reckless institutions when their trades imperil them. That's a question for another day.
AND the fact that large institutions arguing against transparency in derivatives trading won't acknowledge that such rules could also save them from themselves is quite the paradox.
''These regulations are not just protecting the United States taxpayer,'' Mr. Greenberger said. ''They protect the banks themselves. The best friend of these banks would be laws that prevent them from shooting themselves in the foot. The fact is, they can't do it themselves.''
As if we had to learn that lesson again.

MOMMY HAD TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILE
As an obstetrician for high-risk pregnancies who has cared for women with substance-abuse problems, I found the story of Amanda Kimbrough all too familiar. On a practical level, criminalizing any aspect of women's behavior during pregnancy has the exact opposite effect of what is intended: it alienates the very women who are most likely to benefit from prenatal care. Instead of protecting fetuses, this practice demonizes their mothers and sends them into hiding. Frequently this results in increased, rather than decreased, drug use. Which leads me to wonder if the purpose of these laws is really to protect fetuses.
HYTHAM M. IMSEIS, M.D.,Charlotte, N.C.
Willful endangerment of a child -- even one who hasn't been born yet -- is something that should be taken seriously. It's easy to be sympathetic and sentimental, or even to frame this as a gender issue. But as a physician who has seen the worst that pregnant women can do, I prefer to err on the side of protecting the children. And that's especially true when it comes to dealing with current and former addicts. If you commit errors in judgment that endanger others, you pay the price, even if it means collateral damage with regard to the children. If left free, the danger these offenders pose to their children and others far outstrips any relative merits they might have been able to argue for.

EARTH TO BEN BERNANKE
If Paul Krugman sees a difference between Ben Bernanke's academic writing and his current posture, maybe that's because Bernanke is no longer an academic, free to lob rhetorical missiles toward policy makers, which happens to be precisely what Krugman is doing. On the other hand, Krugman is right to feel frustrated at the pace of economic recovery and question whether there isn't a way for policy makers to do more.
Unfortunately for the country, with just six months before the presidential election, political concerns are now paramount among our nation's leaders, which reduces the likelihood of aggressive Fed action. In a way, the Krugman-vs.-Bernanke debate symbolizes one of the great narratives of President Obama's first term: What happens when bold ideas run smack into the responsibility -- and political considerations -- of actually governing and maintaining public support to continue doing so?
SAM GUSTIN,posted on time.com
This is really an issue of models. In your model of monetary policy, how many more jobs does the economy produce at 3 percent inflation rather than 2 percent inflation? What about 4 percent inflation? In Bernanke's model, the answer is ''not many.'' Or more precisely, it's ''not enough to be worth it.'' But it would be nice to see this argument conducted in more precise terms. What does Bernanke actually think the Federal Reserve could do if it tried to juice the recovery? What do his critics think the Federal Reserve could do if it tried to juice the recovery? In other words, do Paul Krugman and Ben Bernanke disagree on the number of jobs the Fed could create, or do they disagree on whether creating those jobs would be worth the cost in higher inflation expectations?

HEADLINE: Evolving Russia Finds a Recorder Of Its Moment

BYLINE: By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY; Yulia Taranova contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW
EVER since he won the grand prize at the 2003 Venice Film Festival for his stunning film debut, ''The Return,'' an allegorical tale of father-son relations tinged with mystery, Andrei Zvyagintsev has been hailed as the heir to the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky.
Now with ''Elena,'' his taut and starkly realistic third film that is also a mystical parable, Mr. Zvyagintsev is being described as a seer of the social and spiritual divides in Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.
Shot in 2010 and released here last fall, ''Elena'' seemed to capture the mood that led to mass protests against Mr. Putin and Russia's entrenched bureaucrats after charges of widespread electoral fraud in December's parliamentary elections. 
''We all are rotten seeds,'' says the most cynical character in ''Elena,'' Katerina, who is paradoxically the only character honest with herself and others and who shows glimmers of redemption.
''Moral questions are being set aside,'' Mr. Zvyagintsev said in an interview last month in his sleek office in central Moscow, reflecting on Russia and accusations by critics, intellectuals and general audiences that his film defames Russians by portraying them in a negative light. ''New values are being articulated.''
''One has to be blind not to see this,'' he said.
Mr. Zvyagintsev is wary of directly criticizing Mr. Putin, the newly re-elected president, or those who supported him on the way to the March 4 vote. But the filmmaker did attend an anti-Putin rally in December and talked about it on an opposition television channel. And the sense that he views life -- and the Russian condition -- as a series of moral challenges is apparent in his films and in conversation.
''A person who is in art can speak of politics through art,'' he said.
''Elena,'' shown as part of the Certain Regard section at Cannes last year, was honored with a special jury prize there, and Mr. Zvyagintsev took home the best director award at the Nika film awards in Russia last month. But ''Elena'' was pushed out of contention last year for Russia's Oscar entry for best foreign-language film in place of ''Citadel,'' the final installment of a trilogy about the Stalin era and World War II. ''Citadel'' was directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, who presides like a czar over Russia's film world.
Americans can see what the controversy was about when ''Elena'' has its premiere in the United States on Wednesday at Film Forum. BAMcinematek will offer a sneak preview on Monday as part of its Next Director series. Also screening as part of the series are ''Apocryphya,'' Mr. Zvyagintsev's entry in the anthology film ''New York, I Love You,'' which was not included in its theatrical release; ''The Banishment,'' his 2007 film that was not released in the United States; and ''The Return.''
''Elena'' is set unmistakably in today's Moscow. The tacky talk shows and dating games that fill TV screens here are a recurrent background.
On the surface the socioeconomic lines could not be more clearly drawn: the film cuts between Moscow's most elite neighborhood, near the Kremlin, and the industrial sprawl and crumbling Soviet-era housing on its outskirts, where credit cards are still regarded as something alien.
Elena -- in her 50s, dutiful and taciturn -- lives with her older, much richer husband, who shows her little affection but appears to depend on her. They are played by the stately Nadezhda Markina and Andrei Smirnov, veteran Russian actors, and their relationship speaks volumes about alienation, exploitation and attraction.
Elena's sole purpose in life, one that represents many Russian women, is to support her adult son, Sergey. Unemployed, with a family that includes a teenager who needs to be bought out of impending military service, he lives off his mother with no qualms. Her husband, Vladimir, also supports his own wayward daughter, Katerina, from a previous marriage. But once he insists that Elena's family -- and especially her son -- take responsibility for their lives, the long-suffering and religious Elena snaps.
Mr. Zvyagintsev is a youthful-looking 48, a fashionably dressed and soft-spoken father of four. But he links his Siberian background and impoverished days as a young actor in Moscow to the harsher realities of Russian life today, and he chafes at suggestions that the portrayal of Elena's poor relations is exaggerated and insulting.
''When people say this is a caricature, I say this is me,'' he said. ''We didn't have to go to Biryulyovo'' -- a reference to a working-class neighborhood in the film -- ''to study people there. It's me and my friends. Maybe I'm not so close to oligarchs.''
''Elena'' is permeated with the sense that people can live side by side for years and be divided. Mr. Zvyagintsev said the idea of overriding disconnection between people was the basis of his original vision for the film in 2009. It began as a script by Mr. Zvyagintsev and Oleg Negin for a British producer who wanted an international lineup to make films revolving around the idea of apocalypse. Mr. Zvyagintsev's contribution was supposed to be in English, with characters named Helen and Richard.
The apocalypse project fell through, and Mr. Zvyagintsev translated the script to a Russian setting. Russian reviewers last fall noted that he had conveyed the sense of impending doom in Russia -- ''moral catastrophe'' as he describes it -- but the film, with no direct political references, cleared the censors on Rossiya, one of two main state television channels, and was broadcast during prime time last November. But in theatrical release in Russia, where American blockbusters dominate, ''Elena'' pulled in just over 100,000 viewers, fewer than it drew in France.
In late April, at a Moscow art gallery holding an exhibition about Tarkovsky, Mr. Zvyagintsev presented his favorite Tarkovsky film, ''Andrei Rublev,'' about the Russian religious iconographer. Amid depictions of feudal Russia, it examined the role of the artist and the meaning of faith.
Mr. Zvyagintsev deflected accusations that he imitates Tarkovsky, saying that it was impossible not to be inspired by him. The next day, ''Rublev'' still on his mind, Mr. Zvyagintsev mused about Russia. ''We are a feudal society,'' he said, ''with a slavish mentality. I don't think we can ever change this until our entire world order changes. We need to have many new generations born in freedom.''

HEADLINE: Phil Who? Knicks Will Probably Play It Safe

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
For a decade, the Knicks conducted business like a crazed QVC addict with a stack of limitless credit cards -- lunging at every shiny object, no matter the price or the consequences.
Instant gratification came in the form of Isiah Thomas and Larry Brown, Stephon Marbury and Eddy Curry, Amar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony. If the name could light up a marquee, the Knicks were buying, whatever the cost.
Yet suddenly, with the franchise at a crossroads, Madison Square Garden has gone inexplicably conservative. 
Sometime soon (possibly this week), the Knicks are expected to remove Mike Woodson's interim title and make him the permanent head coach.
They will do so without making a single bid for the shiniest object on the market: Phil Jackson, with his 11 sparkly championship rings.
The Knicks had not contacted Jackson as of last week, according to people close to the Hall of Fame coach. There is no guarantee that he would take the job, but ''he would listen,'' one said.
Yet James L. Dolan, the Garden chairman, apparently does not intend to call. He has already begun preliminary talks with Woodson on a multiyear extension, according to people with ties to the Garden.
Woodson, a passionate teacher and motivator, is a perfectly reasonable choice.
The Knicks rallied under his leadership, going 18-6 to finish the season before getting crushed by the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs. He has the strong support of Anthony, Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler, the Knicks' three stars.
He has a solid resume, having previously molded a young and impetuous Atlanta Hawks roster into a stout playoff team. He is well liked and respected around the league. No one will fault the Knicks for hiring him.
Woodson is the safe, conventional choice. Jackson, though infinitely more successful, might be the riskier option, which could explain Dolan's sudden conservative streak.
Jackson is an iconoclast, a force of nature who marches to the beat of his own bongos. He would clash spectacularly with the Garden's staid corporate culture, which is reason enough for Dolan to hesitate and for Jackson (if he were offered the job) to balk.
Jackson can be brutally candid, a trait that is frowned upon at the Garden, where ''see no evil, speak no evil'' is official policy. On any given day, Jackson might publicly upbraid his players, needle opponents, insult a city or tweak the commissioner's office. He would violate the Garden's infamous news media rules within 32 seconds of his first news conference. He would eventually write a book exposing the internal politics and hypocrisy.
And Jackson would learn, as Donnie Walsh did, that promises of autonomy -- whether in choosing personnel or choosing what to say -- will ultimately ring hollow.
There will apparently be no such tension with Woodson. He withheld any criticism of his players throughout the five-game thrashing by the Heat. On Thursday, when asked his parting message to the players, Woodson responded as if reading from an MSG employee manual. ''Nothing negative,'' he said. ''It's all positive.''
That same day, word leaked that Woodson had fired his longtime agent -- at Dolan's urging. The agent, Joe Glass, also represents Brown, who won an $18.5 million settlement after Dolan fired him in 2006.
Keith Glass, the agent's son, who has worked with his father in representing Brown and Woodson, was stunned.
''I received a phone call from him, basically saying that he had to make a change,'' Keith Glass said, adding: ''Mike deserves the job. I'm trying to take the high road here. And I certainly won't be asking anyone at the Garden for directions.''
Although Woodson has yet to hire a new agent, word is already circulating that he will choose Creative Artists Agency, the same group that represents two team executives (Mark Warkentien and Allan Houston), as well as Anthony.
It is hard to imagine anyone telling Jackson who should represent him. It is hard to imagine Jackson being told what to do, period. That strong will and outsize personality are precisely what the Knicks need right now.
Michael Jordan was once a swaggering, single-minded scorer like Anthony. Jackson persuaded him to embrace a team-oriented game, and the Chicago Bulls won six championships. Jackson coaxed Kobe Bryant, another headstrong star, into trusting his teammates. They won five titles together in Los Angeles.
Anthony, who had more turnovers (14) than assists (11) in the playoffs, is overdue for an epiphany. And no one manages egos better than Jackson.
There is near-universal agreement around the N.B.A. that Anthony needs to become a more dedicated passer, but no one around the Knicks will say so.
Woodson made his mark by demanding accountability, and he forged the Knicks into a superior defensive team. But he never imposed the same standards on offense, as Anthony, J. R. Smith and Baron Davis were permitted to dominate the ball, burn the shot clock and fling contested jumpers -- sometimes from 28 feet -- without consequence.
Lacking job security, Woodson let Anthony indulge his worst habits. He withheld public criticism after Stoudemire recklessly smashed a fire-extinguisher door, slicing open his hand. He called out Smith for his sagging pants but never for his shot selection, which was abominable.
With a contract in hand, perhaps Woodson will tighten the reins and demand more from his stars. With the luxury of a training camp, perhaps he will find a way to blend Stoudemire's and Anthony's talents. He has earned the opportunity to try.
Meanwhile, an unemployed coach with 11 championship rings, a crate of incense and a fondness for Zen teachings is relaxing in Playa Del Rey, waiting for the phone to ring. Or not.

HEADLINE: Banks Tread a Fine Line in Trading

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Widespread trading practices are creating a headache for regulators who are trying to devise rules to prevent another financial crisis. 

 BODY:
When JPMorgan Chaserevealed its $2 billion loss last week, it looked as though the big Wall Street banks were up to their old tricks, using their government-backed funds to make risky trades in a misguided effort to improve their profits.
But even banks that focus mainly on good, old-fashioned lending do their fair share of high-stakes trading.
While few other banks, if any, pursue the complex strategies that led to JPMorgan's losses, many traditional lenders regularly buy and sell securities, and make bets with derivatives, as part of their core operations. Financial firms say such activities allow them to earn a basic return on the deposits they collect and to offset risks on their balance sheets.
These widespread trading practices are creating a headache for regulators who are trying to devise new rules to prevent another financial crisis.
Regulators are putting the finishing touches on the so-called Volcker Rule, which would ban banks from making speculative bets with their own money. But they face a basic problem: What exactly is proprietary trading?
Such activities are easy to spot when financial firms run independent trading units devoted to making profits. Already, most big banks have moved to exit these businesses in preparation for the Volcker Rule. But regulators are having a harder time telling when other trading activities - like market-making and portfolio hedging - cross the line.
"Proprietary trading is in the eye of the beholder. There's a fine line," said Nancy Bush, a banking analyst and a contributor to SNL Financial, an industry publication.
"That's what the regulators are now forced to confront, and it will be really difficult to do."
Regulators are focused on making the financial system safer.
They worry that a federally insured bank will experience a trading disaster, which would force the government and taxpayers to come to its rescue.
So far, regulators don't seem overly concerned that the JPMorgan blowup will have broader ramifications on the banking system. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, the committee set up in the wake of the crisis to identify and respond to threats to the banking sector, is not planning a special meeting to discuss JPMorgan, according to a person briefed on the council's activities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter is not public.
Big banks, even those with little presence on Wall Street, contend that their trading activities are part of prudent risk-management. Without the ability to invest in bonds and other securities, companies argue that they would not be able to make loans or extend credit as easily.
To understand regulators' dilemma, look at a big bank like Wells Fargo. It focuses on plain-vanilla lending like mortgages, credit cards and corporate loans, and like JPMorgan emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis.
Over the last 12 months, Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, has substantially increased its core bond portfolio, known as "available for sale" securities. At the end of March, the bank held $230 billion of such bonds, up 37 percent compared with a year earlier. At the same time, Wells Fargo's loans grew by 2 percent over the same period.
By comparison, Citigroup cut its available-for-sale portfolio by 7 percent over the same period. Bank of America's holdings fell by 10 percent.
Wells Fargo used money from a flood of new deposits to buy the new bonds. In essence, the bank is trying to earn extra interest.
"As the Fed has indicated rates will remain low for some time, there was less risk in investing at today's low rates, so we have in recent quarters deployed some of the liquidity in this way," Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, wrote in an e-mail.
But the holdings can also leave Wells Fargo at risk. If the bank makes a wrong assumption about interest rates, the portfolio can take a hit.
While a large proportion of the available-for-sale bonds are in instruments considered safe, like Treasuries or debt backed by the federal government, the securities can produce big trading gains, especially if their purchases are well-timed. At the end of March, Wells Fargo was sitting on $8.3 billion of paper gains on its available-for-sale bonds at the end of March, up from $6.6 billion at the end of 2011.
But these bond portfolios have also been a source of huge losses for banks.
In the darkest days of the financial crisis, available-for-sale securities showed paper losses of over $70 billion across the banking system, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
The holdings remain enormous. At JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, these bonds totaled $1.17 trillion at the end of March.
Given the size of such portfolios, banks sometimes decide to hedge against potential losses in them. But that only adds a layer of trading to the equation.
JPMorgan said its $2 billion loss stemmed from a hedge related to its available-for-sale securities. Specifically, the bank was using a relatively new type of credit derivative that mostly trades off exchanges in opaque markets.
The value of a credit derivative is tied to the prices of corporate bonds, which is why many banks make heavy use of them to protect against losses on their loans and bonds.
But hedges often lead to their own losses, as JPMorgan discovered. In its latest quarterly securities filing, Bank of America said a certain batch of credit derivatives was showing a paper loss of $493 million at the end of March. That loss should be offset against $128 million of gains on the assets being hedged, a Bank of America spokesman, Jerome F. Dubrowski, said via e-mail.
Even with the Volcker Rule on the horizon, banks are still using credit derivatives for proprietary trading. Citigroup, in its latest quarterly securities filing, says one of its uses for credit derivatives is "to take proprietary trading positions." A Citigroup spokesman, Jon Diat, said in an e-mail, "Yes, we sometimes use credit derivatives in a proprietary trade but this type of activity is a relatively small portion of our credit derivative activity."
After the JPMorgan losses, some analysts say banks could deliver more nasty surprises as they build up big positions in bonds and derivatives, especially if the economy remains weak and interest rates don't behave as banks expect.
"The biggest issue for the next five years in banking is how banks manage their balance sheets in such unprecedented times," said Michael Mayo, a banking analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities.

HEADLINE: Assigning Blame in Dewey's Collapse

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Supporters and detractors of Steven H. Davis, who possessed an equanimity that inspired confidence, agree he was the driving force behind a series of moves that sowed the seeds of Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf's demise. 

 BODY:
With the finger-pointing well under way at Dewey & LeBoeuf, the once-proud law firm on the brink of dissolution, its partners agree the former chairman, Steven H. Davis, shoulders a large chunk of the blame for its stunning fall.
Yet amid the recriminations, two sharply divergent views of Mr. Davis have emerged.
Some Dewey partners suspect him of being a crook. Last month, several of them presented the Manhattan district attorney's office with evidence of possible financial improprieties by Mr. Davis. The office has opened a criminal inquiry.
 To another group of partners, the idea that Mr. Davis engaged in criminal misconduct is preposterous. They say they believe the accusations are a fiction devised by angry, pernicious lawyers whose careers and finances have been upended.
Both detractors and supporters agree Mr. Davis was an affable, low-key leader who possessed an equanimity that inspired confidence and articulated a convincing vision for building a global legal powerhouse.
But it is also clear that Mr. Davis, 58, was the driving force behind a series of moves that sowed the seeds of the firm's demise. He pushed the star-crossed merger in 2007 that created Dewey & LeBoeuf, a behemoth with 1,400 lawyers. He also charted a rapid expansion fueled in part by heavy borrowing, overextended the firm by handing out lavish pay guarantees and oversaw a corrosive partnership culture of haves and have-nots.
"A dispassionate and disinterested review of the facts will confirm that I have not engaged in any misconduct," Mr. Davis said in an e-mail to his partners last month. "I did my best to navigate the firm through challenging and turbulent times, and I deeply regret our current situation."
Mr. Davis has not returned to Dewey's offices since his former partners ousted him two weeks ago. He has mostly been holed up in his Beekman Place rental apartment on Manhattan's East Side. Dewey's collapse caused him great emotional strain, but since the criminal accusations, that stress has turned into anger, friends say. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment for this article.
Beekman Place is two miles north of the Stuyvesant apartment complex where Mr. Davis, the bookish son of an accountant and homemaker, grew up. He finished near the top of his class at Stuyvesant High School, a prestigious public school, and gained acceptance to Yale's exclusive directed studies program for 125 of its most ambitious freshmen.
Mr. Davis moved on to Yale Law School, and he approached graduation unsure about his plans. His college and law school classmate Tom A. Bernstein, who came from a prominent New York family, introduced him to Bernard D. Fischman, a partner at the law firm Shea & Gould.
Mr. Fischman had one word for him: utilities.
He told Mr. Davis that utilities industry law was not a crowded field and, given his brains, he would stand out. He suggested that Mr. Davis interview at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae.
Mr. Davis joined LeBoeuf in 1977, a time of seismic changes in the energy industry, and he built a thriving business. It was a career that played to Mr. Davis's strengths, requiring a mastery of complex tax regimes and a thicket of state and federal regulations. He married Loretta K. Davis, a fellow lawyer who would later become town justice in Tuxedo, N.Y., outside Tuxedo Park, the stone-gated community where the two lived. Together, they raised three children.
During the boom-boom late 1980s, Mr. Davis took a three-year hiatus from the law. In 1988, he saw an opportunity for big profits when the Public Service Company of New Hampshire went bankrupt.
Martin J. Whitman, the value investor who is now chairman of Third Avenue Management, recruited him into the deal. Together they made a run at the utility, leading a group that bought up Public Service Company bonds at a deep discount. They then used their expertise to influence the company's reorganization, and the group made a rich return.
Many corporate lawyers would have jettisoned their legal practices after getting a taste of deal-making, but Mr. Davis preferred the role of trusted legal adviser to that of sharp-elbowed distressed-debt investor.
Back at LeBoeuf, he rose quickly. In 1999, the firm elected him co-chairman, chosen to lead not for his charisma and connections, but for his judgment and intellect.
He could also show compassion. When Shea & Gould dissolved amid partner disputes in 1994, Mr. Fischman, by then nearly 80 and past his prime, needed a place to hang his hat. Mr. Davis gave jobs to him and his partner, Milton S. Gould.
Away from the office, Mr. Davis went through a profound change a decade ago. In 2001, after 24 years of marriage, Mr. Davis separated from his wife and came out as gay. He has been in a long-term relationship with another man for the last 10 years.
"Steve dealt with this part of his personal life with grace and courage," said Mr. Bernstein, his Yale classmate and co-founder of Chelsea Piers, the sports and entertainment complex. "I've known him for over 40 years, and to me, he's the same Steve Davis."
When Mr. Davis became sole chairman of LeBoeuf & Lamb in 2004, he sought to broaden the firm's business beyond its solid if stodgy specialties in insurance and utilities law. To plug gaps, he embraced a growing legal industry trend now seen as a major cause of Dewey's decline - the poaching of partners from rivals by offering them large guaranteed contracts.
He made his mark quickly. During his first year in charge, he recruited Ralph C. Ferrara, a former top lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, away from Debevoise & Plimpton. LeBoeuf caused a stir in the corporate law world by agreeing to pay Mr. Ferrara about $2 million a year and assuming responsibility for his pension of roughly $15 million.
Mr. Ferrara's hiring turned out to be a coup for LeBoeuf. It raised the firm's profile in Washington, where Mr. Ferrara was based, giving it a strong foothold in defending S.E.C. enforcement cases and securities class action lawsuits.
"Steve had early, great success with Ralph's hiring," said a managing partner at a big law firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. "And what can happen when you have an early success is that it can give you a false sense confidence about what you're capable of doing."
From 2004 to 2007, LeBoeuf had a great run under Mr. Davis, but he became convinced the firm needed to be bigger and more global.
He set his sights on a merger, but first had to deal with a threat to his leadership. The co-heads of the firm's corporate department, Alexander M. Dye and John M. Schwolsky, mounted a bid to replace him. Mr. Dye and Mr. Schwolsky were forced out of their management posts after Mr. Davis confronted them with embarrassing internal e-mails they had written.
Having consolidated his power, Mr. Davis approached Dewey Ballantine, a century-old establishment firm of a similar size. Over breakfast at Michael's restaurant, a power scene in Midtown, Mr. Davis pitched Dewey's chairman, Morton A. Pierce, on combining to create one of New York's largest firms with the heft to compete internationally.
Though Dewey's brand was powerful, its finances were anything but. The previous year, a collapsed merger with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe had destabilized the firm. Dewey's profits were plummeting and it had considerable debt.
Yet Mr. Davis craved Dewey's mergers practice, a weak spot for LeBoeuf. He was also enamored with Dewey's white-shoe pedigree. LeBoeuf (pronounced le-buff) did not exactly roll off the tongue, but Dewey was a name upon which you could build a world-class firm.
His goal, he would say, was to become the next Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom or Latham & Watkins, two profitable large firms with strong international networks. Together, LeBoeuf and Dewey created a firm with offices in 26 countries and $1 billion in revenue that Mr. Davis thought had the global reach and diverse practice to withstand a recession.
It did not. The merger, which closed in October 2007, was reached as credit markets were beginning to seize up. Less than a year later, the financial crisis would cripple the international economy. To keep important partners from leaving, Mr. Davis had handed out dozens of four-year contracts, creating onerous compensation commitments.
Mr. Davis had also projected a 25 percent increase in partner pay in 2008 over 2007, according to a January 2009 internal memo sent from Mr. Davis to the partners. Instead, Dewey's profit in 2008 dropped 15 percent. "In hindsight, our 2008 targets proved to be overly optimistic," Mr. Davis wrote.
The January 2009 memo chafed some partners in another respect. The executive committee - the 24 senior partners who oversaw the management of the firm alongside Mr. Davis - had established a bonus pool to reward top-producing partners in 2008. Many of those top producers sat on the executive committee.
"We were in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Depression and these guys were reserving bonuses for themselves," said a former junior partner. "Whatever happened to shared sacrifice?"
A shared sacrifice ethos did not exist at Dewey. Mr. Davis subscribed to a "barbell" compensation system. On one end were the so-called rainmakers with big books of business who were lavished with multimillion-dollar, multiyear guarantees. Dewey's stars were paid as much as $10 million a year. (Mr. Davis himself earned about $4 million a year, but cut his 2011 salary to $300,000.)
On the other end of the barbell were partners who worked on the court cases and deals brought in by the rainmakers. These partners were paid about $300,000, creating a dynamic where the highest-paid partners were making 30 times more than the most junior ones.
At Skadden, by comparison, the highest-paid partner makes no more than five times the lower-paid ones. One former partner called the arrangement "something closer to feudalism than a true partnership."
After struggling through the financial crisis and deep recession - and piling up tens of millions of dollars more in I.O.U.'s for existing partners - Mr. Davis was primed to execute his growth strategy.
Many partners said they remained largely oblivious to Dewey's financial woes. Distracted by demanding legal practices, they placed their faith in Mr. Davis. Working closely with Mr. Davis was Stephen DiCarmine, a nonpracticing lawyer who served as Dewey's longtime executive director. "The Steves," as they were known by many inside the firm, had broad authority over management and partner pay.
Mr. Davis again set rosy projections for 2011, forecasting an 11 percent increase in earnings. Some of those profits, Mr. Davis hoped, would come courtesy of a new round of lateral hires. He embarked on a recruiting spree, recruiting 37 new partners from other firms last year.
Rising expenses and an uneven economic recovery crimped the firm's profit. At a tense partner meeting in October, Mr. Davis said that 100 of the firm's 300 partners had guarantees. After being pressed, he said he did not know the total dollar amount in back pay owed to them. The answer was about $100 million.
"Steve believed that the way to dig the firm out of its hole was to hire more laterals who could generate more business," said a Dewey partner. "But the hole got too deep and everyone ran for the exits."
Among the first big defections was a 12-person team led by Mr. Dye and Mr. Schwolsky, the pair that had tried to remove Mr. Davis years before. Their departures had a snowball effect that devastated the firm.
One partner who had come on board recently said he blamed himself for not asking more questions about the firm's financial state. He also blames Dewey's executive committee for a lack of oversight. But he says the former chairman deserves the most blame.
"Maybe we were all passengers on a ship of fools," he said. "But Steve Davis was the captain of that ship."
An earlier version of this post misstated the town where Loretta K. Davis is town justice as Tuxedo Park, rather than Tuxedo.

HEADLINE: Questions Over Fees to Pilots Guiding Ships in San Francisco

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Since the height of the Gold Rush, the San Francisco Bar Pilots have been guiding large vessels from the Pacific in and out of the harbors here and further inland, knowing as only they did the vagaries of the bay's currents, its hidden shoals and every foggy channel's twist and turn. The ships steadily grew larger just as the pilots' salaries did, standing at $451,336 last year.
These days, though, the pilots, who are regulated by the state and number only 57, are having a hard time navigating the treacherous waters of Sacramento. A bill that would have increased piloting rates and pilots' wages was soundly defeated last year; the fate of another bill that would raise the fees for the largest of the ships now appears bleak. 
A previously obscure group of workers, overseen by an even more obscure state commission, is now attracting unwanted attention in the state capital for its high compensation, work schedule and perks. In normally laid-back committee hearings, at least one official delivered an emotional plea in favor of the bar pilots.
K. Michael Miller, the president of the commission that oversees the pilots, said he was going to be a ''stand-up guy'' and ''ruffle some feathers'' before defending the pilots' practice of flying business class on training trips to France instead of economy, which he called ''pretzel class.''
The pilots and their supporters say they are being vilified in a well-orchestrated campaign by shipowners. They say they are asking for the rate increase only to ensure the safety of Northern California's harbors as they pilot bigger and bigger ships.
''That's my utmost goal, and that's what I'm all about,'' Capt. Bruce Horton, the group's leader, said in an interview in his office, which overlooks San Francisco Bay.
Critics, however, say the pilots are motivated only by greed. After failing to win across-the-board increases last year, the pilots are back asking for a smaller one this year despite the hard economic times, the critics say.
Under state law, bar pilots must take command of an incoming large vessel about 12 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge, beyond the treacherous sand bar that gives them their title.
Out in the open ocean, the bar pilots board the vessel by climbing up a rope ladder. Giving directions to the vessel's crew and later to tugboat pilots, they steer the ship into San Francisco Bay, where most ships dock at the Port of Oakland. Bar pilots also guide ships east into San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay and up the Sacramento River. Last year, ships on average paid nearly $12,000 per round trip to the bar pilots.
There have been pilots at ports all over the world for centuries. In the United States, the first Congress gave states the right in 1789 to regulate pilots in their waters, according to the American Pilots' Association in Washington.
''Pilots that come aboard ships are talked about in the Bible and the Laws of Oleron from the Dark Ages,'' said Paul G. Kirchner, the association's executive director, referring to the 12th-century French maritime code.
Bar pilots -- who typically accumulate years of experience as tugboat pilots or captains of cargo ships before training to become bar pilots -- represent the ''pinnacle of the mariner profession'' and deserve their compensation, Mr. Kirchner said.
Experts say it is difficult to compare the San Francisco bar pilots' compensation with their counterparts at other large ports because wages are not made public in many states. But Mr. Kirchner said the pilots here are ''probably in the upper half, but there are plenty of groups that make more than that.''
The pilots say their priority is public safety; they can resist pressure from shipowners to enter a harbor if they believe the conditions are unsafe.
''We like to be regulated,'' Captain Horton said.
But the state has gotten tougher on the pilots since a cargo ship guided by one of them hit the Bay Bridge in 2007, causing a huge oil spill. The authorities determined that the accident was partly the result of the prescription medication that the pilot had been taking.
''They went largely without oversight until the recent past few years,'' said Alyson Huber, a Democratic assemblywoman who is investigating the state commission that oversees the pilots. ''They have been around since the 1800s, but most legislators didn't even know they existed.''
State auditors found that the commission did a poor job licensing pilots and investigating potential safety violations. They also described as a possible ''misuse of state resources'' the commission's policy of allowing bar pilots to fly business class to training programs in France and Maryland.
Despite the reprimand, the pilots flew business class to France last year even as they asked for a rate increase, which the Legislature has to approve.
This year, the pilots and their supporters in the Legislature presented a bill that would require owners of ships longer than 1,115 feet to pay an extra cost, amounting to half a pilot's fee. A second pilot, they say, is needed to carry the sensitive equipment required to navigate those vessels safely.
Mike Jacob, vice president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, which represents shipowners, says the request is a hidden rate hike. Various agricultural and business organizations are also opposing the increase, saying it would ultimately be passed on to consumers.
Mr. Jacob said that the larger ships did require an extra pilot, but that the cost should be part of the service currently provided by the pilots.
''This has nothing to do with safety,'' he said. ''It has everything to do with their compensation.''
Like many critics, Mr. Jacob said that because of cozy ties with regulators, the pilots have been able to maintain a monopoly. Though regulated by the state, the pilots are considered independent contractors who evenly split total profits among themselves.
''They have a natural internal incentive to have few guys working because they get paid more,'' Mr. Jacob said.
The bar pilots deny that they keep their numbers intentionally low. But state officials said the pilots frequently worked longer hours than allowed, suggesting that more pilots were needed.
''This is an entirely appropriate subject to look into,'' said John Logan, an expert on labor at San Francisco State University. ''Things have changed in the last couple of years, but there still needs to be greater oversight.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Ex-Leader Honored As Scholar

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
The Library of Congress will award the $1 million John W. Kluge Prize for lifetime intellectual achievement in the humanities and social sciences to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who had a distinguished international career as a scholar before twice being elected president of Brazil. An official announcement will be made in Washington on Monday, with an awards ceremony there on July 10.
In a citation Mr. Cardoso, who is 80 and lives in Sao Paulo, is described as ''a scholar of enormous intellectual energy'' and praised for his ''deeply original analysis of the interplay among political, economic and social processes.'' The citation also notes that ''throughout his life Cardoso has asked difficult questions and often defied conventional wisdom'' in his wide-ranging research and writing. 
''In purely scholarly and academic terms he has to be considered the outstanding political scientist in late-20th-century Latin America,'' said James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress. ''It's not just that he's the first person with a personal political career of consequence to win this award, it's that he is also a full representative of what we call a social scientist. If you want to make an American comparison, he is like Jefferson, playing a key role in building a democracy on a scholarly foundation.''
Brazil has become the world's sixth largest economy, having recently passed Britain and Italy, and has a dynamic and growing middle class, numbering more than 100 million. As president from 1995 through 2002 Mr. Cardoso was the primary architect of that rise. He presided over the elimination of hyperinflation and initiated sweeping social investment and income redistribution programs, which his two successors have extended and deepened.
''I was always preparing myself to understand society and macroeconomics, so of course when I had the chance to become president, I tried to apply that knowledge,'' Mr. Cardoso said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo, where he now oversees the first presidential library in Brazil and a research institution that bears his name. ''I didn't plan it that way, but the concern, the preoccupation with how to construct a decent society was always there.''
Though not awarded annually, the Kluge Prize, first given in 2003 and last granted in 2008, is a sort of Nobel Prize for achievement in the humanities and social sciences, categories the Nobel overlooks. Previous recipients include the Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, the American historian John Hope Franklin, the Chinese-born expert on Confucianism Yu Ying-shih and the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur.
Mr. Cardoso's interests are expansive and thus harder to categorize. He trained as a sociologist, specializing in race relations and the impact of slavery on Brazilian society, and taught that subject for many years, but many of his more than 20 books and 100-plus scholarly articles also deal with economics and political science.
''He's unusual for a political figure in that before he was elected president of Brazil, he was also very active in the International Political Science Association,'' said Alfred Stepan, a Brazil expert at Columbia University who has known Mr. Cardoso since the 1960s. ''He's also taught at Cambridge, the Sorbonne, and he came many times to Princeton, Yale and Columbia'' as a visiting scholar.
After leaving office, named the best president in Brazil's history in a poll conducted as he was departing, Mr. Cardoso joined Brown University as a professor at large. In 2008 the British magazine Prospect designated him one of the world's top 100 intellectuals, and in 2009 Foreign Policy magazine placed him 11th on its list of top 100 global thinkers.
Mr. Cardoso's academic career in Brazil was cut short when a military dictatorship seized power in 1964, eventually forcing him into exile in Chile, France and the United States. After returning in the 1970s he became active in politics, serving as a senator for nearly a decade and as foreign minister and finance minister before being elected president.
Mr. Cardoso is probably best known as co-writer of the influential 1969 book ''Dependency and Development in Latin America,'' which detected in the early glimmerings of globalization new opportunities for growth in countries considered to be on the periphery of world affairs. But he said the book he considered ''most solid'' is ''Capitalism and Slavery in Southern Brazil,'' an examination of how racially based servitude contributed directly to Brazil's economic and social backwardness.
''He is a man who profoundly studied Brazil before governing it, taking part in all of the important intellectual debates of his time, never letting himself be limited by any one theory,'' said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. ''He entered politics not for traditional reasons, but for reasons of values and because he was prohibited from doing what he was originally trained to do.''

HEADLINE: Vermont Towns Have an Image, and They Say Dollar Stores Aren't Part of It

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
CHESTER, Vt. -- Almost two decades after the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the entire state of Vermont on its list of endangered sites, citing big-box developments as a threat to its signature greenness, towns like this one are now sizing up a new interloper: the chain dollar store.
While Wal-Mart has managed to open only four stores in Vermont and Target still has none, more than two dozen Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores have cropped up around the state. All three companies are thriving in the bad economy -- between them, they have more than 20,000 outlets nationwide, selling everything from dog treats to stain remover and jeans to pool toys. Their spread through Vermont, with its famously strict land-use laws, has caught chain-store opponents off guard.
Shawn Cunningham, a resident here in Chester who is fighting Dollar General's plan to open down the street from the town common, said that since dollar stores tend to be much smaller than big-box stores, they are often not barred by local zoning rules meant to keep sprawl in check. 
''It's not like you're bringing in a 100,000-square-foot supercenter,'' said Mr. Cunningham, who started a group, Smart Growth Chester, to fight the Dollar General proposal.
So far, the battle has been in vain; the town's Development Review Board narrowly voted last month to let Dollar General open a 9,100-square-foot store on South Main Street as long as it agreed to 35 conditions, including that it use wood clapboard siding and keep its shopping carts inside.
The project could still be scuttled under Act 250, a state law that empowers regional boards to reject development based on environmental, aesthetic and other criteria. Mr. Cunningham said his group would also file an appeal with the environmental division of Vermont Superior Court.
Supporters of Dollar General's plan to open in Chester -- a town in rural southern Vermont, near the New Hampshire border -- say that the store would expand the tax base and keep residents from having to drive to larger towns for whatever Chester's lone grocery store does not provide.
But Mr. Cunningham and other opponents say that the Dollar General, which has opened 15 stores in Vermont in recent years, including one in Springfield, less than eight miles away, will be the beginning of the end for what might best be described as Chester's Vermontiness. They theorize that second-home owners will abandon the town rather than abide a discount chain store, tourists in search of a bucolic escape will avoid it and Lisai's Market, the beloved local grocery store, will be forced out of business.
''People come here and stay at the inns and eat at the restaurants not because we have Disney World but because we have Chester,'' said Claudio Veliz, an architect who moved here from New York. ''That is the hull of our boat, and Dollar General wants to put its fist right through the hull.''
Citizen groups have also opposed dollar stores in other states, including in New Hampshire, New Mexico, California and Indiana. But such battles can be particularly trenchant in Vermont, with its tourism-dependent economy and fierce protection of its landscape. In Franklin County, opponents fought a proposed Wal-Mart for almost 20 years until the Vermont Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of the project last summer.
Chester, with 3,000 residents, has a number of homegrown businesses, many located in Victorian houses along Main Street. But there is little in the way of generic commercial architecture here -- a selling point that drew residents like Mr. Veliz and Mr. Cunningham, who moved his family here from Baltimore in 2004.
''Most of the people in Chester now are people who have come from someplace else,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''It's like a lot of Vermont. Why come to a place like this only to have it turn into the kind of place you were trying to leave?''
Nodding to that concern, the Development Review Board is requiring Dollar General to use certain materials -- the wood clapboard siding, for example, instead of a vinyl alternative that the company wanted. Dollar General on its own proposed a building with a peaked roof, as well as a cupola and a faux hayloft door.
In their decision approving the project, board members noted that a retail store was an ''allowed use'' in the part of town where Dollar General wants to open. They also said that, by using wood siding, the store would meet a zoning requirement that new buildings ''adhere harmoniously to the overall New England architectural appearance'' of the town.
Tawn Earnest, a spokeswoman for Dollar General, said the company had a long history in small towns and rural communities, often serving customers who have few retail options. Opposition to Dollar General, which is based in Goodlettsville, Tenn., is ''a rare exception,'' Ms. Earnest said, adding, ''We have been very thoughtful in the placement and design of the store to benefit Chester.''
Paul Bruhn, executive director of the Preservation Trust of Vermont, said opposition to dollar stores has sprung up in at least four other towns in the state. Mr. Bruhn's group, which seeks to protect what it calls ''the essential character of Vermont,'' has been tracking the spread of dollar stores since 2010; it provides grant money to citizens' groups that oppose them, including Mr. Cunningham's.
''The dollar stores have proliferated in a way that seems a little extreme,'' Mr. Bruhn said. ''One of the things I think is crucial for Vermont, in terms of maintaining this very special brand that we have, is we don't want to look like Anywhere, U.S.A. And homegrown businesses are a crucial piece of that.''
The spread of dollar stores has come during a period of decline of the general store, a Vermont institution that in many towns served as a meeting place and all-purpose emporium. This week, the Barnard General Store, not far from Chester, closed after 180 years. Its owners cited the twin blows of Tropical Storm Irene, which badly flooded parts of the state last summer, and a nearly snowless winter that kept skiers away.
Lonnie Lisai, whose family owns Lisai's Market, said he was already strategizing about how to survive if the Dollar General store opens. A lunchtime salad bar, a selection of fancy cheeses and lower-cost alternatives to popular brands are in the offing, he said.
''If you pay a buck over at Dollar General and you're going to pay a buck eighty-nine here, it's, boy, what do you tell the customer?'' Mr. Lisai said. ''I can't compete. And hopefully they'll understand that.''

HEADLINE: A TV Schedule in the Hands of Whoever Holds the Remote

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
This week, when they ring the bell on the television upfronts, the annual orgy of advertising buying, I hope the industry isn't counting on my house to lift ratings.
So far in the month of May, our household has watched exactly two minutes and one second of live television. NBC's broadcast of ''the most exciting two minutes in sports,'' as the Kentucky Derby is described, was epic, unfurling on the big flat panel we finally bought. But I doubt our spasm of live viewing is enough to keep the television business in business.
And it wasn't an anomaly. In April, our sum total of live viewing -- the building block of the upfront -- came during CBS's broadcast of the Masters. Even then, I was more riveted by the iPad app in my lap, selecting players and holes to follow.
It's an apt metaphor. When it comes to the traditional screen that families gather around, live television is competing against a growing array of self-selected content. Given the amount of high-quality shows idling in my DVR and on-demand queue, channel surfing for live television seems very last century. And our television is Web-enabled, so a vast treasure of other goodies awaits from Netflix, Hulu Plus and Apple TV. 
(Our house is part of a rapidly growing trend: online viewing is up more than 46 percent in just the last year, according to the media buying firm Horizon Media. And as my colleague Bill Carter noted, live ratings for network programs have declined for 14 consecutive quarters, with audiences bolting in record numbers this spring.)
Outside of the professional football season or some breaking national news event, the television at our house has become uncoupled from the commercial-driven environment that drives the broadcast and cable business. We haven't cut the cord so much as kinked it in a way that commercials rarely sneak through.
I continue to be a fan of (some) network television products; I just don't consume them as they're broadcast.
I'm part of the cult of ''Community,'' but I motor through several episodes on Hulu Plus when I am feeling the need to spend some quality time with Abed. I'm a frantic fan of ''Modern Family,'' but this season, fresh episodes were broadcast so sporadically that I just set the DVR to harvest the new ones. And sure, I like to get tucked in by Stephen Colbert, but I don't go to bed until 1 a.m., so I make sure he is waiting for me in the virtual video library controlled by the remote on my night stand.
There used to be some intellectual cachet in sniffing that you didn't watch television, but that time is past. Both premium and basic cable churn out so many remarkable goodies that can be recorded or consumed on demand -- ''Archer,'' ''Girls,'' ''Game of Thrones,'' ''The Killing'' and ''Louie,'' to name just a few -- that it feels like a sucker's game just to settle for sponsor-infested spoon-feeding. Then again, if the business model producing some of that yummy programming dries up, the shows might go away as well.
For half a century, signals came over the public airwaves, and we gathered around the glowing appliance in groups at preordained times. Cable created a second wave of choice and split the model into paid and unpaid streams.
Now, DVR penetration will approach 50 percent of American homes next year, while half of American homes already have video on demand. With the Web offering alternatives as well, the programming controls have been reversed: we watch what we want, when we want to watch, and by the way, we aren't going to watch much in the way of commercials.
My house is hardly the bleeding edge: Nielsen estimates that there will be 350 million Web-enabled television devices sold worldwide in 2015.
And it isn't just the early adopters that legacy television has to be concerned about: there is a whole cohort of consumers on the way who are nonadopters of television as we have historically conceived it. My 15-year-old has a television in her room, but it's not even on the cable-broadcast grid; it is wired instead to a Web-enabled Wii. Like the laptop and smartphone that she never seems to be without, the television is just one more Web-enabled portal for content she controls.
Other significant trends are under way. As the workplace has followed people home through a variety of devices that keep them virtually tethered to their desks, appointment viewing has given way to setting up the next day's appointments. And social media, Web news and e-mail seem far more urgent than an amusing show in the 9 p.m. slot.
Even so-called event programming like ''American Idol'' is losing steam -- that show's ratings are down 30 percent -- in part because of overexposure and in part because people are less patient with the formula of a cliffhanger interrupted by a thicket of commercials. Save the drumroll; I'll watch a clip of the winner in the morning.
But the upfronts nevertheless continue to rumble along. According to estimates reported by Reuters, in the coming week the big four broadcast networks and the CW will book some $9 billion in advertising revenue, with the big four up 2 to 4 percent from last year. And cable networks, which surpassed broadcasters for the first time last year in total advertising booked during the upfronts, are expecting a payday of more than $9.6 billion, an increase of 4 to 6 percent.
Part of what keeps legacy television in the game is that it is the last refuge of mass and reach. For retailers who want to flag a sale or an entertainment company with a weekend movie opening, a commercial on a broadcast network or a highly rated cable station can still hammer a message into a lot of noggins. In this targeted age, it's breathtakingly inefficient -- you pay to reach everyone, even the millions not in the desired age group -- but making a big television buy is a kind of comfort food, easy and familiar.
Yet by losing audience, networks and cable stations have been able to force advertisers to buy more commercials to reach the number of viewers that they want.
''They have an interesting business model predicated on losing viewers,'' observed Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at Horizon Media. ''It can't last forever.''
At some point, the laws of both gravity and economics will begin to pull down the upfronts, and with them, the fundamentals of the television business. Jeff Gaspin, who used to head entertainment at NBC, told Bill Carter that he and his son recently decided to catch up on a particular series and so assembled episodes from a variety of sources -- iTunes, Netflix and the DVR. They saw all the past episodes in time to watch the final one live on AMC but found that commercials interrupted their experience.
So what show demonstrated to the former television executive that the old way of watching television was losing relevance?
''The Walking Dead.''

 BODY:
The Web site of Representative Daniel Webster, Republican of Florida, instructs visitors to click on a link for ''Census data for the 8th district'' to learn about the area's economy, businesses, income, employment, homeownership and other important features. And yet, on Wednesday, Mr. Webster declared that the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- the source for much of that data -- is an unconstitutional breach of privacy. 
He then proposed an amendment to the bureau's 2013 appropriation to forbid any money from being spent on the survey; the amendment was passed by most House Republicans and four Democrats.
This is know-nothingness at a new level. The American Community Survey, which gives annual updates of Americans' economic, demographic and housing characteristics, is widely considered a vital tool for business decision makers. It is also a bipartisan creation. First used in 2005, it is a more timely and accurate way to ask questions that used to be posed on the ''long form'' decennial census. Indeed, in 2006, Republican Congressional staff members participated in efforts to promote the survey under the slogan ''Better Data for Better Decisions.''
But that was then. Last week, 224 Republicans and 23 Democrats voted to cut the bureau's 2013 budget to $855 million, $88 million below last year's total and $116 million below the White House's request. On top of ending the American Community Survey, the truncated budget would cripple the Economic Census -- a survey of nearly five million businesses, conducted every five years, that is the foundation for economywide statistics on growth, inflation, productivity and consumer spending.
The survey cuts would reduce understanding about what is happening in the economy and the effectiveness of business and government policy. Lack of information can lead to paralysis and costly mistakes. When Republicans proposed similar cuts last year, even the deficit hawks at the United States Chamber of Commerce opposed them.
The White House is opposed to the cuts and the Senate will soon have a chance to reject them when it takes up the appropriation bill. It should.

HEADLINE: Ex-Leader's Detention Tests Mongolia's Budding Democracy

BYLINE: By DAN LEVIN

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Mongolia's previous president has spent more than a week on a hunger strike, protesting a detention that he says is aimed at preventing him from running in the country's coming parliamentary election.
With the health of Nambaryn Enkhbayar, the former president, deteriorating rapidly, the government is holding firm, throwing Mongolia's young democracy into turmoil in a crisis freighted by dueling accusations of corruption and human rights abuses.
''This is likely to open a Pandora's box,'' said Mark C. Minton, a former American ambassador to Mongolia. ''It will do no good for Mongolia's reputation and due process or rule of law, which is already shallowly rooted.''
In an eerie echo of a political protest in Ukraine, Mr. Enkhbayar, who served as prime minister before leading the country as president for four years until 2009, has refused to cooperate with his interrogators, who barred his lawyers during the questioning. The confrontation intensified when Mr. Enkhbayar, 53, stopped eating and drinking after a local court extended his detention until the eve of the June 28 parliamentary election. 
The drama began one evening last month when men from Mongolia's anticorruption agency dragged Mr. Enkhbayar from his car in front of his parents' home in the capital, Ulan Bator, and tried to arrest him. After his bodyguard intervened and the attempt failed, hundreds of police officers raided the house at dawn the next morning, witnesses say, and hauled the former president, shoeless and with a bag over his head, to jail. All of it was captured on live television.
Mongolia, a country with just three million people but abundant natural resources wedged between China and Russia, has been widely lauded by American officials as a bastion of democracy in a region where the rule of law and due process are rare.
That reputation is now being called into question. The government and its supporters see the jailing of Mr. Enkhbayar on corruption allegations as long-overdue justice for a man they say enriched himself and his family at the country's expense. Mr. Enkhbayar's allies say his detention is a naked attempt by the government to vanquish a political foe and a dangerous regression to practices honed during the Soviet era, which ended two decades ago.
''This is a purge,'' his son Batshugar Enkhbayar, 25, an American-educated investment banker, said in a telephone interview. ''The true motivation is purely to keep him away from the election and remove him from politics.''
The government, headed by Mr. Enkhbayar's rival, President Tsakhia Elbegdorj, has remained largely silent on the matter.
Much is at stake in the parliamentary election, whose outcome will guide the exploitation of Mongolia's vast deposits of coal, copper, uranium and gold. The country's economy is booming as global demand soars.
But most Mongolians have yet to benefit from this wealth. In the capital, thousands of herders who left the countryside in recent years live in slums, while the elite drive sports utility vehicles along its crumbling streets and shop at Louis Vuitton and Armani stores.
Mining is a major source of contention for Mongolians, many of whom bristle at deals giving multinational corporations much of the spoils. Ivanhoe Mines of Canada, for example, owns a 66 percent stake in the Oyu Tolgoi mine, one of the world's largest deposits of copper and gold. Mr. Enkhbayar was campaigning in opposition to that deal.
Public frustration over corruption and poverty has a history of turning violent in Mongolia. Hundreds rioted during the last parliamentary elections four years ago when the leader of the Democratic Party, Mr. Elbegdorj, accused Mr. Enkhbayar's government of voter fraud.
Mr. Elbegdorj was swept into power the next year, and the mutual enmity has only grown. After his defeat, Mr. Enkhbayar founded the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which is expected to play kingmaker after the parliamentary election.
So when Mongolia's Independent Agency Against Corruption showed up last month forcefully demanding to question Mr. Enkhbayar, his supporters cried foul. The allegations, which relate to his time in office, include the purchase of a hotel and an accusation that he misdirected donations intended for a Buddhist monastery. Some complaints appear to be rather picayune, including suggestions that he used his authority to decrease a customs duty on the shipment to South Korea of eight copies of a book he had written.
To fight the allegations, Mr. Enkhbayar's family has used its connections and media savvy to raise global attention, staging candlelight vigils at the prison gates and hiring a powerful legal team. One of Mr. Enkhbayar's lawyers is Peter Goldsmith, a former British attorney general and a member of the House of Lords, who visited Mongolia but was not allowed to see his client. He called the accusations ''insubstantial, stale and petty.''
Just as troubling, Mr. Goldsmith said, are Mr. Enkhbayar's detention without formal charge and the mistreatment of his supporters. Mr. Enkhbayar's party secretary was harassed after being called into a police station, and another party member was detained for collecting petition signatures, Mr. Goldsmith said.
''Everyone had hoped Mongolia had broken away from the Soviet chain,'' he said in a phone interview. ''But this is Soviet stuff.''
The saga surrounding Mr. Enkhbayar is similar, in the accusations and the protest, to the recent controversy in another erstwhile Soviet dominion, Ukraine. Last year, former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko was convicted of abuse of power and sentenced to prison in a case that critics say was driven by the political motives of her main rival, Ukraine's president. To protest her imprisonment, which has drawn widespread international criticism, Ms. Tymoshenko began a hunger strike in April, agreeing to end her 20-day fast only after being transferred to a hospital.
Mr. Enkhbayar's supporters have used his fast to highlight what they perceive to be evidence of government malfeasance. They are particularly suspicious of Bat Khurts, whom President Elbegdorj appointed deputy director of the anticorruption agency last year. A former director of Mongolia's top spy agency, Mr. Khurts was arrested in Britain in 2010 in connection with the drugging and kidnapping of a Mongolian dissident seven years earlier.
According to the European arrest warrant, Mr. Khurts drove the kidnapped dissident from France to Berlin, where the man was trundled onto a Mongolian Airlines flight to Ulan Bator and forcibly repatriated. A British court extradited Mr. Khurts to Germany, where he was imprisoned. He was released last year.
After he began his hunger strike, Mr. Enkhbayar was moved to a hospital, but his family has been allowed to see him only briefly. ''He's very weak,'' his son Batshugar said. The last time he saw his father, he said, a pair of interrogators sat in the room, one videotaping and the other writing down the conversation. The visit lasted 20 minutes.
Still, Mr. Enkhbayar's hunger strike, said Mr. Minton, the former American ambassador, has left Mongolia's government looking confused and uncoordinated. ''They got a lot more than they bargained for,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Great-Grandfather Was a First-Class Bamboozler

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
A DISPOSITION TO BE RICH
How a Small-Town Pastor's Son Ruined an American President, Brought on a Wall Street Crash, and Made Himself the Best-Hated Man in the United States
By Geoffrey C. Ward
Illustrated. 418 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95
After Ferdinand De Wilton Ward Jr. became notorious as a Gilded Age financial schemer of rare weaselly ingenuity, his picture appeared in a manual of phrenology. The shape of his ''low-top head, very broad from side to side,'' was said to explain why Ward had shown the ''Secretiveness, Cunning, Acquisitiveness, Destructiveness'' to bilk investors, shame and bankrupt a former president and try to kidnap his own son.
Within the large Ward clan Ferdinand remains ''the family sociopath,'' although each of his parents was a candidate for that distinction. It took a great-grandson of Ferdinand's, the prizewinning historian Geoffrey C. Ward, to write the scandal-filled but eminently fair book that airs this dirty laundry. 
Geoffrey Ward has reason for backhanded pride when it comes to his great-grandfather's malfeasance. Ferdinand was not just any crook; he created a Ponzi scheme before Charles Ponzi was even born. He can legitimately be called the Bernard Madoff of his time, and he had the public infamy and prison sentence to prove it. Ferd, as he was known, was incarcerated at both the Ludlow Street Jail and the Tombs in New York, but it was not until he reached Sing Sing that his gifts as a con man really reached their peak. Thanks to well-placed bribes he got a nicer-than-average cell and the privilege of wearing a straw hat, not a striped one.
Before the arrival of this book, ''A Disposition to Be Rich,'' which takes its title from Ferd's mother's excuse for his problems, not much was written directly about Ward's chicanery. There are several reasons. His illicit financial dealings were best known as a sad footnote to the Ulysses S. Grant story, since Grant became Ward's woefully ill-informed partner in the firm of Grant & Ward. (Specialty: securities rehypothecating, or ''pledging the same paper over and over again to borrow money, paying the interest on one loan out of the principal for the next, hoping that things would somehow balance out one day.''
And the Panic of 1884, which was prompted in part by the collapse of banks exploited by Grant & Ward, had other causes, among them the depletion of European gold reserves. The eloquent bursts of fury at Grant & Ward from Mark Twain, Grant's friend and protector, are better remembered than the misdeeds that provoked them. Twain spoke of cursing Ward ''with all the profanity known to the one language I am acquainted with,'' as well as ''odds and ends of profanity drawn from the other two languages of which I have a limited knowledge.''
Finally there was little firsthand evidence of the Ward story. A trunk full of Ferd's Sing Sing papers has been in Geoffrey Ward's possession since 1965, but it took him years to examine the letters and family memorabilia inside. Mr. Ward has been understandably slow to tackle this subject. He has also been busy writing ''The Civil War'' with Ken and Ric Burns and winning the National Book Critics Circle Award for ''A First-Class Temperament,'' his biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He has written many other books, some with Ken Burns, on subjects ranging from baseball to tigers.
But ''A Disposition to Be Rich'' is a special accomplishment. It is a most peculiar labor of love. It begins by describing the fractious lives of Ferd's parents, the chronically embattled clergyman Ferdinand De Wilton Ward Sr. and his gloomy wife, Jane Shaw Ward. First as missionaries in India, then as part of a combative Presbyterian faction in Geneseo, N.Y., these parents helped set the stage for their youngest son's misdeeds. Ferd's father seems never to have gracefully given up on a feud if he could keep fighting. His mother rued the fact that she had ever borne children and specialized in writing guilt-provoking letters about her impecuniousness. As for these parents' attitude toward Ferd, ''both were right to be worried about his conscience,'' Mr. Ward writes in this book. ''It would eventually become clear that he had none.''
Born in 1851, Ferd grew up in his mother's depressive shadow. Later he developed such fine penmanship that he became a secretary to S. Hastings Grant. This opened the door to a business relationship with the Grant family and then to the general.
And at 26 he approached James D. Fish, president of the Marine Bank, an institution that Ferd's dishonest borrowing would later destroy. Ferd solicited Fish's help as a mentor and collaborator.
Ferd projected signs of great prosperity, used his extravagance as a lure for investors and had the charm to keep them from withdrawing funds. He once appeared, uninvited, at the home of General Grant late at night, knowing that Grant's guests included William H. Vanderbilt and others Ferd wanted to impress. The reason for the late-night call, he said, was to present Grant with the profits from an investment that had supposedly tripled during the course of the business day. On a similarly tricky occasion an investor tried to withdraw $50,000 from Ferd's firm, only to have Ferd offer him $250,000, claiming that the man's money had quintupled in the space of six months. The man was mollified, and the nonexistent $250,000 was reinvested. Grant & Ward could then continue to bamboozle. As the financier Henry Clews put it, ''It is marvelous how the idea of large profits when presented to the mind in a plausible light has the effect of stifling suspicion.''
The scheme succeeded from 1880 to 1884. That it lasted even four years can be ascribed to Ferd's and Fish's trading on Grant's reputation. Ferd let it be thought that his firm was investing in lucrative but hush-hush government contracts. Later, investors were so embarrassed that it became difficult to find witnesses who would testify to this dissembling.
Geoffrey Ward cuts his great-grandfather no slack. He describes a whiny, bullying, self-pitying narcissist who, once caught, didn't even try to justify his behavior. The best things to be said about Ferd Ward are that he was reckless and ruthless enough to be worth reading about. And that when he tried to kidnap Clarence Ward, Geoffrey's grandfather, he at least had some kind of reason. Clarence's mother, Ella, had died; Ferd wanted access to her estate even if he had to steal his terrified boy in the process. Yet, somehow, ''A Disposition to Be Rich'' is written without malice. Every page of this book attests to a sane streak in the Ward family -- Ferd's best effort notwithstanding. As George Bernard Shaw said, ''If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.''

HEADLINE: Pursuing Advertisers With Big-Top Spectacle

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
This week, the biggest television networks will battle it out for their share of the more than $60 billion in advertising dollars spent by the world's largest marketers on television commercials each year.
The networks' weapons? A 40-foot sushi bar, a 125-foot star-studded red carpet and 14 flavors of doughnuts (including candied ginger and hibiscus).
What began in the 1960s as a glorified trade show for television executives to woo marketers and sell advertising time upfront to support the coming fall TV schedule has evolved into a full-fledged bacchanal that can cost networks upward of $1 million.
Today the upfronts look more like Fashion Week than a business transaction. This week, celebrity D.J.'s will spin dance music in elaborate tents complete with lounges where marketers can sip specialty cocktails alongside stars. 
The addition of social media means the upfronts are not just a tool for connecting to advertisers, either. Joe Earley, Fox's president of marketing and communications, compared the event to Comic-Con as a first and ''crucial'' chance to tell the most devoted fans about the fall TV season.
''It's a chance for us to show ourselves at our best because God knows the reality of ratings will set in soon,'' said Alan Wurtzel, president of research and media development at NBCUniversal.
In the go-go 1990s, when advertising dollars poured into TV and networks did not face threats from the Internet or cable competitors, the upfronts ''almost became a game to top what the other guy was doing and get the most buzz for your upfront,'' said Tim Brooks, a television historian.
Back then, NBC held its party in the sprawling ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Other parties took place at the Plaza Hotel. Presentations featured live animals and Broadway-style spectaculars complete with confetti and chorus lines of dancers.
Indeed, as television evolved and networks had to fight harder for advertisers' attention, the lavishness of an upfront presentation became inversely linked to a network's fortunes (or lack thereof). What a network lacked in ratings, it tried to make up in passed hors d'oeuvres and party-favor panache.
Most of the big-ticket deals with advertisers were still struck in conference rooms over stale Chinese takeout, Mr. Brooks said. ''It was a lot of money down the drain, but no one wanted to be the first one to stop doing it,'' he said of the upfront parties. ''Incrementally, they all started to pull back.''
The down economy in 2008 forced the networks to scale back even more. The iPod party favors disappeared, and the shrimp cocktail towers seemed a little skimpier, if they existed at all. ABC stopped hosting a party after its presentations, held at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall.
Lately, the glamour has slowly returned, partly because of improving economic conditions and partly out of necessity. The big four broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- face more competition than ever. Cable channels and Web services like Hulu and YouTube hold their own elaborate upfronts and compete for the same advertising dollars.
In 2010, fourth-ranked NBC colored a flock of New York taxicabs in its peacock rainbow and hosted a luncheon that required 350 pounds of raw fish from the sushi restaurant Haru. This year NBC will return its event to Radio City Music Hall, after several years in a worn ballroom at the Hilton, and will offer about 800 guests evening appetizers and drinks at the expensive Italian restaurant Del Posto.
''There will be some peacocks present, but it will be subtle and understated,'' said Francine Spray, vice president of events and operations at NBC.
CBS initially declined to comment on its upfront presentation and party. ''We're in a cone of silence,'' said Phil Gonzales, a spokesman.
When pressed, Mr. Gonzales, after getting approval from senior executives, said that the CBS party held in a tent behind Lincoln Center would have an ''elegant motif'' and that the catering would feature pigs in a blanket, miniature cupcakes and sliders.
USA Network, one of the oldest and highest-rated cable channels, this year decided for the first time to hold its upfront the same week as its broadcast competitors'. Its event will feature a 125-foot red carpet with more than 50 actors from USA series stretched out along 66th Street, outside Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. Waiters will be outfitted in ''preppy chic'' gingham polo shirts and slate-blue bow ties to fit in with the channel's sunny shows like ''White Collar'' and ''Royal Pains.''
''We wanted it to feel like a visual spectacle with a sense of awe at every touch point at every part of the event,'' said Alexandra Shapiro, USA's executive vice president of marketing and digital.
At the Fox party on Monday, the judges for the show ''MasterChef,'' Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Joe Bastianich, will personally serve a menu that includes organic salmon ceviche and a deconstructed Caesar salad accompanied by brioche Twinkies. An international dumpling station will include flavors like chicken mole.
''Having those three guys plan your menu really affects your budget,'' Mr. Earley said. But, he added, ''it puts the show front and center and helps awareness, so we think it's worth it.''
Fox expects 2,300 guests to crowd under a tent featuring midcentury modern decor and set up over Central Park's Wollman Rink. Tomiko Iwata, Fox's senior vice president of creative services, said her team had spent over eight months planning the party, including a citywide doughnut tasting test. (They settled on using Dough in Brooklyn.)
Madison Avenue regulars said advertisers should feast on Fox's veal meatballs with black truffles, Manhattan mules (a variation on the Moscow mule, which has vodka, ginger beer and lime) and steak tacos while they can, before the antiquated upfront ritual disappears.
The traditional 52-week TV schedule is less critical to advertisers than it used to be, in the days when General Motors signed on early to introduce a new Chevrolet during ''Bewitched.''
''The world is changing at lightning speed, and we are still forced to make decisions for next year upfront?'' said Bill Koenigsberg, the founder and chief executive of Horizon Media, a media planning and ad placement firm. ''Down the road there will be less of a need to run to the altar before Memorial Day weekend.''
In the meantime, enjoy the doughnuts.

An article on April 14 about the economic problems in California, as measured between east and west instead of the state's usual north-south divide, referred incorrectly to data looking at the gap between the per capita income in the San Francisco Bay Area compared with the Inland Empire. The article erroneously used dollar figures -- saying that the gap between the two communities grew to more than $40,000, and that it was $26,000 four decades ago -- rather than using the per capita income index used by the researchers. (By 2009, the San Francisco Bay Area per capita income was 86 percent higher than the Inland Empire, a gap that had grown since 1969, when the per capita income was 41 percent higher than in the Inland Empire.)

HEADLINE: Assigning Blame in Dewey's Collapse

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
With the finger-pointing well under way at Dewey & LeBoeuf, the once-proud law firm on the brink of dissolution, its partners agree the former chairman, Steven H. Davis, shoulders a large chunk of the blame for its stunning fall.
Yet amid the recriminations, two sharply divergent views of Mr. Davis have emerged.
Some Dewey partners suspect him of being a crook. Last month, several of them presented the Manhattan district attorney's office with evidence of possible financial improprieties by Mr. Davis. The office has opened a criminal inquiry.
To another group of partners, the idea that Mr. Davis engaged in criminal misconduct is preposterous. They say they believe the accusations are a fiction devised by angry, pernicious lawyers whose careers and finances have been upended. 
Both detractors and supporters agree Mr. Davis was an affable, low-key leader who possessed an equanimity that inspired confidence and articulated a convincing vision for building a global legal powerhouse.
But it is also clear that Mr. Davis, 58, was the driving force behind a series of moves that sowed the seeds of the firm's demise. He pushed the star-crossed merger in 2007 that created Dewey & LeBoeuf, a behemoth with 1,400 lawyers. He also charted a rapid expansion fueled in part by heavy borrowing, overextended the firm by handing out lavish pay guarantees and oversaw a corrosive partnership culture of haves and have-nots.
''A dispassionate and disinterested review of the facts will confirm that I have not engaged in any misconduct,'' Mr. Davis said in an e-mail to his partners last month. ''I did my best to navigate the firm through challenging and turbulent times, and I deeply regret our current situation.''
Mr. Davis has not returned to Dewey's offices since his former partners ousted him two weeks ago. He has mostly been holed up in his Beekman Place rental apartment on Manhattan's East Side. Dewey's collapse caused him great emotional strain, but since the criminal accusations, that stress has turned into anger, friends say. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment for this article.
Beekman Place is two miles north of the Stuyvesant apartment complex where Mr. Davis, the bookish son of an accountant and homemaker, grew up. He finished near the top of his class at Stuyvesant High School, a prestigious public school, and gained acceptance to Yale's exclusive directed studies program for 125 of its most ambitious freshmen.
Mr. Davis moved on to Yale Law School, and he approached graduation unsure about his plans. His college and law school classmate Tom A. Bernstein, who came from a prominent New York family, introduced him to Bernard D. Fischman, a partner at the law firm Shea & Gould.
Mr. Fischman had one word for him: utilities.
He told Mr. Davis that utilities industry law was not a crowded field and, given his brains, he would stand out. He suggested that Mr. Davis interview at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae.
Mr. Davis joined LeBoeuf in 1977, a time of seismic changes in the energy industry, and he built a thriving business. It was a career that played to Mr. Davis's strengths, requiring a mastery of complex tax regimes and a thicket of state and federal regulations. He married Loretta K. Davis, a fellow lawyer who would later become town justice in Tuxedo, N.Y., outside Tuxedo Park, the stone-gated community where the two lived. Together, they raised three children.
During the boom-boom late 1980s, Mr. Davis took a three-year hiatus from the law. In 1988, he saw an opportunity for big profits when the Public Service Company of New Hampshire went bankrupt.
Martin J. Whitman, the value investor who is now chairman of Third Avenue Management, recruited him into the deal. Together they made a run at the utility, leading a group that bought up Public Service Company bonds at a deep discount. They then used their expertise to influence the company's reorganization, and the group made a rich return.
Many corporate lawyers would have jettisoned their legal practices after getting a taste of deal-making, but Mr. Davis preferred the role of trusted legal adviser to that of sharp-elbowed distressed-debt investor.
Back at LeBoeuf, he rose quickly. In 1999, the firm elected him co-chairman, chosen to lead not for his charisma and connections, but for his judgment and intellect.
He could also show compassion. When Shea & Gould dissolved amid partner disputes in 1994, Mr. Fischman, by then nearly 80 and past his prime, needed a place to hang his hat. Mr. Davis gave jobs to him and his partner, Milton S. Gould.
Away from the office, Mr. Davis went through a profound change a decade ago. In 2001, after 24 years of marriage, Mr. Davis separated from his wife and came out as gay. He has been in a long-term relationship with another man for the last 10 years.
''Steve dealt with this part of his personal life with grace and courage,'' said Mr. Bernstein, his Yale classmate and co-founder of Chelsea Piers, the sports and entertainment complex. ''I've known him for over 40 years, and to me, he's the same Steve Davis.''
When Mr. Davis became sole chairman of LeBoeuf & Lamb in 2004, he sought to broaden the firm's business beyond its solid if stodgy specialties in insurance and utilities law. To plug gaps, he embraced a growing legal industry trend now seen as a major cause of Dewey's decline - the poaching of partners from rivals by offering them large guaranteed contracts.
He made his mark quickly. During his first year in charge, he recruited Ralph C. Ferrara, a former top lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, away from Debevoise & Plimpton. LeBoeuf caused a stir in the corporate law world by agreeing to pay Mr. Ferrara about $2 million a year and assuming responsibility for his pension of roughly $15 million.
Mr. Ferrara's hiring turned out to be a coup for LeBoeuf. It raised the firm's profile in Washington, where Mr. Ferrara was based, giving it a strong foothold in defending S.E.C. enforcement cases and securities class action lawsuits.
''Steve had early, great success with Ralph's hiring,'' said a managing partner at a big law firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''And what can happen when you have an early success is that it can give you a false sense confidence about what you're capable of doing.''
From 2004 to 2007, LeBoeuf had a great run under Mr. Davis, but he became convinced the firm needed to be bigger and more global.
He set his sights on a merger, but first had to deal with a threat to his leadership. The co-heads of the firm's corporate department, Alexander M. Dye and John M. Schwolsky, mounted a bid to replace him. Mr. Dye and Mr. Schwolsky were forced out of their management posts after Mr. Davis confronted them with embarrassing internal e-mails they had written.
Having consolidated his power, Mr. Davis approached Dewey Ballantine, a century-old establishment firm of a similar size. Over breakfast at Michael's restaurant, a power scene in Midtown, Mr. Davis pitched Dewey's chairman, Morton A. Pierce, on combining to create one of New York's largest firms with the heft to compete internationally.
Though Dewey's brand was powerful, its finances were anything but. The previous year, a collapsed merger with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe had destabilized the firm. Dewey's profits were plummeting and it had considerable debt.
Yet Mr. Davis craved Dewey's mergers practice, a weak spot for LeBoeuf. He was also enamored with Dewey's white-shoe pedigree. LeBoeuf (pronounced le-buff) did not exactly roll off the tongue, but Dewey was a name upon which you could build a world-class firm.
His goal, he would say, was to become the next Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom or Latham & Watkins, two profitable large firms with strong international networks. Together, LeBoeuf and Dewey created a firm with offices in 26 countries and $1 billion in revenue that Mr. Davis thought had the global reach and diverse practice to withstand a recession.
It did not. The merger, which closed in October 2007, was reached as credit markets were beginning to seize up. Less than a year later, the financial crisis would cripple the international economy. To keep important partners from leaving, Mr. Davis had handed out dozens of four-year contracts, creating onerous compensation commitments.
Mr. Davis had also projected a 25 percent increase in partner pay in 2008 over 2007, according to a January 2009 internal memo sent from Mr. Davis to the partners. Instead, Dewey's profit in 2008 dropped 15 percent. ''In hindsight, our 2008 targets proved to be overly optimistic,'' Mr. Davis wrote.
The January 2009 memo chafed some partners in another respect. The executive committee - the 24 senior partners who oversaw the management of the firm alongside Mr. Davis - had established a bonus pool to reward top-producing partners in 2008. Many of those top producers sat on the executive committee.
''We were in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Depression and these guys were reserving bonuses for themselves,'' said a former junior partner. ''Whatever happened to shared sacrifice?''
A shared sacrifice ethos did not exist at Dewey. Mr. Davis subscribed to a ''barbell'' compensation system. On one end were the so-called rainmakers with big books of business who were lavished with multimillion-dollar, multiyear guarantees. Dewey's stars were paid as much as $10 million a year. (Mr. Davis himself earned about $4 million a year, but cut his 2011 salary to $300,000.)
On the other end of the barbell were partners who worked on the court cases and deals brought in by the rainmakers. These partners were paid about $300,000, creating a dynamic where the highest-paid partners were making 30 times more than the most junior ones.
At Skadden, by comparison, the highest-paid partner makes no more than five times the lower-paid ones. One former partner called the arrangement ''something closer to feudalism than a true partnership.''
After struggling through the financial crisis and deep recession - and piling up tens of millions of dollars more in I.O.U.'s for existing partners - Mr. Davis was primed to execute his growth strategy.
Many partners said they remained largely oblivious to Dewey's financial woes. Distracted by demanding legal practices, they placed their faith in Mr. Davis. Working closely with Mr. Davis was Stephen DiCarmine, a nonpracticing lawyer who served as Dewey's longtime executive director. ''The Steves,'' as they were known by many inside the firm, had broad authority over management and partner pay.
Mr. Davis again set rosy projections for 2011, forecasting an 11 percent increase in earnings. Some of those profits, Mr. Davis hoped, would come courtesy of a new round of lateral hires. He embarked on a recruiting spree, recruiting 37 new partners from other firms last year.
Rising expenses and an uneven economic recovery crimped the firm's profit. At a tense partner meeting in October, Mr. Davis said that 100 of the firm's 300 partners had guarantees. After being pressed, he said he did not know the total dollar amount in back pay owed to them. The answer was about $100 million.
''Steve believed that the way to dig the firm out of its hole was to hire more laterals who could generate more business,'' said a Dewey partner. ''But the hole got too deep and everyone ran for the exits.''
Among the first big defections was a 12-person team led by Mr. Dye and Mr. Schwolsky, the pair that had tried to remove Mr. Davis years before. Their departures had a snowball effect that devastated the firm.
One partner who had come on board recently said he blamed himself for not asking more questions about the firm's financial state. He also blames Dewey's executive committee for a lack of oversight. But he says the former chairman deserves the most blame.
''Maybe we were all passengers on a ship of fools,'' he said. ''But Steve Davis was the captain of that ship.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on May 14 about the role of Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, in the firm's financial problems misidentified the town where his wife, Loretta K. Davis, is town justice. It is Tuxedo, N.Y. - not Tuxedo Park, the nearby gated community where the Davises live.

HEADLINE: May 14, 1948 | Israel Declares Independence

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On May 14, 1948, the independent state of Israel was proclaimed as British rule in Palestine came to an end. 

 BODY:
On May 14, 1948, the independent state of Israel was proclaimed as British rule in Palestine came to an end.
The May 15 New York Times reported, "The declaration of the new state by David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the National Council and the first Premier of reborn Israel, was delivered during a simple and solemn ceremony at 4 p.m., and new life was instilled into his people, but from without there was the rumbling of guns, a flashback to other declarations of independence that had not been easily achieved."
After World War II and the Holocaust, in which six million European Jews were killed, the United Nations moved to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish sections. The United Nations adopted the partition plan in November 1947. This plan outraged Arabs, and sparked a civil war in Palestine. The Palestinian Arabs had greater numbers, but the Israelis were better armed and organized, and were able to overcome the Arabs. During this time, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs chose to or were forced to evacuate their homes.
The violence caused the United States to withdraw its support for partition. However, when Israel declared its independence, the United States immediately recognized the new state. The Times wrote, "In one of the most hopeful periods of their troubled history the Jewish people here gave a sigh of relief and took a new hold on life when they learned that the greatest national power had accepted them into the international fraternity."
The armies of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria invaded almost immediately after the May 14 declaration of nationhood and the withdrawal of British troops, sparking the Arab-Israeli War. Israeli forces defeated the coalition by the end of the year and, via 1949 armistice agreements, Israel expanded its borders beyond those established by the original United Nations partition plan. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, the country took effective control of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.
The political borders of Israel have continued to change over the course of its statehood due to military and diplomatic developments. Today, the country borders Lebanon in the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank in the east, the Gaza Strip and Egypt in the southwest.

In a report on Israel's 64th independence celebration in April 2012, Ethan Bronner wrote in The Times: "The paradox that is Israel - wealthy, dynamic and safe, yet mistrusted, condemned and nervous - was on full display Commentators on the left and the right stuck to their scripts, with the left asserting that the country's treatment of the Palestinians and its regional saber rattling have made it isolated and stagnant, and the right glorifying Israel's accomplishments: high-tech innovations, long life expectancies and democracy."
In an interview, President Shimon Peres praised the strength of the military for the nation's creation and survival, but also "warned about Israel's direction, saying that without peace with the Palestinians, its economic prowess and future would be imperiled."
President Peres's remarks may have been a reference to the government's decision to retroactively legalize settlements in the West Bank, a move that drew international condemnation as the country began its Independence Day celebrations.
What do you think it will take to achieve lasting peace in Israel? Why? In general, what recourse or resolutions do you think there should be for countries in which different "nations," or groups of people who share a common identity, are unable to agree on the terms of the "state," or defined political territory?

HEADLINE: An American Goes European

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Damaso Reyes has been following the changes wrought by immigration and the economy in Europe since 2005 for his project "The Europeans." He is going past the daily headlines - and stereotypes - in hopes of achieving a more subtle portrayal. "If everything was about reconfirming what I thought I'd find, why get on a plane?" 

 BODY:
Damaso Reyes has been photographing the many changes sweeping over the European Union since 2005 as part of his ambitious project, "The Europeans." Across the Continent, he has been finding moments large and small that strive for nuance and details of everyday life.
It's a challenge, because he knows he's an outsider. Mr. Reyes, 33, grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, where he lived with his parents, who had come from the Dominican Republic. His earliest experiences with photography had him question how photographers approach - and portray - unfamiliar people and places.
"It began to drive me nuts," he said. "I knew we had problems, there were drugs and crime. But there were also people going to work and school. But then you have these photographers, who will remain nameless, who go in and make you think Bed-Stuy was nothing but shooting galleries and crack houses."
Those early concerns have stuck with him as he pursues his project, which he hopes to finish by 2015.
"As someone who grew up in a community that I feel was poorly represented in the media, when I go to other communities, I try to be hyper-aware and hyper-sensitive and not regurgitate the same visual information, but to push myself beyond what I expect," he said. "If everything was about reconfirming what I thought I'd find, why get on a plane?"
Mr. Reyes, who did newspaper work in New York before moving to Indonesia, had been looking for a long-term project when he settled on the idea of "The Europeans." Fascinated by the changes he was reading about, he took a chance to delve into a project that went beyond the headlines of daily stories to see how people were adjusting in various Europeans nations.
"Europe was going through the biggest transformation since World War II, but everything I was reading was like looking at a map one inch from your face," he said. "Nobody is holding back the map. None of the pictures I was seeing showed anybody looking beyond what happened that day, week or month."
If "The Europeans" elicits thoughts of "The Americans," it's not an accident. Mr. Reyes has admired Robert Frank ever since he discovered his oeuvre in high school.
"Wouldn't it be interesting if an American went to Europe and photographed how it was changing?" he said. "That was one of the strengths of Frank's work. He was looking at America from an outsider's perspective."
He began his project in 2005 in London, following with trips to the Netherlands, Kosovo and Spain (where he now lives, in Barcelona). For someone used to daily newspaper assignments, it was a bit scary to go off without being sure how he would finance the project, or whether picture editors would be interested in his work.
He soon discovered there was little interest in pictures that were not newsy. Instead, he found greater support in the art world, receiving fellowships and grants as well as artist residencies.
One thing that struck him over the last few years was how pervasive immigration has been. Working in a town on the border between Hungary and Slovakia, he photographed two brown-skinned girls during a school dance.
"I had never seen brown people there before," he recalled. "I asked my friend and she said, 'Oh, they're the daughters of the pharmacist. He's from the Congo.' So, I go to visit the pharmacist. It turned out that during the '70s and '80s, during the era of fraternal Socialism, there were exchanges between the Eastern Bloc and the developing world, where they invited people from the Congo to study. He did that and stayed, marrying a local woman."
As he proceeded in the project, he found himself going past the easy pictures. While others cautioned him that Catalans were closed and distant, he found them to be warm and welcoming - they even asked him to participate in a local custom of building human towers. In Barcelona, he was fascinated by the growth of Pentecostal Christianity, and has spent many hours documenting a congregation.
In Vienna, he found himself going deeper.
"Vienna is a city with many immigrants, but I'm not sure how that got visualized," he said. "You see a picture and it's usually of an asylum-seeker or someone being arrested. It's not about people riding the train, shopping or just living their lives. For me, it's important to show the diversity of the city that often does not get shown."
Of course, there were other times when he was bluntly reminded that he was still an outsider.
"In parts of Austria and Germany, I got a sense that somebody was always looking at me and wondering why I was there," he said. "People began to see me as an asylum-seeker. So they looked at me and put me in a box. It really goes to the heart of what is the biggest challenge Europe is facing in the 21st century, which is a reconstruction of their concept of identity."

HEADLINE: Define 'Welfare State,' Please

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Data simply does not the support the abstract notion that the "welfare state" is out of control in the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Even those who denounce our "unsustainable welfare state" don't agree on what it is or how its spending should be measured.
Brandishing the phrase in his recent call for a structural revolution, David Brooks of The New York Times didn't get specific.
The Heritage Foundation sometimes offers a narrow definition of the "unsustainable welfare state," based on means-tested programs - benefits directed to those with income below a poverty threshold, like Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, food stamps and Medicaid.
Like many conservative Republicans, however, the Heritage Foundation often includes bigger entitlement programs that are not means-tested, like Social Security and Medicare, within its unsustainable category.
The ball seems to get bigger as it rolls downhill. Some critics consider the entire government payroll part of the unsustainable welfare state. Others use government spending as a share of gross domestic product as a warning sign. By these measures, military expenditures also count.

Academic researchers also disagree about specifics. The economists Irwin Garfinkel and Timothy Smeeding, for instance, assert that spending on education should be considered part of the welfare state, emphasizing its productive contributions to the development of human capital.
Like many other researchers, including Christopher Howard, author of "The Hidden Welfare State," they insist that analysis of government spending alone provides an incomplete picture, because tax expenditures, such as the costs of tax breaks for employer-provided health insurance, or for children, should also be counted.
It seems odd to give the same "welfare state" label to all these different categories of spending. Their distributional impact varies enormously. Means-tested government spending on low-income families is small relative to other transfers. Social Security and government employment tend to benefit the middle class. Tax expenditures, in particular, tend to benefit the rich.
Spending trends also vary enormously. Spending on means-tested programs other than Medicaid has not increased much over the long run. According to the Budget of the United States Government for fiscal 2011, it represented about the same percentage of G.D.P. in 2007 as in 1976 - about 1.3 percent. It increased to 1.7 percent in 2009 as a result of the great recession.
When unemployment goes up and stays up, spending on programs like food stamps and the earned income tax credit goes up, helping people who can't find a job and buffering the economy from the effects of income loss.
Spending on Social Security, often treated as the greatest bugaboo of our aging society, has remained at 4.5 to 5 percent of G.D.P. since 1985. The already carried out transition to a higher retirement age is contributing to cost containment.
The scary increases in government spending have come in Medicaid and Medicare. These two programs, which consumed 1.2 percent of G.D.P. in 1975, reached 4.1 percent of G.D.P. in 2008.
These increases have less to do with government spending than with the increased costs of health care, regardless of who is paying the bill.
The Center for Economic and Policy Research offers an online calculator showing how much lower our projected deficits would be if we could reduce health care spending per person to levels comparable to those of other affluent countries. The center also graphs the improvement that would result from successful fulfillment of the Affordable Care Act.
If you distrust these calculations, consider that government spending on retirement and health security is largely a substitute for private spending. Try projecting your personal expenditures on retirement and health care if Social Security and Medicare are downsized. Your taxes might go down, but you might need to spend more out of your own pocket to buy the services you need.
All government programs deserve critical scrutiny, and there is plenty of room for meaningful debate over the relative efficiency of public versus private provision. But there is no evidence that social spending in the United States is approaching some upper limit of feasibility.
What is unsustainable (or should be) is the current level of confusion, misinformation and paranoia about the future of the so-called welfare state.

HIGHLIGHT: Plus: A seismic shift in Europe, managing cash flow, and what your mother taught you. Do you believe that Yelp can help your business? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: A Shift in Europe
France simmers, Greece boils and an economic crisis threatens Europe's "storied way of life." Spain owns up to its banking mess. Jeff Miller says no one should panic. Richard Bailey explains why the euro zone is undergoing a seismic shift. And maybe there is a reason France has so many 49-employee companies.

Deborah Sweeney suggests five must-haves for your e-mail newsletter. Carolyn Nye says your Web site must have triggered e-mails, such as form-fill abandonment: "Once someone partially completes the form and then abandons it, you can send an automatic e-mail to help them finish. ...

Tim Fernholz wonders why Chinese consumers care more about responsible business than Americans do. Mark Partridge lists 10 steps for protecting intellectual property in global markets, including, "Use an international copyright notice on catalogs, blueprints, Web sites, software and other publications and materials": "While copyright notice is not required for protection in the United States, it may be required as a condition of protection in foreign courts, so using a copyright notice is a good practice to help deter unauthorized copying." Prince Charles predicts rain.
Red Tape: Why Businesses Want Regulation
A political candidate pays $59.05 to set up a Web site (his state would have spent $180,000). States are cutting taxes for the first time in 10 years. Barry Nolan says that many businesses actually want regulation, and "it's a big, fat lie when they claim otherwise." House Republicans try to bolster small-business exports. David Brodwin says government can unleash small businesses and expand the economy.
Technology: Presenting Like Steve Jobs
Avram Piltch believes there are 15 ways you can make yourself a better computer user, including: "Use dual monitors and AeroSnap to view several windows at once. ... Time saved: 1.5 to 2 seconds per window switch, which adds up to several minutes per hour." Microsoft makes big changes to Bing. Smartphones could be spreading faster than any technology in history, and now some Amtrak customers can start using their iPhones for ticketing. Some investors are betting everything on mobile. Mikal Belicove offers five tips on how to present like Steve Jobs. Technology makes its mark on oil production. Brad Farris explains why he likes his iPad for business and Seamus Bellamy says this isthe iPad keyboard case you want. Here are the 2012 Inventors Hall of Fame inductees. And no, Lincoln did not invent Facebook.
The Week's Bests
Leo Babauta explains how to live well: "Want little, and you are not poor. You can have a lot of money and possessions, but if you always want more, you are poorer than the guy who has little and wants nothing."
Hugo Moreno says there five things to learn from the animal kingdom, including, "Culture can determine corporate survival": "Beehives are known to exhibit a sort of collective superpersonality: Scientists scored 25 hives on such traits as how actively the bees foraged for food, how assiduously they kept up with hive maintenance and how fiercely they defended the hive. ... Then they looked for patterns among these traits that correlated with which hives survived the hazards of an upstate New York winter (nature's version of hard economic times). The best predictors of success were highly active foraging and a strong defense."
Mark Suster says that to be successful you'll need to shake hands and kiss babies: "The interesting thing about pressing the flesh is that once you've broken bread with people and spent personal time getting to know them, it is then much easier to build long-term relationships through e-mail, phone, Twitter, Skype and the like. There is a certain trust that exists and a certain leeway granted to you since they really 'know you.'"

HEADLINE: Sweetleaf Expands to Brooklyn

BYLINE: OLIVER STRAND


HIGHLIGHT: A serious coffeehouse with a devoted following in Long Island City is branching out. 

 BODY:
Sweetleaf opened a coffee shop Monday on Kent Avenue in Williamsburg. It's the second location for Sweetleaf, which has a devoted audience in Long Island City, and the latest addition to the growing Williamsburg coffee scene: Blue Bottle Coffee, Toby's Estate Coffee and a number of other serious coffee shops are close by.
The new Sweetleaf will use espressos from Ritual Coffee Roasters, a highly respected San Francisco roaster whose coffees are rarely seen on this coast. Sweetleaf will be pulling two different espressos, the "Nine Darling Road" seasonal espresso and the El Naranjo: Cumbrita from El Slavador, the May "Sweet Tooth" single-origin espresso. Sweetleaf is one of a handful of shops in New York to offer different espressos at the same time: if you haven't tried two espressos side by side, it's a revelation to discover how distinct each shot tastes.
Sweetleaf will also brew coffee from Heart Coffee Roasters, a cult roaster in Portland, Ore., and Stumptown Coffee Roasters. 
Sweetleaf's original location in Long Island City is a neighborhood hangout where serious coffee is prepared according to precise techniques and methodology (every shot of espresso is weighed on a digital scale, and those that don't measure up are thrown out), and served in a bar-like atmosphere (the room in the back has a turntable and a stack of records that would have gotten you detention at some schools in the 1980s). 
The new Sweetleaf will be as obsessed with coffee as the first (the scales are here), and will be as relaxed (there's fussball), but the scene here might reflect the economic aspirations of the new Williamsburg: the coffee shop shares a loft-like storefront with a real estate office.

HEADLINE: Sweet Offerings From Enterprising Bakers

BYLINE: FLORENCE FABRICANT


HIGHLIGHT: Pip's Place, on the Upper East Side, specializes in gluten-free layer cakes; Schmackary's, in Hell's Kitchen, sells deep-dish cookies. 

 BODY:
When life went sour, they turned to sweets. Denise Cumming, a stay-at home mom, became a gluten-free baker to satisfy a daughter with celiac disease. And Zachary Schmahl, a young entrepreneur, turned a baking hobby into a business when his marketing job disappeared in the recession. Both are opening shops this week. 
Ms. Cumming, 45, who is self-taught, named her bakery Pip's Place after her daughter, who is nicknamed Pippi. The Upper East Side shop has few seats and an open kitchen, where Ms. Cumming bakes cakes, above, as well as muffins, cookies and squares. In place of wheat flour, she uses white and brown rice flour and teff, a type of grain, as well as potato and corn starches, with excellent results. It took her four years of experimenting to come up with a satisfactory blend. 
Mr. Schmahl, 28, who had been selling his baked goods online for a few years before opening his store in Hell's Kitchen, has come up with a thick cookie, right, baked in a muffin tin, that he calls a schmack snack. It's like a dense cupcake with little if any icing, in about a dozen flavors. His regular cookies, in two sizes, are good but less distinctive; they are also used to make ice cream sandwiches.
Schmackary's, 362 West 45th Street, (646) 801-9866, schmackarys.com, opens Wednesday. Deep-dish cookies called schmack snacks are $3 each or five for $12, and come in more than 10 flavors, including chocolate chip, red velvet and oatmeal. Regular cookies come in a "Schmahl" size, four for $6; a larger size for $2.75 each; and in ice cream sandwiches, $4 and $6.25.

HEADLINE: Steiger to Step Down as ProPublica's Editor

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: Stephen Engelberg will replace Paul Steiger, 69, as editor in chief, and Richard Tofel, ProPublica's general manager, will fill his role as president. The two will become co-chief executives. 

 BODY:
Paul E. Steiger, the formlongtime managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, will step down at the end of the year as the editor in chief and chief executive of ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative news organization that he started nearly five years ago.
Effective Jan. 1, 2013, the project's managing editor, Stephen Engelberg, will replace Mr. Steiger as editor in chief and Richard Tofel, ProPublica's general manager, will step in as president. They will share the position of chief executive, Mr. Steiger, 69, told his staff on Monday.
Mr. Steiger will transition to a role as executive chairman, a position that will allow him to spend about 60 percent of his time assisting with fundraising and weighing in on strategic decisions. The rest of his time, he said, he hopes to spend with his family and young grandchildren in Los Angeles.
"It seems like the right time, and, in addition, I have two colleagues who are totally ready to take over," Mr. Steiger said in an interview.
The timing, he added, was fitting, in part, because more news organizations, donors and readers have become aware of ProPublica and its place in the news ecosystem.
"The message is getting across, more people understand why for this kind of journalism, part of the solution needs to come from philanthropy," Mr. Steiger said. "That was a very mysterious notion when we first started."
In 2006, when Mr. Steiger was still The Journal's managing editor, a post he had held since 1991, the bankers-turned-philanthropists Herb and Marion Sandler proposed that Mr. Steiger start a nonprofit that would spend $10 million a year on investigative journalism. He was nearing The Journal's mandatory retirement age of 65 that year and needed a new opportunity. The Sandlers would provide the initial funding.
ProPublica, which employs 34 journalists, was created in 2007 and began publishing online in 2008. The nonprofit's mission is to "expose abuses of power and betrayals of public trust by government, business and other institutions" and publish the type of long-format journalism that has been squeezed in recent years at budget-strapped newspapers, magazines and TV news outlets.
In 2008, Mr. Steiger was paid $571,687, plus $13,430 in additional compensation, sparking criticism in media circles. Compensation "is subject to the board," Mr. Steiger said. "All I can say is I'll be working part-time so it will be lower on that basis and it will be lower since I'll no longer be C.E.O."
In 2010, ProPublica won a Pulitzer prize for a story published in The New York Times Magazine about a New Orleans's hospital in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It won a second Pulitzer in 2011 for an online story on Wall Street's contribution to the economic meltdown.
Mr. Engelberg, 54, joined ProPublica after serving as managing editor of The Oregonian in Portland. He spent 18 years in various posts at The New York Times. (The Times's executive editor, Jill Abramson, serves on ProPublica's journalism advisory board.)
In addition to its own Web site and apps, ProPublica partners with major news organization, including The Times, to publish its reporters' work. Partners have included PBS's "Frontline," CBS's "60 Minutes," and "This American Life" on National Public Radio, as well as Politico, Slate and The Washington Post.
"As the journalism marketplace continues to fragment, we're getting into smaller and more customized niches," said Mr. Engelberg, who handles ProPublica's media partnerships.
Mr. Tofel, 55, served as an assistant publisher at The Wall Street Journal and held various corporate posts at the newspaper's parent company, Dow Jones & Company. He is the author of "Restless Genius: Barney Kilgore, The Wall Street Journal, and the Invention of Modern Journalism," and other journalism books.

HEADLINE: College Costs Weighing Down a Generation With Student Debt

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new series from The Times examines the implications of rising college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families. 

 BODY:
3:03 p.m. | Updated A second article in the "Degrees of Debt" series was published online. It examines how college presidents are recognizing that they must handle education costs through methods other than tuition increases.
On Sunday, The New York Times introduced the series "Degrees of Debt," which examines "the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families."
Regular readers of The Choice would be highly interested in this article, as it examines some serious issues we've covered about college affordability, student debt and the roles that students, parents, colleges and lenders have played in the issue. It explores whether student lending is the next bubble that may cause an economic collapse; the rationale behind sticker prices and the actual prices that students typically pay; misleading financial aid letters that saddle students with $42,000 in loans; responsible lending practices; and whether college is even worth the cost.
It also examines how state funding has affected college costs and, ultimately, student borrowing. Ohio State University, for example, used to receive 25 percent of its financing from the state. That was in 1990. Today, state financing only accounts for 7 percent of its budget. "The consequence? Three out of five undergraduates at Ohio State take out loans, and the average debt is $24,840," our colleagues report.
On the issue of affordability, more college marketing companies are promoting the premise that the expense will work out in the end; they choose their words wisely and "focus on the value of the education rather than the cost," our colleagues write.
The piece begins with Kelsey Griffith, an Ohio Northern University graduate who owes $120,000 in student debt.
"As an 18-year-old, it sounded like a good fit to me, and the school really sold it," she said. "I knew a private school would cost a lot of money. But when I graduate, I'm going to owe like $900 a month. No one told me that."
The report examines how, over time, student debt has become a central part of the college experience. In 1993, The Times reports, 45 percent of students who earned bachelor's degrees had to borrow money to pay for college. By contrast, about two-thirds of bachelor's degree graduates in 2007-08 had to borrow money to attend college, according to the Department of Education. The report says: 
With more than $1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. Now nearly everyone pursuing a bachelor's degree is borrowing. As prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden.
About two-thirds of bachelor's degree recipients borrow money to attend college, either from the government or private lenders, according to a Department of Education survey of 2007-08 graduates; the total number of borrowers is most likely higher since the survey does not track borrowing from family members. 
By contrast, 45 percent of 1992-93 graduates borrowed money; that survey included family borrowing as well as government and private loans. 
For all borrowers, the average debt in 2011 was $23,300, with 10 percent owing more than $54,000 and 3 percent more than $100,000, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports. Average debt for bachelor degree graduates who took out loans ranges from under $10,000 at elite schools like Princeton and Williams College, which have plenty of wealthy students and enormous endowments, to nearly $50,000 at some private colleges with less affluent students and less financial aid. 
The article also includes a detailed interactive chart that shows the increasing levels of student debt at colleges and universities around the country. The data go back to 2004 and allow users to customize the chart using a number of factors, including enrollment size, share of graduates with debt, graduation rates, and whether the school is public or private. It also provides data for a particular college or university, and displays your debt level, adjusted for inflation.
There has been overwhelming response to the piece, and our colleagues hope to hear from more readers about their experience with college loans, for future reporting for the series. Several experts have also weighed in on how, exactly, to control the rising levels of student debt and protect young borrowers from such big financial burdens. In a Room for Debate piece, experts weigh in on loan collection policies, controlling college costs, government spending, "reckless" for-profit colleges and better lending practices.
An article on Sunday about college students' debt, and an accompanying chart, misstated the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed money for their education from the government, private lenders, or with the help of family members.
The article stated that the percentage had increased to 94 percent from 45 percent in 1993, based on data from the Department of Education, whose officials reviewed The Times's methodology before publication. While the percentage of students borrowing for college has indeed increased significantly, the 94 percent figure reflected an inaccurate interpretation of the data, which came from a survey of 2007-2008 graduates.
That survey showed that 66 percent of bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from the government or private lenders; an additional percentage of graduates had family members who borrowed on their behalf or who lent them money, meaning that the total percentage with college borrowing increased to more than 66 percent. But the precise figure isn't known because the department survey did not address borrowing involving family members. (The earlier survey, of 1992-1993 graduates, found that just 45 percent of graduates had borrowed from all sources, including from family members.)

HEADLINE: Offshore Transmission Line Takes a Step Forward

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A federal agency clears the way for an environmental review of a proposed Atlantic wind power transmission backbone. 

 BODY:
 A pioneering proposal tobuild a wind power transmission line on the ocean floor from southern Virginia to northern New Jersey cleared a hurdle on Monday when the Interior Department opened the way for the project's sponsors to start work on an environmental impact statement. 
 The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, part of the Interior Department, said that no competitor had emerged for the right-of-way for the proposed transmission line, known as theAtlantic Wind Connection, allowing the bureau to issue a "determination of no competitive interest." By linking wind farms 15 to 20 miles off the coast, the backbone would greatly reduce the number of individual radial lines needed to bring the energy to shore. 
David J. Hayes, the deputy secretary of the Interior, said in a statement that the Interior Department was "moving ahead to responsibly evaluate and expedite appropriate projects." In a conference call with reporters, he said his department could issue its first permit for a wind farm by the end of the year.

Mr. Hayes noted that offshore mid-Atlantic wind power had yet to be developed "despite the world-class nature of the wind resource" and "its proximity to some of our nation's largest load centers.''
"We've been working to change that,'' he said. 
The major investors in the project are Google; Good Energies II, a New York-based investment partnership; the Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading firm;, and Elia, a Belgian transmission operator.
 Robert L. Mitchell, the chief executive of the Trans-Elect Development Company, the project's developer, said that an environmental study would take about 18 months. The decision also clears the way for his company to begin negotiating commercial terms for the right-of-way with the Department of Interior, he said. 
Construction of the full project would take about 10 years, according to the company. The right-of-way corridor, including branches to reach the shore at intermediate points, would run about 790 miles, the Interior Department said. 
 The offshore wind farm that might be approved this year would presumably be in New Jersey, given that proposed projects off the coasts of Delaware and Maryland have suffered setbacks in the last few months. 
 Late last year, NRG, a New Jersey-based power generator, for a 200-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Delaware because it could not find an investment partner. 
The Maryland legislature adjourned its regular session this spring designed to encourage wind off its coast. In both cases, a decline in prices for conventional electricity made offshore wind power look less attractive. The economic slowdown has cut the demand for electricity, which makes all new projects seem less urgent. 
But in New Jersey, plans are
Mr. Mitchell suggested that the Atlantic Wind Connection could eventually cut customers' bills by bringing electricity from low-cost areas like southern Virginia to northern New Jersey.The Northeast is prone to grid congestion, a situation in which low-cost generators in distant places stand idle but higher-cost generators closer to load must operate because there is no space on the transmission lines to bring electricity in from farther away.
"There's at least a billion dollars a year that ratepayers are paying extra just because of congestion,'' Mr. Mitchell said. "Our line, even the first leg of it, will make a contribution to reducing that. '' 
The first segment of the transmission line will probably stretch from northern New Jersey to the Atlantic City area, he said.

HEADLINE: New York Voters Support Minimum Wage Increase, Poll Says

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: More than three-quarters back a proposal by Democrats to raise the rate to $8.50, according to a Siena College survey, which also showed that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is still drawing positive reviews. 

 BODY:
ALBANY -- More than three-quarters of New York State voters support a proposal by Democrats in the Legislature to raise the minimum wage to $8.50 per hour from $7.25, according to a new poll released on Monday.
The poll, conducted by Siena College from May 6 to 10, found broad support for what has emerged as the highest-profile issue in the closing weeks of this year's legislative session, which is scheduled to conclude in six weeks.
Democrats and independent voters were strongly supportive of raising the minimum wage, the poll found, with 88 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of independents in support. And while the Republican majority in the State Senate has derided the proposal as a job killer, a majority of Republican voters - 58 percent - said they supported it, as did 64 percent of voters who described themselves as politically conservative.
"At least 70 percent of voters from every region support the increase," said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena pollster. "About two-thirds of voters have heard or read a great deal or some about the issue, and the vast majority would like to see the Legislature pass the minimum wage increase before session ends next month."
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, has made increasing the minimum wage his top legislative priority this year. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has said that he supports an increase in concept, but he has shied away from embracing Mr. Silver's specific proposal. The current wage is lower than that in 18 states and the District of Columbia.
The poll also found broad support for a proposal to provide new tax cuts and credits for small businesses, a priority of Senate Republicans. But it found no such agreement over a plan to create a system of public financing for state elections; 40 percent said they supported such a proposal, while 36 percent opposed it.
The Siena poll showed few surprises looking toward this year's statewide elections. Fifty-seven percent of voters said they supported President Obama, compared with 37 percent for the presumptive Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. 
Among the Republicans seeking their party's nomination to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, two-thirds of Republican voters said they did not know whom they favored or had no opinion. 
Of those with a preference, 15 percent favored Representative Bob Turner; 12 percent supported Wendy E. Long, a Manhattan lawyer; and 6 percent backed George Maragos, the Nassau County comptroller. In hypothetical match-ups against all three Republicans, Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat, won by a ratio of more than two to one.
Mr. Cuomo continued drawing positive reviews from voters: 68 percent said they had a favorable impression of him, down from the 73 percent favorability level that Siena measured last month.
The poll, conducted by telephone of 766 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The survey included 205 Republicans, for whom the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 7 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Ina Drew's Successor at JPMorgan Has a Long History With Risk

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Matthew E. Zames, co-head of JPMorgan Chase's global fixed-income group who some see as a potential heir to Jamie Dimon, has seen trading blowups before. 

 BODY:
Matthew E. Zames, who will take over for Ina Drew as the chief investment officer of JPMorgan Chase in the wake of a $2 billion trading loss, has a long relationship with risk.
Mr. Zames, who goes by Matt, is currently co-head of JPMorgan's global fixed-income group and an executive in its mortgage division. He came to the bank in 2004 from Credit Suisse, where he was a trader in the interest rates group.
His first job in finance, as a junior trader with the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, introduced him to the dangers of excessive risk-taking. Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., blew up after a series of risky arbitrage strategies led to billions of dollars in losses. The firm ultimately had to be bailed out in a $3.6 billion rescue coordinated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to avoid larger losses in the wider financial system.
As a result of his front-row seat for the collapse of Long-Term Capital, Mr. Zames "witnessed firsthand what could happen when a bunch of shortsighted executives didn't manage their risk properly," according to Kate Kelly's 2009 book "Street Fighters: The Last 72 Hours of Bear Stearns, the Toughest Firm on Wall Street." 
That book, and several others, chronicled Mr. Zames's involvement in another last-minute rescue: the 2008 fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan.
Mr. Zames, who was then the co-head of global rates and currency trading at JPMorgan, was one of the bank's primary brokers on the eleventh-hour acquisition. In his book "House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street," William D. Cohan described Mr. Zames's cautious approach to deal-making:
Around midnight, Matt Zames, the co-head of global rates and currency trading at JPMorgan, arrived in the conference room. The brusque Zames had been a trader at Long-Term Capital Management when it blew up ten years earlier. The Bear Stearns executives started to run through the situation for Zames. "About 10 minutes into it he goes, 'Where's the Fed?'" Friedman said. "We said, 'They're in one of the other conference rooms.' He goes, 'Well, we can't talk about anything until we talk to the Fed. We've got Reg W issues'" -- referring to a complicated regulation that limits the transactions between a bank and its affiliates. "Some number of weeks later, he actually apologized to me for being rude at that meeting. I said, 'No, we'd been sitting there for hours. You're the only one who made any sense.'"
At JPMorgan, Mr. Zames made a name for himself as a hard-nosed trader with a sixth sense for risky situations. A 2011 bankruptcy filing showed that Mr. Zames was among the first people at the firm to suspect that Bernard L. Madoff, who kept accounts at JPMorgan, was running a Ponzi scheme. 
That year, The Wall Street Journal identified Mr. Zames as a potential successor to Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief. 
Mr. Zames's new position atop the chief investment office will put him one step closer to Mr. Dimon's perch. It will also put him in charge of a beleaguered unit that could still face billions of dollars in additional losses as it seeks to wind down the ill-fated trades that created the initial hole.
Mr. Zames has kept a low profile in the media -- so low, in fact, that a 2010 segment about JPMorgan's succession plan featured a photo of Andrew Madoff, Mr. Madoff's son, labeled incorrectly as Mr. Zames. 
The real Mr. Zames sits on the U.S. Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, and is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

HEADLINE: In Commencement Speech, Obama Highlights Role of Women

BYLINE: JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's commencement speech at Barnard College on Monday highlighted the role of women in public life. 

 BODY:
1:52 a.m. | Updated The full version of this post is available here.
President Obama's commencement speech at Barnard College on Monday highlighted the role of women in public life, a return to gender-gap identity politics that Democrats are hoping will benefit them in the coming election.
The president, speaking from the grounds of Columbia University in New York City, told the nearly 600 female graduates to "fight for a seat at the head of the table."
"You are now poised to make this the century when women shape not only their own destiny, but the destiny of the whole nation," he said.
"It's up to you to stand up and be heard, to write, to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote," he said.
Mr. Obama has appeared repeatedly before enthusiastic college crowds in recent weeks, often to emphasize his call for Congress to make sure that interest rates don't go up on student loans.
And at times, the president's speech was an echo and a distillation of his standard policy messages, touching on health care, education and alternative energy sources.
At other times, it mixed fatherly advice with thoughts of his own daughters, praise for the roles of mothers and grandmothers, and reminiscences of his younger days.
The speech's emphasis on women's issues was easily anticipated. Hours before Mr. Obama took the stage, the Republican National Committee circulated reminders using Twitter and e-mail to college graduates about how tough the job market has been for them in the past few years, blaming the Obama administration's economic policies.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama acknowledged the recession and its impact on job opportunities.
"This recession has been more brutal, the job losses steeper, politics seems nastier, Congress is more gridlocked than ever, some folks in the financial sector have been less than model citizens," he said.
But over all, the president's speech took a resolutely optimistic tone. "The question is not whether things will get better. They always do," he said.
"You may be looking toward your future with that same sense of concern that my generation did," he said, adding that as women, the graduates faced special concerns: equal pay, balancing jobs and family, reproductive health.
But "as tough as things have been, I am convinced you are tougher."
The president was on familiar ground, and it was the friendliest of audiences.
His sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, graduated from Barnard in 1993. Ten years earlier, he graduated from Columbia. ("I know there can be a little sibling rivalry here," he said.)
The graduates and others in the crowd quieted toward the end as he spoke of hope, then cheered again as he raised his oratorical tenor to speak of the fight for equal rights, for workers' rights, for the rights of gay people.
"I will join you every step of the way," Mr. Obama concluded.

HEADLINE: After $2 Billion Loss, Will JPMorgan Move to Claw Back Pay?

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: With Ina Drew and two JPMorgan Chase traders leaving in the wake of the trading loss, the question is whether JPMorgan will invoke its newly implemented clawback policy to penalize these executives. 

 BODY:
Ina Drew and two JPMorgan Chase traders are leaving in the wake of the bank's $2 billion trading loss, and others could follow. 
The question now is whether JPMorgan will invoke its newly implemented clawback policy to penalize these executives, including forcing the return of Ms. Drew's reported $14 million salary last year. 
We are on new terrain. 
Prior to the financial crisis, a clawback wasn't really an option. Bank executives and other employees kept prior compensation, even if it turned out that they bore responsibility for their institution's later billion-dollar losses. For example, Charles Prince, the former chief executive of Citigroup who left in the midst of the financial crisis, not only kept the hundreds of millions he was paid but also received a $68 million exit package.
Financial institutions were savagely criticized for these practices, the "heads I win, tails you lose" nature of Wall Street compensation. It was a problem that extended beyond the C-suite. Traders could pocket millions of dollars for strategies that later soured.
One of the most egregious examples was Joseph Cassano of the American International Group. The executive, who headed up the A.I.G. Financial Products, kept more than $300 million in salary and bonuses despite heading the group the led the insurer to near collapse. 
When things went bad during the financial crisis, many Wall Street traders pulled the eject button, escaping with millions and leaving the wreckage behind. 
In the wake of the financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to change all this by implementing clawback policies. By ensuring that prior compensation could be returned to a company, employees would act in the long-term interest of the company instead of trying to make money in the short term. The clawback ensures that employees have the right incentives and can't just run with the money. 
But the clawback policy in Dodd-Frank as adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been criticized as weak, since it only applies to the "too big to fail" banks and other financial institutions. The policy is triggered if the bank is put into insolvency proceedings and employees are found to have failed to apply their job with the "degree of skill and care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances." 
This is a legal standard and allows the employee to simply claim they made an error but acted with appropriate care. And the policy only applies to senior executives and directors, not traders. The standard is so high and the circumstances it can be used so narrow, I doubt the F.D.I.C. will ever invoke this clawback provision. 
But this does not end the matter. Regulators and institutional shareholders have been at work in the market to build on these requirements. New York's comptroller, John C. Liu, has been pushing financial institutions to adopt stronger clawback provisions, including getting Goldman Sachs to implement tougher rules. Not surprisingly, given Jamie Dimon's prior criticism of financial reform, JPMorgan resisted most assiduously although it did eventually address some of Mr. Liu's concerns.
Under JPMorgan's policy adopted in 2009, JPMorgan retains "the right to reduce current year incentives to redress any prior imbalance. . . . " In addition, prior equity compensation can be clawed back if the employee "engages in conduct that causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities" or "for members of the Operating Committee and Tier 1 employees, such employees improperly or with gross negligence fail to identify, raise, or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities."
According to Mr. Liu, JPMorgan takes the position that this clause not only applies to the business as a whole but also to various units. So it is possible that the policy could ensnare executives in the chief investment office, where the trading losses occurred. 
I do not know if any of these traders or Ms. Drew is a Tier I employee, but there is a real question whether they and others have acted in a way to trigger these policies. It is even worth asking the question whether the intelligent Mr. Dimon -- who admittedly has been upfront that this was "stupid" and has been a valuable chief executive for JPMorgan -- has acted in a way to trigger this policy as the supervisor of these people. 
JPMorgan's shareholder meeting is on May 15. No doubt shareholders will be asking whether JPMorgan rewarded these traders with termination packages, but also about clawbacks. At a minimum, the JPMorgan board has a duty to look at this issue, find out the facts are and determine the situation warrants clawbacks. Others are likely to be scrutinizing the board to make sure there is no whitewash, since these clawbacks and compensation adjustments are seen as ensuring that Wall Street does not again profit and leave others holding bag. 
We are about to see the first real test of the new post-financial crisis regime. Hopefully, Wall Street will do better this time.

HEADLINE: Job Creation vs. Profit Creation

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A new attack ad tells the story of GST Steel, and casts Mitt Romney as a "job destroyer." 

 BODY:
The Romney campaign often faults the president for concentrating on "distractions" (like whether same-sex couples deserve equal treatment under the law) instead of economic issues. Today the Obama campaign took the bait, releasing a two-minute ad that calls Mitt Romney a "job destroyer."
The ad, which will air in five battleground states, tells the story of GST Steel, a Kansas City plant that Bain Capital bought in 1993 and shuttered in 2001 after more than a century in operation - taking away more than 750 jobs. "It was like a vampire," says one man. "They came in and sucked the life out of us." "It was like watching an old friend bleed to death," says another.
By way of explanation, the Obama campaign released a statement alleging that "Romney's business strategy wasn't about strengthening companies and creating jobs for long-term economic growth. It wasn't about investors and workers playing by the same set of rules, and it certainly wasn't about creating an economy built to last by rewarding hard work and responsibility and strengthening the security of middle-class families."
You may be asking yourself: ? You have. In January, a pro-Gingrich super PAC released an anti-Romney spot called "King of Bain," which drew a distinction between the capitalism that makes America great, and Mr. Romney's special brand of predatory "corporate raiding."
Romney supporters are quick to note that Mr. Romney left Bain in 1999 to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics. That is, he left GST's bankruptcy. That's perfectly true, but Mr. Romney regularly takes credit for jobs that Bain created after his tenure. He can't have it both ways. Either he accepts responsibility for job gains and job losses, or neither.
Steven Rattner, the president's former car czar (and a contributor to our Op-Ed page), has also taken issue with the ad, calling it "unfair." He said on MSNBC this morning: "Bain Capital's responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number. It was to create profits for its investors, most of whom were pension funds and endowments and foundations. I don't think there's anything Bain Capital did that they need to be embarrassed about."
That's a pretty damning defense. Mr. Romney's pitch to voters is that he knows how to create jobs; Mr. Rattner's saying he was never responsible for creating jobs, he was responsible for creating . There's a difference, and that's exactly what the "job destroyer" ad points out.

HEADLINE: After $2 Billion Loss, JPMorgan Reshuffles Trading Group

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Matthew E. Zames, the JPMorgan executive who was tapped on Monday to replace the outgoing chief investment officer, Ina Drew, announced several top leadership changes in the unit on Monday afternoon. 

 BODY:
Several days after announcing a $2 billion loss in its chief investment office, JPMorgan Chase is clearing house.
Matthew E. Zames, the JPMorgan executive who was tapped Monday to replace the outgoing chief investment officer, Ina Drew, announced several top leadership changes in the unit on Monday afternoon, according to an internal memo obtained by DealBook. 
Achilles Macris, the executive who led the London-based group that made the ill-fated trade, will step down as chief investment officer of the European arm, according to the memo.
Rob O'Rahilly will lead the firm's chief investment office in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, while Christopher Chan will lead the office in Asia. Marie Nourie will take over the chief financial officer position within the global unit, and Chetan Bhargiri will serve as chief risk officer of the reformed group.
"I am proud of the firm's efforts over the past several days to address our mistakes and pleased to join the dedicated employees in our Chief Investment Office today," Mr. Zames wrote in the memo to employees. "Together, we will have a sharp, renewed focus on our hedging strategies, risk management and execution. JPMorgan Chase will come out of this experience as a stronger firm."
Mr. Zames, 41, is an experienced trader with a history of staring down risky situations. He served as a trader at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that blew up and had to be rescued in a 1998 bailout. He then moved to Credit Suisse before landing at JPMorgan, where he was part of the team that bought a failing Bear Stearns in 2008, at the depths of the financial crisis.
In an interview on Monday, Mr. Zames reflected on how the previous crises he had experienced, including his front-row seat for the Long-Term Capital Management implosion, had informed his view of financial risk.
"I've never forgotten the lessons of 1998," he said. "This is not all that similar to Long-Term, frankly."
Mr. Zames will be responsible for the chief investment office as it attempts to stem the losses from the botched trade. He said that although he had not been involved in the ill-fated strategy, he had confidence that it could be managed without posing a risk to JPMorgan's balance sheet.
"We're going to be prudent about any of our moves," he said. "This trade, although large, is certainly not substantial enough to cause a problem in the context of our capital."
JPMorgan's chief investment office could remain in the spotlight for weeks, as the firm tries to unwind the trade and faces questions from regulators. Mr. Zames, who was approached by the firm's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, on Friday night about taking the position atop the beleaguered group, said he had not hesitated.
"What appeals to me is helping JPMorgan and making sure the firm is moving in the right direction," he said.
Here is a copy of the memo: 
Message from Chief Investment Officer Matt Zames
I am proud of the firm's efforts over the past several days to address our mistakes and pleased to join the dedicated employees in our Chief Investment Office today.
A new leadership team has agreed to help me augment the already strong staff that will continue supporting CIO. Rob O'Rahilly will lead the CIO team in EMEA, reporting to me. Christopher Chan will continue his role leading CIO in Asia but he will report to me. Marie Nourie will become CFO of the global group, reporting jointly to Doug Braunstein and me.
Chetan Bhargiri will join our CIO management team as Chief Risk Officer, reporting to John Hogan.
As a result of these announcements, Achilles Macris will transition his CIO responsibilities.
The Global Fixed Income business is in good hands under Daniel's leadership. He has been a terrific partner. J.P. Morgan's Fixed Income unit is an integral part of the Investment Bank, and I sincerely thank all of my colleagues in the business for their dedication and outstanding performance the past seven years.
Our CIO staff is very talented, and I am excited to work with my new team. Together, we will have a sharp, renewed focus on our hedging strategies, risk management and execution. JPMorgan Chase will come out of this experience as a stronger firm.

HEADLINE: Red Flags Said to Go Unheeded by Bosses at JPMorgan

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Despite Jamie Dimon's recent apologies about the losses, which will most likely be repeated on Tuesday as JPMorgan shareholders gather for the company's annual meeting, regulators will scrutinize risk management at the chief investment office. 

 BODY:
In the years leading up to JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss, risk managers and some senior investment bankers raised concerns that the bank was making increasingly large investments involving complex trades that were hard to understand. But even as the size of the bets climbed steadily, these former employees say, their concerns about the dangers were ignored or dismissed.
An increased appetite for such trades had the approval of the upper echelons of the bank, including Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, current and former employees said.
Initially, this led to sharply higher investing profits, but they said it also contributed to the bank's lowering its guard.
 "There was a lopsided situation, between really risky positions and relatively weaker risk managers," said a former trader with the chief investment office, the JPMorgan unit that suffered the recent loss. The trader and other former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the investigations into the trading losses.
Instead, the bank maintains that the losses were largely the fault of the chief investment office. Overall tolerance for risky trading did not increase, current executives said, just the scale of the office's activities because of the bank's acquisition of Washington Mutual in 2008 and its more risky credit portfolio.
Despite Mr. Dimon's recent apologies about the losses, which will most likely be repeated on Tuesday as JPMorgan shareholders gather for the company's annual meeting in Tampa, Fla., regulators will scrutinize risk management at the chief investment office.
Top investment bank executives raised concerns about the growing size and complexity of the bets held by the bank's chief investment office as early as 2007, according to interviews with half a dozen current and former bank officials. Within the investment office, led by Ina Drew, who resigned on Monday, the bets were directed by the head of the Europe trading desk in London, Achilles Macris.
Mr. Macris, who is also expected to resign, failed to heed concerns as early as 2009 from the unit's own internal risk officer, said current and former members of the chief investment office. Mr. Macris and Ms. Drew were not available for comment.
Under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, JPMorgan Chase has long had a reputation for its strong risk-management abilities - indeed, it came through the 2008 financial crisis largely unscathed, unlike many big banks. For their part, senior bank officials on Monday disputed the assertions that the company weakened risk management in recent years while seeking higher trading profits.
Risk managers were largely sidelined by Mr. Macris, who had wide latitude and also had Ms. Drew's support, with only modest interference from her. At one point, after concerns were raised about positions assembled by Bruno Iksil, now known as the London Whale, Mr. Macris brought in a risk officer with whom he had worked closely in the past.
Risk officers are empowered to halt trades deemed too dangerous, so the coziness of the arrangement generated talk in New York as well, according to the former trader within the chief investment office.
Several bankers said that risk controls were not sufficiently strengthened by Doug Braunstein, who took over as chief financial officer in 2010, another reason the bolder trades continued.
The bank disputes that Mr. Braunstein tolerated additional risk in any way, said Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank.
David Olson, who headed up credit trading for the chief investment office until December, said that in his trading "the management was very involved and the risk controls were very strong."
Part of the breakdown in supervision, current executives said, was a fundamental disconnect between the chief investment office in London and the rest of the bank. Even within the chief investment office there were heightening concerns that the bets being made in London were incredibly complex and not fully understood by management in New York.
Despite these concerns, the scope of the chief investment's offices trades widened sharply following the acquisition of Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Not only did the bank bring with it hundreds of billions more in assets, it also owned riskier securities that needed to be hedged against. As a result, the business's investment securities portfolio rapidly grew, more than quadrupling to $356 billion in 2011, from $76.5 billion in 2007, company filing show.
Ms. Drew made presentations to the board about twice a year, one former executive recalled, "but it was just not talked about a lot," he said.
What is more, said another senior former executive, Mr. Dimon had other fires to put out, and the chief investment office wasn't a "problem child" for either top managers or the board of directors, despite its rapid expansion. Gigantic losses were piling up from bad mortgages, and new regulations were threatening the profitability of traditional banking, among other pressing matters.
All of these factors may explain why Mr. Dimon, an executive known for his ability to sense risk who also was familiar with the minutiae of his business, failed to heed the first alarm bells that were sounded in early April.
Sirens had gone off after a series of erratic trading sessions in late March resulted in big gains one day, followed by even bigger losses the next on the London trading desk of the bank's chief investment office. Mr. Dimon was convinced by Ms. Drew and her team that the turbulence was "manageable," executives said. Nor did anyone on the operating committee, of which Ms. Drew is a member, question her conclusion - in fact the full operating committee wasn't told of the scope of the problem till early last week, just days before Mr. Dimon went public.
The alarm bells were silenced in early April, but days after first-quarter earnings were reported on April 13, the erratic trading pattern continued, except this time there were few gains to offset the losses, and the red ink was flowing faster by the day.
Mr. Dimon convened a second round of checks, which soon concluded there was a ticking time bomb, but by then it was too late, a situation made worse as traders actually increased their bets instead of shrinking them, resulting in a loss that now totals more than $2 billion and threatens a management team that until now could seemingly do no wrong.
The company has indicated publicly that the losses could eventually double, depending on market conditions.
On Monday, the bank replaced Ms. Drew with Matthew E. Zames and appointed a former chief financial officer, Mike Cavanagh, to head up the task of fixing what went wrong. One of the most respected senior executives at the bank, Mr. Cavanagh has been a loyal lieutenant of Mr. Dimon since before he took over JPMorgan Chase and has been discussed as a possible successor.

HEADLINE: In Washington, Mixed Messages Over Tighter Rules for Wall St.

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and ED WYATT


HIGHLIGHT: Calls for a crackdown, which come as regulators are putting the finishing touches on the Volcker Rule and other overhaul measures, may not find many sympathetic ears in Washington. 

 BODY:
Conflicting signs are emerging in Washington over whether JPMorgan Chase's surprise trading loss will spur tighter regulation on Wall Street.
One of the banking industry's main regulators appeared to indicate that it would oppose new efforts to rein in risky Wall Street activities, while other regulators emphasized caution. Still, a Congressional committee announced plans on Monday to hold a hearing on the financial regulatory overhaul that will look at the JPMorgan loss. 
Wall Street's representatives, fearing that the entire banking industry might pay for JPMorgan's sins, are trying to contain the fallout in Washington, people close to the matter said.
When JPMorgan announced on Thursday that it had a trading loss of $2 billion that was expected to grow, some lawmakers and consumer advocates cast it as a case study on the need for stricter Wall Street oversight. The central policy, known as the Volcker Rule, would ban banks from trading with their own money, an effort to prevent bank blowups that necessitate bailouts with taxpayer money.
Yet calls for a crackdown, which come as regulators are putting the finishing touches on the Volcker Rule and other such overhauls, may not find many sympathetic ears in Washington.
The nation's main banking regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in recent days told a prominent Republican lawmaker that the Volcker Rule would not have outlawed the disastrous trade. The regulator also opined to the lawmaker, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, that it hoped the final version of the rule would not interfere with this sort of trading.
"They were adamant that hedges like these are there to make the bank safer," Mr. Corker said in an interview. The conversation occurred between Mr. Corker's staff and the "examiner in charge" of overseeing JPMorgan.
JPMorgan said it initially used the position to hedge its exposure to the broader economy - and in theory hedging is exempt under the rule. It is unclear, whether banks under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law are allowed to hedge only against specific risks rather than theoretical concerns.
In response to Mr. Corker's statements - and the firestorm they created among lawmakers on Monday - Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller, clarified that the conversations with Mr. Corker "were based on incomplete details."
"It is premature to conclude whether the Volcker Rule in the Dodd-Frank Act would have prohibited these trades," Mr. Hubbard said, noting that the Volcker Rule was "not in effect yet." Regulators plan to complete the overhaul later this year.
Still, other regulators echoed the agency's cautious tone on Monday, saying that it was too soon to tell whether the Volcker Rule would need some tweaking.
An official at one bank regulator said that the agencies drafting the rules did not provide for more exemptions than lawmakers had intended.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because regulatory discussions are not public, said the language in the proposed rule closely tracked the language of the Dodd-Frank statute, which allows banks to take steps to protect themselves against losses on an "aggregated position," or portfolios of securities. That, the official said, means banks are permitted to place broad hedges on portfolios, rather than having to match each hedge with an individual security or investment.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve said that regulators were still gathering facts about the trading losses at JPMorgan. The central bank also said it was examining whether there were similar risk problems in other corners of JPMorgan.
Mr. Corker was hesitant to judge whether the Volcker Rule would have prevented JPMorgan's trades. "I don't know," he said. Instead, Mr. Corker called for a Congressional hearing to shed light on the intricacies of the positions and the implications for the Volcker rule.
His requests were heeded. The Senate Banking Committee announced plans on Monday to hold hearings in the coming weeks into Wall Street regulation, in which the JPMorgan debacle is "expected to be discussed," the committee said.
JPMorgan, however, is stepping away from another public panel on the Volcker Rule. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the regulators writing the Volcker Rule, will host a public roundtable this month about the new regulation and has invited JPMorgan to speak. Last week, JPMorgan suggested that one of its top Volcker Rule experts would attend. But then the bank said that this person had a scheduling conflict. Rather than dispatch another executive to Washington, the banks recommended an employee at another bank.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the cancellation was unrelated to the trading loss.
Another JPMorgan official said that while the bank disagreed with some portions of the Volcker Rule, it did feel that, in their final form, the trades that caused the bank $2 billion in losses would not have been allowed under the Volcker Rule as it was intended.
While the bank said it believed that the trade started as a basic, allowable hedge under the proposed Volcker rule, "it morphed into something we should not be doing," the official said. "We don't think where it ended up would be consistent with the Volcker Rule or our standards."
 Other Wall Street companies, rather than reveling in the embarrassment of a competitor who emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed, are moving to play down the incident. Several Wall Street lobbyists interviewed for this story, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the trading blowup could not have come at a worse time as regulators put the finishing touches on their rule making .
"There is absolutely no Schadenfreude," said one lobbyist from a rival bank. "This is not a gift."

HEADLINE: Experts Say Default Would Mean Eviction

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- Could Greece default on its debt and still remain in the euro zone?
Greece's most popular politician, the firebrand left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras, has more or less said why not.
''We think it will be very hard for Europe to throw us out,'' said Euclid Tsakalotos, one of Mr. Tsipras's top economic advisers.
But that attitude defies the conventional wisdom of the country's elites, to say nothing of economists and investors the world over. For them, the notion that Europe would forgive a default remains highly unlikely. 
''Not only would Greece have to leave the euro zone, it would have to leave the European Union, too,'' said Jens Nordvig, a currency expert in New York with the investment bank Nomura.
Although a euro exit would be a seismic event politically and economically, it is something investors have long been preparing for. At a recent conference in London sponsored by Nomura, for example, 70 percent of those polled said they expected Greece to leave the euro in a year.
It was to forestall just such a default showdown that the framers of the monetary union did not even design a process by which one of the countries using the euro could withdraw from the union. And it was not because they were pie-in-the-sky thinkers who never believed that the monetary pact would be challenged.
In fact, the euro's architects were veterans of the clumsy collapse of the euro's predecessor, the European Exchange Rate mechanism. They realized that the pain of trying to survive a deep economic downturn without the elixir of a unilateral currency devaluation might tempt a country to flee -- and so they effectively barred the exits.
But the framers surely never expected a member to encounter debt problems of the magnitude of Greece's. Nor could they have known how much they would have to ask from Europe's taxpayers to keep Greece in the euro: close to 100 billion euros so far, or about $130 billion.
Now, investors are betting that if Mr. Tsipras does come to power in some way, he will force Greece's so-called troika of international lenders -- Europe, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- to cut off funds by refusing to carry out their recipe of wage and pension cuts.
''If you don't have money, you don't make the rules,'' said a troika official who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''And Greece does not have any money.''
If Greece does not get its next 30 billion euro installment of bailout money by August, default could come in a matter of months, if not sooner, once it begins to miss its bond payments.
What would happen next would be quick, and possibly brutal, said Mr. Nordvig of Nomura.
According to Mr. Nordvig, the European Central Bank's support of the Greek banking system, amounting to more than 100 billion euros, has so far been the most important factor in keeping Greece in the euro since its debt crisis began more than two years ago.
Greece has already lost more than 20 percent of its deposits via capital flight. And without the money provided by the European bank, its banks would have long ago gone bust.
If Greece were to default, Mr. Nordvig contends, Greek banks would probably be cut off from access to European Central Bank funds, and the euros in Greek banks would become effectively devalued compared with their counterparts in other European banks.
Greece would then be forced to impose capital controls and approve laws to start printing a new drachma -- not because it wanted to, but because it had to, he said. ''It just happens automatically,'' Mr. Nordvig said. ''A euro sitting in a Greek bank would not be the same as a euro in another European bank. I think we are now moving very close to this being a central case.''
In other words, a euro sitting in a Greek bank would not be perceived to have the same value as one in a German bank -- because investors would fear that Greece might suddenly freeze euro accounts and force the holders to take newly printed drachmas, which might have only 50 percent of the value of a euro.
Until now, there have been only small signs that money is fleeing the other troubled countries of the southern euro zone: Portugal, Spain and Italy. But the worry is that after a Greek default, and amid worries over bank problems in Spain, depositors in those countries could send their euros to safe German banks in gradually larger numbers.
Many government officials in Greece now believe that a Greek default would lead to an eventual exit from the euro, and that belief is a main reason they are leaning heavily toward paying a small group of investors who refused to participate in the 100 billion euro debt restructuring most other creditors agreed to in March.
Better to pay off the vulture funds, they say, with teeth clenched, than risk a default under Athens's current political turmoil.
''If you are not going to pay, you do not do so in a state of chaos,'' said Gikas Hardouvelis, an economic adviser to the departing prime minister, Lucas Papademos, who has been vocal in warning that Greece faces a euro exit -- or ejection -- if it rejects the troika's terms.
But as Mr. Tsipras's economic adviser sees it, whether Greece defaults or not is not the central issue. ''We have to convince Europeans that the problem is not Greece but the financial architecture of the euro zone,'' Mr. Tsakalotos said. ''We need a central bank that prints money, euro bonds, and a system that transfers money from rich countries to poor countries.''
A tall order indeed -- especially for a country teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Band in Fatal Hazing to Stay Off Field

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Florida A&M University's celebrated band, the Marching 100, will remain on suspension until the university can put in place strong antihazing measures, the university's president said Monday. 
The band, a moneymaker for the university because of its widely admired, elaborate halftime shows, will remain off the playing field through the 2012-13 academic year. The decision by the president, James H. Ammons, is likely to have a marked impact on the university's budget and game attendance.
The band was indefinitely suspended shortly after a drum major, Robert Champion, 26, died on Nov. 19 during hazing on a bus after a football game in Orlando. Eleven band members have been charged with felony hazing in his death and two were charged with misdemeanors.
Mr. Ammons told the board of trustees that there had not been enough time to ''restructure'' the band and ensure ''a safe environment'' for students. ''I think there is a period we should take that these measures are in place and we have addressed all the institutional issues,'' he said.
The president faced pressure from Gov. Rick Scott and Frank T. Brogan, the chancellor of the state university system, to keep the band off the field until all investigations are complete. The university is facing a criminal investigation into financial irregularities.
Members of the board agreed that this was not the time to reinstate the band. ''I'm completely satisfied,'' said Solomon Badger, the chairman. ''We are just not ready to bring the band back.''
Mr. Badger added that the suspension did not mean the university's well-known music program was being dismantled. Students will continue to be accepted into the program and scholarships will be honored, he said.
Since Mr. Champion's death, the university and its marching band have come under increasing scrutiny. Soon after the charges were announced, the university revealed that 101 of the 457 band members did not attend the university. About half of those 101 had previously attended; the other half attended other colleges but had not signed up for a Florida A&M band class, as required.
Julian White, the band's longtime director who had been fighting to keep his job, retired shortly after the discovery. Mr. White has long said he tried to combat hazing, but was met with indifference by university leaders.
Student applications for the new school year are down from previous years, said William E. Hudson Jr., vice president for student affairs. But Mr. Hudson said it was not clear what role, if any, the hazing death and its aftermath had played.
''We see the decline in applications related to several issues, including the economy and new enrollment standards'' he said. ''The band plays a role in the recruitment, but we have not received correspondence from potential students confirming the impact on their decision to attend FAMU or not.''

HEADLINE: Colleges Start to Confront Cost Burdens

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- In a wood-paneled office lined with books, sports memorabilia and framed posters (including John Belushi in ''Animal House''), E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State University, keeps a framed quotation that reads, ''If you don't like change, you're going to like irrelevance even less.''
Mr. Gee, who is often identified with a big salary and spendthrift ways, says he has taken the quotation to heart, and he is now trying to persuade Ohio State's vast bureaucracy, and the broader world of academia, to do the same.
At a time of diminished state funding for higher education and uncertain federal dollars, Mr. Gee says that public colleges and universities need to devise a new business model to pay for the costs of education, beyond sticking students with higher tuition and greater debt. 
''The notion that universities can do business the very same way has to stop,'' said Mr. Gee, who is also the chairman of a commission studying college attainment, including the impact of student debt.
College presidents across the country are confronting the same realization, trying to manage their institutions with fewer state dollars without sacrificing quality or all-important academic rankings. Tuition increases had been a relatively easy fix but now -- with the balance of student debt topping $1 trillion and an increasing number of borrowers struggling to pay -- some administrators acknowledge that they cannot keep putting the financial onus on students and their families.
Increasingly, they are looking for other ways to pay for education, stepping up private fund-raising, privatizing services, cutting staff, eliminating departments -- even saving millions of dollars by standardizing things like expense forms.
And Wall Street is watching.
Moody's Investors Service, in a report earlier this year, said it had a favorable outlook for the nation's most elite private colleges and large state institutions, those with the ''strongest market positions'' that had multiple ways to generate revenue. Ohio State, for instance, received a stable outlook from Moody's last fall, though the report cautioned about the school's debt and reliance on its medical center for revenue.
But Moody's issued a negative outlook for a majority of colleges and universities heavily dependent on tuition and state revenue.
''Tuition levels are at a tipping point,'' Moody's wrote, adding later, ''We anticipate an ongoing bifurcation of student demand favoring the highest quality and most affordable higher education options.''
Colleges can be top-heavy with administrators and woefully inefficient, some critics say, and some have only recently taken a harder look at ways to streamline their operations.
''Schools are very good at adding new things, new programs,'' said Sherideen S. Stoll, vice president for finance and administration at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. ''We are not so good at looking at things we have been doing for 20 or 30 years and saying, 'Should we be offering those academic programs?' ''
At Bowling Green, 62 percent of graduates have debt that averages $31,515, the highest among Ohio public universities that publish the data. In addition to raising tuition, which has been limited by state-mandated caps, the university has laid off employees, encouraged early retirements, required unpaid furloughs and limited pay increases, Ms. Stoll said. The belt-tightening hasn't yet reached the point that academic quality has suffered, she said, but Bowling Green may not be able to offer as much in the future.
''We've done everything and anything to try to operate much more efficiently,'' she said.
The problems aren't confined to public colleges. Administrators at some nonprofit private institutions said they too had come to realize they could not keep raising tuition and fees. Families have become more price-sensitive since the economic collapse and are seeking deeper discounts on the sticker price.
''We know the model is not sustainable,'' said Lawrence T. Lesick, vice president for enrollment management at Ohio Northern University. ''Schools are going to have to show the value proposition. Those that don't aren't going to be around.''
There is a dispute about why college costs have risen so much. Before the economic crisis, some critics argue, both public and private colleges participated in a costly ''arms race'' to provide better amenities to lure the best students and faculty: new dormitories with one student to a room, frequent sabbaticals for professors, upscale cafeteria food, expanded counseling services and gymnasiums that rival the fanciest health clubs in Manhattan.
Others say education is intrinsically expensive. Health care costs, for instance, have taken a toll, since colleges are labor-intensive. And the expense of keeping up with technology, like wireless Internet and new computers, is high. Here at Ohio State, where tuition has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2002, there is a gleaming new student union, climbing walls that can accommodate 50 students at a time and $2 billion in construction projects under way.
Mr. Gee's compensation package this year, moreover, is worth about $2 million, and The Chronicle of Higher Education has called him the highest-paid public university president. The Dayton Daily News recently reported that Mr. Gee had billed Ohio State for $550,000 in travel in the last two years.
The travel expenses prompted some to question if Mr. Gee practices what he preaches.
''He's very capable. He's a very smart guy, and he's engaging and all these things,'' said Dale Butland, a spokesman for Innovation Ohio, a nonprofit policy research group. But he added, ''Students and their parents who are struggling, not just with coming up with the money, but paying off the debt, I think there is a disconnect between what they are being asked to do and what they are seeing the leader of the university doing.''
Mr. Gee maintains that Ohio State is getting its money's worth. On his watch, Ohio State has become a more prestigious university, he says, while remaining a relative bargain, even with fewer resources from the state. It now receives just 7 percent of its budget from the state.
Ohio State costs about $25,000 a year for in-state residents who live on campus. The average debt for graduates who borrow is $24,480.
A lanky 68-year-old who is known for his bow ties, horn-rimmed glasses and sometimes zany antics (he has shown up, unannounced, at 21st birthday parties for his students, which he finds on Facebook), Mr. Gee has had the top job at five universities, including twice at Ohio State. He returned to the Columbus campus in 2007 after stints at Brown and Vanderbilt. Mr. Gee acknowledges that college affordability and student debt are growing problems that university presidents long ignored. He said they now needed to address them quickly.
''We have not been as conscious about costs as we should be, and that has now come home to roost,'' he said.
Like many other college presidents, Mr. Gee has set about trying to make Ohio State's highly decentralized bureaucracy more efficient. He said he planned to find $1 billion in inefficient spending in the university's $5 billion budget over the next five years and redirect the money toward priorities.
''We are like Noah's Ark,'' he said. ''We do two of everything.''
The university saved $20 million simply by switching to common vendors for pens, copiers and overnight shipping; previously Ohio State's 14 colleges chose their own. Creating a common expense report will save $75 million.
''When I got here, I asked to see their long-term financial model, and they brought me a paper for one year, and I said, 'What?' '' said Geoff Chatas, a former banker whom Mr. Gee hired in 2010 as chief financial officer. ''Now we have a 15-year plan.''
Mr. Gee said he was considering selling off Ohio State's airport and golf courses, and he might privatize campus parking, though faculty members are balking at the idea. Last year, Ohio State became the first public university to issue a 100-year bond, for $500 million.
He is also is trying to beef up Ohio State's enrollment of out-of-state and international students, who bring in more tuition revenue and higher test scores. And, he is pressing donors for more money, a task in which he is particularly skilled.
At a ceremony to honor a $100 million donation from Leslie Wexner, the clothing magnate and Ohio State graduate, Mr. Gee choked back tears.
''Every time I get a lot of money I cry,'' Mr. Gee told the crowd. ''And I got a lot of tears left.''

HEADLINE: Fiscal Woes Boomerang for Brown in California

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- By this point in his tenure, Gov. Jerry Brown had hoped to have dispensed with the huge budget shortfalls that greeted him when he took office. Yet on Monday, there was Mr. Brown in a familiar, if uncomfortable, position: calling for severe spending cuts, this time to deal with a new $15.7 billion shortfall.
Mr. Brown's campaign to persuade voters in California, the birthplace of the antitax movement, to vote for tax increases to head off even more cuts seemed at one point to have a good chance of winning. But now it is threatened by a rival tax plan that went onto the ballot after Mr. Brown was unable to persuade its organizers to stand down.
And what is perhaps the most prominent nonbudgetary initiative on Mr. Brown's docket -- a high-speed rail line to whisk riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the kind of legacy project identified with his father, Gov. Pat Brown -- is embattled as well, facing rising opposition and questions about its feasibility and cost. 
These are not easy days for Mr. Brown, a Democrat, as he approaches the midpoint of his term. The promises of his election -- to end partisan wrangling, to deal with budget problems that have hamstrung the government of the world's ninth-largest economy, to establish his own legacy as he approaches the end of his career -- have to date been largely frustrated. After a long and varied career in public life, Mr. Brown, 74, finds himself stymied by a governing system that seems impervious to his considerable skills and a budget that defies his vision of the state as a sunny engine of continued growth and reinvention.
''The system he has inherited is a very difficult one,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a longtime adviser to Republican governors here. ''Part of the problem is the political culture. But part of the problem might be Brown himself, in that he can't seem to close a deal. Does he lack negotiating skills, the bullying capacity to get people to come around?''
The budget has proved to be the most troubling issue of Mr. Brown's first years and it has hijacked much of his time, as his aides worried it would when he took office facing a $26 billion shortfall.
On Monday, Mr. Brown announced that the shortfall had shot up again, from $9.2 billion in January, blaming a drop in revenue caused by a bad economy and court rulings barring spending cuts the state had approved. He proposed $8.3 billion in cuts, slashing welfare, social services and health care for the elderly, and a 5 percent cut in hours for state employees.
Mr. Brown said that unless voters this November approved his temporary tax increases, including a quarter-percent increase in the sales tax and an income tax surcharge on the wealthy, the state would have to slash another $6 billion in January, most of it from public schools and the state's once-celebrated higher education system.
''The fact is, California has been living beyond its means,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The United States of America and its federal government has been living beyond its means. This is a day of reckoning, and we have to take the medicine.''
To complicate things, relations between Mr. Brown and his Democratic colleagues have shown signs of strain, particularly after Mr. Brown said lawmakers should ''man up'' and begin cutting at the first sign of revenue shortfalls. ''There is always institutional tension between the legislative branch and the governor's branch,'' said Darrell Steinberg, the Senate leader. ''I find myself saying some of the same things I was saying three years ago when talking about a different governor.''
''Though we've disagreed at times -- and I'm sure we'll have some disagreements this time -- I can't fault him for the way he has laid out the problems,'' he said.
It is two years into Mr. Brown's term, and this current and former governor has, over the course of the past half-century, regularly defied people who have written him off. He is as intellectually nimble as ever, serving up, even on this day of gloomy news, some classic Brownian turns of phrase -- ''It's a pretzel palace of incredible complexity,'' he said of the budget -- and sparring with a reporter who suggested that the high revenue estimates Mr. Brown had put out earlier were the same kind of budgetary tricks he had denounced as a candidate.
And Mr. Brown denied the suggestion that the budget had distracted him from dealing with other issues, pointing to the realignment of the prison system and his promise to unveil a plan to deal with the state's water system.
''I've been here a long time,'' he said. ''I know what the hell I'm doing. I'm a truthful guy.''
But after this troubled spring, the vote on the tax initiative is now assuming an outsize importance, both for the state and for Mr. Brown. A defeat would most likely curb Mr. Brown's influence, and might even invite a primary challenge from a younger generation of Democrats who have been waiting in the wings.
''In the drama of his governorship, it's been elevated to something of pretty serious importance,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director of the Edmund G. ''Pat'' Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University.
In many ways, it is hard to fault Mr. Brown: he is one in a long line of governors who have struggled in a state that defies conventional political management. He is torn between Democrats who are extremely reluctant to impose cuts and Republicans who have refused to give him the votes needed to pass a tax increase. (Under California law, a two-thirds majority is needed to raise taxes.)
After all these years in office, and all these cries of armageddon, Mr. Brown finds it hard to break through to voters, who have seen budgetary crises come and go. As engaging as he is, Mr. Brown has never had the flair for showmanship exhibited by his predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr. Brown never enjoyed the same kind of political tail wind that Mr. Schwarzenegger received, and his election -- while solid -- did not offer any obvious mandate.
Dr. Sonenshein said he thought that this was mainly a budgetary problem, and one that could pass.
''The good news for him is all this is happening in May and we are about to head into the summer, when people are not spending a lot of time paying attention to what is happening in government,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bronx Lawmaker Seeks a Sharp Contrast With His Disgraced Predecessor

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Former state senators from one particularly hapless section of the northwest Bronx have something in common on their resumes: one went to jail, another is still in jail and a third now faces jail.
But Senator Gustavo Rivera said he would not follow in the footsteps of predecessors like Israel Ruiz Jr., who was expelled from the State Senate in 1989 after being convicted of bank fraud, or Efrain Gonzalez Jr., who was sentenced to seven years in prison for corruption in 2010. Mr. Rivera does not even like to mention the man he ousted, Pedro Espada Jr., who was found guilty of theft on Monday for siphoning money from a Bronx health clinic that paid for lobster dinners, flowers and spa treatments, among other things.
''At first, I was the guy who beat Espada,'' said Mr. Rivera, 36, an adjunct college professor and former political aide who defeated Mr. Espada by nearly two to one in a 2010 Democratic primary. ''My goal after six months was to make sure that my name and his name were separate. I don't mention him by name. I call him 'my predecessor' or 'Mr. Past Tense' or 'Captain Knucklehead.' '' 
The freshman senator is seeking to make a name for himself as an honest politician in the Bronx, a place that seems cursed with more than its share of crooks, both in and out of elected office. New York's poorest borough remains desperately in need of unimpeachable leaders to reverse the ravages of chronic crime, unemployment and health problems, but it has instead been brought low time and again by an entrenched culture of self-interest and corruption that has benefited a handful of political elites at the expense of its 1.4 million residents.
Upon learning of Mr. Espada's conviction, Mr. Rivera said his priority since being elected had been to restore his constituents' faith in government. ''It is a sad day for Bronxites when someone who supposedly represented them is convicted of a crime, especially if that crime directly violates the public's trust,'' he said.
Within weeks of arriving in Albany, Mr. Rivera, hard to miss in pastel-colored shirts and paisley ties, proposed a bill requiring public officials to provide more detailed information about their outside income and clients. Though the bill never came up for a vote, similar language was later included in an ethics reform package championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and passed by the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
''I've been saying in class for years that we need to demand more from the people who represent us, not less,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''The things I might have said, I get to do now.''
It is too early to tell if Mr. Rivera, who is seeking re-election this fall, will keep his promises, but his colleagues and their aides described him as hardworking, passionate and ethically scrupulous to the point that he does not allow lobbyists or special-interest groups to buy him a beer. ''There are many people who say one thing to get elected and do another once they're in office,'' said Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who has served in the Legislature for more than a decade. ''Gustavo is not among them. He is true to his word.''
As a junior member of the minority party in the Senate, Mr. Rivera has attracted little interest from Senate Republicans or other potential critics. But though he has not yet had any bills passed into law, he has sought other ways to advance his ideas. For instance, he has worked with Governor Cuomo's aides on a new requirement that state agencies provide interpretation and translation services for non-English speakers, and on a proposed law to allow charitable organizations to post bail for those who cannot afford it.
In keeping with his push for transparent government, Mr. Rivera has also made much of his private life public. He led a campaign against obesity in which he was weighed publicly once a month at health fairs as he shed 27 pounds; the newspaper El Diario ran before-and-after pictures of him on its Sept. 28 cover.
Next month, he will introduce financial literacy classes inspired by his own struggles with low credit when he applied for a car loan. At the time, his credit score was 570 out of 850: the result of living for years from one paycheck to the next, he said. He added that after tighter budgeting, his score had risen to 615.
Mr. Rivera, who reported earning $99,064 in government pay and reimbursements and $3,075 for teaching a government class at Pace University last year, lives alone in the same rent-stabilized building in Kingsbridge Heights that he moved into in 2000 as a graduate student at the City University of New York. He upgraded last year to a one-bedroom from a studio, increasing his rent by $300 to $1,200. His one splurge since taking office was $26,000 for a Mazda 6 (an American-made model; Mr. Rivera is a staunch union supporter) to drive himself to and from Albany.
''Senator Rivera has been a breath of fresh air,'' said Kenny Agosto, a Democratic district leader in the Bronx who added that he was disgusted by the revelations of Mr. Espada's misspending of taxpayer money. ''He doesn't treat the job as if it's his power. He's a temporary holder of it, and he knows it.''
One day this spring, Mr. Rivera turned heads while bounding down a working-class stretch of the Grand Concourse in a natty gray pinstripe suit and a lavender shirt, with a fedora perched on his cleanshaven head. Mr. Rivera -- who is not related to Jose Rivera, the patriarch of a leading political family in the Bronx -- introduced himself in Spanish, then in English, to a couple of men standing on the curb and handed out business cards. ''If you guys ever need anything,'' he said, ''stop by, O.K.?''
Mr. Rivera said he wanted people to know he was one of them. Mr. Espada used to appear in public with bodyguards and an entourage; Mr. Rivera has neither. When Mr. Rivera recently stopped by a 99-cent store, another shopper asked, ''What are you doing here?'' Mr. Rivera held up a package of toilet paper.
He and his aides said they had rebuilt the State Senate office over the past 16 months, after inheriting just two cardboard boxes of constituent cases from Mr. Espada but none of his staff members or contacts and not even his office, which was outside the district. During the campaign, they recalled, Mr. Espada acted as if Mr. Rivera -- a former aide to Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a United States senator -- were a young upstart who showed no respect for him.
Local residents have been surprised by some of Mr. Rivera's efforts, including the free civics classes he taught at public libraries to encourage more involvement in local government.
''It saddens me a little that the expectations for some are so low that honestly, I could have showed up and smiled a couple times and that would have been enough,'' he said.
Anna Rodriguez, 52, a housekeeper who voted for Mr. Rivera, said he had shown that he was honest and cared about the community. ''I've seen that he's doing his job and he's working out well,'' she said.
Then Ms. Rodriguez qualified her assessment. ''Until now,'' she said. ''When people leave office, that's when you hear bad things. That's when everything comes out.''

HEADLINE: At JPMorgan, 'Perfect Hedge' Still Elusive

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
At JPMorgan Chase, they called it ''the icing'' - as in the icing on the cake.
The bank's chief investment office - the one that incurred the $2 billion trading loss - was responsible for managing the firm's risk.
It was supposed to place trades, including by hedging, to keep the firm from losing money.
But part of the group's job may have been at odds with its stated goal of reducing risk: it was also supposed to turn its ''hedging'' trades into a tidy profit. That's the part they called the icing.
As investors, regulators and policy makers try to deconstruct the trading blunder at JPMorgan, it is worth revisiting the debate over the very definition of hedging. 
That definition is a crucial ingredient in the long-running battle in Washington over the proposed Volcker Rule, legislation aimed at curbing banks from making speculative bets. Or to put that in plain English, separating the casino from the bank. Yet the law leaves wiggle room for Wall Street firms to make trades as long as their intent is to ''hedge'' the firm from potential losses. (The banks, often led by JPMorgan, fought hard for that wiggle room.)
Critics of the language in the bill have long contended it is a gaping loophole that allows firms to continue to make speculative bets under the guise of it being part of a ''hedging'' program.
Indeed, JPMorgan's problem trade increasingly makes it seem as if it was not a ''hedge'' at all but a speculative bet. That's the only way to account for the $2 billion loss. If it was a perfect hedge - when one asset goes up in value, the other goes down - the bank would have neither made nor lost any money.
And therein lies the problem: hedging by its very nature is at some level a gamble. It is never perfect.
''I don't think you can hedge without taking a risk,'' said Dina Dublon, a former JPMorgan chief financial officer who worked at the firm for 22 years alongside Ina Drew, who ran the chief investment office and tearfully resigned on Monday. Ms. Dublon left JPMorgan in 2004 and now is a board member of Microsoft, Accenture and PepsiCo. Ms. Dublon said that Ms. Drew always managed her group with the intent of hedging, but also being a ''profit center.'' And up until this failed trade, she did it quite successfully.
Paul Hsi, head of United States credit research at Morgan Stanley, put the hedging debate this way: ''The idea of risk management is an oxymoron. You can try to measure the amount of potential risk in your portfolio, but the only way to really 'manage' risk is by either taking more of it or taking less of it.''
It's also worth noting that this ''mess'' is not actually much of a mess for the firm in terms of dollars and cents; the firm is still expected to make $4 billion this quarter. The reason that JPMorgan's loss matters at all is the larger context: if this bank, known for being the best risk manager on Wall Street, could lose this amount of money on a bad trade, what about other firms?
In the process of writing and rewriting the Volcker Rule over the last two years, the banks pushed hard to be allowed to hedge risk related to ''market-making'' and to ''portfolio hedging.'' Market-making is when a firm acts as buyer or seller to help facilitate a trade for a client. The banks actually made a persuasive case that if they are going to take risks for clients, they should be able to seek to hedge each trade individually.
However, they also sought an exemption for something much more expansive: ''portfolio hedging.'' In other words, they wanted the ability to try to hedge their entire firm's portfolio against macroeconomic factors. And that's where JPMorgan's botched trade comes in.
So let's discuss how JPMorgan got in this mess in the first place. Here's an overly simplistic primer, but you'll probably get the idea: The company's chief investment office originally made a series of trades intended to protect the firm from a possible global slowdown. JPMorgan owns billions of dollars in corporate bonds, so if a slowdown were to occur and corporations couldn't pay back their debt, those bonds would have lost value.
To mitigate that possibility, JPMorgan bought insurance - credit-default swaps - that would go up in value if the bonds fell in value.
But sometime last year, with the economy doing better than expected, the bank decided it had bought too much insurance. Rather than simply selling the insurance, the bank set up a second ''hedge'' to bet that the economy would continue to improve - and this time, traders overshot, by a lot.
Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, said of the trade on ''Meet the Press'': ''We know we were sloppy. We know we were stupid.'' Senior executives at the bank say privately that the trade should have never been made; they even concede that it looks like a proprietary trade - which the Volcker Rule would explicitly prohibit - rather than a ''hedge.''
''The key conceptual point is probably whether the transactions would have been viewed as true hedges under the final version of the Volcker Rule,'' Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote on Monday. ''In theory, this was an intelligent risk-reducing activity, if executed sensibly, as was apparently not the case here. Incompetence of execution would presumably not trigger the Volcker Rule, if the intent were truly to hedge.''
But nearly four years after the financial crisis, we shouldn't have to worry about whether a series of mistaken trades (and I'm being polite) can create a hole in a balance sheet and a risk to the system. (The good news, by the way, is that in the case of JPMorgan, the bank is large enough to withstand the loss.)
We shouldn't need to try to divine whether a bank is really seeking to ''hedge'' its risk or making a big bet.
''The notion that you can very clearly draw a line between propriety risk-taking and hedging is a very difficult notion to implement,'' Ms. Dublon said.
Ultimately, if there's any lesson at all in this story, it is a lesson we all already know: you can't have your cake and eat it - and the icing - too.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hawaii's Beaches Are in Retreat, and Its Way of Life May Follow

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Little by little, Hawaii's iconic beaches are disappearing.
Most beaches on the state's three largest islands are eroding, and the erosion is likely to accelerate as sea levels rise, the United States Geological Survey is reporting.
Though average erosion rates are relatively low -- perhaps a few inches per year -- they range up to several feet per year and are highly variable from island to island and within each island, agency scientists say. The report says that over the last century, about 9 percent of the sandy coast on the islands of Hawaii, Oahu and Maui has vanished. That's almost 14 miles of beach. 
The findings have important implications for public safety, the state's multibillion-dollar tourism economy and the way of life Hawaiians treasure, said Charles H. Fletcher, who led the work for the agency.
''This is a serious problem,'' said Dr. Fletcher, a geologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
Sea level does not rise uniformly around the world, and so far, Dr. Fletcher and other geologists said in interviews, Hawaii has escaped some of the rise that has occurred elsewhere as earth's climate warms. But that situation is unlikely to continue, the report says.
Hawaii's geological history also leaves it unusually vulnerable. The islands formed, one by one, as a tectonic plate carrying them moved to the northwest over a ''hot spot,'' where a plume of molten lava pushes through the seafloor. Over the millenniums, this material cools, accumulates and eventually rises above the waves. (Loihi, an underwater -- for now -- mountain southeast of the island of Hawaii, is the latest to undergo this process.)
But once the slow plate movement carries an island away from the hot spot, its volcanic material begins to compress, causing the island to start to sink, worsening its erosion prospects.
The new analysis, ''National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change in the Hawaiian Islands,'' is the latest in a series of reports the geological survey has produced for the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, California and some of Alaska. Over all, their findings are similar: ''They all show net erosion to varying degrees,'' said Asbury H. Sallenger Jr., a coastal scientist for the agency who leads the work.
He said the studies aimed to establish a baseline from which scientists could ''really assess what sea level rise actually does in the future to our coasts.''
S. Jeffress Williams, another scientist with the agency, said researchers had over the years produced a number of studies of Hawaii's shorelines, using various methods of data collection and analysis. ''Many were well done, but it is sort of mixing apples and oranges,'' he said, referring to the need to adopt standard study methods. The new work aims to allow researchers to compare data from states around the country.
And though it seems self-evident that erosion must be tied to rising seas, ''you have to document it,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Sea level rise is only one of the driving forces that control what happens at the shoreline.'' For example, he said, on a beach that receives a steady influx of sand, ''you can have marginal erosion or stable or even accreting shorelines.''
But that is not ordinarily the case in Hawaii, where the typical response to erosion has been to protect buildings with sea walls and other coastal armor. ''It's the default management tool,'' Dr. Fletcher said. But in Hawaii, as nearly everywhere else this kind of armor has been tried, it results in the degradation or even loss of the beach, as rising water eventually meets the wall, drowning the beach.
He suggested planners in Hawaii look to American Samoa, where, he said, ''it's hard to find a single beach. It has been one sea wall after another.''
But the most common alternative approach, replenishing beaches with pumped-in sand, is difficult in Hawaii, where good-quality sand can cost 10 times as much as it does on the East Coast, Mr. Williams said.
Dr. Fletcher said he believes the answer lies in encouraging people to move buildings and other infrastructure away from the shoreline, a strategy coastal scientists call retreat. ''If we want beaches we have to retreat from the ocean,'' he said. But, he added. ''It's easy to say retreat; it's much harder to implement it.''
Dr. Sallenger said he hoped the work in Hawaii and elsewhere would help policy makers.
''We don't define what rules and laws are written about coasts and exactly how they are managed,'' he said, ''but this is information that can be factored into that process.''

HEADLINE: An Environmental Crusader's Newest Goal: Congress

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
In the name of living his New York City life with as little environmental impact as possible, Colin Beavan embarked on a punishing project five years ago. He and his family stopped taking the elevator to their ninth-floor Manhattan apartment; they did their laundry by stomping on it in the tub; for about six months, they even went without electricity at home. Mr. Beavan called the project No Impact Man, scored a book deal and became the subject of a documentary.
Now, Mr. Beavan is engaged in an endeavor that may be even more punishing: a run for Congress on the Green Party ticket. His platform is as much about getting New Yorkers engaged in politics, promoting local businesses and reducing economic dependence on corporations as it is about fossil fuels. But it was the actions that mostly took place in his apartment five years ago that put him on the radar of Green Party activists who eventually recruited him to run. 
So how does No Impact Man live now? A resident of Brooklyn, Mr. Beavan is careful to turn off the lights when he leaves a room, but he again uses a refrigerator. He will not buy an air-conditioner, but his windows are lined with fans. He still composts, but instead of feeding trash to worms in his apartment, he puts the garbage in his freezer until he can take it to a nearby community garden.
He refused to discuss his use of a sensitive product eschewed during the project: toilet paper.
All told, however, his daily environmental activities look far less eccentric, and much more like the habits of a familiar, if very committed, Brooklyn type who commutes by bike and buys local food.
''Five years ago, that wasn't the case,'' he said as he strolled through his neighborhood. ''Things have changed.''
And while his own approach has become more practical, No Impact Man is still in there: Many New Yorkers may dream of brownstone stoops and penthouse views, but Mr. Beavan says his real estate aspirations are for a communal-living situation in Brooklyn, or perhaps on a piece of land upstate dotted with yurts.
As he walked toward the front of his apartment building, he looked toward a neighbor's illuminated window and added, ''That's not my light that's burning with nobody home.''
When Mr. Beavan moved to New York City as an adult in the 1990s -- he was born here but grew up in Massachusetts -- he lived in Stuyvesant Town, and though he studied energy production and distribution while earning a Ph.D. at the University of Liverpool, the environment was not much of a concern in his fourth-floor apartment.
''I always took the elevator up,'' he said, apparently without shame, sipping iced coffee out of a pint glass. ''I didn't walk, and neither did anybody else.''
Next, he moved in with the woman who would become his wife, Michelle Conlin -- who comes off in the documentary as the ultimate good sport. They are now living separately; Mr. Beavan said his environmental zeal was not the reason.
It was in a one-bedroom co-op on lower Fifth Avenue that, in the name of the project, they lived by candlelight and tried to keep milk cold in a contraption made essentially from giant flowerpots and sand. (The result, as you might imagine, was curdled milk.)
''Walking up and down the stairs was hard,'' Mr. Beavan acknowledged, ''especially one time when the dog had diarrhea and it was up and down, and up and down.''
Today, Mr. Beavan, 48, makes his living as a full-time activist, speaking and writing about environmental issues and running a nonprofit group called No Impact Project. He lives in a small two-bedroom duplex rental at the top of a brick town house in Clinton Hill, an apartment with white walls, sparse decoration and a king-size mattress on the floor in his bedroom because he could not find a secondhand bed frame. (''I went to Ikea,'' he said, but he left empty-handed. ''I just couldn't do it.'') A bed made of salvaged wood is being built for him now.
The couple that owns the property -- a parks department official and an environmental lawyer -- and the building itself share his values. The roof is painted silver to reflect light and keep it cool, the insulation is made from recycled fibers, the white oak floors are re-milled and the cabinetry is formaldehyde free. The landlords, Mr. Beavan explained, were one of the attributes that made the apartment so appealing.
''Having people that share values with me in my personal and private life is very important to me,'' he said. ''So at the end of the day, you go home to people who understand why you're putting your trash in the freezer.''
Mr. Beavan is running for the seat in central Brooklyn that is being vacated by Representative Edolphus Towns, a 15-term Democrat. Mr. Beavan's opponents include Charles Barron, a Democratic city councilman and a longtime resident of East New York, and Alan Bellone, a Republican who runs a business printing T-shirts and lives in Sheepshead Bay with his wife, children and mother-in-law. But the candidate widely considered to have the best chance of winning is Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries.
Mr. Jeffries lives in a three-bedroom condominium in a shiny new apartment building in Prospect Heights, which he bought about five years ago. (Mr. Beavan says he cannot even bring himself to buy a new cellphone.) Although Mr. Jeffries does recycle, according to a spokeswoman, he does not compost.
But even Mr. Beavan's wife, a journalist who lives in Boerum Hill -- their daughter, Isabella, 7, shuttles between the two -- says she has fallen down on composting and such, though she has resisted buying a television.
''Full disclosure: I have backslid some since the No Impact project,'' Ms. Conlin wrote in an e-mail. ''Bad No Impacter!''
Ultimately, however, Mr. Beavan and other activists say the solution to climate change and environmental issues lies not only in a devotion to bicycles and buckets full of worms, but also in policy decisions.
''People tend to concentrate on, 'Do you compost? Do you buy secondhand?' '' he said. ''Well, yes, but those things aren't going to sort us all out. What's going to sort us out is all of us deciding that we're responsible for the culture that we live in.''
Let the campaign begin.

HEADLINE: End of the Affair?

 BODY:
Investors are shunning the stock market, and who can blame them? As serial bubbles have burst, faith in the market has been rewarded with shattered retirements. At the same time, trust has been destroyed by scandals and -- as demonstrated by the reckless trading at JPMorgan Chase -- the slow, uncertain pace of financial reform. 
There has been less buying and selling of stock, and there have been huge outflows of investor dollars from domestic stock mutual funds, as detailed recently by The Times's Nathaniel Popper. If the trend continues, the result could be a less robust market, with fewer companies opting to raise money by issuing shares and fewer investors willing to put their retirement savings into stocks.
Policy makers should pay attention. Evidence suggests that investors are not merely reacting to tough conditions, but rather are staying away because they do not trust the market. Restoring trust is crucial to restoring the market.
American stocks have doubled in price since the market hit bottom three years ago. But trading in the United States stock market has not only failed to recover since the 2008 financial crash, it has continued to fall. In April, average daily trades stood at 6.5 billion, about half their peak four years ago. By comparison, after the market busts of 1987 and 2001, trading recovered within two years. In fact, going back to 1960, trading had never declined for three consecutive years, let alone four and counting.
Investors haven't just hunkered down, they have headed for the exits. Since the start of 2008, domestic stock mutual funds, a common way for individuals to invest, were drained of more than $400 billion, compared with an inflow of $52 billion in the four years before that.
These investors have increasingly opted for bonds over stocks, with reason. From the peak of the dot-com era in March 2000, stocks have risen about 10 percent, a paltry gain once fees, taxes and risks are factored in. Stocks are still down about 5 percent from the peak in October 2007, even with prices doubling since mid-2009.
There is also the feeling that the market has become increasingly unfair to investors. For example, Mr. Popper also reported recently on rebates to brokers from stock exchanges. In general, brokers are required to find the best prices for clients who pay them to buy and sell shares. But with the nation's 13 exchanges now paying brokers for sending them business, brokers may have an incentive to search for the biggest rebate rather than the best price. A new study has estimated that rebates could be costing mutual funds, pension funds and individual investors as much as $5 billion a year.
Also known as ''maker-taker'' pricing, the rebates have caught the attention of market researchers and investor advocates, including two former economists for the Securities and Exchange Commission who issued a report in 2010 saying that ''in other contexts, these payments would be recognized as illegal kickbacks.''
So add rebates to to the S.E.C.'s long list of market issues to be investigated. In the meantime, they are a reminder that brokers often do not have an obligation to act in a client's best interest -- and that efforts to change the law to put a client's interest first have been repeatedly defeated in the face of industry pressure.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Worries Over Greece and JPMorgan

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; David Jolly reported from Paris.

 BODY:
The political stalemate in Greece rattled financial markets worldwide on Monday, sending stocks lower in the United States.
The euro sank to a three-month low against the dollar, and borrowing costs for Spain and Italy jumped as bond traders anticipated that financial troubles could spread beyond Greece. Investors dumped risky assets for the safety of the Treasury market, pushing yields to their lowest levels this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 125.25 points, or 1 percent, to close at 12,695.35. The Dow has lost more than half its gains for the year in the last two weeks as worries have resurfaced about Europe and the strength of the American economy. 
In Athens, talks to form a government dragged into a second week. The uncertainty has raised concerns that Greece could miss a debt payment and drop out of the euro currency. The worry is that if Greece leaves the currency union, bond traders might demand steeper borrowing rates from other troubled countries and push them deeper into debt.
The turmoil could easily spread to the United States through the banking system. ''The large banks are globally connected,'' said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.'' The concrete fear is that if Greece exits the euro, that would hurt European banks. They'll pull back lending to U.S. banks and then they'd be in worse shape.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.04 points. or 1.1 percent, to 1,338.35. The Nasdaq composite index sank 31.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,902.58.
The losses swept across the market. All 10 of the industry groups within the S.& P. 500 fell.
JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss continued to hang over bank stocks. JPMorgan dropped 3 percent after the news that the executive overseeing its trading strategy would step down. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, two banks with large trading operations, fell more than 4 percent.
The loss to JPMorgan appears ''manageable,'' said Matt Freund, a portfolio manager at USAA Investments. ''But people are looking at other banks and wondering who's going to be next? What else could be lurking?''
Major markets in Europe plunged. The main stock indexes in France and Germany both lost about 2 percent, while those in Italy and Spain fell nearly 3 percent. Traders shifted money into the safety of United States Treasury bonds, pushing their prices up and their yields down. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 21/32, to 99 27/32, while its yield dropped to a low for the year of 1.77 percent, compared with 1.84 percent late Friday.
Since hitting its high for the year on May 1, the Dow has been on a slide. The Dow's 1.7 percent loss last week was its worst since Dec. 16.
Despite the broad market decline, some stocks posted gains. Chesapeake Energy rose 4.8 percent on reports that the activist investor Carl C. Icahn had bought a stake in the company. Chesapeake's chief executive said he would welcome an investment by Mr. Icahn, who is known for shaking up companies.
Yahoo gained 2 percent after it replaced its chief executive, Scott Thompson, on Sunday.
The electronics retailer Best Buy rose 1.5 percent after the company's founder, Richard M. Schulze, said that he would step down as chairman. An investigation found that he had known the company's chief executive was having a relationship with a female employee but did not tell the board's audit committee.

HEADLINE: Deadliest Danger Isn't at the Rig but on the Road

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
After working 17 hours straight at a natural gas well in Ohio, Timothy Roth and three other crew members climbed into their company truck around 10 o'clock one night last July and began their four-hour drive back to their drilling service company's shop in West Virginia.
When they were just 10 minutes from home, the driver fell asleep at the wheel. The truck veered off the highway and slammed into a sign that sheared off part of the vehicle's side, killing Mr. Roth.
About two months before the fatal crash, Mr. Roth nearly died in a similar accident when another co-worker with the same company fell asleep at the wheel after a long shift and ran the company's truck into a pole. In 2009, Mr. Roth's employer was penalized in New York, Pennsylvania and Utah for violations like ''requiring or permitting'' its oil field truckers to drive after working for 14 hours, the legal limit. 
Over the past decade, more than 300 oil and gas workers like Mr. Roth were killed in highway crashes, the largest cause of fatalities in the industry. Many of these deaths were due in part to oil field exemptions from highway safety rules that allow truckers to work longer hours than drivers in most other industries, according to safety and health experts.
Many oil field truckers say that while these exemptions help them earn more money, they are routinely used to pressure workers into driving after shifts that are 20 hours or longer.
''Just because you are on an oil field site does not make you any less vulnerable to the effects of fatigue!'' Garr Farrell, an oil service driver in Ore City, Tex., wrote last year to federal highway safety regulators. In his letter, Mr. Farrell complained that his managers had used the oil field exemptions to force him to wait, without anywhere to sleep, for 36 hours at one well site before he could unload his drilling supplies and get back on the highway.
Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board said it ''strongly opposed'' the oil field exemptions because they raise the risk of crashes.
This threat will grow substantially in coming years, safety advocates warn. According to federal officials, more than 200,000 new oil and gas wells will be drilled nationwide over the next decade. And the drilling technique used at more than 90 percent of these wells, known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, leads to far more trucks on the road -- roughly 500 to 1,500 truck trips per well -- than traditional drilling, partly because fracking requires millions of gallons of water per well.
The new drilling has been an economic boon to the country, adding millions of dollars in local tax revenues and royalty payments and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, many of them providing high pay to unskilled laborers in areas with double-digit unemployment.
But the jobs are also hazardous, with fatality rates that are seven times the national average across all industries. Nearly a third of the 648 deaths of oil field workers from 2003 through 2008 were in highway crashes, according to the most recent data analyzed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By contrast, highway crashes caused roughly a fifth of workplace fatalities across all industries in 2010.
''The growth of this industry is a big concern because it's adding so many more trucks on the roads and its drivers don't have to follow the same rules as others,'' said Henry Jasny, a lawyer for Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
Bending the Rules
In 2005, as the drilling boom accelerated, federal labor officials noticed a worrisome trend: fatalities among oil and gas workers rose 15 percent from 2003 to 2004. After investigating, the C.D.C. found that with the growth of the industry, not only were more workers dying but, more surprising, the fatality rate was increasing, meaning the relative risk was rising. Shifts grew longer, more inexperienced workers were hired and older rigs were being pressed into service, the agency concluded.
''Unless changes are made to increase worker safety, the high fatality rates described in this report are likely to continue,'' the agency warned, citing the growth of the industry and its trucking exemptions.
Some worker safety experts point to other factors contributing to the industry's fatality rate. Drug use is common among workers at some sites. Few workers are unionized, meaning they are less able to complain about safety problems without fear of being fired.
Some experts have called for increased oversight. An analysis by The New York Times of more than 50,000 inspection reports indicates that as the number of drilling rigs rose by more than 22 percent in 2011 from the prior year, the number of inspections at such work sites fell by 12 percent.
David Michaels, an assistant secretary of labor with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said that his staff was aggressive about enforcement but that companies were not required to alert his agency when their truckers crashed on public roads. Nor do they have to inform his agency when drilling starts, making timely inspections difficult, he added.
By contrast, mining companies are required to alert the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration about new sites. While there are far fewer active oil and gas drilling sites in the country than underground and surface mining sites, more drilling industry workers than miners typically die each year.
Oil and gas workers also crash because their trucks are frequently in disrepair, the police say. For example, data from the Pennsylvania State Police indicates that 40 percent of 2,200 oil and gas industry trucks inspected from 2009 to this February were in such bad condition that they had to be taken off the roads.
Oil service companies also often circumvent highway safety rules.
For example, Mr. Roth's employer, Energy Services, based in Grand Junction, Colo., was cited repeatedly in 2009 for allowing or requiring truckers to drive after the legal limit of 14 hours per shift. The company lost its federal transportation registration and was fined $21,700 in 2010 for various road safety violations.
But soon after losing its registration, Energy Services officials said in court papers that they had teamed up with another company, Energy Specialties, to continue operating with a new federal registration number, crossing out one company's name and writing by hand the other's name over it in drivers' logs.
Mary Stacy, a lawyer for Energy Services, said the company declined to comment. Energy Specialties also declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.
In March, the Government Accountability Office criticized federal highway regulators for their failure to detect commercial truckers -- widely known as ''chameleon carriers'' -- that use shell companies to get around safety rules.
Reward and Risk
Despite the dangers of working in the drilling industry, jobs are filled quickly because they pay well, sometimes more than $2,000 a week, and many require minimal training.
After serving a six-year prison sentence on several gun and drug charges, Mr. Roth, 36, was delighted when he landed a job for nearly $14 an hour with Energy Services.
''He just kept saying, 'Baby, this is going to change everything, I promise,' '' said his wife, Crystal Roth, 30, adding that they were just happy to no longer have to eat day-old castoffs from a bakery for dinner.
But Ms. Roth said she knew almost immediately that her husband and his crew were working too hard because some days they were drinking five super-caffeinated energy drinks each to stay awake during shifts that lasted up to 20 hours, she said.
On the day of his fatal crash, Mr. Roth's back was still sore from another truck accident about 10 weeks earlier. No one died in that crash, but it was also caused by a co-worker who fell asleep at the wheel, according to Ms. Roth.
In court papers, the supervisor of Mr. Roth's crew and two other workers described how, they said, the company taught drivers to falsify their logbooks.
''All you got to do is say that you went into one of the campers and fell asleep for a couple hours, when actually you're out there working,'' Mike Lowther, one of the crew members, recalled being instructed. Mr. Lowther, who was driving, was injured in the crash that killed Mr. Roth, and he is suing the company, as is Mr. Roth's wife.
Energy Services denied these statements in court documents, saying it had told the men to invoke the industry's exemptions if they needed to justify their long hours in their logbooks.
The crew manager, Jestus Wade, ''told them that because we work in the oil and gas field that there are exceptions to the logbook, but not to lie,'' the company said in court documents.
Questioning Exemptions
The number of Americans killed in auto crashes has been falling, but the number of deaths from crashes involving large trucks climbed 8.7 percent from 2009 to 2010, according to federal transportation data.
Across all industries, highway crashes are a leading cause of death among workers. As a result, federal regulators set strict safety rules for commercial truckers that dictate how long they can drive.
But for almost five decades, the oil and gas industry has enjoyed several exemptions to these rules that allow many of its truckers to work longer.
For example, most commercial truckers must stop driving no later than 14 hours after their workday begins. Many oil and gas industry drivers, however, do not have to count time spent waiting at the well site while other crews finish their tasks. These wait times can sometimes stretch over 10 hours.
If most commercial truckers work 60 hours over seven consecutive days, they must take at least 34 hours off so they can get two full nights of sleep. Oil and gas truckers who work that long are required to take only 24 hours off.
The oil field exemptions were granted in the 1960s after officials in the industry argued that its drivers needed more flexibility in their schedules.
Since then, the exemptions have survived repeated attempts to remove them.
In 2000, federal highway authorities concluded that removing some of the exemptions would improve highway safety by allowing ''drivers to get the restorative sleep the research suggests they need.'' After the industry lobbied Congress, the exemptions were left intact.
Other industries like utilities and construction also have exemptions for some of their truckers, and Shashunga Clayton, a spokeswoman for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, emphasized that the oil field exemptions did not apply to all trucks in the oil and gas industry.
But many safety advocates say oil and gas companies routinely apply the exemptions to vehicles that are not covered by them, like the type of pickup truck that Mr. Roth was in or the large tankers that haul waste and water. Enforcing the rules is difficult, said the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, an association of police and highway authorities, because federal regulators do not provide a list of trucks that qualify for the exemptions.
In 2010, federal authorities proposed revisions to highway regulations. Dozens of executives from trucking and oil and gas companies submitted comments.
Changing the rules would ''require more drivers to do the same amount of work in a time when we are having difficulty recruiting enough drivers,'' wrote Kenneth Aker, operations manager for Elite Transportation, which has offices in Ohio and South Dakota. Others argued that companies would have to hire more inexperienced drivers, making roads less safe.
In written comments to federal regulators, safety advocates -- like the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency responsible for accident investigations -- disagreed.
Some oil field truckers also questioned the exemptions.
''Oil field crews only work 12 hours and go home, or to a motel,'' wrote Mr. Farrell, the Texas oil service driver who complained to regulators. ''It is UNSAFE to expect truck drivers to work longer than that.''
In December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration declined to eliminate the oil and gas industry exemptions, explaining that the exemptions had ''been in place for nearly 50 years'' and were clear enough.

HEADLINE: The Lessons of JPMorgan's Trading Loss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''JPMorgan Chase Loses $2 Billion From Its Trades'' (front page, May 11):
The recent JPMorgan Chase trading losses highlight the need to re-enact Glass-Steagall and separate trading and securities activities from the deposit-taking and lending functions of commercial banks.
JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, arrogantly commented that the as yet unfinished Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law, which would restrict risky trades by banks, would not have prohibited these trades. Two senators who helped draft the hedging exception in Dodd-Frank disagree. Since the regulations have not yet been written, both positions are speculative. 
This dichotomy of opinion demonstrates the futility of trying to regulate the trading activities of large banks. Bankers will always be able to find a loophole in any regulations.
It's time to ignore the hollow claims of bankers who lobby for less regulation and impose real reform by admitting that repealing Glass-Steagall was a mistake.
Only by re-enacting Glass-Steagall and prohibiting all trading activities by commercial banks can we avoid another meltdown and taxpayer-funded bailout.
PAUL IMMERMAN New York, May 14, 2012
The writer is a securities lawyer.
To the Editor:
JPMorgan Chase's reputation for remaining ''solid'' through the financial crisis has been dealt a major blow. Without going into the culture of greed or the opacity of derivatives upon which much blame can be placed, I see a simple truth emerging from this story: banks are too big.
They are too big for consumers, too big for management and too big for regulators. The dilution of antitrust efforts in this country over the last few decades has created this situation in financial services and many other industries. Time to call Teddy Roosevelt.
THOMAS MINET Upper Montclair, N.J., May 11, 2012
To the Editor:
We need to remember the difference between true bets and investments. Somehow, the fact that investments involve risk has led to applying the term ''bet'' to both. A true bet is a ''zero sum game.'' Someone wins, someone loses, money changes hands. The bettor believes he is smarter, or has more information, than his opponent. And most important, the transaction has no value to society as a whole!
An investment can be understood as a business partnership, in which the investor provides funds that a business uses to create value. The risk is that the business doesn't work out. But when it does, everyone wins. The investor shares in the profits of the business, and the value created helps society as a whole.
It is time we returned to expecting investors to invest, not bet. Then maybe we can help produce the economic growth that our country, and the whole world, so desperately needs.
MARC AUSLANDER Millwood, N.Y., May 11, 2012
To the Editor:
In spite of the elite education and corporate credentials, the ''smartest guys in the room'' have demonstrated once again that they're not. They're pretty much like everybody else. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, attributes the loss to ''errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.''
The Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law seems to be more and more reasonable, because the lessons of the past seem to fade from people's minds more and more quickly.
JOHN McLANE New York, May 11, 2012
To the Editor:
If JPMorgan Chase, reported by your paper to have settled six fraud cases in the last 13 years, including a $228 million settlement last year, is considered one of the better banking institutions, that says a great deal about how Wall Street operates and how the banks are regulated.

HEADLINE: Private Sector Edges Deeper in Space

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
It sounds like a routine event for NASA: At 4:55 a.m. on Saturday, a rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and carry cargo -- but no people -- to the International Space Station.
But if all goes as planned, that morning will mark something transformative for the space industry: a victory for capitalism in what has been for decades a government-run enterprise. The capsule, built by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation -- SpaceX, for short -- would be the first commercial spacecraft to make it to the space station, and many observers view its launching as the starting gun in an entrepreneurial race to turn space travel into a profit-making business in which NASA is not necessarily the biggest customer.
Already, there are some hints of how the era of commercial space travel might unfold. Companies like Virgin Galactic, XCOR and Space Adventures are booking passengers on suborbital joy rides to space, promised for dates within the next few years, and hundreds of people are signing up. And already there are celebrity tie-ins: Among the people who have signed up for Virgin's first flights are Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Katy Perry. 
On a more mundane note, the launching of commercial satellites has been a steady business for decades, and SpaceX is among the companies already competing for contracts. Indeed, SpaceX already seems to have built a viable business here, having announced more than $1 billion of contracts in the last few years.
Then there are the longer-term dreams, which may sound less far-fetched as each landmark in space travel grows nearer.
''I think humanity needs to get to Mars, one way or another,'' said Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX, who vows that his company will send people to Mars in as little as 10 years -- more likely 15 years, and certainly within 20. He said he would do this with or without NASA: ''I would prefer it would be with NASA. If not, we have to find another path.''
The International Space Station is only a couple of hundred miles up -- SpaceX's rocket has yet to get there, of course -- and Mars is millions of miles away. But Mr. Musk predicts that travel to Mars will eventually become commonplace, and that the ticket price will eventually -- perhaps a decade after the first flight -- drop to half a million dollars. That contrasts with the more than $60 million a seat that the Russians are currently charging NASA to take one astronaut to the space station.
''Is it possible to achieve that?'' Mr. Musk said in an interview at his headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. ''I think it is. My calculations show that it is.''
To date, space travel has been expensive and, as a government-managed operation, has had little incentive to streamline. NASA, of course, was the only game in town for American astronauts, and most recently it operated the shuttles that supplied the International Space Station. Big aerospace has been involved, too: One company, United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, effectively has a monopoly for launching satellites for NASA and the Air Force on its Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.
Only recently have smaller, nimbler companies like SpaceX, some of them run by billionaires who proved themselves in other fields, started trying to compete as equals with NASA and its major contractors. (Mr. Musk, for example, is an Internet entrepreneur who founded PayPal.)
''SpaceX is attempting to build the same class of vehicle, to my mind, only with modern manufacturing techniques and management techniques to reduce the cost,'' said Jeff Greason, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace, which is building a two-seat rocket plane to take tourists to the edge of space.
Since the end of the space shuttle program, NASA has relied on Russia to take its astronauts to space in Soyuz rockets, but now it is looking to hire commercial companies for space taxi services. So there are incentives for commercial companies both to build the transportation and to offer it at competitive prices. SpaceX, for one, says that it could provide rides to NASA astronauts at $20 million a seat, a third of the Russian price.
But the new space companies are relying on taxpayer dollars to finance their research and development. The Obama administration requested $830 million for next year to finance the development of passenger-carrying spacecraft. Proponents argue that the investments will jump-start a vibrant new business that dwarfs NASA; Congress has so far remained skeptical. A report by the House committee in charge of NASA's budget said the program ran the ''risk of repeating the government's experience from last year's bankruptcy of the solar energy firm Solyndra.''
Despite the ambivalence on Capitol Hill, the new space competition has drawn both entrepreneurs and the old aerospace giants.
Alliant Techsystems, better known as ATK, manufactured the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttles and had the contract to build a longer-range version as the first stage for NASA's next-generation rocket, the Ares I. That was before the Ares I was canceled in favor of the space taxi approach.
ATK has now teamed up with Astrium, a European rocket company, to come up with what is essentially a commercial version of the Ares I, which it called the Liberty. Last week, ATK announced that it was developing its own capsule -- based heavily on the Orion capsule that was originally going to sit on top of the Ares I -- to carry astronauts for NASA one day. ATK says it, too, would charge less than the Russians.
What is not clear is whether there are people and companies interested in buying all those seats to orbit. Currently, the market for taking people into space is small. NASA needs to send only two crews a year to the space station, and if a piece of space debris were to disable the station, there would suddenly be no demand at all. The commercial future of space, while relying on NASA financing in the short run, needs new markets for manufacturers to take advantage of the economies of mass production.
''The only way to make a dramatic reduction of price is to assume a dramatic increase of launches,'' said Mr. Greason of XCOR. ''You have to assume there is some market, that there will be enough demand to support that low price.''
The current rockets -- most of them good for one launching only -- are very expensive regardless of whether they are built by entrepreneurs or government. The future of low-cost travel in space hinges on reusable rockets and technologies not yet developed, space experts say.
Mr. Musk declined to talk about what a profitable business model for sending people to Mars might look like, but said his ultimate goal of a $500,000 trip to Mars depended on a large number of passengers and fully reusable systems.
''I'm not going to try to convince people I can do it,'' he said. ''I'm just going to do it.''

HEADLINE: A Mathematical Challenge to Obesity

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
Carson C. Chow deploys mathematics to solve the everyday problems of real life. As an investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, he tries to figure out why 1 in 3 Americans are obese.
We spoke at the recent annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where Dr. Chow, 49, gave a presentation on ''Illuminating the Obesity Epidemic With Mathematics,'' and then later by telephone; a condensed and edited version of the interviews follows.
You are an M.I.T.-trained mathematician and physicist. How did you come to work on obesity?
In 2004, while on the faculty of the math department at the University of Pittsburgh, I married. My wife is a Johns Hopkins ophthalmologist, and she would not move. So I began looking for work in the Beltway area. Through the grapevine, I heard that the N.I.D.D.K., a branch of the National Institutes of Health, was building up its mathematics laboratory to study obesity. At the time, I knew almost nothing of obesity. 
I didn't even know what a calorie was. I quickly read every scientific paper I could get my hands on.
I could see the facts on the epidemic were quite astounding. Between 1975 and 2005, the average weight of Americans had increased by about 20 pounds. Since the 1970s, the national obesity rate had jumped from around 20 percent to over 30 percent.
The interesting question posed to me when I was hired was, ''Why is this happening?''
Why would mathematics have the answer?
Because to do this experimentally would take years. You could find out much more quickly if you did the math.
Now, prior to my coming on staff, the institute had hired a mathematical physiologist, Kevin Hall. Kevin developed a model that could predict how your body composition changed in response to what you ate. He created a math model of a human being and then plugged in all the variables -- height, weight, food intake, exercise. The model could predict what a person will weigh, given their body size and what they take in.
However, the model was complicated: hundreds of equations. Kevin and I began working together to boil it down to one simple equation. That's what applied mathematicians do. We make things simple. Once we had it, the slimmed-down equation proved to be a useful platform for answering a host of questions.
What new information did your equation render?
That the conventional wisdom of 3,500 calories less is what it takes to lose a pound of weight is wrong. The body changes as you lose. Interestingly, we also found that the fatter you get, the easier it is to gain weight. An extra 10 calories a day puts more weight onto an obese person than on a thinner one.
Also, there's a time constant that's an important factor in weight loss. That's because if you reduce your caloric intake, after a while, your body reaches equilibrium. It actually takes about three years for a dieter to reach their new ''steady state.'' Our model predicts that if you eat 100 calories fewer a day, in three years you will, on average, lose 10 pounds -- if you don't cheat.
Another finding: Huge variations in your daily food intake will not cause variations in weight, as long as your average food intake over a year is about the same. This is because a person's body will respond slowly to the food intake.
Did you ever solve the question posed to you when you were first hired -- what caused the obesity epidemic?
We think so. And it's something very simple, very obvious, something that few want to hear: The epidemic was caused by the overproduction of food in the United States.
Beginning in the 1970s, there was a change in national agricultural policy. Instead of the government paying farmers not to engage in full production, as was the practice, they were encouraged to grow as much food as they could. At the same time, technological changes and the ''green revolution'' made our farms much more productive. The price of food plummeted, while the number of calories available to the average American grew by about 1,000 a day.
Well, what do people do when there is extra food around? They eat it! This, of course, is a tremendously controversial idea. However, the model shows that increase in food more than explains the increase in weight.
In the 1950s, when I was growing up, people rarely ate out. Today, Americans dine out -- with these large restaurant portions and oil-saturated foods -- about five times a week.
Right. Society has changed a lot. With such a huge food supply, food marketing got better and restaurants got cheaper. The low cost of food fueled the growth of the fast-food industry. If food were expensive, you couldn't have fast food.
People think that the epidemic has to be caused by genetics or that physical activity has gone down. Yet levels of physical activity have not really changed in the past 30 years. As for the genetic argument, yes, there are people who are genetically disposed to obesity, but if they live in societies where there isn't a lot of food, they don't get obese. For them, and for us, it's supply that's the issue.
Interestingly, we saw that Americans are wasting food at a progressively increasing rate. If Americans were to eat all the food that's available, we'd be even more obese.
Any practical advice from your number crunching?
One of the things the numbers have shown us is that weight change, up or down, takes a very, very long time. All diets work. But the reaction time is really slow: on the order of a year.
People don't wait long enough to see what they are going to stabilize at. So if you drop weight and return to your old eating habits, the time it takes to crawl back to your old weight is something like three years. To help people understand this better, we've posted an interactive version of our model at bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov. People can plug in their information and learn how much they'll need to reduce their intake and increase their activity to lose. It will also give them a rough sense of how much time it will take to reach the goal. Applied mathematics in action!
What can Americans do to stem the obesity epidemic?
One thing I have concluded, and this is just a personal view, is that we should stop marketing food to children. I think childhood obesity is a major problem. And when you're obese, it's not like we can suddenly cut your food off and you'll go back to not being obese. You've been programmed to eat more. It's a hardship to eat less. Michelle Obama's initiative is helpful. And childhood obesity rates seem to be stabilizing in the developed world, at least. The obesity epidemic may have peaked because of the recession. It's made food more expensive.
You said earlier that nobody wants to hear your message. Why?
I think the food industry doesn't want to know it. And ordinary people don't particularly want to hear this, either. It's so easy for someone to go out and eat 6,000 calories a day. There's no magic bullet on this. You simply have to cut calories and be vigilant for the rest of your life.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The ''Conversation With'' article on Tuesday, about Carson Chow, a mathematician who studies obesity, misstated a statistic around which his work revolves. One in 3 Americans are obese -- not merely overweight, a description that applies to 2 in 3 Americans.

HEADLINE: The ESPN Man

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Two of the nation's smartest analysts have just come out with reports on how the presidential election looks six months out. Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution argues that at this point President Obama has a modest advantage over Mitt Romney. The pollster Peter D. Hart says that ''this election is no better than a 50-50 proposition for the president.''
But when I look at the data, a slightly different question comes to mind: Why is Obama even close? If you look at the fundamentals, the president should be getting crushed right now. 
The economic mood of the country is terrible. Roughly 75 percent of Americans believe the economy is still in recession. According to a Quinnipiac survey, only 35 percent of Americans say they are better off than they were four years ago. Barely a third believe the country is heading in the right direction. The economic climate is as bad as or worse than it was in 1968, 1976, 1992 and 2000, years when incumbent parties lost re-election.
Then there is the ideological climate. Obama has governed from the left, but the country, as Galston notes, has shifted to the right. Forty percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the highest number ever measured.
According to an ABC News/Washington Post survey, only 22 percent of voters believe Obama's views on the size and role of government are a reason to vote for him. The share of Americans who say the current level of inequality is acceptable has increased by seven percentage points since 1998, to 52 percent. Obama's main policy initiative, health care reform, remains decidedly unpopular: 39 percent now support it, and 53 percent oppose, according to another ABC News/Washington Post poll.
Finally, Obama has lost support among crucial constituencies. He alienated independents in 2009 and has never won them back. According to a Pew Research Center poll, his support among Catholics has fallen to 42 percent from 49 percent. Even young voters are moving away. And as Galston notes, voter registration among Hispanics has declined by five percentage points, the first significant drop in four decades.
The fundamentals suggest that Obama will go the way of Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy -- incumbents who were trounced in hard times. And yet Obama isn't on the same trajectory as other global leaders, left or right.
This race, like almost all re-election races, is shaping up to be a referendum on the incumbent, not a choice between two visions. Obama's job approval numbers are driving everything else. Today, 48 percent of Americans approve of his performance. That's high given the circumstances, and near the 50 percent threshold he will need to win.
How has he stayed so competitive?
First, the Democrats' demographic advantages are kicking in. The population segments that are solidly Democratic, like single women and the unchurched, are expanding. The segments that are more Republican -- two-parent families and observant Catholics -- are shrinking.
But most of the cause is personal. There's an interesting debate over how much personal qualities matter in a presidential election. The evidence this year suggests: a lot. Take one contrast. According to a Fox News poll, only 36 percent of voters believe Obama has a clear plan for fixing the economy. But 48 percent approve of his performance. That means 12 percent of Americans approve of Obama even though they don't think he has an agenda for moving us forward. In survey after survey, Obama is far more popular than his policies.
The key is his post-boomer leadership style. Critics are always saying that Obama is too cool and detached, arrogant and aloof. But the secret to his popularity through hard times is that he is not melodramatic, sensitive, vulnerable and changeable. Instead, he is self-disciplined, traditional and a bit formal. He is willing, with drones and other mechanisms, to use lethal force.
Normally, presidents look weak during periods of economic stagnation, overwhelmed by events. But Obama has displayed a kind of ESPN masculinity: postfeminist in his values, but also thoroughly traditional in style -- hypercompetitive, restrained, not given to self-doubt, rarely self-indulgent. Administrations are undone by scandal and moments when they look pathetic, but this administration, guarded in all things, has rarely had those moments.
In 2008, Obama had that transcendent, messianic tone. This year, he has adopted a Clinton 1996 type of campaign -- strong partisan attacks combined with an emphasis on small and medium-sized policies -- like the Buffett Rule and student loans -- intended to display his common man values. As a result, Obama has come off aggressive, but also, (unlike Romney) classless and in touch with middle- income groups.
I'd say that Obama is a slight underdog this year: the scuffling economy will grind away at voters. But his leadership style is keeping him afloat. He has defined a version of manliness that is postboomer in policy but preboomer in manners and reticence.

HEADLINE: Romney Medicare Plan Draws a Stark Contrast

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Mitt Romney agree on one thing about Medicare: the differences between them are huge. Each man says his opponent's policies would end Medicare as it now exists, undermining the rock-solid guarantee of health care for older Americans.
Given the emphasis both parties are placing on health care as a defining political issue, their contrasting approaches to the government-run health insurance program serving 49 million people are certain to command considerable attention in both the presidential and Congressional campaigns.
President Obama illustrated the importance he is placing on Medicare when, in a slap at Mr. Romney, he vowed this month: ''I will never allow Medicare to be turned into a voucher that would end the program as we know it. We're not going to go back to the days when our citizens spent their golden years at the mercy of private insurance companies.''
Mr. Romney, who would limit the government's current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare, contends that Mr. Obama has no workable plan to prevent Medicare from going bankrupt. Under the Romney proposal, the government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for traditional Medicare. 
Mr. Romney says he offers not just a policy change, but ''a dramatic change in perspective and philosophy,'' and he cites his Medicare proposal as evidence of his willingness to tackle the cost of popular entitlement programs.
The president's 2010 health care law, Mr. Romney says, ''could lead to the rationing or denial of care for seniors,'' as it will squeeze nearly a half-trillion dollars from the growth of Medicare over 10 years while putting the program's future ''in the hands of 15 unelected bureaucrats.''
Obama administration officials say the 2010 law improved Medicare's finances and extended the life of its hospital insurance trust fund. They say that the ''bureaucrats'' -- on the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- are a backstop to help control costs and cannot recommend rationing care, increasing premiums or cutting benefits.
Mr. Obama assails the Romney proposal for the same reason he denounced a similar plan devised by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee: the government contribution, he says, would not keep up with the rising cost of health care, so Medicare beneficiaries -- older Americans and people with disabilities -- would have to pay more of the cost. Under the proposal, Mr. Obama says, the government would save money by shifting costs to beneficiaries.
Aides to Mr. Romney say his proposal is very similar to the latest version of Mr. Ryan's plan, drafted with Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. But, the aides say, the Ryan plan offers more specifics than Mr. Romney has provided to date.
The side that can win public opinion on Medicare is likely to find its political position strengthened in November; Medicare is extremely popular with older Americans, who turn out to vote in large numbers and have historically trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care. But that trust has been undermined by continual Republican criticism of the 2010 health care law, which Republicans say cut Medicare to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured.
Mr. Obama also wants to slow the growth of Medicare spending. The 2010 law throttles back payments to health care providers, including hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations.
Under the law, Mr. Obama is testing new ways of delivering care, notably by encouraging doctors and hospitals to team up to coordinate care, to see if they save money and keep patients healthier. In his latest budget, Mr. Obama proposed $300 billion of further savings in Medicare, most of it from providers.
Of the 49 million Medicare beneficiaries, one-fourth already receive comprehensive care through H.M.O.s and other private plans run by companies like UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Humana. The number could rise significantly under Mr. Romney's proposals.
Medicare actuaries and trustees say Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2024 under current law. And Medicare spending could surpass estimates based on current law. The law requires cutbacks in payments to providers that many experts see as unrealistic and unsustainable.
The idea espoused by Mr. Romney -- known as premium support, because the government helps pay premiums -- has been around for more than 15 years. Liberal Democrats tend to view it as a right-wing idea to privatize Medicare. But Medicare's financial problems may ensure that ''premium support'' remains part of the political debate, whoever wins the election.
More moderate Democrats like former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Alice M. Rivlin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, have endorsed the idea, with important qualifications.
The traditional fee-for-service Medicare program should be one of the options for beneficiaries, along with commercial insurance plans, they say.
Under Mr. Romney's proposal, ''traditional Medicare will compete against private plans.'' How to ensure fair competition is a huge challenge, given the size of the traditional Medicare program and the government's power to regulate private plans.
A summary of the proposal, provided by the Romney campaign, explains how it would work: ''Traditional fee-for-service Medicare will be offered by the government as an insurance plan, meaning that seniors can purchase that form of coverage if they prefer it. However, if it costs the government more to provide that service than it costs private plans to offer their versions, then the premiums charged by the government will have to be higher, and seniors will have to pay the difference to enroll in the traditional Medicare option.''
This prospect alarms many Democrats. But Mr. Romney says, ''Lower-income seniors will receive more generous support to ensure that they can afford coverage, and wealthier seniors will receive less support.''
Another crucial question is how the federal contribution to private plans would be calculated, updated and increased from year to year. If the government starts with the current level of Medicare spending and increases it to keep pace with the Consumer Price Index or the size of the economy, it would cover a smaller and smaller share of medical costs, which have historically grown faster than those benchmarks.
Under his proposal, Mr. Romney says, the government contribution would be based on competitive bidding. An insurer's bid would reflect its estimate of the cost of providing a standard package of benefits to a typical beneficiary. Mr. Romney says tax increases are ''off the table'' as a way to deal with Medicare's financial problems. He would gradually increase the eligibility age for Medicare, now 65, by one month a year. In the long run, he says, the eligibility age should rise with life expectancy.
The type of competition Mr. Romney wants to see in Medicare is strikingly similar to the competition that is supposed to drive down commercial insurance prices under Mr. Obama's health care law. Under the law, people under 65 could choose among competing health plans offered through an insurance exchange in each state, and the government would subsidize premiums for lower- and middle-income people.
Ms. Rivlin pointed to a curious paradox: ''Republicans object to exchanges in the Affordable Care Act and favor them in Medicare, while Democrats take the opposite, equally inconsistent, position.''

HEADLINE: In Washington, Mixed Messages Over Tighter Rules for Wall St.

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and ED WYATT

 BODY:
Conflicting signs are emerging in Washington over whether JPMorgan Chase's surprise trading loss will spur tighter regulation on Wall Street.
One of the banking industry's main regulators appeared to indicate that it would oppose new efforts to rein in risky Wall Street activities, while other regulators emphasized caution. Still, a Congressional committee announced plans on Monday to hold a hearing on the financial regulatory overhaul that will look at the JPMorgan loss. Wall Street's representatives, fearing that the entire banking industry might pay for JPMorgan's sins, are trying to contain the fallout in Washington, people close to the matter said.
When JPMorgan announced on Thursday that it had a trading loss of $2 billion that was expected to grow, some lawmakers and consumer advocates cast it as a case study on the need for stricter Wall Street oversight. The central policy, known as the Volcker Rule, would ban banks from trading with their own money, an effort to prevent bank blowups that necessitate bailouts with taxpayer money. 
Yet calls for a crackdown, which come as regulators are putting the finishing touches on the Volcker Rule and other such overhauls, may not find many sympathetic ears in Washington.
The nation's main banking regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in recent days told a prominent Republican lawmaker that the Volcker Rule would not have outlawed the disastrous trade. The regulator also opined to the lawmaker, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, that it hoped the final version of the rule would not interfere with this sort of trading.
''They were adamant that hedges like these are there to make the bank safer,'' Mr. Corker said in an interview. The conversation occurred between Mr. Corker's staff and the ''examiner in charge'' of overseeing JPMorgan.
JPMorgan said it initially used the position to hedge its exposure to the broader economy - and in theory hedging is exempt under the rule. It is unclear, whether banks under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law are allowed to hedge only against specific risks rather than theoretical concerns.
In response to Mr. Corker's statements - and the firestorm they created among lawmakers on Monday - Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller, clarified that the conversations with Mr. Corker ''were based on incomplete details.''
''It is premature to conclude whether the Volcker Rule in the Dodd-Frank Act would have prohibited these trades,'' Mr. Hubbard said, noting that the Volcker Rule was ''not in effect yet.'' Regulators plan to complete the overhaul later this year.
Still, other regulators echoed the agency's cautious tone on Monday, saying that it was too soon to tell whether the Volcker Rule would need some tweaking.
An official at one bank regulator said that the agencies drafting the rules did not provide for more exemptions than lawmakers had intended.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because regulatory discussions are not public, said the language in the proposed rule closely tracked the language of the Dodd-Frank statute, which allows banks to take steps to protect themselves against losses on an ''aggregated position,'' or portfolios of securities. That, the official said, means banks are permitted to place broad hedges on portfolios, rather than having to match each hedge with an individual security or investment.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve said that regulators were still gathering facts about the trading losses at JPMorgan. The central bank also said it was examining whether there were similar risk problems in other corners of JPMorgan.
Mr. Corker was hesitant to judge whether the Volcker Rule would have prevented JPMorgan's trades. ''I don't know,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Corker called for a Congressional hearing to shed light on the intricacies of the positions and the implications for the Volcker rule.
His requests were heeded. The Senate Banking Committee announced plans on Monday to hold hearings in the coming weeks into Wall Street regulation, in which the JPMorgan debacle is ''expected to be discussed,'' the committee said.
JPMorgan, however, is stepping away from another public panel on the Volcker Rule. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the regulators writing the Volcker Rule, will host a public roundtable this month about the new regulation and has invited JPMorgan to speak. Last week, JPMorgan suggested that one of its top Volcker Rule experts would attend. But then the bank said that this person had a scheduling conflict. Rather than dispatch another executive to Washington, the banks recommended an employee at another bank.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the cancellation was unrelated to the trading loss.
Another JPMorgan official said that while the bank disagreed with some portions of the Volcker Rule, it did feel that, in their final form, the trades that caused the bank $2 billion in losses would not have been allowed under the Volcker Rule as it was intended.
While the bank said it believed that the trade started as a basic, allowable hedge under the proposed Volcker rule, ''it morphed into something we should not be doing,'' the official said. ''We don't think where it ended up would be consistent with the Volcker Rule or our standards.''
Other Wall Street companies, rather than reveling in the embarrassment of a competitor who emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed, are moving to play down the incident. Several Wall Street lobbyists interviewed for this story, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the trading blowup could not have come at a worse time as regulators put the finishing touches on their rule making .
''There is absolutely no Schadenfreude,'' said one lobbyist from a rival bank. ''This is not a gift.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Council Wants Banks Seeking City Deposits to Report on Efforts to Aid Poor Areas

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
As a huge trading loss at JPMorgan Chase intensifies criticism of the nation's big banks, the New York City Council plans to vote on Tuesday to require banks to make public their efforts to be socially responsible before the city decides where to deposit the billions of dollars it keeps in banks.
The city currently deposits money at 31 banks -- among them JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Wells Fargo -- chosen for their financial soundness and ratings by federal and state agencies. 
But leaders of the Council say those criteria are no longer enough. As the Occupy Wall Street movement focuses attention on the role of banks in the financial crisis, and the JPMorgan loss prompts calls for increased regulation, council members want the city to begin weighing the services banks offer in poor neighborhoods when determining which ones to do business with.
Cleveland and Philadelphia have had laws in place for over a decade similar to the one being proposed in New York, and now the financial crisis has led several other cities to consider them. Pittsburgh recently passed a bill that requires banks that want city deposits to submit community reinvestment plans every two years. Los Angeles, Boston, and San Diego are all considering similar measures.
The New York measure, championed by Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker and a leading candidate for mayor in 2013, opens yet another rift between the Council and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg over how the city should respond to concerns about economic inequality.
The mayor has already threatened to sue the Council over two other pieces of legislation, the so-called living- and prevailing-wage bills, which would raise wages for some private-sector workers above the minimum wage.
In a brief interview Friday, as he left a breakfast with local bankers in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg said he strongly opposed new restrictions on where the city could put its deposits, which can be as much as $7 billion.
''You would think, between the federal government and the state government, we'd have enough bank regulations,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''I don't know why the City Council thinks that they have the expertise, or can really add anything other than just adding costs to banks to try to comply.''
The banking industry is fighting hard against the bill, which Michael P. Smith, the president of the New York Bankers Association, called ''unacceptable as far as our industry is concerned.''
''This would represent a whole new layer of regulation,'' said Mr. Smith. He said federal and state governments already monitored community performance by banks, and he warned that the measure could discourage banks from taking public deposits.
Representatives of Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Capital One, Citibank and HSBC declined to comment, referring questions to the association. Kevin Friedlander, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said that after a year of talking with the sponsors of the measure, ''We can't support this proposal in its current form.''
But some bankers were more sympathetic to the idea.
Keith Pilkington, a spokesman for Amalgamated Bank, said, ''Amalgamated Bank understands and shares the frustration of the City Council and tens of millions of Americans at a banking and financial system that took tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer aid.''
''Amalgamated Bank believes that there is room to improve the pending bill to minimize the administrative and reporting burden on banks and urges the Council to make such changes before passage,'' Mr. Pilkington said. ''However, Amalgamated Bank believes that banks, and all other businesses that voluntarily choose to do business with New York City should be businesses that pay their employees living wages with benefits and that are committed to the long-term viability, diversity and vibrancy of New York City.''
Ms. Quinn, who in her early 20s worked for the Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, a housing organization that has pushed the measure, said she was motivated by seeing the owners of apartment buildings around the city get overloaded with debt and then be foreclosed on during the financial crisis. She said the proposed measure, which is being sponsored by Councilman Albert Vann of Brooklyn and appears to have the support of a veto-proof majority, was simply about transparency.
''It's a bill to allow New Yorkers, whose money gets deposited in banks, to know how those banks are behaving in their neighborhoods,'' she said, adding that it was ''not designed to be finger-wagging and punitive.''
The Council bill, called the Responsible Banking Act, would require the Department of Finance to create a new advisory board, which would publish an annual report on how banks that apply to take city deposits were doing in meeting the credit needs of the city's neighborhoods.
Banks would be required to provide detailed information, by census tract, about branch locations, loans, delinquencies, foreclosures and loan modifications.
The information, as well as the advisory board's evaluation of the banks, would be published on the Department of Finance Web site and, in the language of the bill, ''may be considered'' by the mayor, comptroller, and finance commissioner in deciding which banks should be allowed to take city deposits.
John Taylor, the president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a network of community organizations that is helping officials in several cities draft ''responsible banking'' laws, said the measures allowed the cities to push banks to offer more services in poor neighborhoods. ''People have stopped looking to the federal government alone to solve all these problems and are looking at what they can do on a local level -- what can we do to stimulate economic development and investment in our town,'' he said.
Marlene Cintron, the president of the Bronx Overall Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency, said that she thought the bill was a good idea. A particular problem in the Bronx, she said, is the small number of local bank branches, a situation she said made banking expensive for residents and encouraged predatory lending.
''I've always wanted to know what our institutions have been doing in the Bronx -- for the Bronx,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Red Flags Said To Go Unheeded By Chase Bosses

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
In the years leading up to JPMorgan Chase's $2 billion trading loss, risk managers and some senior investment bankers raised concerns that the bank was making increasingly large investments involving complex trades that were hard to understand. But even as the size of the bets climbed steadily, these former employees say, their concerns about the dangers were ignored or dismissed.
An increased appetite for such trades had the approval of the upper echelons of the bank, including Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, current and former employees said.
Initially, this led to sharply higher investing profits, but they said it also contributed to the bank's lowering its guard. 
''There was a lopsided situation, between really risky positions and relatively weaker risk managers,'' said a former trader with the chief investment office, the JPMorgan unit that suffered the recent loss. The trader and other former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the investigations into the trading losses.
Instead, the bank maintains that the losses were largely the fault of the chief investment office. Overall tolerance for risky trading did not increase, current executives said, just the scale of the office's activities because of the bank's acquisition of Washington Mutual in 2008 and its more risky credit portfolio.
Despite Mr. Dimon's recent apologies about the losses - which will most likely be repeated on Tuesday as JPMorgan shareholders gather for the company's annual meeting in Tampa, Fla. - regulators will scrutinize risk management at the chief investment office.
Top investment bank executives raised concerns about the growing size and complexity of the bets held by the bank's chief investment office as early as 2007, according to interviews with half a dozen current and former bank officials. Within the investment office, led by Ina Drew, who resigned on Monday, the bets were directed by the head of the Europe trading desk in London, Achilles Macris.
Mr. Macris, who is also expected to resign, failed to heed concerns as early as 2009 from the unit's own internal risk officer, said current and former members of the chief investment office. Mr. Macris and Ms. Drew were not available for comment.
Under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, JPMorgan Chase has long had a reputation for its strong risk-management abilities - indeed, it came through the 2008 financial crisis largely unscathed, unlike many big banks. For their part, senior bank officials on Monday disputed the assertions that the company weakened risk management in recent years while seeking higher trading profits.
Risk managers were largely sidelined by Mr. Macris, who had wide latitude and also had Ms. Drew's support, with only modest interference from her. At one point, after concerns were raised about positions assembled by Bruno Iksil, now known as the London Whale, Mr. Macris brought in a risk officer with whom he had worked closely in the past.
Risk officers are empowered to halt trades deemed too dangerous, so the coziness of the arrangement generated talk in New York as well, according to the former trader within the chief investment office.
Several bankers said that risk controls were not sufficiently strengthened by Doug Braunstein, who took over as chief financial officer in 2010, another reason the bolder trades continued.
The bank disputes that Mr. Braunstein tolerated additional risk in any way, said Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank.
David Olson, who headed up credit trading for the chief investment office until December, said that in his trading ''the management was very involved and the risk controls were very strong.''
Part of the breakdown in supervision, current executives said, was a fundamental disconnect between the chief investment office in London and the rest of the bank. Even within the chief investment office there were heightening concerns that the bets being made in London were incredibly complex and not fully understood by management in New York.
Despite these concerns, the scope of the chief investment's offices trades widened sharply following the acquisition of Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Not only did the bank bring with it hundreds of billions more in assets, it also owned riskier securities that needed to be hedged against. As a result, the business's investment securities portfolio rapidly grew, more than quadrupling to $356 billion in 2011, from $76.5 billion in 2007, company filing show.
Ms. Drew made presentations to the board about twice a year, one former executive recalled, ''but it was just not talked about a lot,'' he said.
What is more, said another senior former executive, Mr. Dimon had other fires to put out, and the chief investment office wasn't a ''problem child'' for either top managers or the board of directors, despite its rapid expansion. Gigantic losses were piling up from bad mortgages, and new regulations were threatening the profitability of traditional banking, among other pressing matters.
All of these factors may explain why Mr. Dimon, an executive known for his ability to sense risk who also was familiar with the minutiae of his business, failed to heed the first alarm bells that were sounded in early April.
Sirens had gone off after a series of erratic trading sessions in late March resulted in big gains one day, followed by even bigger losses the next on the London trading desk of the bank's chief investment office. Mr. Dimon was convinced by Ms. Drew and her team that the turbulence was ''manageable,'' executives said. Nor did anyone on the operating committee, of which Ms. Drew is a member, question her conclusion - in fact the full operating committee wasn't told of the scope of the problem till early last week, just days before Mr. Dimon went public.
The alarm bells were silenced in early April, but days after first-quarter earnings were reported on April 13, the erratic trading pattern continued, except this time there were few gains to offset the losses, and the red ink was flowing faster by the day.
Mr. Dimon convened a second round of checks, which soon concluded there was a ticking time bomb, but by then it was too late, a situation made worse as traders actually increased their bets instead of shrinking them, resulting in a loss that now totals more than $2 billion and threatens a management team that until now could seemingly do no wrong.
The company has indicated publicly that the losses could eventually double, depending on market conditions.
On Monday, the bank replaced Ms. Drew with Matthew E. Zames and appointed a former chief financial officer, Mike Cavanagh, to head up the task of fixing what went wrong. One of the most respected senior executives at the bank, Mr. Cavanagh has been a loyal lieutenant of Mr. Dimon since before he took over JPMorgan Chase and has been discussed as a possible successor.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Voters Dubious of Obama's Announcement on Same-Sex Marriage

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and DALIA SUSSMAN; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Dalia Sussman from New York. Marjorie Connelly, Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Most Americans suspect that President Obama was motivated by politics, not policy, when he declared his support for same-sex marriage, according to a poll released on Monday, suggesting that the unplanned way it was announced shaped public attitudes.
Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed by The New York Times and CBS News since the announcement said they thought that Mr. Obama had made it ''mostly for political reasons,'' while 24 percent said it was ''mostly because he thinks it is right.'' Independents were more likely to attribute it to politics, with nearly half of Democrats agreeing.
The results reinforce the concerns of White House aides and Democratic strategists who worried that the sequence of events leading up to the announcement last week made it look calculated rather than principled.
Mr. Obama, who had said since late 2010 that his position on the issue was ''evolving,'' finally proclaimed his support for same-sex marriage only after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. did so first in a television interview. 
''If Biden hadn't said something, I don't think he would have said anything either,'' Larry Gannon, 48, a graphic artist from Norwalk, Calif. and an independent, said in a follow-up interview.
Holly Wright, 67, an independent from Smithfield, Va., who works in the food industry, said she believed that Mr. Obama had concluded that more Americans approved of same-sex marriage. ''He believes it will help him win the election,'' she said. ''In other words, say what the majority of the people want to hear.''
The survey results made it clear that the president was wading into a divisive area of American life, one that may not top the nation's priority list but still has the potential to hurt him at the margins in elections in November. About 4 in 10, or 38 percent, of Americans support same-sex marriage, while 24 percent favor civil unions short of formal marriage. Thirty-three percent oppose any form of legal recognition. When civil unions are eliminated as an option, opposition to same-sex marriage rises to 51 percent, compared with 42 percent support.
The poll showed that relatively few voters consider same-sex marriage their top issue amid continued economic uncertainty, and more than half said it would make no difference in their choice for president. But among those who said Mr. Obama's position would influence their vote, more said they would be less likely to vote for him as a result; in a close race, even a small shift in swing states could be costly.
The political consequences of the president's announcement have absorbed Washington, with strategists on all sides poring through data to try to anticipate what it might mean in the fall. Many surveys have shown rising support nationally for same-sex marriage, especially among younger Americans. However, voters in more than 30 states have passed measures banning such unions, most recently those in North Carolina last week.
Mr. Obama's team is counting on the notion that whatever he might lose in votes or intensity of support will be offset by increased excitement among young voters and his liberal base. His probable Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, is banking on the idea that Mr. Obama's position will turn off enough supporters of traditional marriage, including African-Americans, to help tip the race his way.
The situation remains so uncertain in part because, as the poll showed, the public is deeply conflicted on the issue. Consider the responses to two questions: Just 32 percent said the federal government should determine whether same-sex marriage is legal, rather than leaving it to the states. But 50 percent favored an amendment to the federal Constitution allowing marriage only between a man and a woman and overruling state laws to the contrary.
Mr. Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage appeared to have little effect on Americans' view of the issue. More influential seems to be the increasing familiarity with people who are gay and lesbian. In a 2003 Times/CBS News poll, 44 percent of respondents said they had a colleague at work, close friend or relative who was gay, compared with 69 percent in the latest poll. Those who did were more likely to support legalizing same-sex marriage than those who did not.
''I might have been against it a long time ago, but then after meeting people who were gay, I changed my mind and had a different position,'' said John Cornett, 70, a Democrat in Georgetown, Ky.
The new nationwide poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from May 11 through 13 on landlines and cellphones with 615 adults.
With less than six months until the election, Mr. Obama remains in a tight race with Mr. Romney. A month ago, a Times/CBS News poll showed the two tied at 46 percent each; the latest survey had the Republican challenger at 46 percent to the president's 43 percent, an edge that was within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Mr. Obama's vulnerable standing in the poll came despite rising optimism about the economy. About a third of voters said it was very or fairly good, the most since January 2008. More than a third said it was getting better, compared with a quarter who said it was getting worse. Jobs and the economy remain by far the most dominant issue, with 62 percent naming it their top priority and 19 percent their second highest. By contrast, just 7 percent chose same-sex marriage as the most important issue and 4 percent as the second-most important.
While most respondents said the candidates' position on the issue would not affect their vote, about 4 in 10 said it would, and that played against Mr. Obama. Twenty-six percent of respondents said they were less likely to support Mr. Obama as a result, while 16 percent said they were more likely to. Many of those who described themselves as less likely to vote for Mr. Obama were Republicans who might not have anyway, but in a tight race, even small numbers can matter.
The sample size of the new poll was too small to break out comparisons by race, but aggregating four Times/CBS News surveys that asked the question over the last year opens a window into a racial dynamic that could be challenging for Mr. Obama.
Over all, black and white Americans divided on same-sex marriage in roughly similar numbers. But black Democrats were more skeptical than white Democrats. Sixty-one percent of white Democrats supported legalizing marriage for gay couples, compared with 36 percent of black Democrats, while 35 percent of black Democrats opposed any legal recognition, compared with 18 percent of white Democrats.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about Americans' sentiments regarding President Obama's decision to endorse same-sex marriage misstated the degree of support among racial groups when four New York Times/CBS News polls taken over the past year were aggregated. Sixty-one percent of self-identified Democrats who are white support legalizing marriage for gay couples, not 45 percent. Eighteen percent are opposed to any legal recognition, not 28 percent.

HEADLINE: A Youth Entrepreneurship Program Goes International

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: At the end of last year, the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship's programs had reached more than 150,000 students overseas, up from just 1,600 in 2003. 

 BODY:
In 1981, a gang of teenagers mugged the owner of an import-export business while he was walking on Manhattan's Lower East Side. They ran off with the contents of his wallet, $10. But Steve Mariotti took away something more valuable: the germ of an idea.
What, he asked himself, could make young people so disaffected and desperate? To find out, he sold his business and went to work as a public school teacher in the South Bronx. In 1987, he founded the nonprofit Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship with the modest goal of teaching business skills to local children, a strategy he believed would cut dropout rates, bolster employment in low-income communities and help students understand the relevance of school to their lives outside the classroom. Twenty-five years later, the network has taught start-up skills to 450,000 students around the world. 
Last month, some 33 graduates from 10 countries converged on the Marriott Marquis in Midtown Manhattan to receive the network's Global Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. The teenagers set up a gallery of their products: from Colombia, plantain-flower veggie burgers; from Israel, a system to text-message homeowners about leaking water pipes; from Bridgeport, Conn. flame-retardant chef's jackets; and from Germany, a baby sitting service for horses. A crossbow for slinging prizes to bleacher-bound sports fans was invented in Dallas; Chile marketed delicate morel mushrooms; and an aerial photography service based in Fresno, Calif., deployed remote-control helicopters.
Two 19-year-old vocational school graduates from Ningbo City, China, served tea in tiny cups and showed off photographs of the Tao Ming Xuan Teahouse, which they founded in August 2010. While most vocational graduates in China are lucky to earn $200 a month, these young women are now bringing in $60,000 a year in revenue, 30 percent of which they say is profit.
"In China, most students who study in vocational schools are regarded as lower level because their test scores are not high enough for the universities," said Henry To, the chief executive of the Bright China Foundation, the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship's local partner organization. "In their last year, they will be sent to factories. They become cheap labor. So they have less self-confidence and a lower self-image. But they're not poor students or bad students. They have their own strengths and advantages."
In school, the young women behind the teahouse - Pan Pan Chen and Qiong Qiong Wang - each took the network's 50-hour entrepreneurship course, known colloquially as a "mini M.B.A." They discussed how to find opportunities in problems, learned the meaning of supply and demand, and read balance sheets and cash flow statements, while exploring intellectual property protection, market research and social responsibility. (All of these lessons parallel the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship's curriculum in the United States, though they are adapted for language, cultural relevancy and local business rules.)
As the culmination of the class, each student devised a business plan. Ms. Chen proposed the teahouse. After presenting it to her classmates for feedback, she partnered with Ms. Wang, a friend one year ahead of her in school. Their parents agreed to provide $5,000 in seed money.
"They really surprised their teachers," said Mr. To. "Now they're able to support themselves and their families." They're also paying two full-time employees and one part-timer.
The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship's international efforts - not just in China but also in New Zealand, India, Ireland and five other countries - are expanding rapidly. At the end of last year, the network's programs had reached more than 150,000 students overseas, up from just 1,600 in 2003.
"We are growing much faster internationally than we are domestically," said Amy Rosen, the network's chief executive, who also leads the youth subcommittee of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability. "In the last two years, in the emerging economies, there's just a huge demand for this stuff. I do think it's around the youth unemployment rates."

HEADLINE: A Question Inspired by the Skyline

HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: As they're driving into Manhattan, a daughter asks her mother a question about her employment. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary,
 My youngest daughter recently visited me here. It was her first visit to New York, and living in one of the outer boroughs, she wasn't keen on experiencing the subway. So each day during her stay, I drove us into the city. 
One particular afternoon as we were making our way into Manhattan, she looked out at the skyline. She frowned, shook her head and said, 
"All those buildings, and you can't find a job?"

HEADLINE: United States Ranks Last on Breast-Feeding Support

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: A new Save the Children report ranks the United States last among 36 industrialized nations on its breast-feeding policies. Are you surprised? 

 BODY:
Does the United States - do we - really want women to breast-feed their infants?
The American Academy of Pediatrics certainly does. As do the Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity, which clearly have the ring of officialdom about them.
But as many mothers can attest, the awarding of a smiley-face sticker for diligent nursing does nothing to make up for inadequate support for women who want to breast-feed their babies while simultaneously remaining employed outside the home. It's possible to do both, and many women do - but very few would argue that the federal or state government offered much, if any, help.
Last week, Save the Children released its State of the World's Mothers Report for 2012, and in it, amid the detailed discussion of successes and failures of all the world's nations with respect to taking care of mothers and infants, was this:
The United States ranks last on the Breastfeeding Policy Scorecard. It is the only economically advanced country - and one of just a handful of countries worldwide - where employers are not required to provide any paid maternity leave after a woman gives birth. There is also no paid parental leave required by U.S. law. Mothers may take breaks from work to nurse, but employers are not required to pay them for this time. Only 2 percent of hospitals in the United States have been certified as "baby-friendly" and none of the provisions of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes has been enacted into law. While 75 percent of American babies are initially breast-fed, only 35 percent are being breast-fed exclusively at 3 months.
Save the Children makes the point that women in developing countries don't need to breast-feed in the way that women in impoverished countries do. We have ready access to nutritious alternatives and clean water. But the science that's trumpeted by the Surgeon General, A.A.P. and the C.D.C.suggests that breast-feeding, when possible, has benefits that aren't matched by those alternatives - in its "Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding," the Surgeon General's office notes that breast-feeding reduces the risks of some infections and diseases, and of type 2 diabetes, asthma and childhood obesity.
As others have said before me, increasing breast-feeding rates might only incrementally alter the health picture for any one child, but it holds the possibility of dramatic change nationwide with respect to the number of children affected by those problems, and the cost of their treatment.
But if that's the case, then why not support policies that make breast-feeding as easy as possible?
As the Surgeon General's report notes, rates of breast-feeding are lower among employed mothers, and women with longer maternity leaves, those who can work part time and those with breast-feeding support programs in the workplace nurse longer. But for many, if not most, women, those supports aren't available.
I've written before that breast-feeding isn't free. Breast-feeding for six months or more is associated with a loss of earnings: women who nurse long-term spend more time out of the workforce, and work fewer hours, and the result seems to impact their earnings beyond even the time with an infant at the breast. That may be because women who nurse longer are also more likely to have made a conscious choice to stop working or cut back on their hours, but there's more to that story as well. Faced with a different work environment, women might make different choices.
But if that different work environment is to include laws requiring more support of breast-feeding, many women have doubts about that as well. The costs may shift, but breast-feeding will never be "free" - there will always be a cost in terms of lost hours of productivity with respect to the financially remunerative work, and the return on that investment will never be in kind.
We've collectively embraced the benefits of breast-feeding, but we still have no way to value those benefits within our economy. The result is that many women fear that laws that place the economic burden of breast-feeding on the employers will have a cost to all women (regardless of whether they ultimately breast-feed a child) in terms of hiring and promotion - one more way that a woman employee may be different from a man.
So, do we as a country really want every woman (not just those who can bear the costs themselves) to breast-feed her infant? One reason we're ranked at the bottom of the worldwide "Breastfeeding Policy Scorecard" is that we don't have a good answer to that question.

HEADLINE: Porsche Releases Test Photos of 918 Hybrid Hypercar

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Wearing a spirited bit of camouflage, the 918 closely resembled the slippery 918 RSR hybrid racecar concept unveiled at the 2011 Detroit auto show. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, Porsche announced that testing of its long-awaited 918 Spyder hybrid was under way.
The plug-in supercar is slated to go into production in September 2013 and, according to a Porsche media release, the first customers to meet the $845,000 price of entry can expect delivery before the end of next year.
Only 918 vehicles will be produced. Reached by telephone, Gary Fong, a Porsche spokesman, said the tally of preordered models was not available.
Accompanying Tuesday's release were photographs of a 918 Spyder prototype on a test track. Although mildly camouflaged, the sleek and slippery form of the black, targa-top sports coupe closely reflected that of the 918 RSR hybrid racecar concept unveiled at the 2011 Detroit auto show. Porsche said the white accents pouring out like flames from the prototype's headlamps and front wheel wells hark back to Porsche 917 racecars, but for Americans, they may more immediately conjure memories of hot rods from the 1950s.
The 918, ultimately, is a technology showcase for systems that may eventually reach series-production Porsche models. The vehicle's hybrid powertrain is the centerpiece of the car's advanced hardware, combining a high-performance internal combustion engine with two electric motors, one on the front axle and one in the drivetrain, for more than 770 horsepower, Porsche asserts.
Last year, Porsche identified the internal-combustion engine as a 500-horsepower V-8 and pegged the combined output of the two electric motors at 218 horsepower. The earlier data cited a zero-to-60-m.p.h. time of 3.1 seconds and a top speed of 199 m.p.h. Fuel economy was said to be roughly 3 liters per 100 kilometers on the European test cycle. Fuel-economy estimates for models bound for North America have not been announced.
The powertrain rides inside a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic monocoque body structure with a unit carrier. Other advanced features of the 918 include fully adaptive aerodynamics, adaptive rear-axle steering and an upward venting exhaust system.
Porsche, flashing its trademark corporate restraint, said initial results from the track tests were in line with expectations.

HEADLINE: How Older Workers Weather Layoffs

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A Government Accountability Office report looks at the difficulties they face finding new jobs, and how their financial security in retirement may be compromised. 

 BODY:
While the recession and its aftermath have been particularly rough on the youngest workers, the oldest workers may end up suffering the longest.
 A new Government Accountability Office report on unemployed older workers looks at the difficulties they face finding new jobs if they are laid off, and how their financial security in retirement may be compromised as a result.
 As has been documented, older workers have not been laid off at the same rate as younger workers, but once they lose their jobs, they tend to spend much longer finding new jobs, if they find them at all. 
In 2011, 55 percent of workers older than 55 had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, compared to 47 percent of those 25 to 55. Of workers who lost their jobs between 2007 and 2009, just under a third of those 55 to 64 had found full-time jobs by January 2010, compared with 41 percent of those 25 to 54.
The report's authors convened focus groups of unemployed older workers and prospective employers to discuss the barriers to re-employment, finding that older workers believed they suffered from age discrimination but also had trouble adjusting to new technology and online job searches. Employers were hesitant to hire older workers because of perceived higher health-care costs, as well as concerns that older workers would not stay long enough for the employer to reap a good return on investment.

Those older workers who do find jobs are much more likely to take a pay cut than younger workers. According to the report, 70 percent of workers 55 or older who were laid off between 2007 and 2009 and found a new job are now earning less than in their previous job, compared to 53 percent of those 25 to 54. 
 At the same time, older Americans are trying to work longer. The labor force participation rate - the proportion of people of an age cohort who are either working or looking for work - has steadily risen since 1990 for workers 55 or older. People are living longer and healthier lives, but are also trying to save more for retirement. 
 But those who are laid off and never find another job can see their retirement savings shrivel as they spend fewer years paying into employer-based plans and Social Security once they are out of work. Some older workers who lose their jobs also draw down from their employer-based pensions or 401(k)s to cover living expenses before they are officially eligible for retirement, and those who have no other options are very likely to claim Social Security early.
 By doing so at 62 rather than 65 or 66, these workers will receive lower monthly payments for life. In a simulation, the report's authors estimated that a person who stopped working at 62 and began collecting benefits would receive a median monthly benefit of $909, about 25 percent less than the $1,212 per month available to those who hold off claiming Social Security until age 66. A person who lost a job at 55 and began collecting at 62 would have a median benefit of just $855 a month. 
For those trying to get by primarily on Social Security benefits, such low levels "could become problematic as retirees age and if health care costs and premiums continue to increase," the authors wrote.

HEADLINE: We Could Be Heroes

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We can slow global warming by eating fewer animal products. 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, in "The Ethicist," Ariel Kaminer asked readers of this paper's Magazine to explain why it's ethical to eat meat. The contest generated around 3,000 submissions, and as a judge I read about 30 of them. (Here are the responses from the winner and the finalists.)
A fascinating discussion. But you need not have a philosophy about meat-eating to understand that we - Americans, that is - need to do less of it. In fact, only if meat were produced at no or little expense to the environment, public health or animal welfare (as, arguably, some of it is), would our decisions about whether to raise and kill animals for food come down to ethics.
The purely pragmatic reasons to eat less meat (and animal products in general) are abundant. And while I've addressed them before, I'll continue until the floods come to Manhattan.
Five years ago, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization published a report called "Livestock's Long Shadow," which maintained that 18 percent of greenhouse gases were attributable to the raising of animals for food. The number was startling.

A couple of years later, however, it was suggested that the number was too small. Two environmental specialists for the World Bank, Robert Goodland (the bank's former lead environmental adviser) and Jeff Anhang, claimed, in an article in World Watch, that the number was more like 51 percent. It's been suggested that that number is extreme, but the men stand by it, as Mr. Goodland wrote to me this week: "All that greenhouse gas isn't emitted directly by animals. "But according to the most widely-used rules of counting greenhouse gases, indirect emissions should be counted when they are large and when something can be done to mitigate or reduce them."
The exact number doesn't matter. What does is that few people take the role of livestock in producing greenhouse gases seriously enough. Even most climate change experts focus on new forms of energy - which cannot possibly be effective quickly enough or produced on a broad enough scale to avert what may be the coming catastrophe - and often ignore the much easier fix of adjusting our eating habits.
It's good that we're eating somewhat less meat, but it still amounts to something just shy of a staggering 200 pounds per person per year. And no matter how that number changes domestically, on the world scale there's troubling movement in the wrong direction. Meat consumption in China is now twice what it is in the United States (in 1978 it was only one-third). We still eat twice as much per capita as the Chinese, but when they catch up they'll consume more than four times as much as we do.
But the Chinese don't need to eat like us; we need to eat like them. Or, rather, like they did until recently.
If you believe that earth's natural resources are limitless, which maybe was excusable 100 years ago but is the height of ignorance now, or that "technology will fix it" or that we can simply go mine them in outer space with Newt Gingrich, I guess none of this worries you. But if you believe in reality, and you'd like that to be a place that your kids get to enjoy, this is a big deal.
A primer: The earth may very well be running out of clean water, and by some estimates it takes 100 times more water (up to 2,500 gallons) to produce a pound of grain-fed beef than it does to produce a pound of wheat. We're also running out of land: somewhere around 45 percent of the world's land is either directly or indirectly involved in livestock production, and as forests are cleared to create new land for grazing animals or growing feed crops, the earth's capacity to sequester greenhouse gases (trees are especially good at this) diminishes.
I could go on and on about the dangers of producing and consuming too much meat: heavy reliance on fossil fuels and phosphorous (both in short supply); consumption of staggering amounts of antibiotics, a threat to public health; and the link (though not as strong as sugar's) to many of the lifestyle diseases that are wreaking havoc on our health.
Here's the thing: It's seldom that such enormous problems have such simple solutions, but this is one that does. We can tackle climate change without inventing new cars or spending billions on mass transit or trillions on new forms of energy, though all of that is not only desirable but essential.
In the meantime, we can begin eating less meat tomorrow. That's something any of us can do, with no technological advances. If personal choice enacted on a large scale could literally save the world, maybe we have to talk about it that way. We could be heroes, like Bruce Willis in "Armageddon," only maybe the sacrifice is on a more modest and easier scale. (You already changed your light bulbs; how about eating a salad?)
As the global appetite for meat grows, we'll doubtless figure out a way to satisfy it. But no matter how profitable that may be for producers, the toll it would take on our finite and dwindling resources would be unconscionable.
We have to think about producing and eating meat in those terms. Anything else would be unethical.

Facebook Is Said to Raise Offering Share Price | Facebook is planning to increase the price for its eagerly awaited initial public offering to a level that could value the company at as much as $104 billion.
Because of high investor demand, the social network will seek a price in the range of $34 to $38 a share, up from an earlier $28 to $35 a share, people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday evening, speaking anonymously because the discussions were private. In Asia alone, Facebook's offering is more than 25 times oversubscribed, said a person briefed on the matter.
The company, which will most likely stop accepting orders for its I.P.O. shares on Tuesday, is expected to price its shares on Thursday and start trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday. DealBook »
At JPMorgan, the 'Perfect Hedge' Remains Elusive | The chief investment office of JPMorgan Chase was supposed to place trades, including by hedging, to keep the firm from losing money. But part of the group's job may have been at odds with its stated goal of reducing risk: it was also supposed to turn its "hedging" trades into a tidy profit, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.
As investors, regulators and policy makers try to deconstruct the trading blunder at JPMorgan, it is worth revisiting the debate over the very definition of hedging.
That definition is a crucial ingredient in the long-running battle in Washington over the proposed Volcker Rule, legislation aimed at curbing banks from making speculative bets. Or to put that in plain English, separating the casino from the bank. Yet the law leaves wiggle room for Wall Street firms to make trades as long as their intent is to "hedge" the firm from potential losses. (The banks, often led by JPMorgan, fought hard for that wiggle room.)

HEADLINE: Campaigns Duel Over Romney's Bain Record

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In rival videos, the Obama and Romney campaigns offer differing views of Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital. 

 BODY:
Some of the most explosive moments in presidential campaigns are fueled by surprise. The political power of an unexpected allegation often comes from the frenzy surrounding its revelation.
That wasn't the case on Monday, when President Obama's campaign unveiled what might turn out to have been the most anticipated attack of the 2012 campaign: the critique of Mitt Romney's years at Bain Capital.
In the new ad, Mr. Obama's campaign unleashes a broadside against Mr. Romney's business credentials, accusing him of being a corporate raider whose private equity firm preyed on weak companies, seeking profits, then tossed aside their employees with little regard.
This morning, Priorities U.S.A., a "super PAC" backing Mr. Obama, is out with its own ad about Bain Capital, which echoes the theme set by Mr. Obama's campaign. The organization will spend $4 million to air its Bain ad in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
"With Romney and Bain Capital, the objective was to make money," a former employee of GST Steel, a company taken over by Bain Capital, says in the Priorities U.S.A. ad. "If we lost, they made money. If we survived, they made money. It's as simple as that."
The attacks on Bain underscore the fundamental premise of Mr. Obama's campaign - that voters will reject the idea of handing the White House over to a wealthy businessman who got rich by buying and selling companies with little concern for workers.
In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Stephanie Cutter, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said the fate of the GST Steel mill in Kansas City demonstrates what Mr. Romney's values are and "what they tell us about what type of president Mr. Romney would be."
But as Mr. Obama tries to make that case against Mr. Romney, he faces the challenge of reviving an issue that has been lodged against the Republican nominee for more than a decade, including by members of his own party.
Mr. Romney survived attacks on Bain Capital when he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002. And he weathered charges of being a "vulture capitalist" by some of his Republican rivals earlier this year.
In an interview Monday evening, Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, shrugged off the attacks, saying they have already been litigated in the court of public opinion.
"We've been down this road before," Mr. Fehrnstrom said. "Attacks on how our free enterprise system works have a way of backfiring."
That may happen. If voters conclude that Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney amount to an unfair criticism of capitalism, it might boomerang on the president as a political weapon. (It also has the potential to turn off wealthy donors who may already view Mr. Obama with suspicion because of his efforts to regulate the banking industry.)
Still, Mr. Romney's campaign is not ignoring the attacks. The Republican campaign quickly released its own Web-only video on Monday that tells the story of another steel plant that Mr. Romney's firm invested in. In this case, the company is thriving, having added thousands of jobs.
"When others shied away, Mitt Romney's private sector leadership team stepped in," the ad says of the Bain Capital investment. "Building a dream with over 6,000 employees today."
The quick response, with a video that was produced long before Monday, suggests that Mr. Romney's camp might be more worried than they are letting on.
It's one thing to weather attacks from a gubernatorial opponent in a statewide campaign. It's something altogether different when an aggressive presidential campaign like Mr. Obama's takes aim.
During the Republican primaries, Mr. Romney fought back against the attacks from Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney by vastly outspending his rivals. He bombarded the airwaves with criticisms of their records, drowning out even the ads by the well-funded super PAC backing Mr. Gingrich.
So far, Mr. Obama's investment in the Bain attacks is tiny - the two-minute ad will run only once on Wednesday during the evening news. But in the end, Mr. Romney will not have the same kind of overwhelming position in the general election as he had in the primary battles.
And even though the outlines of the attack on Mr. Romney are not new, the specifics are powerful, especially to voters in states that were not subject to millions of dollars of campaign ads during the primaries.
The former employees of the GST plant in Kansas City offer emotional testimony about what happened to them - losing their jobs, their pensions, their health care benefits. They blame Mr. Romney even though he had left Bain Capital by the time the steel company went bankrupt.
"They came in, they bought the plant, and they made as much money off it as they could," said Joe Soptic, a former employee who told reporters during the conference call how the lack of health insurance affected his wife's battle with cancer. "He is only worried about one group of people, and that's people like him, people at the top."
Mr. Romney's campaign is betting that they can counter those employees with ones of their own. In the web video they released, employees of Steel Dynamics, the successful steel company in Indiana, thank Mr. Romney for creating jobs.
"If it wasn't for a company like Steel Dynamics, this county wouldn't have a lot," one employee says.
Both campaigns take issue with the way the other tells the story of Mr. Romney's experience at Bain. 
Mr. Obama's campaign accuses Mr. Romney of taking undue credit for jobs at Steel Dynamics that didn't come until years later. Mr. Romney's campaign says the bankruptcy at GST Steel was the result of nationwide economic conditions that drove more than 30 similar plants out of business at the time.
Mr. Ferhnstrom also accuses Mr. Obama's campaign of "desperation" for beginning the Bain attack now, rather than in the final weeks of the campaign.
"We were expecting Obama to launch his negative Bain attacks in the fall, closer to the election," Mr. Fehrnstrom said. "He's moved up all of his negative attacks to the spring. It has the feel of a desperation move."
But desperation or not, Mr. Obama's attacks have the potential to put a human face on the argument that Mr. Romney is an uncaring, wealthy politician whose business experience taught him the wrong lessons to deal with the economic struggles of the middle class.
If the ads work with independent voters as Mr. Obama hopes, it could help cement that image. If it doesn't, Mr. Romney could once again emerge unscathed from the Bain attacks - and sitting in the White House.

HIGHLIGHT: Days after disclosing a $2 billion trading loss, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, faced shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in Tampa, Fla. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Days after disclosing a $2 billion trading loss, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, faced shareholders at the bank's annual meeting here on Tuesday.
The meeting could mark a shift in investors' attitudes. 
Mr. Dimon, who successfully steered the big bank through the worst of the financial crisis, had sidestepped much of the criticism leveled at other bank chiefs. But the recent loss has spurred shareholder ire. Shares of JPMorgan have dropped by more than 10 percent since the bank revealed the losses.
The meeting was the first shot investors have to confront Mr. Dimon about the losses that stemmed from a bad bet.
Shareholders have recently raised questions about whether JPMorgan should strip Mr. Dimon of his title as chairman of the bank and whether the firm should take back pay from those executives at the center of the trading losses. Two proxy advisory firms have already weighed in with recommendations that the bank appoint an independent board chair.
Some large investors are also demanding that JPMorgan shake up its risk committee in an effort to identify the breakdown that led to the disastrous trading strategy executed by the chief investment office, the group responsible for the losses. In recent years, risk managers and some senior investment bankers raised red flags about the bank's growing appetite for risk, warnings that were ignored or dismissed. 
DealBook was on hand for the event. What follows is a live blog. 
11:35 A.M. | Clawbacks Possible
At the end of the meeting, Mr. Dimon said, "We will do the right thing," adding "that may include clawbacks." That's all for the live blog. 
11:26 A.M. | Dividend Won't Change
Assuring shareholders that the trading loss would not cause the bank to reduce its dividend, Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan Chase was strong. The proposal to split the role of chairman and chief executive received the support of 41 percent of the shareholders.
11:22 A.M. | 'Simple Regulation'
Reiterating that he supported some regulation, Mr. Dimon said he believed in "good, strong, simple regulation."
11:20 A.M. | A Little Humor
One shareholder struck a note of levity. "You are not the worst servicer out there," the shareholder said. "Bank of America has risen to that level." The comment drew chuckles from the otherwise stern crowd.
11:16 a.m. | Dual Role
Mr. Dimon defends his role as both chairman and chief executive. "So far we have determined there will be one chairman and C.E.O.," Mr. Dimon said, adding that the board had 11 members and that those members provided a check on his influence.
11:03 a.m. | Open Forum
Shareholders are invited to speak. The first investor asks whether Mr. Dimon, in light of the trading loss, has changed his opinion of the Volcker Rule. "Do you still believe in the company's ability to self regulate?"
11:00 a.m. | 'Self-Inflicted' Wounds
Mr. Dimon opened with a discussion of the trading loss. He repeated again that mistakes "were self-inflicted." He said "it's appropriate that we bring in new management."
On Monday, the bank announced that Matthew E. Zames would succeed Ina Drew as the head of the chief investment office.
10:55 a.m. | Taking Aim at Lobbying Efforts
The Domini Social Equity Fund, a mutual fund, cited the $2 billion trading loss as a reason why the board should approve a proposal demanding that the bank provide greater transparency about the payments JPMorgan makes in lobbying. A representative said such lobbying might have been used to sway lawmakers to water down the Volcker Rule, which would ban banks from making bets with their own money.
10:50 a.m. | Help for Homeowners
Citing the need for greater aid for homeowners struggling under the glut of debt, the Board of Pensions of the Presbyterian Church introduced a proposal to ensure more mortgages were modified.
The board recommended against the proposal.
10:47 a.m. | Conflicts of Interest
The first shareholder proposal hits on a question that has been gaining steam ahead of the meeting.
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees proposed that Mr. Dimon resign his post as chairman and that JPMorgan set up an independent chair. Arguing for that position, the union said that it boiled down to preventing "an inherent conflict of interest" where "Mr. Dimon is monitoring his own performance."
The board recommended against the proposal.
10:40 a.m. | Revamping Regulation
In the wake of the financial crisis, Mr. Dimon has been a vocal opponent of too much regulation that might choke off banks' profits or undermine their ability to hedge their own risk. But JPMorgan's big trading loss has emboldened reformers' calls for greater restrictions, even if regulators are still mixed on the issue.
"We are not against new regulations," Mr. Dimon said on Tuesday. But he did not go so far as to agree with the Volcker Rule.
As he said on a conference call with analysts last week, Mr. Dimon reiterated on Tuesday that the ill-fated trade had morphed into something that violated "our own principles."

HEADLINE: Addressing Pay and Protesters at Morgan Stanley's Annual Meeting

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley's annual meeting was dominated by questions -- and assertions -- from individuals about financial regulation and bankers' pay. But shareholders overwhelmingly approved executive compensation packages. 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James P. Gorman, never visited the Occupy Wall Street protestors at Zuccotti Park. But on Tuesday morning, the protestors visited him.
The firm's annual meeting, held at its corporate campus in Purchase, N.Y., was dominated by questions -- and assertions -- from individuals about financial regulation, the makeup of Morgan Stanley's directors and bankers' pay. 
As the audience was about to vote, a chant began, involving 15 to 20 people. It was led by Jason Javier, who described himself as a graduate of New York University. 
"When finance is deregulated, the 1 percent wins and the 99 percent loses every time," the chanters said. 
About Morgan Stanley, they added: "Between 2008 and 2010, its top five executives made $130 million, but they still want more, even if it comes at the expense of working Americans."
Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the executives' compensation package at the meeting. Mr. Gorman's total 2011 compensation package was $13 million, down from $15.2 million, according to a company filing. 
Asked about the chants, Mr. Gorman said: "It wasn't very exciting." 
Since the financial crisis, it's not unusual for protesters make their anti-Wall Street views know at annual meetings. They simply buy some shares in the company, which allows them to attend as shareholders. The protestors had a greater presence at Tuesday's meeting than at previous ones, Mr. Gorman said afterward. 
He responded to the criticisms several times during the meeting. One theme to his answers was that Morgan Stanley plays a role in allowing companies to raise capital so that they can grow and employ more people. 
When Morgan Stanley's board was criticized for not having sufficiently diverse backgrounds, Mr. Gorman pointed out that directors came from different countries, and added that he himself came from a family of 12 children.
Morgan Stanley's directors sat at the front of the auditorium, seldom turning around to look at the protesters as they asked questions and made speeches. One of them, a woman in a wheelchair, said: "I''ll introduce myself as 'the future.' " She added, "I am usually invisible to most of the people here."

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Romney Tests Economic Message

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Iowa is an interesting laboratory for Mr. Romney's campaign - and how he does in the state could dramatically impact the outcome of the presidential election in November. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney arrives in Iowa on Tuesday for a speech intended to dramatize the impact of the economic downturn, calling the nation's debt a "prairie fire" sweeping across the Midwestern state and the rest of the country.
In a Web video released ahead of his arrival in Des Moines, Mr. Romney's campaign highlighted the stories of unemployed and economically distressed Iowans.
"I've been looking for a job for two years," a woman named Deborah Ragland of Webster City, Iowa, says in the video. "Haven't found any. My unemployment benefits did run out, and we're just trying to get by." 
But Iowa is an interesting laboratory for Mr. Romney's campaign - and how he does in the state could dramatically affect the outcome of the presidential election in November.
The state has one of the strongest local economies in the country, with dramatically lower unemployment than the national average, fueled in large part by a booming farm economy that has enriched many in this largely agricultural state.
According to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's 5.2 percent unemployment rate follows four months of growth in the state's economy. Employment in the state has grown by more than 13,000 jobs in the last year, the paper reported.
Mr. Romney's top campaign advisers are betting that people in Iowa, like those whose lots are improving in other states, will look beyond their local economies and focus on the nation's slump - a slump the presumptive Republican nominee is betting will be blamed on President Obama. 
In his speech, excerpts of which were released by his campaign, Mr. Romney assails Mr. Obama as promising - and failing - to cut the nation's deficit in half.
"Through his own decisions, this president has added more than five trillion dollars to the national debt, which now stands at $15.7 trillion," Mr. Romney plans to say. "As president, I will approach debt and spending differently."
Mr. Romney will say the nation's "prairie fire of debt" has been made worse by a lack of resolve among Democrats and Republicans, according to the excerpts. And he promises to deal with the problem if he is elected to the White House.
"That fire could care less if you have a donkey or an elephant in your front lawn, it's still coming for your house," he will say. "There's plenty of blame to go around for both parties. But in my years leading businesses, an Olympics and a state, I've learned one simple principle of leadership that never falters: Leaders lead. I will lead us out of this debt and spending crisis."
Still, the fight for Iowa's six electoral votes will undoubtedly play out on the ground, where Mr. Obama's campaign has spent months quietly organizing supporters. Mr. Romney's campaign is just returning to build out his campaign infrastructure.
And Mr. Romney faces a challenge in Iowa to appeal to evangelical voters. Those voters demonstrated a nervousness about Mr. Romney during the Republican primaries, repeatedly voting for his rivals in state after state. Mr. Romney's advisers believe those divisions will fade in the face of the effort to defeat Mr. Obama. If so, Iowa will be one place where it happens.
In the meantime, Mr. Romney faces a political annoyance in Iowa, where the state Republican Party has been virtually taken over by supporters of Representative Ron Paul of Texas.
A backer of Mr. Paul is now the state party chairman. And supporters of Mr. Paul and his libertarian movement now make up nearly half of the state's 18-member central committee, having ousted some of the state's establishment Republicans who had backed Mr. Romney.
"It has to be of considerable concern," said Steve Roberts, a longtime Iowa Republican who served as one of the state's national committeemen for a decade. "You need everybody to work together and be unified and turn out the vote and get every last vote for Romney if he's going to win."
Aides to Mr. Romney dismiss the political coup, saying that the party will be united behind the Republican in the fall. But Mr. Paul's chief strategist, Jesse Benton, made clear in an e-mail to supporters on Tuesday that Mr. Paul intends to keep fighting for his beliefs.
"By sending a large, respectful, and professional delegation to Tampa, we will show the party and the country that not only is our movement growing and here to stay, but that the future belongs to us," Mr. Benton wrote.

HEADLINE: Is There a Social Issues Strategy?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Debating the significance of the Obama campaign's culture war forays. 

 BODY:
My column over the weekend made the case that the Obama campaign's eagerness to change the subject from the economy to social issues has been winning them news cycles without helping their long-term cause. (Yesterday's Times/CBS poll showing Romney with a slight lead would seem to provide some confirmation of that point.) The New Republic's Alec MacGillis takes issue with my argument, suggesting that the Obama White House doesn't have a social issues strategy at all:
Douthat would have a very good point to make here about short and long term gains if what he was saying was, well, true. But it's quite obviously not. The Obama campaign's underlying message and strategy so far have been all about contrasting his vision for the economy with Mitt Romney. That's what the campaign's official kickoff speeches in Ohio and Virginia were all about. (And yes, he gave his first speech in Ohio. Which would seem to call slightly into question Galston's claim that the campaign is effectively giving up on the state.) The campaign's first ads last week were all about the economy-a "Morning in America"-style economic comeback ad,ads about the auto-industry rescue. And today, lo and behold, comes a very hard-edged two-minute ad attacking Romney and Bain Capital over their ill treatment of a Missouri steel mill that was reaped for big profits before they shut it down

 Douthat could not have known that this ad was coming. But still, it should have been plain from the campaign's other recent signals that they had no intention of trying to pull a Bush (or ) and make the campaign a cultural fight. Obama made the announcement on gay marriage last week because he had to-because Joe Biden forced his hand. But it's pretty plain that Chicago would rather fight this campaign on the terrain of a recovering auto industry and Bain's billions, rather than over gay rights. In this case, it was the pundits who were letting themselves be distracted by the 24-hour news cycle and missing the big picture.
I think I should have more precise in my argument. I don't actually believe that the Obama campaign thinks that it can fight the election on "war on women" grounds from here to November. (They can't possibly be that idiotic!) Rather, I meant to argue that , team Obama has showed a clear willingness to embrace and even expand social-issues debates - a willingness that contrasts sharply with previous Democratic campaign, and suggests a calculated view that cultural terrain provides a useful opportunity to talk about something other than the economy. Whatever pressures Joe Biden and the gay rights movement brought to bear on him, the president didn't have to play the same-sex marriage issue the way he did, and the White House certainly didn't have to expand the HHS mandate debate into a broader culture war debate that dominated the political conversation for a month (and then helped inspire the misguided "Life of Julia" campaign, which tried to weave together lifestyle issues into a defense of the welfare state).
Here I think it's MacGillis who's missing the bigger picture. Yes, of course, the White House is trying to build an economic narrative for the fall, one that weaves in everything from the Buffett Rule to the new Bain ad to many gambits yet to come. But the Obama campaign's willingness to talk social issues has been a consistent and consistently significant feature of the campaign to date, and it's certainly shaped news coverage of the election more than, say, the president's swing-state kickoff speeches did. It isn't the only thing that's been happening since January, but as a window into the state of the race and the thinking inside the White House, it seems like one of the most telling.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Art Deco Sears Store Is Now a Landmark

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The store in Flatbush, Brooklyn, an Art Deco structure with a distinctive 10-story corner tower, is now designated as a landmark. 

 BODY:
The Sears, Roebuck store in Flatbush, Brooklyn, an 80-year-old Art Deco structure with a distinctive 10-story corner tower, is now a city landmark. 
The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the building on Tuesday. The store, the only New York City project of the architecture firm Nimmons, Car & Wright, opened at the height of the Great Depression in 1932, providing 300 jobs, in a ceremony presided over by Eleanor Roosevelt, then the state's first lady.
Ms. Roosevelt is said to have made the store's first purchase, a pair of baby bootees. 
The store has an auditorium that fits 650 people and was also once home to a third-floor West Indian restaurant in the former employee break room.
"The building is as impressive for its architectural style, scale and massing as for the impact it must have had on Brooklyn and the city's economy when it first opened," the commission's chairman, Robert B. Tierney, said in a statement.
Though Sears has fallen on hard times in recent years and plans to close up to 120 of its Sears and Kmart stores, the Flatbush store is not among them.
The commission also granted landmark status to a Beaux-Arts former horse-auction house in the East Village, the Van Tassell & Kearney Auction Mart on East 13th Street near Third Avenue. The building is now home to a dance center. (See related post on The Local East Village.)
And the commission voted to open public hearings on a proposal to create the Bedford Historic District, a collection of 800 buildings, including hundreds of pre-1900 row houses and small apartment buildings northeast of Fulton Street and Bedford Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant - see description (pdf) and map (pdf).

HEADLINE: Bush Makes a Rare Return to Washington

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Former President George W. Bush visited the nation's capital on Tuesday to promote international dissidents, a memorial to Sept. 11 heroes and, as it happened, Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Former President George W. Bush made a rare return to Washington on Tuesday to promote international dissidents, a memorial to Sept. 11 heroes and, as it happened, Mitt Romney.
Just a couple of blocks from the White House, Mr. Bush gathered veterans of his administration as well as human rights leaders to kick off what he called a "freedom collection," an assemblage of interviews with activists who have fought authoritarian regimes around the world.
Although he did not mention his successor, Mr. Bush seemed to want to nudge President Obama to do more to support the revolutionaries of the Arab Spring, both those still seeking to topple entrenched governments, as in Syria, and those trying to build enduring democratic institutions after a regime change.
"As Americans," he said, "our goal should be to help reformers turn the end of tyranny into durable, accountable civic structures - strong constitutions, political parties committed to pluralism, free elections, the rule of law and property rights, hopeful economies drawn into open world markets, healthy civic institutions, protections for the rights of minorities and women. This work will require patience, creativity and active American leadership." 
The event featured a number of prominent dissidents from around the world, including Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian opposition figure living in the United States; Bob Fu, a Chinese-born pastor; and Normando Hernandez, a former political prisoner in Cuba. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who after decades of house arrest and struggles has just been elected to the Parliament in Myanmar, addressed the event via Skype.
Mr. Bush made a point of backing the Syrian opposition that has been fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad. "All of us here today join you in hoping and praying for the end of violence and the advance of freedom in Syria," he told Mr. Abdulhamid.
While Mr. Bush was focused on politics overseas, he finally put his toe into politics at home. As Mr. Bush was leaving the event, a reporter asked about the presidential race, and he replied, "I'm for Mitt Romney." Mr. Bush had declined to make an endorsement until now, but with Mr. Romney's last Republican rivals now out of the race, the former president opted to speak out.
Later in the day, Mr. Bush planned to join former President Bill Clinton for a fund-raiser at the Newseum to bring in money for a memorial to the heroes and victims of United Flight 93, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001, after passengers confronted hijackers.

HEADLINE: With JPMorgan as Example, Warren Calls for More Wall Street Regulation

BYLINE: JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The call comes as Elizabeth Warren tries to move beyond questions over whether she claimed American Indian ancestry to advance her career. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - In the wake of a $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase, Elizabeth Warren is redoubling her focus on a familiar campaign theme, calling for more effective Wall Street regulation with a burst of national media appearances, campaign statements and a new radio advertisement.
The call comes as Ms. Warren, the likely Democratic nominee for the Massachusetts Senate race, works to move beyond weeks of uncomfortable questions from the campaign of her Republican opponent, Senator Scott P. Brown, over whether she claimed American Indian ancestry at certain points in her academic career.
Still, those questions persisted on Tuesday, after Politico published part of a piece in the 1997 Fordham Law Review describing Ms. Warren as Harvard Law School's first female minority hire. "In my three years at Stanford Law School, there were no professors who were women of color. Harvard Law School hired its first woman of color, Elizabeth Warren, in 1995," read the piece, which was written by Laura Padilla about the role of minority women in a discussion of affirmative action.
In a 60-second radio advertisement released on Tuesday, Ms. Warren used the news of JPMorgan's trading loss to underscore what she has called a lack of accountability on Wall Street and the need for a stronger regulatory framework.
"Even now, Wall Street banks that got bailed out are still at it, gambling recklessly," Ms. Warren said in the advertisement. 
Ms. Warren then references her work to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a special adviser in the Obama administration. "I stood up to big banks," she says. "I took on their army of lobbyists and helped win the fight for a consumer protection agency."
Ms. Warren later continues, "In Washington, money talks, and Wall Street has plenty of money to spread around. So Wall Street gets all the special breaks while working families get hammered. That's what I want to change."
The new radio advertisement, the second for Ms. Warren's campaign, is a "major" buy that will be broadcast statewide, said Alethea Harney, a Warren spokeswoman. 
It comes after Ms. Warren's weekend call for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, to resign. "After the biggest financial crisis in generations, the American people are frustrated that Wall Street has still not been held accountable and does not appear to consider itself responsible," Ms. Warren said in a statement e-mailed by her campaign on Sunday.
On Monday, Ms. Warren appeared on "CBS This Morning,"CNN's "Starting Point" and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show," drawing on her consumer advocacy work to blast JPMorgan and Wall Street practices more broadly. "We have to say as a country, no, the banks cannot regulate themselves," Ms. Warren said on CBS.
In an e-mail to supporters on Monday night, she called for a renewed Glass-Steagall Act, referring to a 1933 law meant to place limitations on high-risk banking, which was repealed, for the most part, in 1999. "A new Glass-Steagall would separate high-risk investment banks from more traditional banking," Ms. Warren's e-mail read. "It would allow Wall Street to take risks, but not by dipping into the life savings and retirement accounts of regular people."
At the same time, Massachusetts Democrats called on Mr. Brown to disclose any fund-raising ties to JPMorgan. In a Monday conference call, the manager of Mr. Brown's campaign, Jim Barnett, would not say whether any of the company's executives were on a New York finance committee, which met in March, to raise money for his campaign.
During the call, Mr. Barnett renewed his push for Ms. Warren to release employment records from her time at Harvard Law School and the University of Pennsylvania law school - which the campaign has said may shed more light on Ms. Warren's claims about her ancestry.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Romney Warns of a 'Prairie Fire of Debt'

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney blamed much of the nation's debt problem on President Obama, whom he called an "old school" liberal. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES - Mitt Romney delivered a sweeping call for government austerity here on Monday, comparing the growth of federal spending and debt under President Obama to a fast-moving fire that threatens to engulf America's families. 
Invoking what he called the common-sense "kitchen table" values of Iowans, who are known for their aversion to debt, Mr. Romney called for major reforms to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, the elimination of the president's health care program and a cap on federal spending.
"A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation, and every day we fail to act that fire gets closer to the homes and children we love," Mr. Romney said to an audience of a few hundred at the Hotel Fort Des Moines. 
He compared the federal deficit to a toxic home mortgage -- "adjustable, no-money down and assigned to our children."
"Politicians have been trying to hide the truth about this nightmare mortgage for years - just like liar-loans," Mr. Romney said. 
Mr. Romney did not outline any new programs, but his speech marked a fresh and forceful emphasis on government spending, which his campaign views as a winning issue in an election year when the economy has shown only tepid improvement. 
The financial picture in Iowa, a swing state that Mr. Obama won in 2008, encapsulates the challenge for Mr. Romney. The state has weathered the recession far better than many of its neighbors; its employment rate is well below the national average.
Mr. Romney blamed much of the debt problem on Mr. Obama, whom he called an "old school" liberal. "Rather than put out the spending fire, he has fed the fire," he said.
He added: "America counted on President Obama to rescue the economy, tame the deficit and help create jobs. Instead, he bailed out the public sector, gave billions of dollars to the companies of his friends, and added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined."
A spokesman for the Obama campaign, Lis Smith, said that the president had put forth a plan to cut $4 trillion in spending over the next decade, and criticized Mr. Romney for not outlining how he would pay for proposed across-the-board tax cuts. (Mr. Romney did not mention those tax cuts in his speech.)
"Mitt Romney simply wants to return to the same policies that caused the crisis and weakened the middle class: budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and letting Wall Street write its own rules," Ms. Smith said.
Mr. Romney began his speech by saying that the issue of debt was bipartisan, saying that "the issue isn't who deserves the most blame."
But he returned, again and again, to what he characterized as the failed fiscal policies of Mr. Obama. In an especially pointed jab, Mr. Romney suggested that Mr. Obama's approach to government spending put him to the left of a Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, who was known for his centrist economic thinking, particularly on federal welfare programs. 
"President Obama tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship," Mr. Romney said.
"It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons," he added, to laughs from the audience. "But really it runs much deeper."

HEADLINE: The Third Party Fantasy

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Efforts to create a sensible centrist alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties are weak because they misunderstand where true political insurgency comes from. 

 BODY:
"Third parties are like bees," the intellectual historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in 1955. "Once they have stung, they die." It's an aphorism that aptly describes the anti-slavery and anti-immigrant parties of the mid-nineteenth century, the Populists and Progressives who ushered out the Gilded Age, as well as more recent third-party standard bearers, from George Wallace to Ross Perot. All of these movements and figures influenced American politics dramatically, before fading away and leaving the basic two-party duopoly intact.
Of late, though, our potential third parties have been skipping the stinging part and going straight to the dying. This was true of Unity '08, the much-ballyhooed attempt by former Democratic and Republican politicos to put up an independent alternative to Barack Obama and John McCain. Despite enjoying a wave of free publicity and boasting Sam Waterston of "Law & Order" as their spokesman, the Unityers never even came close to conjuring up a plausible candidate or platform, and their movement fizzled out amid attempts to entice an unwilling Michael Bloomberg into the lists.
Now the same endgame seems to have arrived for Americans Elect, a well-funded attempt to use the power of the Internet to run an Olympia Snowesque or Evan Bayhish centrist against Obama and Mitt Romney. After months of hype, the group made the embarrassing admission on Tuesday that "as of today, no candidate has reached the national support threshold required" to compete for the virtual party's nomination. This was a cumbersome way of acknowledging that almost no actual Americans were interested in what Americans Elect was offering them.
In part, as the American Electors have been at pains to emphasize, the fault lay with the candidates who put themselves forward for the group's nomination. Successful third parties need dynamic, high profile leaders, and ideally deep-pocketed ones as well. But instead of a Bloomberg, the Americans Elect ballot had ex-Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer; instead of a Bayh or a Snowe, they had Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University. Kotlikoff has impressive policy proposals and Roemer has an entertaining Twitter feed, but neither is exactly the potential general election spoiler who could keep David Axelrod awake at night.
But the fault also lay with the project's essential theory of what kind of third party contender disillusioned voters are pining to elect. From the (inarguable) premise that the public is wearied by the failures of the political and economic establishment, it leaped to the (preposterous) conclusion that the country is crying out for a presidential candidate who mostly represents the interests and values of exactly that same establishment.
The founders of Americans Elect, like the Unity '08ers before them, clearly pined for a candidate in the mold of New York's billionaire mayor: A center-left technocrat, more hawkish on deficits and pro-business than the average Democrat, but more socially liberal and less taxophobic than the average Republican. Such a candidate's platform would presumably amalgamate various unsuccessful bipartisan forays from the last ten years: The Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction plan, comprehensive immigration reform and tax reform, the cap-and-trade program that John McCain once backed and then abandoned, and so on.
Some of these ideas are good ones; some are not. But all of them have much more purchase among elites and insiders and power brokers in the Wall Street-Washington corridor than they do among the kinds of disaffected voters who usually propel third party campaigns, and give them their populist, anti-establishment edge.
What's more, given the record of the last decade, disaffected Americans have very good reasons to be suspicious when their elites promotes bipartisanship as an end unto itself. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was approved with significant bipartisan support, after all. The policies that inflated the housing bubble were bipartisan as well - and so was the hated Wall Street bailout that the bubble's consequences required. Even America's deficits are a monument to bipartisanship: to the many Republicans who have defended and expanded entitlements created by Democrats and to the many Democrats who have gone along with Republicans and ruled middle-class tax increases out of bounds.
Why, then, would Americans fed up with the two party system entrust their loyalties to a nascent movement that promises that this time, , a high-minded, bipartisan elite will get things right? Especially since the most successful third party surges, from the William Jennings Bryan-era Populists down to Ross Perot's 19 percent, usually arise from precisely the opposite impulse - a "plague on both your houses" populism that highlights issues and anxieties that the leaders of the two major parties have decided to ignore.
Such a populism has flowered over the last two years, but it's mostly appeared on the right and left-wing fringes of the two parties rather than in the space between them - in the Tea Party's backlash against bailouts and spending and in the Occupy Wall Street revolt against Wall Street's political influence.
It's possible to imagine a gifted political figure emerging to fuse elements from the Tea Party and O.W.S. critiques into a plausible third party challenge to politics as usual. But such a candidate would look nothing like Michael Bloomberg or any other high-minded Davos/Brookings type of technocrat. Instead, he or she would be more disreputable, more eccentric, and probably more demagogic as well. Such a candidacy (Pat Buchanan meets Ralph Nader) wouldn't have to actually govern the country; instead, its purpose would be to jolt the two parties out of their usual habits and arguments and to persuade one or both of them to adopt some of its ideas.
These are not the sort of qualities and goals that the founders of Americans Elect envisioned for their project. But that's precisely why they failed - because they didn't recognize, or didn't want to recognize, what it takes for a third party to actually sting like a bee.

HEADLINE: A 30,000-Foot View on the Presidential Race

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Nothing fundamental has changed in the race in the past month or two, although there are a couple of factors that may be working in Mitt Romney's favor at the margin. 

 BODY:
We are beginning to see more national surveys now, including this week's New York Times/CBS News poll, which show Mitt Romney with a slight lead over President Obama in the general election matchup. To be sure, there are also a number of polls that put Mr. Obama slightly ahead. But his lead does seem to have narrowed - from about three or four points in an average of national polls a month or two ago to more like a point or so in surveys today.
Has something fundamental changed in the race?
Probably not. Instead, I suspect we are seeing some reversion to the mean. It could be that Mr. Obama's larger lead from before was somewhat ephemeral, although there are a couple of factors that may be working in Mr. Romney's favor at the margin. 
Although we are getting to the point where these national polls are at least worth a passing glance, it is still also worth paying attention to Mr. Obama's approval rating. These have a history of predicting electoral outcomes at least as closely as head-to-head polls in the early stages of the race, especially for incumbent presidents.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings have not moved all that much. For the last month or two, they have been essentially even. Right now, in the RealClearPolitics average, 48.3 percent of Americans approve of the job that Mr. Obama is doing, and 48.6 percent disapprove.
A president can get re-elected with numbers like those. Obviously, he can also lose. But the fact that Mr. Obama's approval ratings are close to even means that it should not be surprising that the numbers in his matchup against Mr. Romney are getting closer to even, too.
I am not a purist who says that candidates and campaigns make no difference. That said, the most reliable benchmark in the past of when presidential results deviate from those predicted by approval ratings is when one of the candidates has a relatively "extreme" ideology, like Barry M. Goldwater or George S. McGovern. Mr. Romney does not qualify as an extremist by the various measures we can look at that attempt to quantify this objectively - neither does he qualify as a moderate. Instead, he is a "generic Republican," who might run fairly close to the outcomes predicted by Mr. Obama's approval ratings.
Mr. Romney also went through a period where his favorability ratings were quite poor. However, they have since improved to about even, possibly because his job has been less complicated since the effective end of the Republican primary campaign. It is not uncommon for favorability ratings to shift over the course of a campaign, particularly once the primaries end.
I am working on our general election model, which can begin to look at some of this data in a more formal way. No model is perfect, but some things probably benefit from applying a more formal and rigorous structure. For instance, Mr. Obama's state-by-state polls look a pinch better on balance than his national numbers. It is hard to know if there is something real there; the timing of the polls and the relative ordering of the states in the Electoral College need to be carefully considered.
Likewise, most of the polls we are seeing now are of registered voters or adults rather than likely voters. That is something that needs to be accounted for. Usually a shift from registered voters to likely voters will improve the Republican candidate's standing by a couple of points because Republican voters are older, wealthier and more likely to turn out in the average election. On the other hand, I do not think it is a good strategy to look solely at likely voter polls while ignoring the others. Some survey firms that use likely voter models have a history of a partisan skew in their polls that has nothing to do with the likely voter model itself.
The last thing to remember is that when an election is quite close, it does not take very much to shift the race from one candidate being a 60/40 favorite to it being about even. 
At the betting market Intrade, Mr. Obama's odds of re-election have consistently been around 60 percent. While, on the one hand, it is good not to overreact to new data at this early stage of the race, it is also worth remembering that even a one-point shift in a president's approval ratings, or a modest change in the economic forecasts, can move a president's re-election odds at the margin.
The marginal factors in the past four or six weeks have looked slightly better for Mr. Romney than Mr. Obama. The recuperation in Mr. Romney's favorability numbers, for instance - if it was somewhat to be expected - also reduces the risk that his personal qualities might cause him to lose an election that he otherwise would have won, as during another economic downturn.
Meanwhile, the tumultuous situation in Greece may increase the chance of an economic downside case for Mr. Obama. And data from the domestic economy has not been as strong lately. (Although it might also be mentioned that the situation in the Middle East is thought to be improving, and oil pries have receded somewhat.)
Put another way, if you are being very detail oriented, there is a case to be made that Mr. Romney's odds of being elected have improved somewhat over the past six weeks. I suppose we can be even more detail oriented once we get the general election model up and running. If you just want the 30,000-foot view ... well, it looks pretty close, as it did before.
What I am less convinced by is the idea that anything in the campaign - the day-to-day stories that the news media covers - has mattered very much so far. One of the reasons that campaign stories have been so trivial lately is because if one of the campaigns has an especially strong line of attack on their opponent, or a great piece of opposition research, it does not make a lot of sense to drop it now when most voters are not paying attention yet. It is still extremely early for a general election campaign. If the period after Labor Day qualifies as the pennant race, and the summer of the general election year the regular season, we are still playing preseason baseball now.

HEADLINE: A Russian Magnate's Facebook Bet Pays Off Big

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- With his droopy eyeglasses and boxy suits, Alisher B. Usmanov is at no risk of being mistaken for a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. But the Russian steel tycoon is poised to make billions of dollars from the initial public stock offering of Facebook this week -- in the same league as many of that social networking company's early backers.
Mr. Usmanov, an industrial and media magnate who has demonstrated a keen ability to take advantage of the opportunities that appear in a financial disaster, is reaping the rewards of an ambitious bet on Facebook made amid the global economic recession in 2009.
As other investors were demanding tough terms, he said in an interview this week, he and his Russian business associates were willing to buy almost 10 percent of the company while giving up the voting rights on those shares to Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. 
Now the Russian-led investments of less than $900 million, made through two entities, Mail.ru and Digital Sky Technologies, will be worth more than $6 billion, based on the midpoint of the $34 to $38 price range that Facebook's bankers have set for the stock.
Mr. Usmanov, 58, who got his start in the plastic bag business and was reared in a remote part of the Soviet Union, said he learned the benefits of acting boldly during the ruble crisis of 1998.
''I have a theory of crisis that you must employ crisis to create additional margin,'' he said this week in a telephone interview. ''You need to understand when the moment of growth is coming, and invest just before that.''
Mr. Zuckerberg turned to the Russian investors in 2009 at a meeting quietly brokered by Goldman Sachs. Other sources of financing had slowed because of the crisis. And, because of the popularity of online social games in Russia, investors here had a keen sense of the value of social networking sites and were willing to pay more than others for a stake in Facebook.
The Russians were also willing to accept another condition important to Mr. Zuckerberg. Despite owning 10 percent of Facebook, they would get no voting rights or seat on the board. They would also have no say in the site's policies on privacy or political organizing -- preserving independence that has become especially important as Facebook has played a major role in domestic politics in Russia.
Mr. Usmanov, who is close to the Kremlin, has not hesitated to use his media properties to support the government. Last December, he fired the publisher and editor at one of Russia's most respected newsmagazines, Kommersant Vlast, after it published detailed accounts of bald falsification in national elections. Mr. Usmanov said he fired the executive not for the political coverage per se, but for printing a picture of a ballot defaced with an obscenity insulting Vladimir V. Putin, then prime minister of Russia and now president.
But Mr. Usmanov said the Russian venture into Facebook was purely commercial. ''Americans started investing abroad after 100 years of capitalism at home,'' he said. ''We are doing it after 20 years.''
The precise details of the Russian ownership in Facebook are difficult to assess. The investments were made over two years though the Russian Internet company Mail.ru and the investment fund Digital Sky Technologies, also known as D.S.T., which is run by the venture capitalist Yuri Milner. Although Mr. Usmanov was the leading backer, other investors were involved.
Mr. Milner met with Zuckerberg in 2009 before the first investment, though Mr. Usmanov has never met him.
Mr. Milner said his focus on social networking reflected insights gained from watching the Russian Internet market develop in the last few years. In 2005, D.S.T. began investing in Internet companies in Russia and Eastern Europe, where, as in parts of Asia, people took to social games and the trading of virtual goods faster than in the United States.
The print media market was already weak, a legacy of the Soviet breakup and political controls on national newspapers, leaving a freer space for crowdsourced media like social networks.
Mr. Milner said that this led to an understanding that social networking business models involving tiny payments from large numbers of users had vast potential in emerging markets.
''At the time, I was probably the best-informed person in the world about social networking monetization,'' he said.
Russia remains one of the few major markets today where Facebook does not dominate social networking, because of the strength of local companies like VKontakte and Moi Mir. (Other markets where Facebook is weak include South Korea, where it is gaining, and China, where government firewalls block the site because of its potential to be used in organizing dissent.)
Mr. Usmanov said that, after the series of investments from 2009 until 2011, he and Mr. Milner owned about 9 percent of Facebook at one point, but now own about 6 percent and will hold about 4.5 percent after the initial public offering. The other shares they originally controlled have gone to other investors, clients of D.S.T. and corporate entities.
Mr. Usmanov earned his billions in the post-Soviet business world, managing steel mill subsidiaries for Gazprom before they were spun off as his own businesses, Gazmetal, later renamed Metalloinvest. Mr. Usmanov has said he took on debt in this transaction and others acquiring iron ore mines in Russia.
He said he would use money from investors who buy his shares in the Facebook I.P.O. to invest and pay down debt at his other Russian businesses.
This year, Russia's second-largest cellphone company, MegaFon, which Mr. Usmanov partly owns, is expected to issue shares in London in its own I.P.O.
From his work with Gazprom, Mr. Usmanov is said to be close to Russia's former president and current prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former chairman of the Gazprom board. His ties to the Kremlin and Facebook have stirred concerns that he might influence the company's policies in subtle ways to appease governments in markets where Facebook is also an important tool of political dissent, such as Russia.
Because he does not vote Facebook shares, however, Mr. Usmanov has no direct influence on policies for the site in Russia.
A native of Uzbekistan, Mr. Usmanov spent six years in an Uzbek prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement in the 1980s, charges he contends were politically inspired and the result of a power struggle among the Uzbek elite. Mr. Usmanov's father was a prosecutor. He was sent to a remote prison camp where many men his father had convicted were serving time, apparently an intentional decision so he would be abused or killed.
Soviet courts later exonerated Mr. Usmanov and expunged his record. The Supreme Court of Uzbekistan in 2000 ruled that the K.G.B. had fabricated evidence against him and other children of top Uzbek officials in that period.
''I survived only because I loved my wife, and wanted to return to her, and because I wanted to prove I was innocent,'' he said. ''I am an example to innocent people in jail. A man like that can achieve something. I dedicated 25 years of my life to this idea.''

PERSON: Harold A. Poling 

HEADLINE: Harold A. Poling, 86, a Chairman of Ford

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
Harold A. Poling, the son of an auto mechanic who helped guide the Ford Motor Company through the recession of the early 1990s as its chairman and chief executive, died on Saturday in Pacific Grove, Calif. He was 86.
His death was announced by Ford, where Mr. Poling worked for 43 years before his retirement in 1994. 
Known as Red because of his auburn hair, Mr. Poling rose through the company's ranks on the strength of his financial acumen and a low-key leadership style that brought stability during tough times.
He gained prominence in the 1980s as the head of Ford's troubled North American operations, and later as the company's president and chief operating officer, imposing financial discipline early in his tenure and presiding over plant closings and widespread job cuts. He was also credited with using Japanese production techniques to shave costs and improve quality.
In the midst of huge losses, Mr. Poling joined other senior Ford executives in backing a $3 billion program that produced the wildly popular Ford Taurus. ''We bet the company,'' Mr. Poling said in a Ford news release. ''It was a tremendous gamble, but it has paid off handsomely.''
He was promoted to president of Ford in 1985 and became a vice chairman two years later. The company's fortunes improved as well, with Ford reporting what was then an industry record of $5.3 billion in profits in 1988.
Mr. Poling was named Ford's chairman and chief executive in 1990, succeeding Donald E. Peterson. He was 64 years old, but the company gave him an exemption to stay beyond its mandatory retirement age of 65. On his watch, the company introduced models that allowed it to emerge from the recession with a competitive lineup.
Through all the ups and downs of the industry and Ford's management infighting, Mr. Poling was considered a steady, unflappable executive.
''He was not a table-pounding kind of guy, just very smart, very cordial and very professional,'' said David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Mr. Cole recalled a dinner in the early 1990s attended by Mr. Poling and Roger B. Smith, then the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, Ford's hometown rival. Mr. Smith dominated the conversation at the table, Mr. Cole recalled, while Mr. Poling hardly said a word. ''So my wife turned to him and said, 'Red, what do you do?' And Red just smiled and said, 'I'm the C.E.O. of Ford.' ''
Harold Arthur Poling was born on Oct. 14, 1925, in Troy, Mich., the son of an auto mechanic and a nurse. He said that he learned the basics about cars from his father. ''We'd grind valves, change piston rings and clutches, and do lots of other jobs,'' he said. ''It was serious work, but to me it was very interesting.''
His family moved to Virginia, where Mr. Poling attended high school. He joined the Navy at 17. After being discharged two years later, he went on to earn a bachelor of arts degree from Monmouth College in Illinois 1949 and a master's degree in business administration from Indiana University in 1951.
He joined Ford in 1951 as a cost analyst in the company's steel division, and had several financial posts before becoming a vice president of Ford of Europe in 1972. He became chairman of the European subsidiary, and in 1980 was named executive vice president of North American operations.
In 1986, he received a distinguished service citation from the Automotive Hall of Fame.
Mr. Poling is survived by his wife, Marian, whom he married in 1957; two daughters, Kathryn Poling and Pam Cruden; a son, Doug; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Markets Slump as Greece Falters Anew

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell for the eighth day out of the last 10 on Tuesday as uncertainty stemming from the political stalemate in Greece gave investors another reason to be cautious and sellers came out in force late in the session.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell for the third straight session as attempts to form a government in Greece fell apart, raising the possibility of a rejection of the bailout terms detailed by the European Union for the fiscally troubled nation.
After holding near the unchanged mark for much of the session, stocks moved lower in the absence of positive news to turn the tide of negative sentiment. 
''Those who are looking for a little bit of a bounce off the last eight trading sessions lost their nerve because there is really nothing out there to indicate the broader story has changed,'' said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City.
The concerns about upheaval in the euro zone and its effect on the global economy weighed on energy and materials stocks, with crude oil prices down for the third day. The S.& P. energy index and the S.& P. materials index each dropped 1.5 percent.
Quarterly results helped the shares of the retailers TJX, up 6.9 percent at $42.45, and Dick's Sporting Goods, up 5.9 percent at $50.05.
Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in April, slightly below expectations. But details in the Commerce Department's report indicating underlying strength in demand, and a rebound in manufacturing activity in New York State calmed concerns that the economy was stalling.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 63.35 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 12,632.00. The S.& P. 500 lost 7.69 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,330.66. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,893.76.
The declines on Tuesday pushed the S.& P. 500 down more than 6 percent from its early April high, leaving some investors optimistic that the pullback may be nearing an end as stock prices become more attractive.
''We could go a little lower, but not much lower. It's hard to ignore the fundamentals -- and clearly there are some good fundamentals and prices,'' said Mark Martiak, senior wealth strategist at Premier/First Allied Securities in New York.
Data showing an index of home builders' sentiment at a five-year high in May helped lift the sector's shares. The PHLX housing index advanced 0.6 percent. But Home Depot shares lost 2.4 percent to $48.67 and ranked as the biggest drag on the Dow after the home improvement retailer posted quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street's expectations.
After the closing bell, shares of J. C. Penney slumped almost 12 percent to $29.40 after the retailer's release of quarterly results and same-store sales that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also said it would discontinue its quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share.
JPMorgan Chase rose 1.3 percent to $36.24, mostly unchanged this week after falling more than 11 percent last week after disclosing a trading loss of at least $2 billion. Pressure mounted on the bank to reclaim some of the millions of dollars it paid to the executives who oversaw the wrong-way trades.
Avon Products tumbled 9.7 percent to $18.71 after Coty withdrew its $10.7 billion takeover bid for the company, saying it had missed a deadline to start discussions.
Chesapeake Energy shares dropped as much as 7.8 percent to $14.31, their lowest since March 2009, after a credit rating downgrade and news that the natural gas producer would increase its borrowing to $4 billion from the planned $3 billion as it faces a liquidity crunch. Chesapeake shares finished the session down 5.6 percent at $14.65.
Bond prices were little changed. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 1/32, to 99 26/32, while its yield was unchanged at 1.77 percent.

HEADLINE: As Clemens Trial Drags, Jury Keeps Dozing

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the five days it took lawyers to select the jury for Roger Clemens's federal perjury trial, potential jurors were confronted with more than 100 questions.
They were asked about their education, their occupations and their attitude toward athletes and performance-enhancing drugs. They were asked whether they had ever discussed or read about the use of steroids or human growth hormone.
But it seems that for all the care and caution that went into scrutinizing the Washingtonians who would end up determining Clemens's fate, one fundamental question was overlooked: can you stay awake during the trial? 
The trial of Clemens is in its fifth week -- with Brian McNamee, the government's star witness, now on the stand -- and already, two jurors have been dismissed for falling asleep.
The first juror excused by the judge, Reggie Walton of United States District Court, was a 27-year-old chronically unemployed man who was let go last week. During juror questioning, he told prosecutors that he would ''rather be asleep'' than serve on the jury. In the end, he tried to do both but failed.
Walton then warned the remaining 15 jurors and alternates: ''Stay alert. We don't want to lose anybody else.''
But another juror, a young woman who works as a cashier at a supermarket, failed to heed that warning. She nodded off on Monday -- the day McNamee, Clemens's former trainer, began his testimony -- and was dismissed by Walton on Tuesday.
It was just last week that Walton scolded the prosecutors and the defense lawyers for asking too many unnecessary questions and boring the jurors so much that they had begun to discuss the case among themselves, which they were told not to do. He even threatened to put a time limit on the trial.
Before testimony began last month, Walton also told jurors that there would be free coffee in the jury room.
Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia law school and a former federal prosecutor, said that was not done simply to foster good will.
''Coffee is a critical tool of the American justice system,'' Richman said, at least half-jokingly, adding that commanding the interest of jurors was not easy because they were often expecting a trial to be as entertaining as a television courtroom drama.
''It's taking a bunch of people out of their ordinary setting, putting them together and telling them not to talk about the case, the one and only thing they have in common, then expecting them to rise to the occasion,'' Richman said. ''Most of the time, they do. Sometimes, they don't.''
Jed Rakoff, a federal judge in Manhattan, said sleeping jurors were not uncommon. In even the most exciting trials, there are boring spells that can put jurors to sleep, he said.
In the Clemens case, for example, jurors heard several days of rudimentary testimony about how federal agents handled the case's key physical evidence. At least one juror -- and it was not one of the two kicked off for sleeping -- nodded off several times.
Jurors seemed to be slightly more alert Tuesday for McNamee's second day on the stand. He told jurors how his now former wife urged him to collect physical evidence showing that Clemens was using steroids. He said she was convinced that he would be the scapegoat if anyone ever found out about the drug use. ''You're going to go down!'' he said she told him.
McNamee also said that he injected Clemens's wife, Debbie, in the belly with human growth hormone while Clemens watched, and that he considered it ''creepy.''
Rusty Hardin, Clemens's lead lawyer, spent less than 20 minutes cross-examining McNamee before court adjourned until Wednesday, when the judge will probably be on the lookout for more heavy eyelids in the jury box.
Rakoff said the key to staving off juror sleepiness was to detect it early.
''I carefully watch the jurors in my trials, especially in the early afternoons when, as much of the world once recognized, siestas were a good way to digest a large lunch,'' he said.
At least the Clemens jurors can take solace in knowing that the trial may have only a few more weeks to go.
That is nothing compared with the McMartin preschool trial in the 1980s that dealt with allegations of sexual abuse at a California day-care center. That trial lasted three years.
Another 1980s epic, the Pizza Connection case, went on for 17 months in court in Manhattan as jurors listened, and listened, to testimony about heroin distribution and money laundering. One of the long-suffering jurors in that case lasted 16 months before a judge dismissed her after she received an apparent threatening phone call.
And in the 1970s, jurors in a case involving Memorex and I.B.M. were left to review a 20,000-page transcript of the six-month trial in San Francisco.
The consequences of a juror who loses focus can be dire. Last year, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed a death-penalty conviction after a judge failed to declare a mistrial or dismiss a juror who had been seen sleeping for as much as five minutes at a time during expert testimony. Another juror in that case was reprimanded -- but not dismissed -- for posting to his Twitter account.
Richman, the Columbia professor, said that dozing jurors could pose a problem for the defense. Clemens's lawyers want the jury to pay attention to details so they can later poke holes in the prosecution's narrative, he said.
Sometimes, Richman said, prosecutors do not mind when jurors snooze, particularly when the evidence is strong. ''In that case, the jurors will just wake up, yawn, then convict,'' he said.
Richman also drew a distinction between the Clemens trial and the perjury trial of Barry Bonds, baseball's home run king, who was convicted last year of obstructing justice for giving misleading statements to a federal grand jury.
Unlike in the Clemens case, some of the testimony in that trial came from a former mistress who spoke of a weakening in Bonds's sex drive and of his shriveled testicles.
''The Bonds case had sex in it,'' Richman said. ''That's why everyone found it interesting. I bet there weren't any jurors sleeping through that one.''

HEADLINE: Contractor Is Accused of Stealing $1.2 Million From Hedge Fund by Inflating Costs

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Alex Getelman was still in his 20s when he turned his nascent company into what he called ''New York City's fastest-growing general contracting and construction management firm.'' He had a list of blue-chip clients, a plush office on 57th Street and a luxurious home on Long Island's North Shore.
But in order to help pay for his castlelike stone house on 3.3 acres in Old Brookville, prosecutors charged, Mr. Getelman systematically inflated the cost of work for one of the largest hedge funds in the world, Citadel Investment Group. Between 2008 and 2011, Mr. Getelman stole $1.2 million from Citadel as his company, Aragon, built offices for the hedge fund in the skyscraper at 601 Lexington Avenue, the former Citicorp Center, according to the complaint filed on Tuesday by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The contractor also failed to declare the extra income and pay $286,000 in taxes, the complaint said. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Getelman, now 39, pleaded not guilty to one count of grand larceny and one count of filing a false tax return in Criminal Court in Lower Manhattan.
Citadel, which declined to comment, has been the comeback kid of the hedge-fund world. After the company stumbled badly in 2008, its founder, Kenneth C. Griffin, earned a 20 percent return for his investors last year and a $700 million paycheck.
The charges against Mr. Getelman are the latest case in a long-running investigation into the interior construction industry by the district attorney's rackets bureau and the special investigations unit of the State Police.
Over the past two years, investigators have seized company records, interviewed nearly 100 subcontractors -- including P. J. Mechanical Corporation -- and subpoenaed property owners like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and L&L Holding Company. But progress has been slow.
After Lehr Construction Corporation and four of its executives were indicted in May 2011 on charges of padding their bills by tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Getelman told The New York Observer that he was unsure whether corruption was an industrywide problem. But he was emphatic that Aragon was above board. ''I know that we don't run our operation that way -- nor have we ever.''
He said at the time that his company had a ''very nice niche'' within the hedge-fund and investment industry. Despite the recession, Mr. Getelman claimed he was still doing 120 to 150 projects a year. ''We've worked with all the large shops, but the hedge-fund shops, which are already very lucrative, are continuing to grow,'' he said.
Mr. Getelman bought the land for his house in Old Brookville in 2008, according to public records, and began building the 7,900-square-foot house, which includes six bathrooms, four fireplaces, a large swimming pool, a basketball court and landscaped grounds.
As he completed work on the $4.3 million home in 2011, Mr. Getelman celebrated Aragon's 10th anniversary, inviting 300 people to a party at the chic 42nd Street hot spot Espace.
A number of rival firms in the industry have also run into trouble. Lehr and its top executives are scheduled to go on trial Oct. 9. Lehr executives were also at the center of a wide-ranging prosecution of corruption in the construction industry 14 years ago. The troubled company filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Julian Alessi and his company, MDA Contracting, pleaded guilty in February to a scheme to defraud. The company is dissolving, and Mr. Alessi will be sentenced in June.
Michael Hayes and his company, Sweeney & Harkin Carpentry and Dry Wall Corporation, pleaded guilty to various related charges last September. George and Kevin Fotiadis and their company, Liberty Contracting, pleaded guilty in December to misdemeanor charges, made restitution and paid a $50,000 fine. And George Figliolia and John Krupa of the Builders Group are in prison on charges related to stealing millions of dollars from clients at several condominium and office projects.
''We continue to aggressively investigate corrupt activity in the interior construction industry,'' Mr. Vance's chief assistant, Daniel R. Alonso, said.
Mr. Getelman's lawyer, David M. Zornow, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Dam Project Threatens A Way of Life In Peru

BYLINE: By AARON NELSEN

 BODY:
BOCA SANIBENI, Peru -- Along the murky waters of the Ene River, in a remote jungle valley on the verdant eastern slopes of the Andes, the rhythmic humming of an outboard motor draws the stares of curious Ashaninka children.
With encroachment from settlers and speculators, and after a devastating war against Shining Path rebels a decade ago, the indigenous Ashaninkas' hold is precarious. And they are now facing a new peril, the proposed 2,200-megawatt Pakitzapango hydroelectric dam, which would flood much of the Ene River valley. 
The project is part of a proposal for as many as five dams that under a 2010 energy agreement would generate more than 6,500 megawatts, primarily for export to neighboring Brazil. The dams would displace thousands of people in the process.
Antonio Metzoquiari, 59, a thin man wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap, considered the implications for his community. ''This is a grave matter,'' Mr. Metzoquiari said. ''It's a return to violence, another war. I don't know where or how, but we would have to find a new place to live.''
At a time when hydroelectric dams have fallen out of favor in some parts of the world, the projects might seem an anachronism. But dams remain attractive in much of Latin America, where a number of nations have plenty of water but lack other conventional and affordable energy sources.
For now, the project is stalled in the Peruvian Congress, where it awaits debate by the Foreign Relations Commission. President Ollanta Humala has yet to take a position on the dams, but how he manages this and numerous other initiatives across the country that pit development against local and predominantly indigenous communities could very well define his presidency, said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a research organization based in Washington.
''The biggest test for Humala is how he strikes the middle ground,'' Mr. Shifter said. ''I think he understands that if he moves too hard and too fast on this development path, that it can really come back to bite him.''
Already Mr. Humala is being tested in northern Peru, where thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months to oppose the $4.8 billion Conga gold mine that the protesters say would pollute water supplies.
Mr. Humala capitalized on social movements like these, especially among Peru's large and historically marginalized indigenous population, to win the presidency, much to the chagrin of the middle and upper classes in Lima, the capital, who were the primary beneficiaries of a decade-long economic boom based substantially on mining.
Mr. Humala opposed the Conga mine during the campaign, but he has since given the project his support while pledging to ensure quality of life improvements for surrounding communities. This conciliatory approach might be a first glimpse at how the president plans to achieve his social agenda while assuaging wary investors, said Fernando Romero, a sociologist and an expert on social conflict in Peru.
''I think what we are seeing is that the government will look to mining and investment from Brazil as the principal source of funding for its plan for social inclusion,'' he said.
So far, Mr. Humala has not staked out a clear position on the proposed dams, though that is likely to change when President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil visits Peru, a visit expected soon.
Officials with the Energy and Mining Ministry say the dams make economic sense only if much of the energy they produce is exported. The ministry added that while it considered environmental and social issues important, it also wanted to make sure that affected local populations benefit from the projects through electrification.
Despite claims that the welfare of affected communities is a top priority, several of the projects passed feasibility studies before local residents were even informed that the government had awarded concessions on the land. In response to that disclosure, the Central Ashaninka del Rio Ene, which represents Ashaninka populations in the Ene River Valley, went to court to compel the Energy and Mining Ministry to disclose all feasibility studies on the dam proposals.
After the project was announced, the organization brought together 17 Ashaninka communities to explain that a dam would inundate some communities and dry out others that depend on the river for sustenance and transportation. Many people would be forced from their homes, critics argue, evoking memories of Peru's war against the Moaist-inspired Shining Path rebels, which officially ended in 2000 but scarred the Ashaninka.
Of the 70,000 people who were killed over two decades, 6,000 were Ashaninka, experts said. Thousands more were displaced and only over the past few years have they begun to resettle their communities along the Ene.
''This is why the Ashaninka brothers say because we have sacrificed while our families disappeared, I'm not going to give away our land so easily to the state,'' said CARE's president, Ruth Buendia.
She said the Ashaninka do not understand how a project of this magnitude was approved without their knowledge.
''They think we're going to break windows and protest like in Conga, but we aren't,'' Ms. Buendia said, thumping the table. ''Just as they do to us with legal documents we are going to do to them.''
When the scope of the dam project was made clear to the Ashaninka, many expressed disbelief while others worried that an exodus would lead to infighting over diminished resources. The final speaker, Dimer Dominguito, 25, who was accompanied by his wife and five children, captured the Ashaninka's desperation and outrage.
''In the city they make money and buy whatever they need, but here we live by our customs, our market, eating what we plant and we are happy,'' he said. ''We want to defend our right to what is natural, to defend our market, and we support the government, but who supports us?''

HEADLINE: Gas Costs Fall, Giving Hope for Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are starting to see some relief from higher gasoline prices, a change that could revive the economy in the months ahead.
Consumer prices were flat in April, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday, largely because of a decline in gas prices. Cheaper gas may be combining with steady job growth to increase spending on more expensive items.
Sales of autos, furniture and electronics all rose in April. And Americans spent more at restaurants and bars, generally a sign of confidence in the economy. 
''Consumer spending looks to have started the second quarter on a solid footing,'' said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.
Despite the strength in important areas, overall retail sales increased just 0.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That modest gain followed stronger increases in February and March.
Less expensive gas offset some of the gains in big purchases. The mild winter was also a factor. In February and March, it propelled sales in areas such as building materials and gardening supplies. Spending in those categories fell sharply in April.
Still, economists were encouraged by the details in the report. Excluding autos, gas station sales and building materials, so-called core retail sales increased 0.4 percent, a modest gain.
''All the categories that showed gains are positive signs for consumer spending going forward,'' said Leslie Levesque, senior economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The categories where there were declines were mainly a payback for the warmer weather.''
Recent job growth has contributed to higher consumer confidence. Employers have added a million jobs in the last five months, though the pace of gains has slowed recently.
Another reason to be optimistic is that gasoline prices are falling after spiking. The national average dropped to $3.73 a gallon on Tuesday, about 17 cents cheaper than a month ago, according to a survey by AAA. Sales at gas stations fell 0.3 percent in April.
''We had expected gas prices to be elevated until Memorial Day,'' Mr. Levesque said. ''The fact that they have already retreated so much is a very good sign. It alleviates the strain on consumers' pockets.''
Cheaper gas also kept inflation tame. Gas prices fell a seasonally adjusted 2.6 percent in April, the Labor Department said. That offset mild increases in the cost of food, housing and clothes.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index was flat. Excluding volatile food and gas costs, core prices rose 0.2 percent.
In the last 12 months, prices have risen 2.3 percent, the smallest gain in more than a year.
Mild inflation leaves consumers with more money to spend, which tends to increase economic growth. It could also encourage businesses to invest more in their stockpiles this spring.
Businesses took a more cautious approach to restocking in March, a trend that has helped slow economic growth this year. Company inventories grew just 0.3 percent, the Commerce Department said in a separate report. It was the smallest increase in four months.
When companies reduce stockpiling, it slows factory production and growth tends to decline.
But if retail spending keeps rising, businesses are likely to step up restocking. That could increase growth in the second quarter.
Two other reports provided some reason for optimism. A measure of manufacturing activity in New York State jumped in May, reversing a large drop in April. Measures of new orders and employment rose.
And confidence among home builders reached its highest level in five years in May, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. Builders reported greater sales and higher traffic from prospective buyers.

HEADLINE: Euro Zone Economy Skirts an Official Recession, but Growth Is Minimal

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- It's way too early to call a turning point. But while Greeks were marching in the streets against austerity, their economy may actually have been growing for the first time since 2009. That surprise news resided deep within first-quarter economic data for Europe released Tuesday that also showed, to everyone's mild relief, that the euro zone as a whole has still avoided slipping into a regional recession.
Greece, where the economy has been in free fall, ''grew'' only after adjusting for seasonal effects -- a calculation made by economists at Barclays. The Greek government did not provide an official figure. 
''I cannot imagine this is really a new spring,'' said Fabio Fois, European economist at Barclays in London. Nor is news of technically defined growth likely to offer much consolation to ordinary Greeks. Not while one in five people in the work force are out of work.
Still, along with growth in Germany that was much better than expected, the data provided mild respite from the gloom that has pervaded Europe in recent days. Despite the figures, major stock indexes retreated Tuesday in Europe, and Spanish and Italian bond yields, or interest rates, edged up on news that those two countries' economies continued to contract. Indexes in the United States, however, were modestly higher in afternoon trading.
The euro zone, by not slipping into recession in the first quarter of 2012, ran counter to expectations. Growth in the region was zero compared to the previous quarter, according to the figures, from Eurostat, the E.U. statistics agency.
''In the current context, zero growth in the euro zone in the first quarter is relatively good news,'' Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in a statement. ''It suggests that the economy is not falling off a cliff under the burden of fiscal austerity.''
In the fourth quarter of 2011, gross domestic product in the euro zone had declined 0.3 percent. A second consecutive quarter of decline would have met the general definition of a recession.
Germany's economy expanded 0.5 percent in the first quarter, more than analysts expected. But France did not grow at all, Spain's economy slipped 0.3 percent, and Italy experienced a 0.8 percent decline in output.
The divergence in the numbers, which officials adjusted for seasonal effects, showed that there remains a wide gulf between Northern and Southern Europe.
''Even if the euro zone as a whole narrowly escaped technical recession in the first quarter, there is no sign of a strong, sustained economic bounceback on the horizon,'' Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. The data, he said, ''offers scant consolation for the peripheral economies, where the recession is deepening and whose economic fortunes look bleak at best and downright depressing at worst.''
The growth numbers arrived hours before Francois Hollande, newly sworn in as French president, traveled to Berlin, where he was to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel. She was likely to see the data as vindication of her position that growth must be the product of sound government finances and economic restructuring, not the stimulus advocated by Mr. Hollande.
The Greek economy has shrunk by more than a quarter since 2008, and continued to plunge at the beginning of the year without adjusting for seasonal effects, although at a slower velocity. While Greece's official statisticians do not make such adjustments, statistics agencies in most countries adjust quarterly data to reflect the fact that economic activity typically picks up at the end of a year and slows at the beginning of the next.
Another euro zone trouble spot, Portugal, also performed less dismally than expected. Its economy shrank 0.1 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter, compared with a 1 percent decline that analysts had forecast.
Portugal, which is seen as having done more than Greece to improve economic performance, may have benefited from stronger exports. But Mr. Fois of Barclays said a recovery probably remains distant.
''Expecting sustained growth in the short term would be a bit optimistic,'' he said. ''You still have a lot of fiscal austerity to come through.''
Germany has benefited from the European Central Bank's low lending rate of 1 percent, a benchmark that is set with the euro zone as a whole in mind but is probably too low for German conditions.
While credit is tight in much of Europe, it is still available in Germany at inexpensive rates that have pushed up real estate prices in urban areas. German wages are also likely to rise as companies have trouble finding skilled workers, fueling inflation which is already above the official target of about 2 percent.
Higher wages and inflation in Germany are likely to trouble some policy makers and segments of the German public, but may be good news for other countries in Europe. They would have an easier time competing with Germany for investment, while higher wages might increase German demand for their products.
''Robust German demand is essential to help offset falling domestic activity in the peripheral countries,'' Ms. Diron said.
Germany depends on trade with other euro zone members, and in coming months there is a risk its economy may suffer from problems in countries like Italy and Spain.
''The highly competitive German economy has not entered a recession,'' Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. ''Still, it is unlikely to expand at the same pace in the next few months.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Maternal Deaths Plunged Over 2 Decades, to About 287,000 in 2010, U.N. Reports

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
The number of women dying from pregnancy and childbirth has dropped sharply in the last two decades, according to a report by a consortium of United Nations agencies set to be released on Wednesday. 
Maternal deaths fell to about 287,000 in 2010, the report said. The decline is attributable to increases in contraception and in antiretroviral drugs for mothers with AIDS, and to greater numbers of births attended by nurses, doctors or midwives with medical training.
The agencies said the deaths had fallen by 47 percent from the United Nations' 1990 estimate of 543,000, but the organization has been revising its historical estimates in response to skeptical research by a rival group of epidemiologists at the University of Washington.
Two years ago, that group, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as a sort of check on the World Health Organization, contradicted a long-held United Nations finding that maternal deaths had remained stubbornly above 500,000 a year.
In a widely publicized study in the journal The Lancet in April 2010, the institute estimated that 343,000 maternal deaths took place in 2008. It used three times as much data from census and death records, scientific studies and other sources as previous United Nations reports had.
In response, five months later, the United Nations said it had ''revised and improved'' its own statistics and concluded that there were 358,000 deaths in 2008.
''When they saw our results, they changed their strategy,'' said Dr. Rafael Lozano, an epidemiologist at the institute.
Last fall, the institute estimated that deaths would fall to 274,000 in 2011. The new United Nations estimate of 287,000 is within the same statistical boundaries, Dr. Lozano said.
The United Nations report also concludes that deaths are falling quickly in East Asia but slowly in Africa.
The Asian reduction is attributed largely to China, which has a one-child policy, a very high use of contraceptives and a health care system that is improving as the nation gets richer.
Southern African countries have seen the beginnings of a reversal, according to the United Nations report, which was compiled by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Population Division, the World Bank and a team from the University of California, Berkeley. A decade ago, maternal deaths in southern Africa were rising because of AIDS. As more women get drugs that restore their immune systems, deaths are dropping.
Just two countries, India and Nigeria, account for one-third of the world's maternal deaths. Others with very high numbers include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Sudan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
''There were rumors at a U.N. conference last fall that the new numbers would be in the 200,000s,'' said Christy Turlington Burns, a former fashion model who founded Every Mother Counts to fight global maternal mortality after she nearly died in childbirth.
''I'm delighted to see them come down,'' she added after speaking at a health conference in New York on Tuesday. ''It didn't do any good when different reports diverged by 100,000 -- or when the drop seemed so rapid. That sent a message that it's easier to save lives than it is.''

HEADLINE: Come the Revolution

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Palo Alto, Calif.
Andrew Ng is an associate professor of computer science at Stanford, and he has a rather charming way of explaining how the new interactive online education company that he cofounded, Coursera, hopes to revolutionize higher education by allowing students from all over the world to not only hear his lectures, but to do homework assignments, be graded, receive a certificate for completing the course and use that to get a better job or gain admission to a better school.
''I normally teach 400 students,'' Ng explained, but last semester he taught 100,000 in an online course on machine learning. ''To reach that many students before,'' he said, ''I would have had to teach my normal Stanford class for 250 years.'' 
Welcome to the college education revolution. Big breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary. The costs of getting a college degree have been rising faster than those of health care, so the need to provide low-cost, quality higher education is more acute than ever. At the same time, in a knowledge economy, getting a higher-education degree is more vital than ever. And thanks to the spread of high-speed wireless technology, high-speed Internet, smartphones, Facebook, the cloud and tablet computers, the world has gone from connected to hyperconnected in just seven years. Finally, a generation that has grown up on these technologies is increasingly comfortable learning and interacting with professors through online platforms.
The combination of all these factors gave birth to Coursera.org, which launched on April 18, with the backing of Silicon Valley venture funds, as my colleague John Markoff first reported.
Private companies, like Phoenix, have been offering online degrees for a fee for years. And schools like M.I.T. and Stanford have been offering lectures for free online. Coursera is the next step: building an interactive platform that will allow the best schools in the world to not only offer a wide range of free course lectures online, but also a system of testing, grading, student-to-student help and awarding certificates of completion of a course for under $100. (Sounds like a good deal. Tuition at the real-life Stanford is over $40,000 a year.) Coursera is starting with 40 courses online -- from computing to the humanities -- offered by professors from Stanford, Princeton, Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania.
''The universities produce and own the content, and we are the platform that hosts and streams it,'' explained Daphne Koller, a Stanford computer science professor who founded Coursera with Ng after seeing tens of thousands of students following their free Stanford lectures online. ''We will also be working with employers to connect students -- only with their consent -- with job opportunities that are appropriate to their newly acquired skills. So, for instance, a biomedical company looking for someone with programming and computational biology skills might ask us for students who did well in our courses on cloud computing and genomics. It is great for employers and employees -- and it enables someone with a less traditional education to get the credentials to open up these opportunities.''
M.I.T., Harvard and private companies, like Udacity, are creating similar platforms. In five years this will be a huge industry.
While the lectures are in English, students have been forming study groups in their own countries to help one another. The biggest enrollments are from the United States, Britain, Russia, India and Brazil. ''One Iranian student e-mailed to say he found a way to download the class videos and was burning them onto CDs and circulating them,'' Ng said last Thursday. ''We just broke a million enrollments.''
To make learning easier, Coursera chops up its lectures into short segments and offers online quizzes, which can be auto-graded, to cover each new idea. It operates on the honor system but is building tools to reduce cheating.
In each course, students post questions in an online forum for all to see and then vote questions and answers up and down. ''So the most helpful questions bubble to the top and the bad ones get voted down,'' Ng said. ''With 100,000 students, you can log every single question. It is a huge data mine.'' Also, if a student has a question about that day's lecture and it's morning in Cairo but 3 a.m. at Stanford, no problem. ''There is always someone up somewhere to answer your question'' after you post it, he said. The median response time is 22 minutes.
These top-quality learning platforms could enable budget-strained community colleges in America to ''flip'' their classrooms. That is, download the world's best lecturers on any subject and let their own professors concentrate on working face-to-face with students. Says Koller: ''It will allow people who lack access to world-class learning -- because of financial, geographic or time constraints -- to have an opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their families.''
When you consider how many problems around the world are attributable to the lack of education, that is very good news. Let the revolution begin.

HEADLINE: Needy States Use Housing Aid Cash To Plug Budgets

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Robbie Brown contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hundreds of millions of dollars meant to provide a little relief to the nation's struggling homeowners is being diverted to plug state budget gaps.
In a budget proposed this week, California joined more than a dozen states that want to help close gaping shortfalls using money paid by the nation's biggest banks and earmarked for foreclosure prevention, investigations of financial fraud and blunting the ill effects of the housing crisis. California was awarded more than $400 million from the banks, and Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed using the bulk of that sum to pay the state's debts.
The money was part of a national settlement valued at $25 billion and negotiated with five big banks over abuses in their mortgage and foreclosure processes.
The settlement, reached in February after a year of talks and intervention by the Obama administration, was the second-largest in history involving the states, trailing the tobacco industry settlement, and represented the first large-scale commitment by banks to provide direct aid to borrowers. 
As part of the settlement, the banks agreed to pay the states $2.5 billion, money intended to help homeowners and mitigate the effects of the foreclosure surge. But critics complained that this was the only cash the banks were required to pay -- the rest comes in the form of ''credits'' for reducing mortgage debt and other activities. Even that relatively small amount has proved too great a temptation for lawmakers.
Only 27 states have devoted all their funds from the banks to housing programs, according to a report by Enterprise Community Partners, a national affordable housing group. So far about 15 states have said they will use all or most of the money for other purposes.
In Texas, $125 million went straight to the general fund. Missouri will use its $40 million to soften cuts to higher education. Indiana is spending more than half its allotment to pay energy bills for low-income families, while Virginia will use most of its $67 million to help revenue-starved local governments.
Like California, some other states with outsize problems from the housing bust are spending the money for something other than homeowner relief. Georgia, where home prices are still falling, will use its $99 million to lure companies to the state.
''The governor has decided to use the discretionary money for economic development,'' said a spokesman for Nathan Deal, Georgia's governor, a Republican. ''He believes that the best way to prevent foreclosures amongst honest homeowners who have experienced hard times is to create jobs here in our state.''
Andy Schneggenburger, the executive director of the Atlanta Housing Association of Neighborhood-Based Developers, said the decision showed ''a real lack of comprehension of the depths of the foreclosure problem.''
The $2.5 billion was intended to be under the control of the state attorneys general, who negotiated the settlement with the five banks -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Ally. But there is enough wiggle room in the agreement, as well as in separate terms agreed to by each state, to give legislatures and governors wide latitude. The money can, for example, be counted as a ''civil penalty'' won by the state, and some leaders have argued that states are entitled to the money because the housing crash decimated tax collections.
Shaun Donovan, the federal housing secretary, has been privately urging state officials to spend the money as intended. ''Other uses fail to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the settlement to bring real, concerted relief to homeowners and the communities in which they live,'' he said Tuesday.
Some attorneys general have complied quietly with requests to repurpose the money, while others have protested. Lisa Madigan, the Democratic attorney general of Illinois, said she would oppose any effort to divert the funds. Tom Horne, the Republican attorney general of Arizona, said he disagreed with the state's move to take about half its $97 million, which officials initially said was needed for prisons.
But Mr. Horne said he would not oppose the shift because the governor and the Legislature had authority over budgetary matters. The Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest has said it will sue to stop Mr. Horne from transferring the money.
In California, Attorney General Kamala D. Harris had played hardball in the settlement negotiations, holding out until the very end for a deal guaranteeing that a large share of the benefits would go to California, and then trumpeting her success in a news conference and a flurry of interviews with national news outlets. So Mr. Brown's revised budget put her in an awkward position.
''While the state is undeniably facing a difficult budget gap,'' she said in a statement, ''these funds should be used to help Californians stay in their homes.'' Both officials are Democrats.
When asked if Mr. Brown could legally appropriate the money, which is supposed to be held in a special fund ''for the benefit of California homeowners affected by the mortgage/foreclosure crisis,'' a spokesman for Ms. Harris declined to comment.
Just last week, Ms. Harris announced plans to give about half the money to groups that provide housing counseling and legal assistance to homeowners -- groups whose budgets have shrunk while demand for their services grows. The other half would be used primarily for investigation of mortgage-related crime.
States using some or all of their money for housing have designated it for a wide variety of programs, like a small fund for low-interest loans to build housing in low-income neighborhoods, in Virginia, and Ohio's sweeping plan to demolish abandoned property.
In New York, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman stepped in with $15 million in settlement money for housing counseling and legal assistance when state support ran out last month, and plans to spend the bulk of its $130 million on similar programs. North Dakota will use its tiny allotment, $1.9 million, to provide housing to police officers and emergency responders in its booming oil-field counties, where shelter is scarce.
Using the money for other purposes is shortsighted, housing advocates warn. ''If you leave homeowners hanging out there to dry, then in the short term maybe you help to meet the budget gap this year,'' said Maeve Elise Brown, the executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, based in Oakland. ''But in the long term the more people we have going through foreclosure, the worse it's going to be for our economy as a whole.''
In some states, redirecting the money could have a racially discriminatory effect, said Alan Jenkins, the executive director of the Opportunity Agenda, which supports homeownership, because in some cities black homeowners disproportionately lost their homes, Mr. Jenkins said.
''If you dump all of these funds into the general coffers, the African-American homeowners are not going to benefit in any real way because they represent such a small percentage of the larger state,'' Mr. Jenkins said.

HEADLINE: Mall at an Ideal Crossroads Gets an Overdue Makeover

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
YONKERS -- There is perhaps no better location for a business than the intersection of the New York State Thruway and the Cross County Parkway in Westchester County, where nearly a quarter of a million cars pass through each day.
A bronze plaque on a large stone called the Trading Rock testifies to the spot's long commercial history. Even before western settlement, according to the plaque, members of the Algonquin nation gathered there, 12 miles north of Manhattan, to barter their wares. 
For the last 58 years, most of the trading on the site has been conducted at the Cross County Shopping Center, where a $250 million overhaul is close to completion. Cross County's 72-acre site is so ideally situated that, since opening with John Wanamaker's and Gimbels as anchors, the mall has survived as many others failed, especially through the recent economic doldrums, and even though little was done over the years in the way of modernization.
The topography of the mall's asphalt parking lot, built on a peat bog, came to resemble that of a golf course; sidewalks developed fissures; and many of storefronts increasingly were in need of a fresher, more modern look. Still the shoppers came, which is why Leonard Marx, the center's managing partner for 25 years until his death in April 2002 at the age of 97, saw no need to fix something that he believed still worked, said Alfred B. DelBello, a lawyer in White Plains who represents the mall's owners. Mr. Marx had expanded it in the late 1970s to more than 100 stores from 27, and it remained profitable, its wrinkles notwithstanding.
''Since the day it opened,'' Mr. DelBello said, ''It has always been successful.''
The Cross County mall has been owned since the mid-1970s by Brooks Shopping Centers, a conglomerate that includes Benenson Capital Partners and Merchants' National Properties of Manhattan. Brooks has financed the revamping by luring new retailers and restaurants, and encouraging old standbys like Macy's to undergo a face-lift and add an additional 75,000 square feet to its existing 325,000.
James E. Stifel, the chief investment officer for Benenson, a private family real estate investment and development company in Manhattan, would not give specifics on the financing, although he did describe the current commercial real estate scene as ''a difficult one for new construction.''
In 2006 Brooks commissioned Macerich, a real estate investment trust based in Santa Monica, Calif., to oversee the redevelopment of the mall, and manage and reposition it into what Mr. Stifel described as a contemporary ''family-friendly'' place with playgrounds for children, dancing bear statues as ''park pets'' and outdoor seating areas. The renovations, which began in 2007, were prompted in part to keep pace with efforts by Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest city, to economically reinvigorate itself, and by the Forest City Ratner Company's development of Ridge Hill, a 1.3 million-square-foot, $842 million open-air mall that opened earlier this year on 81 acres less than three miles north on the Thruway.
But while Macerich has put a shiny new face on the old mall, it has also hewed to the original intent of offering an array of value-oriented retailers like Sears and Macy's, the current anchors, to its mostly middle-income customers. Even the new Swarovski North America store at Cross County carries a relatively affordable line of crystal jewelry.
''We call it aspirational luxury,'' said Liz Pollack, a senior marketing manager for Macerich. Of the shopping center's 100 retailers, many like A/X Armani Exchange, Bebe, Guess, H&M and Forever 21 cater to ''fashion-forward, brand-conscious shoppers who want to buy something today and maybe only wear it only for one season until the new styles come in,'' Ms. Pollack said.
At the same time, she said, Cross County shoppers often buy at least one highly recognizable luxury item like a piece from Swarovski's line of jewelry, which many consumers associate with celebrities like Jennifer Lopez.
For the most part, the mall draws middle-income shoppers from the Bronx, Mount Vernon and Yonkers, Ms. Pollack said, noting that Westchester already had its share of upmarket retail, among them the Westchester, an enclosed shopping center with high-end merchandisers including Neiman Marcus and a free-standing Bloomingdales, both in White Plains. Even the new Ridge Hill, while offering a variety of price points, is decidedly more upscale, with a Lord & Taylor and a Whole Foods Market luring customers from Westchester's wealthier river towns, like Hastings-on-Hudson and Irvington, said Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner.
To effect the turnover of stores at Cross County -- many were small independently owned enterprises -- to make way for a new lineup, Macerich chose to renew leases only of shops that ''were still desired by our customers,'' Ms. Pollack said. ''Retailers come and go all the time. It's our goal to present the most up-to-date selection of retailers that meet the needs of the market.''
The shopping center's expansion created more than 1,000 construction jobs in 2009 and 2010, according to the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, which gave the owners tax breaks to help finance the renovation. A 14-year payment in lieu of taxes agreement stipulates that property tax payments, which began in 2009 at $3,300,000 a year will increase incrementally over the next 14 years, concluding in 2023 with a $6 million payment.
Bill Hesse, the president of Aries Deitch & Endelson, retail leasing brokers in Hartsdale, predicted that both Cross County and its new competitor, Ridge Hill, would thrive, because they were aiming at different retail categories, with Ridge Hill appealing to a wealthier customer base.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday in the Square Feet pages, about the renovation of the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, misstated the amount paid in lieu of property taxes by the shopping center in 2009, the first year of a 14-year agreement with the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency. It was $3.3 million, not $3,000. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated, in some editions, the cost of the renovation. It was $250 million, not $50 million. The error was repeated in a picture caption.

HEADLINE: A Narrower Lead, but Big Changes Probably Aren't the Cause

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
We are beginning to see more national surveys now, including this week's New York Times/CBS News poll, which show Mitt Romney with a slight lead over President Obama in the general election matchup. To be sure, there are also a number of polls that put Mr. Obama slightly ahead. But his lead does seem to have narrowed - from about three or four points in an average of national polls a month or two ago to more like a point or so in surveys today.
Has something fundamental changed in the race? 
Probably not. Instead, I suspect we are seeing some reversion to the mean. It could be that Mr. Obama's larger lead from before was somewhat ephemeral, although there are a couple of factors that may be working in Mr. Romney's favor at the margin.
Although we are getting to the point where these national polls are at least worth a passing glance, it is still also worth paying attention to Mr. Obama's approval rating. These have a history of predicting electoral outcomes at least as closely as head-to-head polls in the early stages of the race, especially for incumbent presidents.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings have not moved all that much. For the last month or two, they have been essentially even. Right now, in the RealClearPolitics average, 48.3 percent of Americans approve of the job that Mr. Obama is doing, and 48.6 percent disapprove.
A president can get re-elected with numbers like those. Obviously, he can also lose. But the fact that Mr. Obama's approval ratings are close to even means that it should not be surprising that the numbers in his matchup against Mr. Romney are getting closer to even, too.
I am not a purist who says that candidates and campaigns make no difference. That said, the most reliable benchmark in the past of when presidential results deviate from those predicted by approval ratings is when one of the candidates has a relatively ''extreme'' ideology, like Barry M. Goldwater or George S. McGovern. Mr. Romney does not qualify as an extremist by the various measures we can look at that attempt to quantify this objectively - neither does he qualify as a moderate. Instead, he is a ''generic Republican,'' who might run fairly close to the outcomes predicted by Mr. Obama's approval ratings.
Mr. Romney also went through a period where his favorability ratings were quite poor. However, they have since improved to about even, possibly because his job has been less complicated since the effective end of the Republican primary campaign. It is not uncommon for favorability ratings to shift over the course of a campaign, particularly once the primaries end.
I am working on our general election model, which can begin to look at some of this data in a more formal way. No model is perfect, but some things probably benefit from applying a more formal and rigorous structure. For instance, Mr. Obama's state-by-state polls look a pinch better on balance than his national numbers. It is hard to know if there is something real there; the timing of the polls and the relative ordering of the states in the Electoral College need to be carefully considered.
Likewise, most of the polls we are seeing now are of registered voters or adults rather than likely voters. That is something that needs to be accounted for. Usually a shift from registered voters to likely voters will improve the Republican candidate's standing by a couple of points because Republican voters are older, wealthier and more likely to turn out in the average election. On the other hand, I do not think it is a good strategy to look solely at likely voter polls while ignoring the others. Some survey firms that use likely voter models have a history of a partisan skew in their polls that has nothing to do with the likely voter model itself.
The last thing to remember is that when an election is quite close, it does not take very much to shift the race from one candidate being a 60/40 favorite to it being about even.
At the betting market Intrade, Mr. Obama's odds of re-election have consistently been around 60 percent. While, on the one hand, it is good not to overreact to new data at this early stage of the race, it is also worth remembering that even a one-point shift in a president's approval ratings, or a modest change in the economic forecasts, can move a president's re-election odds at the margin.
The marginal factors in the past four or six weeks have looked slightly better for Mr. Romney than Mr. Obama. The recuperation in Mr. Romney's favorability numbers, for instance - if it was somewhat to be expected - also reduces the risk that his personal qualities might cause him to lose an election that he otherwise would have won, as during another economic downturn.
Meanwhile, the tumultuous situation in Greece may increase the chance of an economic downside case for Mr. Obama. And data from the domestic economy has not been as strong lately. (Although it might also be mentioned that the situation in the Middle East is thought to be improving, and oil pries have receded somewhat.)
Put another way, if you are being very detail oriented, there is a case to be made that Mr. Romney's odds of being elected have improved somewhat over the past six weeks. I suppose we can be even more detail oriented once we get the general election model up and running. If you just want the 30,000-foot view ... well, it looks pretty close, as it did before.
What I am less convinced by is the idea that anything in the campaign - the day-to-day stories that the news media covers - has mattered very much so far. One of the reasons that campaign stories have been so trivial lately is because if one of the campaigns has an especially strong line of attack on their opponent, or a great piece of opposition research, it does not make a lot of sense to drop it now when most voters are not paying attention yet. It is still extremely early for a general election campaign. If the period after Labor Day qualifies as the pennant race, and the summer of the general election year the regular season, we are still playing preseason baseball now.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Iowa, Again, Serves as Proving Ground for Romney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Barbaro reported from Des Moines, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- As he campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, Mitt Romney used a ''prairie fire'' metaphor to describe the nation's debt and its impact on the sagging economic fortunes of many Americans.
But that fire burns less intensely across Iowa, a swing state with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. A booming farm economy has enriched many people in this largely agricultural state. And the housing crisis felt keenly elsewhere has largely passed it by. 
That makes Iowa -- an electoral prize coveted by both presidential campaigns this November -- an important laboratory for Mr. Romney's broad effort to lay the blame for the nation's continuing economic distress at President Obama's feet. Mr. Romney hopes to snag the state back for Republicans after Mr. Obama flipped it to the Democratic column in 2008.
Mr. Romney's top campaign advisers are betting that voters in Iowa -- and in other places where the economy is beginning to turn around -- will look beyond their state's 5.2 percent unemployment rate and focus instead on the jobs slump nationwide, where unemployment still hovers above 8 percent.
''Jobs and the economy still resonate with everybody, regardless of whether their own state is doing well,'' Rich Beeson, the political director for Mr. Romney, said in an interview. ''If it was something that President Obama was doing, it would be working all over the country.''
But as Mr. Romney presses hard to win the state's six electoral votes, he faces other challenges as well: a disciplined and longstanding Obama campaign operation, an evangelical community that continues to view Mr. Romney warily, and a state party that has recently been taken over by supporters of Ron Paul.
In the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Romney finished second to Rick Santorum, and won just 14 percent of the vote among those who said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. These voters demonstrated a nervousness about Mr. Romney during the Republican primaries, repeatedly voting for his rivals in state after state. Mr. Romney's advisers believe those divisions will fade in the general election. If so, Iowa could be one place where it happens.
But the reconciliation will take time and effort, according to Steve Scheffler, the president of the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition. Mr. Scheffler said Mr. Romney's campaign had recently reached out to him, but needs to do more, quickly, like hiring campaign workers to attract voters who care about abortion, traditional marriage and gun rights.
''They are just now beginning to get their game together,'' Mr. Scheffler said. ''Hopefully, they are going to make an outreach to conservative Christians. Hopefully, they are beginning to realize they need to involve all parts of the Republican Party.''
In the meantime, Mr. Romney faces an unexpected political annoyance. A backer of Mr. Paul is now the state party chairman. And supporters of Mr. Paul and his libertarian movement now make up nearly half of the state's 18-member central committee, having ousted some of the state's establishment Republicans who had backed Mr. Romney.
''It has to be of considerable concern,'' said Steve Roberts, a longtime Iowa Republican who served as one of the state's national committeemen for a decade. ''You need everybody to work together and be unified and turn out the vote and get every last vote for Romney if he's going to win.''
Aides to Mr. Romney dismiss the political coup, saying that they are confident the party will be united behind the Republican in the fall. But Mr. Paul's chief strategist, Jesse Benton, made clear in an e-mail to supporters on Tuesday that Mr. Paul intends to keep fighting for his beliefs.
''By sending a large, respectful, and professional delegation to Tampa, we will show the party and the country that not only is our movement growing and here to stay, but that the future belongs to us,'' Mr. Benton wrote.
Republicans say they are optimistic about Mr. Romney's chances in Iowa. Unlike Senator John McCain of Arizona, who did not campaign hard in the state, campaign aides say Mr. Romney will fight hard for votes here. On Tuesday, his campaign released a Web video intended to highlight the stories of unemployed Iowans.
''I've been looking for a job for two years,'' Deborah Ragland of Webster City, Iowa, says in the video. ''Haven't found any. My unemployment benefits did run out, and we're just trying to get by.''
And voters who listened to Mr. Romney speak on Tuesday said his emphasis on the federal debt accumulated under Mr. Obama resonated with them. Several pointed to the federal bailout of big banks, which had begun under President George W. Bush, and the stimulus package, carried out under Mr. Obama, as examples of what they said was excessive government spending.
Paul Zietlow, an insurance agent, said he feared that the United States ''is going to be like European countries if we don't get our spending under control.''
The president, he said, ''believes you can continue to fund every program,'' whereas Mr. Romney is the cold-eyed, number-crunching businessman, who knows when to salvage something or let it die. ''You need to know the difference,'' Mr. Zietlow said.
Ed Urbanek, 63, a commercial real estate broker, said the thought that his two grandchildren would be left with the federal debt weighed heavily on him.
The president ''has not demonstrated any ability to reduce the deficit. He only knows how to grow it,'' Mr. Urbanek said. ''He's never had a real job. It's play money to him.''

HEADLINE: Bush Dips a Toe Back Into Washington

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the three years since he left office, former President George W. Bush has largely stayed out of the political arena. He has spent his time mapping out his library, making speeches, hosting injured veterans for Texas bicycle rides and making clear how glad he is to be out of the nation's capital.
But gingerly, the 43rd president is beginning to add his voice back into the national dialogue. A month ago, he spoke publicly in favor of one of his defining domestic legacies, the tax cuts that still divide the country. Two months from now, he plans to publish a book outlining strategies for economic growth. And on Tuesday, he made a rare return to Washington to promote freedom overseas. 
At an event less than two blocks from the White House, Mr. Bush gathered former aides and human rights leaders to unveil the ''Freedom Collection'' sponsored by his public policy institute, an assemblage of interviews with dissidents who took on autocratic regimes. Along the way, Mr. Bush used the occasion to endorse Mitt Romney for president and to nudge both political parties to do more to support revolutionaries and build democratic institutions around the world.
''America does not get to choose if a freedom revolution should begin or end in the Middle East or elsewhere,'' Mr. Bush said in his speech. ''It only gets to choose what side it is on. The tactics of promoting freedom will vary, case by case. But America's message should ring clear and strong: We stand for freedom and for the institutions and habits that make freedom work for everyone.''
He singled out Syria, where the government of President Bashar al-Assad has killed thousands to squelch opposition. ''All of us here today join you in hoping and praying for the end of violence and the advance of freedom in Syria,'' Mr. Bush told Ammar Abdulhamid, a prominent Syrian opposition figure invited to speak at the event.
Mr. Bush did not mention President Obama or Mr. Romney in his speech, but former aides said it was clear that his words were meant to urge both to pay more attention to an issue he considered a hallmark of his tenure.
''He is very concerned about what he likes to call isolationism,'' said a former Bush administration official, who asked not to be identified presuming to speak for Mr. Bush. ''If there is a nudge involved, it is completely bipartisan. Hardly anyone is doing enough to support dissidents and freedom advocates these days.''
The ''freedom agenda'' Mr. Bush advocated during his presidency proved more controversial than its stated goals. Because it became associated with the Iraq war, many critics saw it as a way of spreading an American-style system at gunpoint, something Mr. Bush always denied. Moreover, the demands of geopolitics often made its application seem inconsistent; the Bush administration applied relentless pressure on countries like Syria, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and Belarus, but approached more cautiously with nations it needed, like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.
Now, out of office, Mr. Bush has more latitude to speak on the issue, and advisers said he hoped to make it central to his life's work. He wants to make the George W. Bush Institute, which along with his future library is at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, a haven for dissidents to share stories, history, tactics and inspiration. Dozens of interviews are already featured on a Web site, www.freedomcollection.org.
Among those he brought together on Tuesday were Bob Fu, a Chinese-born pastor; Normando Hernandez, a former political prisoner in Cuba; and Viktor A. Yushchenko, who helped lead the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who after decades of house arrest and struggles was just elected to the Parliament in Myanmar, spoke via Skype.
While Mr. Bush was focused on politics overseas, he finally put his toe into politics at home. As he was leaving the event, a reporter asked him about the presidential race. ''I'm for Mitt Romney,'' he said before ducking away. Mr. Bush had declined to endorse until now.
Later in the day, Mr. Bush joined former President Bill Clinton for a fund-raiser at the Newseum to bring in money for a $76 million memorial to the heroes and victims of United Flight 93, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001, after passengers confronted hijackers.
But Mr. Bush did not plan to linger in the capital. As he spoke about his Freedom Collection, he said, ''I actually found my freedom by leaving Washington.''

HEADLINE: Dancing With Derivatives

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Jamie Dimon calls it ''a doozy.''
And it was. A $2 billion credit derivatives trading bungle that could mushroom to a $4 billion loss.
The shining industry agitator against some of the tougher regulations on banks has suddenly become the shining example of why still tougher regulations may be needed.
After the economy nearly atomized in a cloud of cupidity, Dimon became known as America's least-hated banker. But now the blunt 56-year-old Queens native who snowed Democrats in Washington with all his talk about not lumping in ''good banks'' with ''bad banks'' has fallen off his pedestal. 
If Jamie the Great and his ''good bank'' can make such a gigantic blunder, sending deja vu shivers down America's back, what hope is there for lesser bankers?
As Noam Scheiber writes in The New Republic, ''we now have ironclad proof -- as if we really needed it -- that everyone is capable of disastrous stupidity.''
Dimon doesn't buy the argument that bosses of big, complex companies can never make mistakes. A smart quarterback still needs great defensive ends, as he puts it, or the guy who runs McDonald's can't ensure all the meat is fresh.
Britain has been rocked by a ''shareholder spring,'' a revolution of ordinarily placid investors vetoing bloated executive pay deals and bonuses. Three top executives of British firms were sacked in revolts of shareholders, who also rose up against giving new executives millions in ''golden hellos.''
As a pay advisory body crisply put it, ''It is unclear how a golden hello benefits shareholders.''
It is redolent of the classic movie ''The Solid Gold Cadillac,'' with Judy Holliday as a scrappy small stockholder, challenging the board of directors about fat salaries and dubious policies.
With C.E.O. pay going stratospheric as workers' pay grew stagnant, anger was bound to erupt.
Yet there wasn't much ire at the JPMorgan Chase annual shareholders meeting in Tampa on Tuesday. It was over quickly and painlessly, despite -- or maybe because of -- Dimon's admission on ''Meet the Press'' that his team was ''sloppy'' and ''stupid'' and used ''bad judgment'' in incurring the loss, which has led to the rolling of three heads at the bank, an F.B.I. investigation, and a Congressional ramp-up for more chiding hearings.
Talking even faster than usual, the tarnished silver-haired banker told shareholders that he couldn't justify the ''self-inflicted'' debacle. While the trade was ''poorly vetted and poorly executed,'' he said it wouldn't make a dent in the ''fortress balance sheet.''
A few shareholders asked pointed but polite questions, but most supported Dimon. ''We think you are doing a fabulous job,'' one Tampa shareholder told the C.E.O. Outside, a paltry 20 protesters gathered.
The Rev. Seamus Finn, representing shareholders from the Catholic organization Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, did gently press the boss: ''We're wondering, Mr. Dimon, given what we've learned, do you still believe a company can self-regulate when trading on their own accounts?'' He added: ''Furthermore, should our company really be spending shareholder funds on, some $7 million last year alone, on lobbying efforts to thwart the Dodd-Frank legislation and the work of regulators to write the rules stemming from that legislation?''
The priest concluded that the shareholders, ''weary of mistakes'' and pledges to reform, wonder if Dimon is listening.
But the group endorsed Dimon's pay package of $23 million and let him keep his dual titles of chairman and C.E.O.
Dimon says he's a ''barely Democrat,'' but he's known as the favorite banker of the president, who called Dimon ''one of the smartest bankers we got'' on ''The View'' on Tuesday. President Obama's financial disclosure report released on Tuesday showed a checking account at JPMorgan worth $500,000 to $1 million, and in 2010 the president defended Dimon's $17 million bonus, on top of compensation in 2010 and 2011 of $23 million.
New York City's chief audit officer is urging Dimon to ''claw back'' salary and bonuses paid to the top executives who dragged the bank into the excessive risk. That would be a first for Wall Street. Dimon says he is ''likely'' to do it, but is loath to ''act like a judge and jury'' with Ina Drew, the head of the investment office who resigned on Monday, given that she lost $2 billion on that deal while she was making $9 billion on others.
He knows he has to claw his way back to high regard.
''I never put myself on a pedestal,'' he said. ''You lose credibility, you have to earn it back. You have to earn respect every day. It's never how great we are. It's always the good, the bad and the ugly.''

HEADLINE: Dire Predictions About Climate Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Game Over for the Climate'' (Op-Ed, May 10), James Hansen repeats his urgent warnings that burning Canada's tar sands oil would cause irreversible climate catastrophe. When he says of the risks we face, ''if this sounds apocalyptic, it is,'' he underscores the challenge of awakening those who don't comprehend the sheer magnitude of what is at stake.
The sky may not literally be falling, but unless we find the will to stop extracting oil from dirty tar sands and shift to a clean energy economy instead, the atmosphere will keep changing in ways that will radically disrupt life on this planet. 
Dr. Hansen did not mention Mitt Romney, who should muster the courage to reverse his primary-season flip-flop about science that is simply no longer subject to debate by informed people. Given the risks that Dr. Hansen details, candidates who still question the science itself have forfeited any right to lead.
DAVID A. SCOTT Vice President, Board of Directors Sierra Club Columbus, Ohio, May 10, 2012
To the Editor:
James Hansen is at it again, flogging the dead horse of man-made climate change as a reason to keep Canada's tar sands petroleum locked up forever. For the past 30 years, Dr. Hansen has issued ever more dire predictions of catastrophic climate change, while actual conditions have not borne out his doomsday forecasts. If anything, as the climate stubbornly fails to conform to Dr. Hansen's predictions, he becomes even more extreme in his outlook.
Dr. Hansen made a name for himself in the 1980s by warning that computer models predicted that increasing carbon dioxide levels would result in major global warming. In fact, since 1998, after a decade of temperature rise, average global temperatures have been stable or actually declined, according to several analyses. This unpredicted trend underscores the shortcomings of computer models.
Scientists with political agendas like Dr. Hansen use apocalyptic predictions to justify increased government regulation, higher taxes and redistribution of wealth. His latest polemic is no different and would result in major economic impacts on Canadian and American citizens, more government bureaucrats to restrict and regulate fossil fuel production, and reduced living standards.
ERIK AXELSON Bellingham, Wash., May 10, 2012
To the Editor:
Here's hoping that James Hansen's impassioned and well-informed plea to turn back from our destructive use of fossil fuels will not continue to fall on deaf ears in Washington. Skeptics might call him an alarmist, but if anyone is in a position to know the severity of the climate crisis, it is Dr. Hansen. All of his findings and predictions, dating to the early 1980s, have turned out to be disturbingly accurate.
Dr. Hansen's proposed solution -- a rising fee on carbon, with revenue returned to the public -- is one that Republicans ought to find embraceable. But coal and oil interests have helped finance the activities of climate change denialists, making it difficult for politicians to support solutions without risking ouster from office. Talk to Senator Richard G. Lugar on that point.
It is up to us as citizens to create a more hospitable climate for our public officials to take action, or else our children will be left with a climate that is inhospitable.
MARK REYNOLDS Executive Director Citizens Climate Lobby Coronado, Calif., May 10, 2012
To the Editor:
I have no idea whether humans are contributing substantially to global warming, and I agree with those who say we should plan ''as if'' because not to take steps could be catastrophic if writers like James Hansen prove to be correct. But consider one of his claims: ''Every major national science academy in the world has reported that global warming is real.''
Here's a news flash: European scientists in the 15th century agreed that the earth was the center of the universe. That didn't make it true.

HEADLINE: Mr. Boehner and the Debt

 BODY:
It clearly does not bother Speaker John Boehner that he pushed the United States to the brink of default last year. It does not matter that the deep spending cuts in the resolution he demanded to end that crisis will hurt economic growth. It does not even matter that the House he leads is determined now to break that agreement with even deeper cuts in vital programs.
No, Mr. Boehner wants to do it all over again: he announced on Tuesday that the House will not agree to raise the debt ceiling when it is reached later this year or early next, unless the increase is matched by equal spending cuts. ''We shouldn't dread the debt limit,'' he said, instantly forcing the country to do just that. ''As a matter of fact, I think we should welcome it. It's an action-forcing event in a town that has become infamous for inaction.'' 
An official who actually wanted to help the country rather than appeasing the Tea Party might have remembered what happened a year ago, after Mr. Boehner first made that extortionate demand. The bond rating agencies said the country's credit and reputation had been seriously damaged, and the government lost its AAA credit rating. (Mr. Boehner shamelessly blamed Mr. Obama for that on Tuesday.) The Federal Reserve warned of ''catastrophic'' and ''calamitous'' effects if Republicans carried through on their threat to default. The stock market sank, and Congress's approval rating has never recovered.
But all Mr. Boehner seems to remember is that he ''won,'' at least by his crass scoring system. Because the House threat was so serious -- and because so many Republicans seemed irresponsible enough to actually carry it out -- President Obama and the Democrats were forced to agree to cut $2 trillion from the budget over a decade, a huge Tea Party victory. The White House reduced the damage by sparing some safety-net programs and making sure the military budget bore a fair share of the impact. But the House voted last week to undo even that agreement and make all the cuts from domestic programs, particularly those for the poor and the struggling.
Washington's need to deal with the long-term deficit can be met only with a combination of new revenues and rational cuts, not extortion. The overly deep cuts in last year's deal were necessary only because Republicans refused to end tax cuts for the rich.
Mr. Boehner said on Tuesday that his party would again refuse to raise any taxes, relying on spending cuts to offset the debt increase. He also announced that the House would vote before the November election to continue all the Bush tax cuts, set to expire on Jan. 1, depriving the Treasury over a decade of more than $3.5 trillion that could be used for deficit reduction.
This time, at least, Democrats have more leverage than they did last year. The House cannot prevent those tax cuts from expiring by itself, nor can it stop the big military cuts that also begin on Jan. 1.
Some members might be willing to reach a deal, but Mr. Boehner's decision to again threaten a default shows that he is an unreliable budget negotiator. President Obama failed to recognize that last time, and Congressional Democrats gave in too easily. We hope both are hearing the message this time around.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Pledges New Standoff On Debt Limit

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner on Tuesday set the stage for a bruising election-year showdown on fiscal policy, vowing to hold up another increase in the federal debt ceiling unless it was offset by larger spending cuts.
His combative comments came on the same day the Republicans' presumptive nominee, Mitt Romney, hit President Obama hard on his fiscal stewardship in a speech in Des Moines, suggesting that Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans see an opening to attack the president on the mounting federal debt and the size of the government. 
Mr. Boehner's stance threatened to throw Congress back into the debt-limit stalemate that consumed Washington in 2011, but this time at the height of a campaign that Republicans are trying to make a referendum on Mr. Obama's handling of the economy.
''A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation,'' Mr. Romney said, ''and every day we fail to act we feed that fire with our own lack of resolve.''
The Boehner comments, made at a fiscal summit meeting in Washington, were the first public shot in what promises to be the most consequential budget fight in a generation. On Jan. 1, nearly $8 trillion in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to take effect.
Mr. Boehner said he would not allow Congress to duck tough decisions with another round of short-term measures. He also said the House would pass an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts before the November elections, and he urged lawmakers in both parties to reach a long-term deal on spending and tax changes -- but no additional taxes -- to head off a fiscal calamity.
''To get on the path to prosperity, we have to avoid the fiscal cliff, but we need to start today,'' he said.
Democrats immediately accused Mr. Boehner of once again holding the nation's full faith and credit hostage to his conservative political agenda, even as Republicans cut corners on the deal struck last summer to end the last debt-ceiling crisis.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, speaking at the same meeting sponsored by the financier Peter G. Peterson, said the government could bump into its borrowing limit before the end of the year, but, he said, the Treasury has enough ''tools'' to keep the government afloat into early next year. That should push a debt-ceiling showdown well past the November election.
Mr. Geithner appealed to lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling ''this time without the drama and the pain and damage that it caused the country last July.'' And he said an orderly solution could be reached.
''Our objective should be to replace that very large set of expiring tax provisions and broad-based, automatic, pretty crude spending cuts with a more responsible, balanced glide path to fiscal sustainability,'' he said.
Next year's fiscal crisis has been brewing since early last decade, when successive Republican Congresses used budget rules to pass large but temporary tax cuts that could not be filibustered. The tax cuts expire en masse at the end of this year after Mr. Obama and Republican leaders agreed on a two-year extension. But the president has vowed not to extend the tax cuts for upper-income families again. Regardless of the election results, he will still be in the White House on Jan. 1.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: ''The American people are tired of kicking things down the road. We've got to get this done and done the right way.''
Top aides to Mr. Romney declined to say whether the campaign planned his speech to coincide with Mr. Boehner's. But as Mr. Romney's presidential campaign merges its operations more fully with the Republican establishment in Washington, the messages are becoming more similar. Republicans also have indicated they were eager to shift the discussion from social topics like same-sex marriage back to economic issues, which they believe play more to their advantage.
''The Obama campaign wants everybody to be distracted by shiny objects,'' said Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director. ''He promised he would cut the debt, and he has not done that.''
The exchange on fiscal policy came on the eve of a Senate budget showdown engineered by Republicans using an obscure procedural provision that says any senator can bring forward a budget if the Budget Committee fails to produce one by April 1.
The main objective of the Republicans is to embarrass the president by forcing the Senate to vote on his budget, which may not get a single vote. That is not because no one supports his plan, but because a presidential budget -- which finances the government line by line, agency by agency -- is much more detailed than a Congressional budget, which creates a broad outline for spending and taxes to be filled in later by the committees of jurisdiction. Accepting a presidential budget in its totality would be tantamount to ceding Congress's constitutional power of the purse.
But Republicans have not been able to unify around an alternative. Instead, they will bring forward four different budgets for the 2013 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 -- with a budget passed by House Republicans viewed as the most liberal of the lot. One by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky would eliminate the Departments of Education, Commerce and Energy; cut the National Park Service by 30 percent and NASA by a quarter; and end Medicare in 2014. Senator Mike Lee of Utah proposes a budget that would raise the retirement age to 68, cut the size of government in half over 25 years, and end the payroll tax as well as all taxes on savings and investment and replace them with a 25 percent flat tax.
''These are not serious in nature,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. ''These are all just for show.'' Senate Democrats have not moved forward on a budget in large part because Democratic leaders did not want to highlight internal divisions over spending and taxes or subject senators facing tough re-elections to the difficult votes Republicans would force on a budget.

HEADLINE: European Leaders Back Stricter Rules for Banks

BYLINE: By PAUL GEITNER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- With a $2 billion loss by JPMorgan Chase in London serving as a reminder that risky trading has not gone away, European Union finance ministers broke an impasse Tuesday and agreed on a plan to force banks to hold more capital as a buffer against the unexpected.
The unanimous move came after a compromise that allowed Britain -- which held up passage of the package last week during a 16-hour marathon meeting -- to impose tougher standards than the international minimum. 
The British government, which was forced to partially nationalize the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group during the financial crisis, called the deal ''an important step towards a safer and stronger banking system in Europe, and one that will help protect the taxpayer from picking up the bill when things go wrong in the way they have had to do over the past few years.''
The agreement was required for Europe to implement new global rules on banking standards known as Basel III, which were endorsed by the Group of 20 largest economies in 2010 and are meant to force banks to sock away more cash for bad times.
The draft approved by ministers means negotiations can begin on a final text with the European Parliament, where a committee passed its own version late Monday. The Parliament's version includes an additional measure that would forbid banks from awarding bonuses that are higher than an employee's annual base salary -- a response to continued public anger over outsized pay in the financial sector.
The Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, suggested Tuesday that governments may have to accept tougher bonus rules in the final agreement, Bloomberg News reported.
But his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble, said he did not think the issue would hold up implementation of the Basel III rules.
Mr. Schauble warned, however, that ''throughout human history'' people have found ways around rules ''to make more money, faster.'' He pointed to the $2 billion loss revealed last week by the biggest American bank, JPMorgan, in its London trading office -- a disclosure that came as policy makers in Washington were putting the finishing touches on new industry regulations there.
''As you've just seen, even with the top market experts in the United States, that it could happen again,'' Mr. Schauble said at a news conference, shaking his head. ''In English or German it's a lot of money.''
Britain, home to one of the world's biggest financial centers, the City of London, wanted to avoid being prevented from applying tougher rules as it saw fit, because its taxpayers would be stuck with the bill should another British bank need rescuing. At the same time, there has been a growing recognition that stronger, Europewide institutions are needed to help build confidence in banks that have been weakened by the fallout from the financial and sovereign debt crises.
Some E.U. countries, including France and Austria, had opposed letting countries set higher capital requirements, fearing it would make their banks look less safe by comparison, and could also crimp growth by forcing banks to curtail lending.
As part of the compromise, member states can impose stricter requirements on domestic banks for up to two years at a time. E.U. regulators would not be able to overrule a nation's decision to take such a step unless they were backed by a vote of the finance ministers as well.
''The compromise strikes a balance between the need for common rules to safeguard the internal market, while allowing member states to have sufficient flexibility to apply stricter rules to safeguard national stability,'' said the Danish economy minister, Margrethe Vestager, chairwoman of the meeting on Tuesday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, a New Stadium Will Rise

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: From the rubble, literally, of the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010 plans to build the first professional soccer stadium in that country are taking shape. 

 BODY:
From the rubble, literally, of the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010, plans to build the first professional soccer stadium in the country are taking shape. The appropriately named Phoenix Stadium is set to rise in Cité Soleil, an area designated by the United Nations as a red zone -- an impoverished town in desperate need of economic development.
The entire project, which has an estimated cost of $5 million, will have the majority of its financing provided by Delos LLC as part of the Clinton Global Initiative. Additional financing will be secured from corporations and individual donors. The stadium is only the first component of a project that will result in the construction of a youth soccer academy, an elementary and middle school, and infrastructure projects that will include agriculture, composting and water treatment.
Part of the impetus for the project came from the long-term efforts of Boby Duval, the founder ofL'Athletique D'Haiti, a nonprofit youth development program that has been providing children with education through sports.
"This is like a dream come true," Duval said in a telephone interview from Haiti. "This project will change people's lives. I started this 18 years ago when I came back to Haiti from college in the States."
He added: "I know this is working. We have more than 2,000 kids we're serving here. They've gone to Brazil, the U.S., the women's team were champions of the Homeless World Cup. Sports is the universal language. The kids may be poor and barefoot, but when they walk on the field I guarantee you, you don't know who's rich. For an hour on the field, they are people who make a difference. This is not rocket science."
Since Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, sports has organically taken a back seat to the struggles to simply put food on the table, for many people. On the global soccer stage, Haiti has had meager success: the country has no national stadium (playing inStade Sylvio Cator in Port-au-Prince), it has played in only one World Cup (1974 in West Germany) and its ability to field a credible national team has been hampered by little, if any, infrastructure on the youth level.
"They do have a national stadium, but it was built 60 years ago and it costs too much to see a game there," said Morad Fareed, a New York-based businessman and former national team player for Palestine (making three appearances during qualifying for the 2006 World Cup). Fareed cofounded Delos, which bills itself as a builder of Wellness Real Estate. "This stadium is not for the national team," he said. "It is intended for a new 10-team league run by Boby Duval.
"I have seen how transformative sports can be in the most desperate places in the world. My company looks for high-impact, philanthropic projects, and this one is just bold enough. It has an exciting potential to have an impact on many people. Besides the essential infrastructure, we are trying to focus on simply enabling children to grow and develop character."
The stadium (capacity 12,000, expandable to more than 20,000) will be part of the first phase of the development that builders hope will spread over more than 15 acres. The plan, put forward by the well-known architect Carlos Zapata -- whose projects include the renovation of Soldier Field in Chicago and the design of the Bitexco Financial Tower in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam -- will use rubble from the 2010 earthquake in the construction process.
"It's a very unlikely project, if you think about it," Zapata said. "Some people would say a soccer stadium in Haiti is something they don't need. I've really been moved by this project. What they don't need is another government building. We're all in support of Boby, who is trying to give the kids a chance."
In Zapata's conception, the project will incorporate labor and materials from Haiti while also creating at least 500 jobs at the start, instead of "importing steel from Miami and a crew from Miami, to put it together and leave." He said it is about using the current landscape, "the geometry of the land," to mold the space and create hills for people to see the field.
"Architecture is poetry," he said. "It goes beyond the basics of building. I believe it can be a beautiful place that doesn't need to be compromised. It's a new opportunity to build something that is an inspiration for everyone, not just Haiti. We aspire to do great things."
When it came to redeveloping Soldier Field in Chicago, Zapata said it took some innovative thinking and planning.
"We did about six iterations in six different locations," he said. "Some were done in an asymmetrical way because we needed to control costs. We started thinking a long time ago about contracting the footprint, doing it in pieces of a ring. That's what were going to use in Haiti, first one stand, then lockers, all support the game, then the hills.
"Before Soldier Field, there was always a desire to take the N.F.L. module and just plop it on top, the footprint was way to wide. Some people proposed cutting the colonnade in half, or taking the whole thing down. It didn't fly. The Bears at the time had to cut costs, as we do in Haiti. So you try and cut redundancies, and discover that the ring is unnecessary."
Can a dose of world-class architecture give Haiti a crop of world-class players? The people, and the children of Haiti, are waiting for a beautiful surprise.
An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that there weren't any public schools in Haiti.

I learn from Ezra Klein's interview with Tom Coburn that Sweden, of all places, has become the new right-wing icon. I thought Europe's woes were all about collapsing welfare states? But anyway, the story now is that Sweden has slashed spending and cut taxes, and is doing great; supply-side economics vindicated!
Ezra points out, rightly, that Sweden has actually benefited a lot from very aggressive monetary policy -- one of the original Princeton zero-lower-bound Group of Four, Lars Svensson, is now deputy governor of the Riksbank. (The others were Mike Woodford, yours truly, and a fellow by the name of Ben Bernanke).
But Ezra didn't challenge Coburn on the claim about spending cuts; why don't we look at what Sweden has actually done, as opposed to the official right-wing line? Look, in particular, at actual government consumption -- purchases of stuff. Here's Sweden versus the United States, from Eurostat:
Somebody has been practicing harsh spending-side austerity -- and it's not Sweden.

HEADLINE: The Power of Nursing

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The work of the Nurse-Family Partnership and other groups like it bring long-term benefits to mother, child and society. 

 BODY:
In 2010, 5.9 million children were reported as abused or neglected in the United States. If you were a policy maker and you knew of a program that could cut this figure in half, what would you do? What if you could reduce the number of babies or toddlers hospitalized for accidents or poisonings by more than half? Or provide a 5 to 7 point I.Q. boost to children born to the most vulnerable mothers?
Well, there is a way. These and other striking results have been documented in studies of a program called the Nurse-Family Partnership, or NFP, which arranges for registered nurses to make regular home visits to first-time low-income or vulnerable mothers, starting early in their pregnancies and continuing until their child is 2.
We tend to think of social change as more of an art than a science. "What's unique about Nurse-Family Partnership is that the program was studied in what's considered the strongest study design, and it showed sizable, sustained effects on important life outcomes which were replicated across different populations," explained Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, a nonpartisan group. "This is very unusual. There are probably only about ten programs across all areas of social policy that currently meet that standard."

What that means, notes Baron, is that if policy makers replicate the program faithfully they can be confident that it will change people's lives in meaningful ways - improving child and maternal health, promoting positive parenting, children's school readiness and families' economic self-sufficiency, and reducing juvenile delinquency and crime.
NFP is not a new idea - it's almost 40 years old - but after decades of study the program, which has assisted 151,000 families, has the potential for broader impact, thanks to the Affordable Care Act's Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which provides $1.5 billion for states to expand such programs.
Done well, it could be among the best money the government spends. Investments in early childhood development produce big payoffs for society. (A 2005 RAND study estimated that NFP provided $5.70 in benefits to society for every dollar spent.) But there's an important concern: home visiting programs are not all effective. When carefully studied, only a few have been shown to reduce the physical abuse and neglect of children. Among the programs that meet the government's standard for funding, there are large variations in evidence of impact (pdf). Policy makers and proponents of home visiting would do well to pay attention to the specific elements in the Nurse-Family Partnership's model that account for its success.
NFP was founded by David Olds, who directs the Prevention Research Center for Family and Child Health at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Early in his career, Olds worked in a day care center in Baltimore because he believed that quality preschool attention would help disadvantaged children succeed in life. What he began to see was that, for some kids, it was already too late to make big gains. If children had been abused or neglected or exposed to domestic violence, or if their mothers had abused drugs, alcohol or tobacco while pregnant, their brains could have been damaged in ways that limited the children's abilities to control impulses, sustain attention or develop language.
Olds developed NFP in the early 1970s. He conducted his first large study in 1977, in Elmira, N.Y., a semi-rural, mostly white, community with one of the highest poverty rates in the state. The program produced strong results. Follow-up studies would reveal that, by age 19, the youths whose mothers received visits from nurses two decades earlier, were 58 percent less likely to have been convicted of a crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, Olds spread the work to Memphis and Denver and subjected the program to more randomized study with populations of urban blacks and Hispanics. The results continued to be impressive. In 1996, NFP began wider replication; the model is now being implemented by health and social service providers in 40 states.
As Olds published his results, the idea gained momentum, but the imitations did not remain faithful to NFP's approach. "People adopted all kinds of home visiting models and used our evidence to make claims," he recalled. In the early 1990s, for example, the federal government, inspired in part by NFP, began a $240 million program to train paraprofessionals, rather than nurses, to make home visits to low-income families with young children. NFP also experimented in Denver, using paraprofessionals (trained from the communities they served) in place of nurses for a subset of families.
In both cases, paraprofessionals didn't get the same results. When it came to improving children's health and development, maternal health, and mothers' life success, the nurses were far more effective. In the federal program, paraprofessionals produced no effects on children's health or development or their parents' economic self-sufficiency.
What's special about nurses? For one thing, . In public opinion polls, nurses are consistently rated as the most honest and ethical professionals by a large margin. But there were other reasons nurses were effective. Pregnant women are concerned about their bodies and their babies. Is the baby developing well? What can I do for my back pain? What should I be eating? What birthing options are available? Those are questions mothers wanted to ask nurses, which was why they were motivated to keep up the visits, especially mothers who were pregnant for the first time.
Nurses had more influence encouraging mothers to delay subsequent pregnancies, Olds explained. They could identify emerging complications more promptly, and they were more successful at getting mothers to stop or reduce smoking, drug or alcohol use. This is vital. Prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants is associated with intellectual and emotional deficits. It can also make babies more irritable, which increases risks of abuse. (A mother who was abused herself is more likely to misinterpret an inconsolable baby's crying as "bad behavior.")
"A lot of the young mothers have had some pretty terrible early life experiences," says Olds. "It's not uncommon for them to have been abused by partners or never have had support and care from a mother. Their lives haven't been filled with much success and hope. If you ask them what they want for themselves, it's not uncommon for them to say, 'What do you mean?'"
A big part of NFP's work is helping them answer this question.
Consider the relationship between Rita Erickson and Valerie Carberry. Rita had had a methadone addiction for 12 years and was living from place to place in Lakewood, Colo. She found out she was pregnant; a parole officer told her about NFP. "I'd burned bridges with my family," Rita told me. "I was running around with the wrong people. I didn't have anyone I could ask about being pregnant." In the early months, Valerie had to chase her around town, Rita recalled. "I was worried she might say, 'This is too much hassle. Come back when you have your act together.' But she stuck with me."
Over the next two years, they embarked on a journey together. "I had a zillion questions," Rita recalled. "I was really nervous at first. I had lived most of my adult life as a drug addict. I didn't know how to take care of myself." On visits, they discussed everything: prenatal care, nutrition, exercise, delivery options. After Rita's daughter, Danika, was born, they focused on things like how to recognize feeding and disengagement cues, remembering to sleep when the baby sleeps, how to manage child care so Rita could go back to school. For Rita, what made the biggest impression was hearing about how a baby's brain develops - how vital it was to talk and read a lot to Danika, and to use "love and logic" so she develops empathy. Once Valerie explained that when babies are touching their hands, they're discovering that they have two. "To me that was really amazing," Rita said.
This month, Rita is graduating from Red Rocks Community College with an associate degree in business administration. She's going to transfer to Regis University to do a bachelors degree. Her faculty selected her as outstanding graduate based on leadership and academic achievement - and she was asked to lead the graduation procession and give one of the commencement speeches. Danika is thriving, Rita said. Recently, she came home from preschool and announced: "Mommy, I didn't have a good day at school today because I made some bad decisions and you wouldn't be proud of me." (She had pushed another child on the playground.) As for the NFP, Rita says that it helped her recover from her own bad decisions. When Valerie came along, she needed help badly. "I didn't care about my life. I didn't care about anything. I never ever thought I would have ended up where I am today."
"When a woman becomes pregnant whether she's 14 or 40, there's this window of opportunity," explained Valerie, who has been a nurse for 28 years and hasworked with more than 150 mothers in NFP over the past seven. "They want to do what's right. They want to change bad behaviors, tobacco, alcohol, using a seat belt, anything. As nurses, we're able to come in and become part of their lives at that point in time. It's a golden moment. But you have to be persistent. And you have to be open and nonjudgmental."
Beyond the match between nurses and first-time moms, there are multiple factors that make NFP work. (NFP has identified 18 key elements for faithful replication.) The dosage has to be right: Nurses may make 50 or 60 visits over two and a half years. The culture is vital: It must be non-judgmental and respectful, focusing on helping mothers define their own goals and take steps towards them. The curriculum should be rigorous, covering dozens of topics - from prenatal care to home safety to emotional preparation to parenting to the mother's continuing education. Nurses need good training, close supervision and support, and opportunities to reflect with others about difficult cases. And, above all, data tracking makes it possible to understand on a timely basis when things are working and when they are not.
With the government making such a large investment in home visiting, it's crucial for programs to get the details right. Otherwise, society will end up with a mixed bag of results, and advocates will have a hard time making the case for continued support. That would be a terrible loss. "When a baby realizes that its needs will be responded to and it can positively influence its own world," says Olds, "that creates on the baby's part a sense of efficacy - a sense that I matter." It's hard to imagine higher stakes.
