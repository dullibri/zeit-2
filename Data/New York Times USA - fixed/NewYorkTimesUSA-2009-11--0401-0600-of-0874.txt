HEADLINE: How the U.S. Rates

BYLINE: By MICHELLE ANDREWS

 BODY:
Which should we trust to rein in health care costs: the federal government or the private sector?
 A brief analysis by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee's ranking Republican, Senator Sam Brownback, above, of Kansas, compared the rates of health care spending growth from 1997 to 2006 in the United States and in the 29 other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 The 5.9 percent rate of spending growth in the United States is below the O.E.C.D. average of 6.6 percent, the analysis showed. Its conclusion: giving government more control over health care here would be a big mistake.
 The notion that government cannot control costs may have wide appeal, but experts say these data, at least, do not support it. 
 Many of the nations with higher spending growth rates, like Greece and Turkey, are poorer countries that until recently spent little on health care, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University. Those countries are spending more to make up for their lack of investment.
 Health care spending in countries similar to the United States, with higher incomes and higher costs but more government involvement -- France, Germany, Japan and Switzerland, among others -- actually grew more slowly than in the United States.
 Experts also noted that because baseline spending is so much higher in the United States, 16 percent of G.D.P. in 2007, even moderate growth here translates into enormous outlays.

HEADLINE: Geithner Says U.S. Is Committed to a Strong Dollar

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner offered fresh reassurances to Asian nations on Thursday that the Obama administration was committed to a strong dollar and to actions aimed at bolstering its value. 
 ''It's very important to the United States that we have a strong dollar,'' he said at a news conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, in Singapore. As growth recovers, he said, the administration plans to move its ''fiscal position back into balance.''
 Soaring budget deficits, which hit a record $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009 and will most likely be near that in 2010, have weakened the dollar because of huge borrowing by the United States to meet the government's day-to-day spending needs.
 As he did throughout the past week, at meetings of the Group of 20 in Scotland last weekend and in Tokyo earlier this week, Mr. Geithner acknowledged that the United States carried a special burden for protecting the currency's value because it was the global reserve currency.
 The dollar has declined 16 percent against a basket of six major currencies from the highs set in March and is down more than 37 percent from a peak in 2001.
 Mr. Geithner dismissed a suggestion that pouring hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide into spurring economic activity might lay the groundwork for an inflationary surge and said finance ministers must stay focused on getting growth on more solid footing.
 ''Inflation is low and still moderating across most of the major economies,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''The most important thing we need to be doing is try to make sure we are reinforcing this early recovery.''
 The Treasury chief said there were promising signs of growth returning to the global economy and credited Asia with leading the recovery but stressed it would have to find future growth in sources other than hard-pressed American consumers.
 Mr. Geithner did not say whether he thought China was signaling a willingness to let its currency, the renminbi, rise in value more rapidly. A recent Chinese central bank monetary policy report said Beijing should consider major currencies in guiding the renminbi.

HEADLINE: Reid Mulls Medicare Tax Increase for High Earners

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is considering a proposal to increase the Medicare payroll tax on high-income workers to help offset the costs of providing health insurance to millions of Americans, Senate aides said Thursday.
 The proposal is part of a legislative package that Mr. Reid has put together in secrecy and submitted to the Congressional Budget Office for analysis. 
 Mr. Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has said the Senate could begin debate on the legislation as soon as next week, although members of his own party do not yet know details of the bill he has assembled from pieces approved by two Senate committees. 
 The Medicare payroll tax is the primary source of financing for Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, which pays hospital bills for beneficiaries, who are 65 and older or disabled.
 Employers and employees each pay a tax equal to 1.45 percent of wages. Unlike the payroll tax for Social Security, which applies to earnings up to an annual ceiling ($106,800 in 2009), the Medicare tax is levied on all of a worker's earnings without limit.
 Mr. Reid is apparently considering an increase in the Medicare payroll tax rate for workers with incomes of more than $250,000 a year, Senate aides said. One idea is to increase the tax rate by one-half of 1 percentage point, to 1.95 percent for high-income people, with an expectation that the government could raise $40 billion to $50 billion over 10 years.
 As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama repeatedly said that under his administration, people making less than $250,000 a year would not see any of their taxes increased. Mr. Reid has several reasons for considering an increase in the payroll tax, a development first reported by The Associated Press on Wednesday night. He is seeking money to provide more extensive subsidies to help low- and moderate-income people buy insurance. A bill passed Saturday by the House would provide $602 billion in subsidies over 10 years, while a measure approved last month by the Senate Finance Committee would provide $461 billion.
 The biggest source of new revenue proposed by the Finance Committee is a tax on high-premium group health insurance provided by employers to their employees. Mr. Reid is looking for an alternative to that tax, or a way to reduce it, because it is anathema to many labor unions, a major constituency of the Democratic Party. Labor leaders say the proposed tax on ''Cadillac health plans'' would hit many middle-income workers whose unions have sacrificed wage increases to secure or retain health benefits.
 Steven M. Kreisberg, director of collective bargaining and health care policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said an increase in the payroll tax on high-income people was ''far preferable'' to the excise tax on high-cost insurance plans.
 ''At a time of rising inequality in income and wealth,'' Mr. Kreisberg said, ''it is appropriate to ask those who make more to bear a greater burden.''
 Democrats said an increase in the payroll tax had an additional advantage: some of the money could shore up the Medicare trust fund, which is expected to run out of money in 2017.
 James P. Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said the majority leader had not decided whether to include the payroll tax increase in the bill he takes to the Senate floor.
 Several Democratic senators have urged Mr. Reid to propose extending the Medicare payroll tax to income other than wages, like capital gains, dividends and rental income. Such a change could generate substantial revenue from higher-income households, who tend to derive a greater share of their income from sources other than wages.
 The House also wants more money from affluent people. The House-passed bill would raise $460 billion over the next decade from a new income surtax. The surtax would equal 5.4 percent of adjusted gross income exceeding $1 million for couples and $500,000 for individuals.
 Mr. Reid is not proposing to increase the payroll tax used to finance Social Security. 
 Economists and politicians pointed out several possible objections to Mr. Reid's proposal. It does nothing to slow the growth of health spending, as the tax on high-cost insurance would. And, as the Congressional Budget Office pointed out recently, ''higher tax rates on earnings reduce people's incentive to work.''
 Moreover, the higher payroll tax would not be sufficient in the long run. Payroll tax revenues generally grow with payroll, which is expected to increase more slowly than health costs under even the most optimistic projections.
 The Business Roundtable, which represents large companies, said Thursday that more aggressive changes in the health care system could save employers as much as $3,000 per employee in 2019.

HEADLINE: Meet John Thune

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Some days the Republican Party seems to be going crazy. Its public image is often shaped by people who appear to have gone into government because they saw it as a steppingstone to talk radio.
 But deep in the bowels of the G.O.P., there are serious people having quiet conversations. The people holding these conversations created and admired Bob McDonnell's perfectly executed Virginia gubernatorial campaign. And now as they look to the future of their party, and who might lead it in 2012, the name John Thune keeps popping up.
 As you may or may not know, Thune is the junior senator from South Dakota, the man who beat Tom Daschle in an epic campaign five years ago. The first thing everybody knows about him is that he is tall (6 feet 4 inches), tanned (in a prairie, sun-chapped sort of way) and handsome (John McCain jokes that if he had Thune's face he'd be president right now). If you wanted a Republican with the same general body type and athletic grace as Barack Obama, you'd pick Thune. 
 The second thing people say about him is that he is unfailingly genial, modest and nice. He grew up in Murdo, S.D., population 612. His father was a Naval aviator in World War II and a genuine war hero. He was called back home after the war to work in the family hardware store and went on to become an educator, as did his wife.
 John was a high school basketball star and possesses idyllic small-town manners, like the perfect boy in a Thornton Wilder play. He appears to be untouched by cynicism. In speeches and interviews, he is straightforward, intelligent and earnest. He sometimes seems to have emerged straight into the 21st century from a more wholesome time.
 After high school, he attended Biola University, a small Christian college outside of Los Angeles. He then got an M.B.A. from the University of South Dakota and has spent his adult life ascending -- as a Congressional staffer, South Dakota Republican Party chairman, the state railroad director, a member of the U.S. House, and now the Senate.
 His positions on the issues are unremarkable. He is down-the-line conservative on social, economic and foreign policy matters. What's notable is the way he talks about the issues and jumps off from them.
 He is a gracious and ecumenical legislator, not a combative one. When you ask him to mention authors he likes, he mentions C.S. Lewis and Jeff Shaara, not political polemicists. The first person who told me I had to write a column about Thune was a liberal Democratic senator who really likes the guy.
 Thune also possesses the favored Republican profile du jour: conservative at the roots but pragmatic at the surface. Like McDonnell, nobody can question Thune's conservative bona fides. As a result, he doesn't have to talk about them. Instead, he prefers to talk about what he calls the ''economic cluster'' of issues: job creation, balanced budgets and small-business-led growth.
 He doesn't have radical plans to cut the federal leviathan. He just wants to restrain the growth of government to bring deficits down. He doesn't have ambitions to restructure the tax code. He just wants to lift burdens on small business.
 He says his prairie background has given him a preference for small companies and local government. When he criticizes the Democrats, it is for mixing big government with big business: the bailouts of Wall Street, the subsidies to the big auto and energy corporations. His populism is not angry. He doesn't rail against the malefactors of wealth. But it's there, a celebration of the small and local over the big and urban.
 Republican pros are attracted to Thune because he could rally the hard-core conservatives without scaring away the suburbanites. His weakness is that he's never really worked outside of government, and he's almost never shown a maverick side.
 At the moment, Republicans are riding an emotional wave. Karl Rove had a piece in Thursday's Wall Street Journal that captures the mood: Obama is being defined as a liberal. Independents are fleeing. The political tide is shifting.
 That overstates things. Obama remains the most talented political figure of the age. After health care passes, he will pivot and pick some fights with his own party over spending. He'll solidify his standing with independents, and if the economy recovers, he could go into his re-election with as much momentum as Ronald Reagan enjoyed in 1984.
 Republicans are still going to have to do root-and-branch renovation if they hope to provide compelling answers to issues like middle-class economic anxiety. But in the meantime, people like Thune offer Republicans a way to connect fiscal discipline with traditional small-town values, a way to tap into rising populism in a manner that is optimistic, uplifting and nice.

HEADLINE: Free To Lose

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Consider, for a moment, a tale of two countries. Both have suffered a severe recession and lost jobs as a result -- but not on the same scale. In Country A, employment has fallen more than 5 percent, and the unemployment rate has more than doubled. In Country B, employment has fallen only half a percent, and unemployment is only slightly higher than it was before the crisis. 
 Don't you think Country A might have something to learn from Country B? 
 This story isn't hypothetical. Country A is the United States, where stocks are up, G.D.P. is rising, but the terrible employment situation just keeps getting worse. Country B is Germany, which took a hit to its G.D.P. when world trade collapsed, but has been remarkably successful at avoiding mass job losses. Germany's jobs miracle hasn't received much attention in this country -- but it's real, it's striking, and it raises serious questions about whether the U.S. government is doing the right things to fight unemployment.
 Here in America, the philosophy behind jobs policy can be summarized as ''if you grow it, they will come.'' That is, we don't really have a jobs policy: we have a G.D.P. policy. The theory is that by stimulating overall spending we can make G.D.P. grow faster, and this will induce companies to stop firing and resume hiring.
 The alternative would be policies that address the job issue more directly. We could, for example, have New-Deal-style employment programs. Perhaps such a thing is politically impossible now -- Glenn Beck would describe anything like the Works Progress Administration as a plan to recruit pro-Obama brownshirts -- but we should note, for the record, that at their peak, the W.P.A. and the Civilian Conservation Corps employed millions of Americans, at relatively low cost to the budget.
 Alternatively, or in addition, we could have policies that support private-sector employment. Such policies could range from labor rules that discourage firing to financial incentives for companies that either add workers or reduce hours to avoid layoffs. 
 And that's what the Germans have done. Germany came into the Great Recession with strong employment protection legislation. This has been supplemented with a ''short-time work scheme,'' which provides subsidies to employers who reduce workers' hours rather than laying them off. These measures didn't prevent a nasty recession, but Germany got through the recession with remarkably few job losses.
 Should America be trying anything along these lines? In a recent interview, Lawrence Summers, the Obama administration's highest-ranking economist, was dismissive: ''It may be desirable to have a given amount of work shared among more people. But that's not as desirable as expanding the total amount of work.'' True. But we are not, in fact, expanding the total amount of work -- and Congress doesn't seem willing to spend enough on stimulus to change that unfortunate fact. So shouldn't we be considering other measures, if only as a stopgap?
 Now, the usual objection to European-style employment policies is that they're bad for long-run growth -- that protecting jobs and encouraging work-sharing makes companies in expanding sectors less likely to hire and reduces the incentives for workers to move to more productive occupations. And in normal times there's something to be said for American-style ''free to lose'' labor markets, in which employers can fire workers at will but also face few barriers to new hiring.
 But these aren't normal times. Right now, workers who lose their jobs aren't moving to the jobs of the future; they're entering the ranks of the unemployed and staying there. Long-term unemployment is already at its highest levels since the 1930s, and it's still on the rise.
 And long-term unemployment inflicts long-term damage. Workers who have been out of a job for too long often find it hard to get back into the labor market even when conditions improve. And there are hidden costs, too -- not least for children, who suffer physically and emotionally when their parents spend months or years unemployed. 
 So it's time to try something different.
 Just to be clear, I believe that a large enough conventional stimulus would do the trick. But since that doesn't seem to be in the cards, we need to talk about cheaper alternatives that address the job problem directly. Should we introduce an employment tax credit, like the one proposed by the Economic Policy Institute? Should we introduce the German-style job-sharing subsidy proposed by the Center for Economic Policy Research? Both are worthy of consideration.
 The point is that we need to start doing something more than, and different from, what we're already doing. And the experience of other countries suggests that it's time for a policy that explicitly and directly targets job creation.

HEADLINE: Iraq, Rebuilding Its Economy, Shuns U.S. Firms

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Mohammed Hussein and Sa'ad al-Izzi contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Iraq's Baghdad Trade Fair ended Tuesday, six years and a trillion dollars after the American invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and one country was conspicuously absent.
 That would be the country that spent a trillion dollars -- on the invasion and occupation, but also on training and equipping Iraqi security forces, and on ambitious reconstruction projects in every province aimed at rebuilding the country and restarting the economy.
 Yet when the post-Saddam Iraqi government swept out its old commercial fairgrounds and invited companies from around the world, the United States was not much in evidence among the 32 nations represented. Of the 396 companies that exhibited their wares, ''there are two or three American participants, but I can't remember their names,'' said Hashem Mohammed Haten, director general of Iraq's state fair company. A pair of missiles atop a ceremonial gateway to the fairgrounds recalled an era when Saddam Hussein had pretensions, if not weapons, of mass destruction.
 The trade fair is a telling indication of an uncomfortable truth: America's war in Iraq has been good for business in Iraq -- but not necessarily for American business. 
 American companies are not seeing much lasting benefit from their country's investment in Iraq. Some American businesses have calculated that the high security costs and fear of violence make Iraq a business no-go area. Even those who are interested and want to come are hampered by American companies' reputation here for overcharging and shoddy workmanship, an outgrowth of the first years of the occupation, and a lasting and widespread anti-Americanism.
 While Iraq's imports nearly doubled in 2008, to $43.5 billion from $25.67 billion in 2007, imports from American companies stayed flat at $2 billion over that period. Among investors, the United Arab Emirates leads the field, with $31 billion invested in Iraq, most of that in 2008, compared to only about $400 million from American companies when United States government reconstruction spending is excluded, according to Dunia Frontier Consultants, a emerging-market analyst. ''Following this initial U.S.-dominated reconstruction phase, U.S. private investors have become negligible players in Iraq,'' Dunia said in a report.
 Indeed, even those companies that prospered during the war and occupation, including many of the big military contractors, will simply leave with the United States military as it completes its pullout over the next two years. 
 KBR was among the earliest contractors in Iraq and has $33 billion in contracts to support American bases. Yet it has not had any contracts with the Iraqi government to support those facilities when they're handed over -- or for that matter, to build anything else in the country. 
 ''KBR is currently assessing the business environment in Iraq in order to make an informed decision regarding potential government contract opportunities there,'' said a spokesperson, Heather Browne. 
 A few big American multinationals, like Bechtel, will still be in the midst of long-term projects like power plants and waterworks -- but those were five- and 10-year undertakings kick-started with American reconstruction aid. 
 Now, Iraq is doling out its own oil-financed funds for capital projects, and American companies have so far received surprisingly little of it. Sports City, a billion-dollar complex of stadiums and housing in Basra planned for the Gulf Games in 2013, was awarded to an Iraqi general contractor, Al Jiburi Construction, over 60 other bidders, many of them American. 
 ''We have a couple American companies as our subcontractors,'' said Adai al-Sultani, an assistant to the firm's owner, with evident pride. When the transportation ministry put up more than $30 billion in railroad expansion contracts recently, they went to Czech, British and Italian companies.
 Those nations had been members of the coalition led by the United States, although all pulled outlong before the United States. But one of the biggest beneficiaries of Iraqi contract money is Turkey, which wouldn't allow American warplanes to use its airbases during the invasion of Iraq, followed closely by Iran. 
 Turkey has gone from almost no legal trade with Iraq before the war to $10 billion in exports last year, five times as much as the United States. Turkey's trade minister, Kursad Tuzmen, predicted that number would triple in the next couple years. 
 Both Turkey and Iran had huge pavilions at the trade fair, crowded with businessmen discussing deals. So did France and Brazil, also not coalition countries.
 Last month, FedEx, which had been flying packages in and out of Iraq since 2004, announced it was suspending its operations. The reason is that Iraqi officials gave RusAir, a Russian airline, exclusive rights to cargo flights. 
 FedEx was one of the very few American businesses that braved the risks of working not only on American bases but also in the Red Zone, back when it was particularly dangerous to do so. Now that the danger is much less, its business is being thwarted by an upstart Russian come-lately. 
 ''FedEx Express has had no choice but to use Rus and, as a result, the reliability of our service to Iraq has been substantially degraded,'' the company said in a statement about the suspension. 
 It is almost an article of faith among many Iraqis, judging from opinion polls, that the United States invaded Iraq not to topple Saddam Hussein, but to get their country's oil.
 If true, then the war failed in even more ways than some critics charge.
 It wasn't until last week that the first major oil field exploitation contract was signed with a foreign company -- BP, in a joint deal with China's state-run China National Petroleum Corporation.
 Exxon Mobil, an American company, has an oil field deal awaiting final approval from Iraq's oil ministry. The Italian oil giant Eni, whose junior partner is the American-owned Occidental Petroleum, is expected to sign a similar deal. These, however, are service contracts, so the foreign oil companies don't actually own rights to any new oil they may find.
 The newest edition of the Iraqi Yellow Pages, a business-to-business directory, doesn't have a single ad from an American company.
 American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the record, disputed that United States companies were having a difficult time in the Iraqi free market. ''I wouldn't read too much into American presence or lack of it at the trade fair as a bellwether,'' one official said. ''I would say the future is very positive.''
 Another official pointed out that a recent Iraqi-American investment conference held in Washington stirred up enormous interest among American companies. ''We had to turn away several hundred companies that wanted to come,'' he said, adding that the embassy in Baghdad has had many subsequent inquiries from firms. That interest has not translated into action yet.
 ''After the conference in Washington, I'm surprised you can get on a flight here considering all the opportunities,'' said Mike Pullen, a lawyer at the British-American firm DLA Piper, who works in Iraq. 
 ''It's a pity we can't get more people to come,'' he said. ''They're losing out to Turkish companies, Russian companies.''
 ''Turkish companies are acceptable to all different Iraqi ethnic groups, because they are not an occupier, and they can implement big reconstruction projects at a lower cost,'' said an executive of a leading Iraqi construction firm that often works with the Turks. He did not wish to be identified for fear of offending American clients.
 Even Iraqi Kurds, many of whom are politically at odds with Turkey, seem to get along with the Turks when it comes to business. 
 ''Turkish companies are not afraid to do business in Iraq,'' said Eren Balamir, who was in charge of Turkey's pavilion at the fair.
 The high cost of security -- a cost that most regional businesses don't have -- has dissuaded many American businesses from coming; some contracts spent as much as 25 percent of their budgets on security.
 Security isn't the only impediment. Being seen as the occupier is just not good for business. Although the United States, legally speaking, has not been an occupying power since June 2004, when the Security Council formally ended occupation, many see it that way. Even Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has described Americans as occupiers to curry electoral support. 
 One European ambassador, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his government's policy, said his own country's trade opportunities greatly increased in Iraq after it withdrew the last of its troops more than a year ago. ''Being considered an occupier handicapped us extremely,'' he said. ''The farther we are away from that the more our companies can be accepted on their own merits.''
 ''As a U.S. company, you already have a few strikes against you before you even step foot in Baghdad airport,'' said Marc Zeepvat of the Trans National Research Corporation in New Jersey, who specializes in studying the Iraqi market for institutional investors. ''The U.S. government and U.S. companies have to wake up and realize they're not in a privileged position any more.''
 ''The State Department's travel advisory doesn't help either,'' Mr. Zeepvat said. It tells people, in effect, ''don't come.''

HEADLINE: Where Credit Isn't Due

BYLINE: By JOHN CARNEY. 
John Carney is a managing editor at BusinessInsider.com.

 BODY:
SENATOR CHRISTOPHER DODD of Connecticut is trying to help consumers. Unfortunately, his plan is likely to backfire. 
 Despite the recent promising signs on economic growth, unemployment is rising and consumer spending is contracting. The slight rise in home prices we saw over the summer is already sputtering. Credit card rates have been shooting up -- even though the Federal Reserve has extended generous interest rates to banks.
 Mr. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has proposed legislation that would immediately freeze credit card rates. ''At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, jacked-up rates can quickly create crushing debt,'' he said in a statement. He also wants to extend and expand the tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was due to expire on Dec. 1. 
 At first glance, both proposals look like pragmatic attempts to relieve the tough economic problems faced by ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of the proposals may wind up creating even worse problems.
 Let's start with the credit card rate freeze. The rising rates charged by issuing banks that inspired Mr. Dodd's legislation are themselves the unintended consequence of an earlier attempt to assist the consumer. Back in May, Congress passed a law requiring banks to give customers a 45-day notification before raising rates. To give banks time to adjust to the new rules, Congress decided not to put that provision into effect until February. 
 So what happened next? Banks rushed to raise rates before the law takes effect. Many customers who may not have had their rates raised until 2010 -- or perhaps not at all, if the economy continues to improve -- found themselves paying higher rates even though they had not missed any payments. How could Mr. Dodd and his fellow lawmakers not realize that banks would pre-emptively raise rates?
 Mr. Dodd's new proposal may also wind up dealing a serious blow to consumers -- and the economy. If banks find themselves unable to raise rates, many will limit their risk by severely restricting consumer credit. Many people will find their credit cards canceled, and new customers will be turned away. This will come on top of an already tight consumer credit market: banks sent out 2.1 billion direct-mail credit card solicitations in the third quarter of 2006, according to the research firm Mintel; this year in the same quarter, they sent out 391 million. A further contraction in consumer credit could devastate our nascent recovery.
 The tax credit for new home buyers, now worth up to $8,000 per sale, can be credited with giving a boost to the housing market. Investment in housing rose almost 24 percent last quarter. Mr. Dodd would extend the program into next year, perhaps raising the $8,000 cap or allowing it to apply to those not purchasing homes for the first time. 
 But this program, too, has had an unintended consequence: large-scale fraud. According to the Treasury's inspector general for tax administration, at least 19,000 people who claimed the credit didn't actually purchase a home. Here's how: because the credit is ''fully refundable,'' it is available to even those who don't pay any taxes or have any income at all. Thus people are buying homes under the names of their children -- including at least one 4-year-old -- to qualify as first-time homebuyers. 
 The tax credit is also interacting with other government programs to enable some of the worst mortgage practices of the recent past, including the notorious ''no money down'' mortgage. The Federal Housing Administration requires a down payment of at least 3.5 percent on mortgages it guarantees. But because homebuyers can recoup up to $8,000 from the tax credit and apply it to the down payment, they can buy a home worth up to $228,000 without spending a dime. 
 We don't know for certain how many such buyers will default on their loans. But borrowers who invest very little in their homes default at much higher rates than other homeowners. And because these loans are backed by the Federal Housing Administration, taxpayers pay the cost of those defaults. This sequence of events is eerily familiar from the subprime era.
 Mr. Dodd's new proposals are guided by good intentions. But he and other lawmakers need to look to the future and see where that particular road may lead. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 16, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on Friday, about the credit-card law passed in May, misstated the date a provision of it became effective. While the full law will not take effect until February, its requirement that banks alert customers to rate increases 45 days in advance has been in force since August.

HEADLINE: Oil Slides, and Wall Street Pulls Back

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday as investors reacted with caution to a drop in the price of oil. An announcement by President Obama of a job creation initiative failed to motivate investors.
 They dumped shares of oil stocks after the Energy Information Administration said that large amounts of petroleum were going unused as businesses and consumers reduced their use of oil. The report said refineries had eased production to the lowest levels since September 2008. As a result, oil fell to $76.64 a barrel, down from $79.28 on Wednesday. 
 President Obama, speaking at the White House before departing for a weeklong tour of Asia, announced that he would convene a summit meeting in December to examine the state of unemployment. Mr. Obama said he was open to any ''demonstrably good idea'' that would spur job growth. 
 ''We have an obligation to consider every additional responsible step we can to encourage and accelerate job creation in this country,'' he said.
 In response, shares on Wall Street made modest gains early but spent most of the day in retreat. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 93.79 points, or 0.91 percent, at 10,197.47. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 11.27 points, or 1.03 percent, at 1,087.24 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 17.88 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,149.02.
 ''There isn't enough conviction there to slough off a bad economic number,'' said Uri D. Landesman, head of global growth at ING Investment Management. ''There really is significant debate and disagreement over what the rate of improvement of the economy is going to be.''
 The day began when the Labor Department announced that new filings for unemployment insurance dropped last week to a seasonally adjusted 502,000, from an upwardly revised 514,000 the previous week. 
 While the broader economy has shown signs of health since the near collapse of the financial system last year, the United States has continued to grapple with high levels of unemployment. Last month, the unemployment rate reached 10.2 percent, a 26-year high. 
 Shares of Advanced Micro Devices shares surged after Intel said it would pay A.M.D. $1.25 billion to settle antitrust and patent disputes. A.M.D.'s stock climbed 21.8 percent to $6.48, while Intel shares fell by 0.8 percent.
 Other technology stocks also rose. Hewlett-Packard's announcement on Wednesday that it would acquire3Com, a provider of computer network equipment, for $2.7 billion sent 3Com's stock up 31.1 percent, though H.P. declined 0.6 percent. 
 The dollar, which had dropped to a 15-month low on Wednesday, showed signs of strengthening. At the market's close, it was trading at slightly more than $1.48 against the euro, which could explain some of the drops in stock prices as investors redirected their funds to currency markets in hopes of strong returns.
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported on Thursday that its third-quarter profit had risen 3.2 percent from the previous year, though sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.4 percent. Its stock rose modestly on Wednesday, but analysts said its report still raised questions about how much consumers would spend this holiday season. 
 Quincy Krosby, a markets strategist at Prudential Financial, said that the market was still hesitant and that investors expected a significant upturn when the S.& P. 500 reached the 1,100-point threshold. That level is significant, she said, because it would be a return to the days before the financial crisis and could motivate skeptical traders on the sidelines to enter the market.
 ''This is more of a struggle in the market, an inflection point, as to whether or not investors see the push toward the end of the year having any ammunition,'' she said. ''It's psychological. Investors will go in regardless of whether they believe the fundamentals of the economy are strong.''
 European stocks were mixed, with the DAX in Germany down 0.1 percent, the CAC in France down 0.2 percent, and the FTSE in Britain up 0.2 percent.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 99 13/32. The yield fell to 3.44 percent, from 3.47 percent late Tuesday.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Faces New Suit In Alabama County's Woes

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Kyle Whitmire contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even after a $700 million settlement with the federal government, JPMorgan Chase still faces troubles in Alabama. 
 On Friday, Jefferson County sued the bank, seeking additional relief on $3.2 billion in county sewer bonds the bank helped underwrite. Under the previous settlement, the county will receive $50 million and will not have to pay the bank $650 million in fees. But the county says it needs more help to get out from under the huge debt that remains. 
 The county, which includes Birmingham, accused JPMorgan of fraud and conspiracy in selling it several packages of debt and derivatives known as interest rate swaps that ''provided no value to the county or its citizens, and created an inherently flawed financial structure that imploded within just a few years.'' 
 The bank issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying: ''We believe the claims are meritless and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. Meanwhile, we continue to work to achieve a responsible restructuring of Jefferson County's financial affairs.''
 Under the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced earlier this month, the bank did not admit any wrongdoing. 
 In its new lawsuit -- against JPMorgan Chase, its securities division and others -- the county cited many of the same details in the S.E.C. complaint, but asked the court to order JPMorgan and others to produce the supporting documents. The commission has extensively investigated Jefferson County's financial debacle but has not shared its evidence, as a matter of policy. 
 The county's new lawsuit gave a sense of the heated competition for its business and how it could be manipulated, describing efforts by JPMorgan to fend off two other firms, Goldman Sachs and the Rice Financial Products Company. The complaint said two employees of the bank's securities division, Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin, worked out a deal to pay rivals ''to stay out of the deal.'' 
 JPMorgan wired $1.4 million to Rice Financial, according to the complaint, and transferred $3 million to Goldman Sachs through a separate derivatives contract created just to make the payment. The president of the county commission at the time, Larry P. Langford, then awarded most of the county's business to JPMorgan. 
 Afterward, Goldman Sachs wrote to Mr. Langford and recommended that the payments be properly reported in the county's bond documents, but Mr. Langford did not do so. 
 Mr. Langford, was convicted in October of accepting luxury gifts and cash totaling $235,000 in connection with the scheme. 
 Lawyers for Mr. LeCroy and Mr. MacFaddin have said the two men did nothing wrong and expect to be vindicated. 
 As the dealing continued, Jefferson County ended up with a ''radically different'' risk profile, according to the complaint. The county said in its complaint that it could not pay down the debt, and that rating agencies had downgraded its overall creditworthiness, so that it now had to pay more to finance its schools and other services. It hopes to press JPMorgan to reduce the interest rate and the principal. 
 ''This whole process has been tainted,'' a county commissioner, Bobby Humphryes, said after a heated meeting this week. ''It has been corrupt. People made money off of it that didn't do a bit of work, and I don't think there is any reason we should even think about making these people whole.''

HEADLINE: Love for a Dog That's No Bark and All Yodel

BYLINE: By N. C. MAISAK

 BODY:
Donut the French bulldog was sitting outside Starbucks. Romeo was perusing the produce at the Korean market down the street, and Jack was going to see Oskar for a play date. Oh yes, Oskar was in his usual spot, sunning himself on his little red bed in the window of the Jumping Bulldog, the chic dog and cat boutique named after him.
 Stroll the streets of the Ditmars area of Astoria, Queens, and you're bound to run into a French bulldog or 32, which was where the unofficial tally stood at last count. 
 ''Last year, there were only eight,'' said Tanja R. Firrigno, Oskar's ''mom'' and the owner of the Jumping Bulldog. ''There are several more that I haven't met, but I've seen them in the neighborhood. I see far more of them here than I do of any of the designer breeds.''
 With their rabbit ears, punched-in faces, squeaky-toy voices and wrestler's bodies, French bulldogs are a noticeable curiosity in Astoria, where the dog of choice still runs to pound, not pedigree. 
 ''They attract more attention than any other dog,'' said Erin Mara, owner of Donut, who is white with a black mask face. ''I can't walk two steps without people stopping us. I walk dogs in my spare time, and no other breed brings this type of response.''
 It's hard not to fall for Frenchies, which were popular lap dogs in wealthy households in 19th-century France, but it's not easy to understand why working-class Astoria has succumbed so suddenly. Often conceived via artificial insemination and delivered via Caesarean section, French bulldogs can sell for $2,500 to $5,000. According to the Web site of the French Bull Dog Club of America, the dogs are difficult to breed and the C-sections are made necessary by the mother's narrow hips and the puppies' large heads.
 ''For decades, Astoria has been waiting in the wings to become the next Manhattan,'' said George Halvatzis, a real estate agent whose Ditmars Boulevard office Donut passes during his daily constitutionals. ''We have been getting trendy restaurants and trendy shops, but more than anything, the Frenchies, which are so Manhattanesque, may be the signal that this is finally starting to happen.''
 Mr. Halvatzis, who owns a shar-pei named Chopper, said the breed was perfect for apartments. ''Because of the weak economy, landlords have gotten more lax about taking dogs,'' he said. ''And French bulldogs are just the right size and temperament for smaller spaces.''
 The dogs have another landlord-endearing quality: ''They don't bark,'' said Luke Herman, who, with his wife, Natalia Lyons, owns Jack. ''They have their own language of yodels, screams, chirps, warbles and what can best be described as snorfles.''
 JoAnn and Matt Franjola, owners of Romeo, say he is the perfect companion for their 3-month-old son, Chase. ''They're fabulous together,'' Ms. Franjola said. ''Romeo licks his toes, and if the baby cries, Romeo runs up to me and stares as if to say, 'Are you going to get that?' ''
 The only thing better than one Frenchie, say Givanni Ildefonso and Jose Sandin, is two. Coco and Samantha, sisters whose fall wardrobe includes matching brown and pink hoodies that complement their fawn bodies and black masks, have turned their owners into celebrities. ''We meet new people every night,'' Ms. Ildefonso said. ''And people always say: 'Wow! They're twins. How do you tell them apart?' ''
 Astoria Frenchie owners dismiss the idea that the dogs are status symbols and emphasize that they require as much tender loving care as children. They can develop breathing and respiratory problems because of their short, pressed-in faces, and are prone to joint diseases, spinal disorders and heart defects.
 ''There's an immense commitment, financially,'' says Josh Flanagan, whose 2-year-old George Clooney is among the original Astoria Eight. ''I've heard that over the life of the dog, it could cost $40,000 in veterinarian bills, premium food and general upkeep. My wife, Lindsay, and I love ours to death, but I don't know if we'd get another.''
 Astoria's fascination with the breed can be traced back four years to the first Oscar, a high-fashion fawn who wore a red bandana around his neck. His owner, a tall, ponytailed man who was said to have been an opera singer, taught Oscar to walk at his side, leashless, and to wait for him outside the shops on 31st Street.
 Oscar moved to the West Coast, Donut has since taken up the golden leash, and the new Oskar, with his darling doggie-in-the-window routine, has turned the Jumping Bulldog into a French bulldog franchise.
 Dogs and owners have become fast friends, so much so that Ms. Firrigno was considering holding Frenchie Fridays at the shop for some off-leash playtime.
 ''You can't be a Frenchie owner and be antisocial,'' Ms. Mara said. ''There's a special bond between Frenchie owners. It's like a club.''
 Mr. Herman agreed, adding that those in the Frenchie fraternity ''recognize the dogs but sometimes not the people. But we have developed social relationships with some of the owners, and sometimes we even hang out without the dogs.''
 There is also a special bond between the pets. Jack, Oskar and Donut, for instance, have become fast friends. 
 ''I can't imagine not ever having a Frenchie,'' Ms. Lyons said. ''Someday, I would like to get a little sister for Jack.''
 Jack looked up at her and smiled like a clown. On command, he gave Mr. Herman a high-five with his petite paw, and they continued down the street.
 ''Oh, that's so cute,'' a woman cooed as she knelt to pet his head. ''What kind of dog is that?''

HEADLINE: Job Losses Mount, Enduring And Deep

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE rise in unemployment that has occurred in the current recession has been hardest on young workers, while having a smaller effect on older workers than previous downturns. Women have been more likely than men to hold on to their jobs.
 The overall unemployment rate, which reached 10.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis last month, remains below the post-World War II peak of 10.8 percent, reached in late 1982. But the proportion of workers who have been out of work for a long time is higher now than it has ever been since the Great Depression. 
 The persistence of joblessness for so many people -- 5.6 million Americans have now been out of work for more than half a year even though they have continued to seek employment -- may provide the greatest challenge for the Obama administration if it decides to seek a new economic stimulus program.
 The short-term unemployment rate -- the proportion of the work force that has been jobless for less than 15 weeks -- has begun to decline, however, and stood at 4.5 percent in October after peaking at 4.9 percent in May.
 That decline is a signal that the recession, which officially began in December 2007, probably has ended. In past recessions since World War II, the National Bureau of Economic Research has always dated the end within two months of the peak in short-term joblessness.
 Over the last three years -- since October 2006 -- the overall unemployment rate has risen by 5.8 percentage points. That is the largest such increase since the Great Depression, providing another indication of the rapidity and severity of the current downturn.
 Before this cycle, the sharpest 36-month increase since World War II was a 4.9 percentage point rise in the period that ended November 1982.
 The accompanying charts show the short- and long-term unemployment rates during the three cycles since World War II when the unemployment rate rose above 8 percent, and reflect how different groups of workers fared in each.
 Each of the charts begins in the month when the broadest measure of employment -- the proportion of people over age 16 with jobs -- hit a cyclical peak. The first two end when that measure reached a cyclical low, several months after the recession was later deemed to have ended. The final chart runs through October, the latest month available.
 With each chart are calculations on the proportion of jobs that were added or lost from the peak through the bottom for differing groups of workers.
 This cycle has been the worst over all, with the government's household survey in October finding 7.7 million fewer jobs than in December 2006, when the employment-to-population ratio reached its high for the current cycle. The declines during the two earlier cycles, from November 1973 to June 1975 and from December 1979 to March 1983, were 0.8 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively.
 Women have held on to jobs better than men have during this downturn, reflecting a pattern that prevailed during the previous cycles. 
 One major difference is how older workers have fared. The number of jobs held by men over 55 is up 5.6 percent since the cycle began, and the number of jobs held by women of that age has risen by 9.3 percent. 
 There are fewer jobs for workers age 54 to 64 than when the cycle began, but that group has done much better than younger workers.
 By contrast, younger workers were more likely to hold on to their jobs in the two previous downturns.
 It is not clear why that pattern has changed. It is against federal law to discriminate against older workers, but that law was passed in 1967, before either of the previous downturns. It could be that the plunge in real estate and stock prices in 2008 led fewer older workers to decide to retire.
 The proportion of the work force out of work for more than 15 weeks reached 5.7 percent in October, well above the 4.2 percent figure reached in 1982. That had been the highest such figure since the government began calculating the number in 1948.
 The proportion that has been out of work for at least 27 weeks -- half a year -- is now 3.6 percent, also a record.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Worst of Three Downturns: The current downturn is the third since World War II in which the unemployment rate rose to above 8 percent. The three charts show each period, beginning when the percentage of American adults with jobs reached a cyclical peak, and ending when that ratio hit its lowest level for the cycle. The current downturn has been the worst of the three, in terms of the decline in employment over the period and in terms of the proportion of people who were unemployed for 15 weeks or more. This cycle has been less severe than earlier ones for older workers, but more severe for younger ones.

HEADLINE: For Marijuana, a Move Into the Open in a Ski Town

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. 

 BODY:
High-altitude partying is a deeply carved tradition in ski country, where alcohol in the open and illicit drugs in the shadows have been intertwined for years. 
 Even before last week's town vote here that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana, one of the best-selling T-shirts at Shirt and Ernie's on Main Street winked at what it means to live and play 9,600 feet up in the Rockies. 
 ''Dude,'' the shirt says, ''I think this whole town is high.'' 
 But what the town's drug ordinance could mean for the local culture and economy, as well as its potential impact on the resort industry if more ski towns go Breckenridge's way, has become part of the discussion as people scan the skies and wait for snow. 
 For business owners ever vigilant about the town's image, safety-minded resort managers and footloose ski and snowboard vagabonds whose ranks have given towns like this a tinge of wildness since the first ski bum washed a dish or waited a table, marijuana is openly discussed as perhaps never before.
 The leader of the group that organized the petition drive leading to the vote, Sensible Colorado, said that Breckenridge, where 71 percent of voters approved the marijuana measure on Election Day, was the opening salvo in a town-by-town strategy toward the goal of a vote on statewide legalization within a few years. 
 Local efforts, said the group's founder and chairman, Sean T. McAllister, are now organizing or under way in two other Colorado resort towns, Durango and Aspen. After the election, Mr. McAllister said, people in Montana and Washington called seeking advice on starting voter initiatives.
 Breckenridge's part-time mayor, Dr. John Warner, a dentist who voted against the measure but remained publicly neutral before the election, said the three dozen or so e-mail messages he had received since the vote had been mixed. 
 About half of the messages were negative, Dr. Warner said, and included comments from people who said they had canceled reservations and would never come back. Other respondents said they were thrilled about the town's vote and could hardly wait to visit and spend some money. 
 State and federal law still make marijuana possession a crime in Colorado, but residents here say that local enforcement has not been a high police priority. 
 A spokeswoman for the Breckenridge Resort Chamber of Commerce, Carly Grimes, said she thought that because of those other laws, little would change. But she said that some chamber members were concerned about perceptions -- that the statute could send a message of broader drug tolerance that could turn off visiting families, who remain a cornerstone of the economic base. 
 ''This is not going to become a little Amsterdam,'' she said, referring to the Dutch capital, an international symbol of libertarian drug use.
 At Vail Resorts, a publicly traded company that owns the Breckenridge resort, a spokeswoman said she expected no change in management practices.
 The spokeswoman, Kelly Ladyga, said that resort employees were already trained to be ''hypervigilant'' in watching people for dangerous behavior from drugs or alcohol and that the company reserved the right to test any employee for drugs if ''reasonable suspicions'' are raised or an accident occurs. 
 ''We're a family-friendly resort, and together with the town we remain committed to delivering an exceptional guest experience,'' Ms. Ladyga said. ''Boarding a lift or using a slope or trail while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited.'' 
 At Home for the Holidays, a year-round Christmas store, the manager, M. Musso, who asked that only her first initial be used, said her customers tended to be older and more conservative. The young and the rowdy, who crowd the bars when the lifts close, usually do not shop for Christmas baubles, she said. 
 ''I don't think that's the type of person we want flocking into Breckenridge,'' said Ms. Musso, who opposed the ordinance. 
 But it is also easy to find people like Chelsey Vogt, a 21-year-old snowboarder originally from upstate New York who foresees what she calls change for the better -- from local marijuana users' becoming more open and comfortable to pot-smoking visitors drawn by the town's new stance. 
 ''It's been here forever,'' said Ms. Vogt, who works for a property maintenance company when not on the mountain. ''Now people can just be more comfortable walking down the street having some marijuana in their pocket -- definitely including me.'' 
 One Town Council member who supported the ballot measure, Jeffrey J. Bergeron, said he thought history had played a role in assembling a majority of voters. Mr. Bergeron, who has lived in Breckenridge for nearly 30 years, said many longtime residents vividly remembered the 1970s and 1980s, when cocaine use became a rage and then a scourge, destroying lives and businesses before fading in the 1990s. Through that lens, he said, marijuana looks comparatively benign.
 But Mr. Bergeron said he had not expected a backlash, and he now worries that business could take a hit. 
 ''It was a gesture in the right direction,'' he said. ''I just wish some other town had done it.''
 Whether the new measure will lead to more accidents on the slopes is anyone's guess. 
 Colorado is one of the few states whose legal codes specify that collisions between skiers are not a natural risk of the sport. The provision, passed by the legislature in 1990, imposes what lawyers call a higher standard of care and potential legal liability upon skiers who cause accidents than do most other states with big resort industries. 
 James H. Chalat, a lawyer in Denver who specializes in personal injury and ski cases, said that of the hundreds of lawsuits stemming from skiing accidents handled by his firm, Chalat Hatten & Koupal, over 29 years, marijuana had been a factor in only one collision between two skiers. 
 Alcohol, on the other hand, has often been an aggravating cause, with a drunken skier or snowboarder plowing into somebody else, causing injury. 
 In any accident, though, evidence of marijuana use would be looked at. ''If somebody is stoned, that's not helpful,'' Mr. Chalat said. ''It's a dumb thing.''

HEADLINE: Higher Oil Prices Widen the Trade Gap

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Matthew Saltmarsh and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The trade deficit in the United States widened more than expected in September, to $36.5 billion, in part because of an increase in oil prices, the Commerce Department said Friday.
 The department's data showed an 18.2 percent increase in the difference in the value of imports and exports, known as the trade balance. 
 Both imports and exports rose, but an increase in the price of oil, which climbed $3.42, to $68.17 a barrel, in September, helped widen the gap. The United States imported $19.51 billion in oil in September, up from $17.38 billion in August. 
 Over all, imports rose 5.8 percent in September, to $168.4 billion from $159.1 billion, and exports grew at half that pace -- 2.9 percent -- to $132 billion from $128.3 billion.
 The data suggested that demand for American products abroad was starting to recover, helped by a weak dollar. After holding up for much of 2008, exports fell off late in the year as other countries began to struggle. Exports have recovered since and exports in September returned to December 2008 levels. 
 Strong export growth and a revival in consumer spending are considered a key to a recovery in the United States. As of September, the trade deficit was running at an annual rate of $366 billion, about half of the $695.9 billion last year. The deficit with China, which had been easing, rose 9.2 percent, to $22.1 billion, last month, its highest level in 10 months.
 While the economy remains weak, Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass., said the rise in imports might indicate that manufacturers in the United States were building inventories -- a carmaker importing Japanese auto parts, for instance -- in anticipation of higher demand from American consumers.
 ''It's a very strong signal that the domestic economy is recovering,'' he said.
 Mr. Behravesh said he expected the appetite for imported goods to remain low as consumers tried to rein in spending.
 Analysts, however, expect American companies will benefit from the weak dollar.
 ''The dollar's been a boost from the standpoint of what it does for competitiveness,'' said Gary Adams, chief economist for the National Cotton Council. ''We've seen a bit of improvement on the export picture, and expect it to continue.''
 But a bounce in exports may not come as quickly as some producers would like.
 John Dodson, president of the American Soybean Association, said the weak dollar meant soybean growers would have to pay more overseas for supplies like fertilizer and machine parts, and he worried that there was a limit to the demand for soybeans worldwide, even if they were cheaper to foreign consumers. 
 ''I hope that we will be able to catch up and see strong export growth,'' Mr. Dodson said. Exports of soybeans, as well as corn, fell slightly in September.
 Dermot J. Hayes, a professor of economics and finance at Iowa State University who specializes in agricultural economics, said the global malaise could slow what might otherwise be a fast-paced season for American exporters.
 Policy makers in Washington have seemed content to let the dollar slide, as long as it does not fall too rapidly and wreak havoc on world economies. The Federal Reserve has kept its interest rates at historic lows, helping to contribute to a weak dollar as investors transfer their wealth to the world's booming stock markets.
 In Asia this week, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner reiterated his support for a strong dollar in the face of criticism from foreign finance ministers.
 Many of America's trading partners have bristled at the weak dollar, concerned it will make their products less competitive. Exports make up more than 40 percent of South Korea's economy and about a third of China's. 
 In China, exports are slowly recovering from a slump that is expected to stunt gross domestic product by about 1 percent this year and another 1 percent next year, economists say. Japan also faces a gloomy outlook in overseas sales, while there has been strong growth in South Korea in part because of increased demand for consumer electronics and automobiles in China.
 Export growth has been slow for most major European economies. For instance, global stimulus efforts have added momentum to sales of machine tools, chemicals and high-end automobiles in Germany, but the prospects for a strong recovery in Europe are weak given that many banks remain fragile.
 ''We believe that consumption growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies will be sluggish,'' said Oliver Hulsewig, a senior researcher at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich. ''We won't see a return for some time to the strength that we saw before the current crisis.''
 On Friday, the Commerce Department also revised the August deficit to $30.8 billion, a smaller-than-expected gap that came after companies cut back on foreign oil.

HEADLINE: Champagne Sales Are Going Flat

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: EPERNAY, France 

 BODY:
For generations of French Champagne makers, the threat of calamity has been a constant companion, whether it is winter freezes or spring frosts, phylloxera parasites or Nazi occupiers.
 Now add to the list a drop in Champagne sales in all the top export markets, particularly the United States, Britain and Japan. All had seemed to have insatiable appetites for the extravagant, delicate bubbles in recent years -- until popping housing bubbles sent the global economy into a downturn. The weak currencies in those export markets have also hurt.
 The grandees of the Champagne region -- Moet & Chandon, Perrier-Jouet and Piper-Heidsieck -- are putting on a brave face heading into the holiday rush, the heady weeks from November to New Year's Eve when they usually sell millions of bottles and reap most of their annual profits.
 So far, retailers in the United States are offering some modest discounts on their Champagne, though some bigger price cuts can be found on more expensive merchandise. Sherry-Lehmann Wine and Spirits, a major retailer in New York, is selling a gift-boxed Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 1998 for $130 in the coming holiday season, down from about $150 in last year's holiday catalog. 
 But Jon Fredrikson, of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, a wine industry consulting company in the San Francisco Bay Area, said retailers were probably waiting until the holiday season to decide whether to slash prices on their higher-end brands.
 Overseas, more significant discounting has already started. Bottles of Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot are one-third off with the purchase of two -- $:24.99 ($41.69) at one top British retailer. In Australia, a price war has broken out among the major liquor retailers. 
 Even in France -- the biggest market for Champagne -- the supermarket giant Carrefour is laying holiday plans to sell Champagne for less than 10 euros ($14.90). A year ago, those bottles might have sold for 12 euros.
 Officially, bargains are a crass notion for the industry, which carefully cultivates its image of luxury and glamour. 
 ''We are artisans and it's not interesting to me to talk about the market or prices,'' said Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, president of Champagne Taittinger in Reims in the Champagne region of northeastern France. ''We are not selling perfume or soap or cars. My job is to find a million friends across the globe that drink five bottles of champagne a year.'' 
 But deep in the wine cellars, there is definitely something going on, as sales to both the United States and Britain tumbled in the first nine months of this year. Britain was down 33 percent, to 12.2 million bottles. Exports to the United States were off 43 percent, to 4.56 million bottles. 
 Producers also have an image problem.
 ''It was a cliche that Champagne did well when times were bad,'' said Robert Joseph, editor at large of Meininger's Wine Business International magazine. ''But this recession has an added element to it in which conspicuous spending -- bling -- is out of fashion.''
 American consumers are clearly trading down. Sales of cheaper sparkling wines -- typically produced in Spain or Italy -- are up 10 percent this year, while sales of imported wines priced at more than $25 are down 21 percent, according to Danny Brager, the group client director for alcohol for Nielsen, which tracks sales in the United States.
 ''The $64 million question in this environment is how will consumers respond heading into this critical time, when we know they are under extreme wallet pressure,'' Mr. Brager said.
 Nielsen figures show that Taittinger, one of the top 10 producers, has responded by spending more on promotional displays in American stores. The percentage of volume sold with promotions is up to 50 percent, from 35 percent, over the last two years.
 Others are deploying their most reliable weapons: glamour and indulgence.
 Moet & Chandon, which is the leader in the American market, is offering a 300 euro ($447) ''celebration case'' that includes a magnum of Moet Imperial, Champagne flutes and medallions with colored Swarovski crystals encased in gilded bubbles. 
 ''We still believe Champagne is needed in tough times,'' said Marc Jacheet, the global director for Moet & Chandon. ''It's not a price battle that we want to get into. We do discount, but selectively and reasonably. We believe more in providing rituals.''
 So does Moet's rival, Remy Cointreau. Its Piper-Heidsieck label is promoting a $500 gift package of a bottle of brut Champagne and a hand-blown, crystal ruby stiletto shoe designed by Christian Louboutin. The company's YouTubevideo is a romantic dream scene of a modern Cinderella who leaves behind a shoe just like it for her distraught lover, who is consoled by the Champagne overflowing from the instep.
 ''I don't expect people to be drinking out of a shoe at midnight on New Year's Eve,'' said Michelle DeFeo, a vice president for marketing for Remy in the United States. ''What we're reminding them is that Champagne has this sensual side so maybe you should share a bottle some night with your loved one.''
 In the first six months of the year, sales revenue for Champagne at Remy Cointreau dropped 42 percent, to $53.19 million, largely because of weak sales in the United States.
 Last month, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods giant, which owns the houses of Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, reported an 18 percent drop in its sales of wine and spirits over the first nine months of the year, though it does not break out the brands separately.
 The tough year has stoked concerns that some of the struggling wineries may be sold in the Champagne region of northeastern France.
 Last month, there was speculation that Diageo, a British liquor company, was discussing a deal with LVMH to buy the world's oldest Champagne houses. While LVMH denies it and Diageo will not comment, Diageo's chief executive, Paul Walsh, said openly in August that his company -- which holds a 34 percent stake in LVMH's drinks unit -- was interested in buying the rest if Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chief executive, were to consider selling. 
 ''All the workers and winemakers are talking about it,'' said Cyril Janisson, a fifth-generation Champagne maker with Janisson Baradon & Fils. ''Nobody knows what is going to happen; it's crazy. The Champagne makers are waiting to see how many bottles they can sell in this crisis.''
 He noted that some smaller companies were faring better because they had not been exporting heavily to the United States. 
 Far from panicking, some high-end Champagne makers are taking a low-key approach. 
 Within the Boizel Chanoine Champagne Group, one label, Champagne de Venoge, is increasing its distribution to a wider range of countries. Another, Champagne de Philipponnat, is redesigning labels and actually raising its average prices this year by about 3 percent, to 27.50 euros.
 ''Most of the marketing is inside the bottle,'' said Charles Philipponnat, who runs the company from an 18th century winery in Mareuil-sur-Ay.
 Winemaking stretches back generations in the family, so Mr. Philipponnat takes a long view. His father was a prisoner of war in Germany in World War II. The naked copper lines that run through the winery are a remnant from French soldiers who rigged telephone lines in the protected cellar during World War I.
 ''We had a half a century of crisis. First the phylloxera crisis that destroyed the vineyards and then World War I. Then came the Great Depression and right after that World War II,'' said Mr. Philipponnat. ''That should put this crisis into perspective.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Rebounds as Dow Goes 4 for 5 on the Week

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Encouraging earnings news from major retailers and the Walt Disney Company drew investors back into the stock market on Friday, one day after a big drop.
 Disney said late Thursday that higher revenue at its cable, broadcast and movie studio divisions had helped produce an 18 percent increase in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit. Results were better than expected at Abercrombie & Fitch, while J. C. Penney raised its profit and sales forecasts.
 The market briefly stumbled in morning trading after a report found that the mood of consumers had darkened. The Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment for November fell to 66.0, from 70.6 in October, making investors nervous that cautious consumers would not step up holiday spending. 
 Stocks rebounded after the sentiment report but later pared their gains as the dollar pulled off its lows of the day. The dollar's steady slide since March, largely because of record-low interest rates, has encouraged investors to move money out of dollars and into higher-yielding assets like stocks and commodities.
 Lawrence R. Creatura, equity market strategist and portfolio manager at Federated Clover Investment Advisors, said investors were able to look past the consumer confidence figure and instead focus on earnings reports from retailers, because they were a more reliable indicator about the economy. ''It's probably safe to say that investors are rationally more focused on what consumers do rather than what they say,'' he said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73 points, or 0.72 percent, to 10,270.47. The Dow's drop on Thursday broke a six-session winning streak, as oil prices tumbled on fresh signs of weak energy demand and a stronger dollar.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.24 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,093.48, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 18.86 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,167.88.
 The Dow, which rose 2.5 percent this week after jumping 3.2 percent the previous week, has gained 17 percent this year. The S.& P. 500 climbed 2.3 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq added 2.6 percent.
 The dollar drove trading during the week, as it has for months. The biggest gain of the week came Monday when the Dow jumped 204 points as a falling dollar raised commodities prices and officials from the Group of 20 wealthy and developing nations signaled they would hold interest rates low to propel economic growth. Stocks rose each day during the week except Thursday.
 Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said he expected the ties between a weak dollar and stocks to continue. ''As long as interest rates stay low it's going to be difficult for the dollar to gain any strength,'' he said.
 Analysts also say news about consumers will drive trading. Traders will get fresh insight next week with a government report due Monday on retail sales in October as well as quarterly earnings reports from Gap, Home Depot, Saks and Target.
 Investors are worried that consumers won't be ready to spend more as the effects dissipate from government stimulus spending like the cash-for-clunkers program.
 ''The real concern is, once the impact of the stimulus works its way through the system, is there going to be a smooth handoff to the consumer?'' said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
 The latest batch of earnings reports gave some hope Friday. Disney rose $1.39, or 4.8 percent, to $30.44, and posted the biggest advance of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials.
 Abercrombie jumped $3.92, or 10.66 percent, to $40.68, while J. C. Penney gained $1.82, or 6.19 percent, to $31.21.
 Bonds mostly rose, pushing yields lower. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 7/32, to 99 20/32. The yield fell to 3.42 percent, from 3.44 percent late Thursday.
 Gold rose, while oil fell 59 cents to settle at $76.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Philanthropy Thrives, Even With Reduced Resources

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE expectation in America is that people who do well give back to society. For the wealthy, it is one way to stave off charges of being greedy. And in the boom times, being seen as philanthropic seemed a social and political obligation. 
 But just as the downturn left the wealthy (and the rest of us) reeling from personal portfolio losses, their foundations also suffered investment losses that have affected their capacity to give. The Foundation Center in New York said this month that philanthropic giving in 2009 could fall as much as 13 percent. This has left many charities, particularly small ones, scraping for funds. 
 Yet Charles Bronfman, the former co-chairman of the Seagram Company and founder of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies, was quick to correct me when I asked him how philanthropists felt about the pressure to give back. ''I never give back,'' he said. ''I don't like that term. I give because I want to give. Other people give because they want to increase their social standing.'' 
 That may help explain why philanthropy has not dipped as much as people's net worth. ''I think some donors are in a state of panic, which leaves them frozen in place,'' said Melissa Berman, president of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers. ''But others have a more philosophical temperament and have continued on a steady course.'' 
 This has meant that the wealthy have become more creative with their philanthropic dollars. She noted that aid to large, stable institutions had been cut in favor of smaller organizations that might be struggling to weather the downturn. The big winners have been food charities, she said, while small arts organizations have suffered the most. 
 Yet Mr. Bronfman, who has co-written the book ''The Art of Giving'' with the president of his foundation, Jeffrey R. Solomon, said the philanthropic economy never dips as far as the economy and returns at the leading edge of any recovery. ''It can be for guilt; it can be for pleasure; but at the end of the day, giving is something that makes you feel better,'' said Mr. Bronfman, who has been involved with philanthropy for 63 years. 
 To test this hypothesis, I decided to check in with three philanthropists I had spoken to in 2006. At the time, they were all overseeing personal foundations in a strong economy. Today, the one common thread is that they are seeking innovative ways to continue their philanthropy with diminished resources. 
 PARTNERING Donald and Barbara Jonas financed the Jonas Center for Excellence in Nursing in 2006. Their goal was to improve nursing care in New York City. The Jonases made their money from Lechters Housewares, a chain of home goods stores, and they seeded their foundation with the sale of $44 million in art. 
 ''We had our bumps in the financial markets like everybody else,'' Mr. Jonas said. ''All of our commitments have been paid on time.''
 Their foundation has given out $7.4 million in grants in the last three years and plans to continue spending $3 million to $3.5 million a year, even though its endowment has been hit, falling from a high of nearly $48 million to $26 million earlier this year. It is now back above $30 million. 
 Mr. Jonas said the toughest lesson he learned was that other philanthropists did not want to give money to the Jonas Center. But, he said, they could be persuaded to donate money directly to causes the Jonas Center was supporting. It took him two years to realize this, he said, but since then he has brought in nearly $3 million in matching donations. 
 They have recently partnered with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to help nurses upgrade their training from associate's to bachelor's degrees.
 Mrs. Jonas said the center was now looking for partners for a program to help nurses get their doctorates. ''They don't have to call them Jonas Scholars,'' she said. ''They can call them whatever they want. We just want them to join in what we're doing.'' So far, six nurses have been helped.
 A NARROWER FOCUS Jeff Skoll, the former president of eBay, led the drive to finance ''social entrepreneurs'' as part of what he called venture philanthropy. But today, the foundation he created has raised the bar for what it finances. 
 ''It's no longer enough to make the case for social entrepreneurs,'' said Sally Osberg, president of the Skoll Foundation. ''Resources have become much more precious.''
 The foundation, which has $750 million an assets, a third less than before the market crash, is focused on giving additional funds to groups it has already financed, something it was not doing when we first spoke. 
 One example is Mindy Lubber, who in 2006 received a social entrepreneur grant of $525,000 over three years. This year, Ceres, the organization she created, received an additional $2 million for the work it is doing on pollution and climate change. 
 ''It's really driven by Jeff Skoll's appreciation for the imperatives of these large-scale issues,'' Ms. Osberg said, citing climate change, water scarcity and the continued conflict in the Middle East. ''These are threats with catastrophic consequences.''
 CHARGING AHEAD Amy Robbins is taking an entirely different tack. A hedge fund executive until she left the industry in 2004, Ms. Robbins has increased her charitable work since we first spoke. 
 ''I'm giving as much or more as I was giving before,'' she said. ''Whatever pain we're feeling in this economy, those living in sub-Saharan Africa are feeling multiples of this.''
 In 2006, she had just given $5 million to create the Mercury Fund through the United States Fund for Unicef. The Mercury Fund's goal was to be a first responder among charities, and this meant sending money to crisis areas within days, not weeks or months. It has made grants in 14 countries, including Burma and the Philippines. The fund has paid out $3 million in the last three years and brought in an additional $5 million through an annual ball that Ms. Robbins underwrote. 
 She declined to put a precise number on what Nduna, her family foundation, gives yearly, other than to say it is several million dollars. She said that her foundation lost a third of its value in the downturn but that it had continued to support all the organizations it had before.
 Since the recession hit, she has stepped up her giving to programs focused on stopping the sexual abuse of young girls and groups working to reduce malnutrition in young children. ''Their lives will never rebound if we don't do something now,'' she said. ''Our financial capacities will rebound.''
 GENERAL TIPS More broadly, Ms. Berman said Rockefeller Philanthropy had been advising foundations on how to adjust their giving to reflect fewer assets in three basic ways. The first is to use a three-year rolling average of the foundation's value to determine donations. This allows you to give less but still hit the 5 percent annual disbursement required by federal tax laws. 
 A second solution is to lend money to a charity at a below-market interest rate. The difference in rates counts toward the 5 percent disbursement. And the third option is to invest the underlying assets of the foundation in community banks or other areas related to the foundation's mission. 
 ''They need to focus on the organizations they care the most about,'' she said. ''It may mean helping to find other donors.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Not Threatened by the Success of China, Obama Tells the Japanese

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The United States is not threatened by a rising China, President Obama said Saturday, but will seek to strengthen its ties with Beijing even as it maintains close ties with traditional allies like Japan.
 In a wide-ranging speech on his first trip to Asia as president, Mr. Obama drew on his own background to reassure the people of the fast-growing continent that even as the United States seemed preoccupied with conflicts in the Middle East and other regions, it was increasingly ''a nation of the Pacific.'' 
 ''I know there are many who question how the United States perceives China's emergence,'' Mr. Obama told an audience in Tokyo's Suntory Hall. But he added, ''In an interconnected world, power does not need to be a zero-sum game, and nations need not fear the success of another.'' 
 Declaring himself ''America's first Pacific president'' (a description that somehow ignored Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, two Californians), Mr. Obama previewed many of the themes that will shadow him during his weeklong trip, which will also include stops in Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing and Seoul. 
 He called on North Korea to return to talks aimed at reining in its nuclear weapons program or face even greater isolation; he urged the military government in Myanmar to release the leader of the country's beleaguered democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (although he mispronounced her name); and he pledged to ''never waver in speaking for the fundamental values that we hold dear.'' 
 But at every turn of his address, Mr. Obama projected a more conciliatory America, which is trying to break from the past. On Myanmar, for example, he pledged that he would ''be the first American leader to meet with all 10 Asean leaders.'' Mr. Obama will be at the table in Singapore on Sunday with the leaders of Myanmar and the other countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, an economic group. 
 And while Mr. Obama spoke at length about human rights, he never connected the pursuit of such rights specifically to China and Tibet, where Beijing-backed authorities have clamped down on religious freedom. Instead, Mr. Obama, clearly seeking to avoid alienating Beijing on the eve of his inaugural visit to China, struck broader themes, saying that ''supporting human rights provides lasting security that cannot be purchased any other way.''
 As he has on many of his trips abroad, Mr. Obama painted a picture of an America willing to learn from its mistakes. In particular, he said, the United States and Asia must grow out of the imbalance of American consumerism and Asian reliance on the United States as an export market, a cycle he called imbalanced.
 ''One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American consumers and Asian exports to drive growth,'' he said. ''We have now reached one of those rare inflection points in history where we have the opportunity to take a different path.''
 Mr. Obama seemed to speak directly to the new Japanese government's efforts to build a tighter Asian economic sphere, and used his own history to deliver the message: Don't exclude the United States. 
 ''My own life is part of that story,'' he said. ''I am an American president who was born in Hawaii and lived in Indonesia as a boy. My sister Maya was born in Jakarta and later married a Chinese-Canadian. My mother spent nearly a decade working in the villages of Southeast Asia, helping women buy a sewing machine or an education that might give them a foothold in the world economy.''
 ''So,'' he added, ''the Pacific rim has helped shape my view of the world.'' He even spoke of his first trip to Japan as a boy--''As a child, I was more focused on the matcha ice cream,'' he said. 
 That drew laughs from the audience, which gave him a standing ovation both before and after his speech.

HEADLINE: Forces Aligning In Bid to Block Cuts in Albany

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson is imploring the Legislature to finally reckon with the state's ugly financial reality. 
 But first the governor must reckon with the likes of Senator Carl Kruger. 
 Mr. Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has amassed a campaign war chest of $2.1 million, in part because of generous contributions from his labor union allies. 
 Despite a deficit of more than $3 billion, Mr. Kruger has threatened to block any significant cuts to health care and education, the biggest spending areas in the budget. He has presented his own budget plan, which has startled even Albany veterans for its reliance on one-time maneuvers and financial gimmickry. 
 The governor and lawmakers have clashed over spending before. But recent events have created a new urgency and, in the view of Mr. Paterson and budget analysts, a desperate situation. 
 The state has lost 270,000 jobs since the start of the recession. The tax bounty from Wall Street has shrunk. 
 And spending just keeps soaring. New York now spends more than any other state on Medicaid, twice the national average per capita. It also spends the most on school aid, per student, than any other state.
 New York is by no means the only place that is struggling. The 50 states confronted a cumulative $162 billion budget gap this year, according to a report issued this week by the Pew Center on the States, which also found that states' tax collections were down nearly 12 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous year.
 California may be in the deepest crisis, but others, like New Jersey, are teetering. States are grappling with the burden of unemployment and soaring pension costs. And many legislatures put off hard decisions about spending cuts, making the current situation worse. 
 In New York over the last decade, the state operating budget has risen an average of 5.8 percent annually, far outpacing the average inflation rate of 2.8 percent. Budget analysts say lawmakers never prepared for the down times. 
 ''We were getting this boom in taxes, and we didn't save it and we plowed everything that came in, in terms of revenue, into expenditures,'' said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization that analyzes government spending. ''We have money? Let's increase education spending, let's increase health care spending. Let's not question what happens down the road if this bubble doesn't continue.''
 In Albany, Mr. Paterson took the unusual step on Monday of speaking to a joint session of the Legislature in its traditional off-season, telling members, ''Quite frankly, we are running out of money.''
 Senators have delayed budget negotiations for weeks as Mr. Kruger accused the governor of creating a ''doomsday scenario'' and vowed not to ''succumb to his hysteria.''
 The battle over how to close the deficit this year is merely setting the stage for a far more bitter fight likely to erupt next year, pitting the governor against a fractious and rebellious State Senate, where Democrats hold a shaky 32-to-30 majority. 
 How the budget fight is resolved will have implications for years to come. The comptroller's office is projecting that the budget gap next year will be nearly $8 billion, and a failure to take long-term steps would exacerbate deficits in 2011 and 2012, as the federal stimulus expires and a temporary increase of taxes on the wealthy ends. 
 The labor unions and special interests that control the capital are mobilizing for a fight. And lawmakers are likely to balk at making painful cuts in a year when elections will be held for all 212 legislative seats. 
 It is not clear whether Mr. Paterson has the stomach for a protracted battle over spending. With the help of Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch, he has made progress persuading newspaper editorial boards and Assembly leaders that bold action is needed. 
 Still, on Thursday, Mr. Paterson seemed to be wavering on his commitment to cuts. That day, one of the state's most powerful unions, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, drew 2,000 people to Albany for a spirited rally, demanding that Mr. Paterson back off any budget cuts.
 The S.E.I.U. and its health care industry allies do not shrink from aggressively attacking governors. They unleashed a blistering set of television ads against Mr. Paterson last year, blaming him for hurting the most vulnerable people with his budget reductions. 
 Labor unions are relying heavily on the Senate, especially Mr. Kruger, a stocky cabdriver's son whose voice still carries the accent of the Brownsville neighborhood where he grew up. He is certainly a canny political survivor. When Republicans controlled the Senate, Mr. Kruger, 59, was their favorite Democrat, and he was even given a committee chairmanship. When Democrats won back control last year, Mr. Kruger took over the Finance Committee after joining three Latino lawmakers in a coalition -- they called themselves ''the four amigos'' -- that won concessions after threatening to join the Republican caucus. 
 Summing up his political skill, he said, ''I know how to count to 32.'' 
 Where the governor would cut spending, Mr. Kruger and the Senate prefer one-time measures like restructuring the state's tobacco bonds, a move that would increase New York's debt burden. Mr. Kruger would also draw from the treasuries of public authorities to a greater degree than the governor and wants to increase gambling hours at gaming facilities. 
 And Mr. Kruger believes the state should set up a commission to study ways to make government more efficient, a step that could take years to show gains. 
 ''If the editorial boards and naysayers would look at this as an opportunity to reshape government, they'd see that cutting programs and services is not going to get us out of this hole,'' Mr. Kruger said.
 He has always been a prodigious fund-raiser, but his new job has helped him build a $2.1 million campaign fund, the largest among the 62 senators. 
 ''The monies that I've raised in my campaign account predate my chairmanship of the Finance Committee; it's not a derivative of it,'' Mr. Kruger said. ''I'm not saying it's hurt, but it's not the sole way I've raised money.''
 Lawmakers have agreed to return to the Capitol on Monday to resume their special session. Negotiations between legislative leaders and the Paterson administration were to continue through the weekend.
 Some are hoping for an uptick in revenues from the recent awarding of bonuses on Wall Street. But Ms. Kellermann warned that the state had to address its deeper structural spending problems.
 ''The problem is not going away,'' she said. ''New York is going to lag in recovering from the recession and may never recover to the levels we have become accustomed to because of the financial industry.''

HEADLINE: The Passion of the Right

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
In 354 days, the dead will rise. Or so believe Republicans.
 They believe that their suffering and forbearance in the face of an overzealous, hyperliberal left will culminate in a 2010 resurrection of the battered Republican brand. 
 Case in point: After G.O.P. victories in Virginia last week, Representative Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, exclaimed that voters are ''looking for change. ... The Republican resurgence begins again tonight!''
 Unfortunately, he's probably right, in part at least. They are likely to make significant gains, not because of their anachronous tenets, but because of historical patterns and an electorate exasperated with seeming Democratic ineptitude.
 According to a Gallup poll on Wednesday, in a generic 2010 Congressional matchup, Republicans moved ahead of Democrats 48 percent to 44 percent. Now generic polls have to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, they do measure the mood of the populace, and it doesn't look good for Democrats.
 The most striking finding in the poll was the margin for Republicans among independents. It grew from 1 percentage point in July to 22 percentage points in November. This is important because according to the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey, independents are now nearly as large a group as Democrats and Republicans combined.
 And, it gets worse for the Democrats. The Gallup poll was of registered voters, not likely voters who skew more Republican, in part because fewer young people vote in midterm elections. 
 Let's take a look at how these factors played out in the recent gubernatorial races. In Virginia and New Jersey, the percentage of voters under age 44 dropped 18 and 14 percentage points, respectively, from last November to this November. And what of the all-important independents Obama narrowly won in both states? They voted overwhelmingly for the Republican candidates.
 Cantor is also right that the people want change -- still. They trusted Democrats to deliver. The Democrats haven't, not yet at least, and pleas for patience come at a price. If voters' thirst remains unsated, they will change politicians until politicians change policies.
 The party that wins the White House generally loses Congressional seats in the midterm, but this Democratic-controlled government has particular issues. Its agenda has been hamstrung by a perfect storm of politics: the Republicans' surprisingly effective obstructionist strategy, a Democratic caucus riddled with conservative sympathizers and a president encircled by crises and crippled by caution.
 And, the most important pocketbook issue -- jobs -- hasn't been the priority that it should be. History may eventually judge these Democrats favorably. Who knows? But real-time anxiety threatens to undermine them.
 Jobs may be a lagging indicator of economic recovery, but consecutive summers of ''staycations'' may be a leading indicator of political realignment.

HEADLINE: Worried About Losing Tax Revenue, Congress to Investigate Airlines' Fees

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
When airlines charge extra fees, are they really just another fare increase in disguise?
 It is not just a theoretical question to help travelers pass the time in an airport.
 Congress has been furrowing its collective brow at the practice. An investigation is under way, and could lead to changes in this increasingly popular tactic that airlines use to bring in more revenue without raising fares.
 Such fees have helped the industry offset the effects of the recession, by charging for things like checking bags, selecting seats and even for travel during the holidays. 
 The reason for the Congressional interest is money. Fees, for the most part, are not taxed, so the government is concerned it is missing out on extra revenue that could help airports. 
 Penny-pinching travelers may gripe about the fees, but this new inquiry could raise the ultimate cost of tickets, if airlines decide to pass along to their customers the cost of the additional taxes.
 The outcome will hinge on the answer to a technical question: do the fees reflect what it costs the airlines to provide the extra service, or are they just an added charge for services the airlines have always provided? 
 The airlines prefer a different metaphor, and say these fees are akin to an a la carte restaurant menu, allowing passengers to choose what they want as part of their trip.
 But to Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, who has long followed industry issues, fees mean only one thing: ''They've found a backdoor way to raise ticket prices.'' 
 He and Representative Jerry F. Costello, Democrat of Illinois, have asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the practice. The office's first meetings with airlines began last month, and Mr. Oberstar said he expected to hold Congressional hearings for airline executives to justify the fees.
 So far this year, United States airlines have taken in more than $3 billion in fees. If all those fees were subject to the same 7.5 percent excise taxes as fares, then the government would have at least $225 million more to distribute to airports for improvements and expansions. 
 Airline executives said they were cooperating fully with the Congressional investigation, but were concerned that it might result in even higher prices for consumers, who are already paying an average of $10 each in baggage and other fees, which the airlines call ancillary revenue.
 ''It falls in the category, first, do no harm,'' said David Castelveter, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group.
 But Mr. Oberstar says airlines may be doing themselves long-term harm. The money collected from excise taxes is a primary source of federal financing for airports, which ultimately helps both the airlines and their customers. 
 ''Maybe we have to teach them a lesson, and make them pay their fair share,'' Mr. Oberstar said of the airlines.
 The airlines counter that the recession has forced them to think up new revenue streams. This fall, for example, they began adding a surcharge on tickets booked during the most popular travel days during Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring break.
 ''We have been aggressive and creative,'' John Tague, president of United Airlines, told analysts last month. And it has paid off: United collects about $13 in fees per passenger, or 30 percent more than the industry average.
 Collectively, the nine biggest airlines lost $236 million between July and September, which is usually the strongest quarter for travel during the year, according to Airlinefinancials.com, which tracks industry trends.
 Along with the overall drop in travel, revenue from business travelers, a major source of income for United and other carriers, was down 25 percent in the third quarter, after falling 40 percent earlier this year.
 ''There's no opportunity here for a full revenue recovery until we get premium travel back,'' Mr. Tague said. ''And it's not clear how long that will take.''
 Southwest Airlines has been a holdout in charging many fees. So far, it has not started charging to check the first two bags, although it is exploring ways to collect more revenue from passengers when it overhauls its frequent-flier program.
 ''We all know if we charged money, we'd get the bag fee, but we'd lose the customer,'' its chief executive, Gary Kelly, said last month. ''We believe we're ahead of the game by not charging a bag fee.''
 Robert W. Mann, an industry analyst, said airlines were making a mistake by giving passengers another reason to resent them, and by creating a new incentive for them to search harder for the lowest possible fare.
 He added that the airlines should have been clearer on their Web sites and in their ads about the charges for things that were once included in the ticket price.
 ''There's a right way, and a wrong way, and the wrong way is what the airlines have done,'' Mr. Mann said.
 Mr. Mann got his own fee surprise when he flew JetBlue Airways from Orlando to New York in October.
 He arrived early at the airport, and asked to rebook his flight. He was told he could do so for $40. The aisle seat he wanted cost him another $25.
 ''It's different than buying a car, and adding on the options packages,'' he said. ''It's almost as if airlines have turned this on its head and said, 'We'll sell you the Toyota, but the four tires are extra.' ''

HEADLINE: China Shows Focus on Territorial Issues as It Equates Tibet and Civil War South

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
The Chinese government had a special message for President Obama on Thursday: He is black, he admires Abraham Lincoln, so he, of all people, should sympathize with Beijing's effort to prevent Tibet from seceding and sliding back into what it was before its liberation by Chinese troops: a feudalistic, slaveholding society headed by the Dalai Lama.
 ''He is a black president, and he understands the slavery abolition movement and Lincoln's major significance for that movement,'' Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference. 
 Mr. Qin added: ''Thus, on this issue we hope that President Obama, more than any other foreign leader, can better, more deeply grasp China's stance on protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity.'' 
 For many Americans, Mr. Qin's analogy might sound like a stretch, but it revealed which issues Chinese leaders see as among their top priorities, ones that Mr. Obama will no doubt have to grapple with after he arrives in China on Sunday for his first trip here.
 While much attention will be focused on broad international issues like trade and currency values, climate change and the ailing world economy, questions of sovereignty and territory remain an obsession of Chinese foreign policy. Some scholars and analysts see this as an expression of an aggressive expansionism that will only deepen as China moves toward superpower status. Others argue that China is driven more by the need to recover territory wrested from it during the decades it was known as the Sick Man of Asia, when pieces of it were humiliatingly annexed by European powers and Japan.
 As a result, Mr. Obama can expect to get an earful from Chinese officials not only on the Dalai Lama, whom the president says he will meet after the China trip, but also on Taiwan, the self-governing island that China says is a rebel province. Taiwan receives annual arms shipments from the United States.
 ''Tibet and Taiwan are, from China's perspective, the two core sovereignty issues, and they rank above all others in Chinese diplomacy,'' said David Shambaugh, a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
 Disputed territory is also the biggest obstacle in relations between China and its largest neighbor, India. On Tuesday, Mr. Qin denounced the Dalai Lama for his visit this week to the Tibetan Buddhist enclave of Tawang in the Indian Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh.
 Tawang is one of the most potent symbols of China's unresolved sovereignty issues. China says it was once part of Tibet, which the Chinese military seized in 1951, and so belongs to Beijing. India says that Tibetan leaders ceded it to British-ruled India in a 1914 treaty. Tawang figured centrally in a border war between China and India in 1962.
 Part of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the notion, rightly or wrongly held, that it ousted foreign influence from the country and has tried to reunite fragments of China to return the boundaries of the modern nation to roughly those of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) at its height. That includes Taiwan, Tibet, the western region of Xinjiang and, by China's calculation, Tawang.
 ''In most respects, the People's Republic of China, of course, inherits the fixed boundaries of its predecessor nation-state, the Republic of China, which declared as its territorial boundaries what had been mostly the messy frontiers of the Qing empire,'' Alice Miller, a political scientist and research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in a China discussion forum posting that she agreed to make public. 
 ''Messy'' is the operative word here. In the age of empires, there were no hard and fast borders, whether the imperial rulers were the Ottoman Turks or the Manchus or the Moghuls. The seat of empire had its sphere of influence, radiating outward, with tributary states occupying the borderlands but rarely being governed in the same way as regions within a modern nation today. 
 Trying to define national borders along the contours of an old empire is a daunting task. If, for example, Tibet paid tribute to the Qing emperor at certain points in history, should Tibet be part of modern China? If Tawang did the same with Tibetan rulers in Lhasa, should Tawang be part of modern Tibet? 
 Along with India and Indonesia, China is one of a handful of vast, multiethnic nations that follow the contours of fallen empires. Because of their size and history, all three nations grapple with the same issues: border disputes, ethno-nationalism, occasionally violent movements by disaffected ethnic or religious minorities.
 China is often criticized as handling uprisings harshly in Tibet and Xinjiang, which the country's ethnic Han leaders consider internal issues of sovereignty. But in dealing with its neighbors on territorial issues, China has in the recent past generally sought to settle conflicts through negotiation, scholars say. 
 Since 1949, it has resolved 17 of 23 border disputes, offering concessions in 15 of those instances and, over all, receiving less than half of the contested territory, said M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M.I.T. The compromises have generally come at times of regime instability, when the Communist Party has felt threatened by external or internal forces, he added. 
 The big question, then, is whether Chinese leaders will continue to show flexibility on border issues as China becomes a greater world power, and as it stamps out internal threats.
 China's maritime disputes have proven harder to settle than those on land. In the resource-rich seas to its east and south, China is trying to assert control of various islands -- most notably the Spratly, Paracel and Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands -- that are also claimed in whole or in part by other Asian countries. In March, official Chinese news organizations reported that the government intended to send six more patrol vessels to the South China Sea in the next three to five years.
 Even the United States has run directly afoul of China's maritime border claims: On March 8, five Chinese vessels harassed an American surveillance ship in what Pentagon officials said are international waters. The Chinese insisted that the American ship, the Impeccable, was conducting illegal surveillance in waters under their jurisdiction.
 Dennis C. Blair, the national intelligence director, told Congress that China's general behavior in the South China Sea was ''more military, aggressive, forward-pushing than we saw a couple of years before.''
 This all speaks to how a bolder, brasher China might handle issues of sovereignty and territory, comparisons to Abraham Lincoln notwithstanding.
 ''The biggest unknown is how a stronger China will behave in its outstanding disputes,'' Mr. Fravel said. ''When it has compromised in the past, mostly in disputes on its land border, it was a relatively weak state. The question now becomes: how will a stronger China behave in its remaining territorial disputes over maritime sovereignty and with India?''

HEADLINE: A Recovery For Some

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
President Obama's strongest supporters during the presidential campaign were the young, the black and the poor -- and they are among those who are being hammered unmercifully in this long and cruel economic downturn that the financial elites are telling us is over.
 If the elites are correct, if the Great Recession really is over, then these core supporters of the president are being left far, far behind -- as are blue-collar workers of every ethnic and political persuasion. Nobody wants to talk seriously about class in America, but the elites are smiling and perusing their stock portfolios while the checklist of Americans locked in depressionlike circumstances just grows and grows: construction and manufacturing workers, young men without college degrees (especially young black and Hispanic men), teenagers, and those who were already poor when the recession began. 
 The economic environment for all of these groups is an absolute and utter disaster. 
 Now we're learning that unmarried women are among those being crushed by the epidemic of joblessness. As the Center for American Progress has noted, ''The high unemployment rate of unmarried women, and particularly the 1.3 million unemployed female heads of household who are primary breadwinners for their families, is devastating to their financial circumstances and standard of living.''
 Mr. Obama announced this week that he would convene a jobs summit at the White House next month to explore ways of putting Americans back to work. It remains to be seen whether the summit will yield anything substantial. But it's fair to wonder why the president and his party have not been focused like fanatics on job creation from the first day he took office.
 It was the financial elites who took the economy down, and it was ordinary working people, the longtime natural constituents of the Democratic Party, who were buried in the rubble. Mr. Obama and the Democrats have been unconscionably slow in riding to the rescue of those millions of Americans struggling with the curse of joblessness.
 We've been hearing that there are six unemployed workers for every job opening in the U.S., but even that terrible figure is deceptive. There are 25 unemployed construction workers for every job opening in their field, and more than a dozen for every opening in the durable goods industries, according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston.
 This was not a normal recession, and we are not on the cusp of anything like a normal recovery. The unemployment rate for black Americans is 15.7 percent. The underemployment rate for blacks in September (the latest month for which figures are available) was a gut-wrenching 23.8 percent and for Hispanics an even worse 25.1 percent. The poverty rate for black children is almost 35 percent.
 Wall Street can boast about recovery all it wants, much of America remains trapped in economic hell. 
 It will take a monumental leadership effort by the administration and Congress to spark the kind of changes necessary to transform this wretched employment landscape. Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute has written: ''By itself, the private sector is unable to create jobs in the numbers the United States needs to obtain a robust, full economic recovery.''
 If that's true, and I have long believed it to be the case, then we need to rethink our entire approach to employment. Conventional efforts to kick-start economic growth are dwarfed by the vast scale of the problem. Bold new efforts -- creative efforts -- are needed.
 A recent survey for the policy institute found that one in four families had been hit by a job loss during the past year and 44 percent had suffered either the loss of a job or a reduction in wages or hours worked. Economic insecurity has spread like a debilitating virus through scores of millions of American families. 
 What kind of recovery are we talking about if blue-collar workers, and men and women without college degrees, and large percentages of ethnic minorities and the young and the poor are not part of it? And how can any recovery be sustained if economic insecurity is a permanent feature of even middle-class life?
 The financial elites have flourished in recent decades to a great extent because they have had government on their side, with the politicians working diligently to ensure that rules, regulations and tax policies established an environment in which the elites could thrive. For ordinary Americans, it has been a different story, with jobs shipped overseas by the millions and wages remaining stagnant, with labor unions under constant assault and labor standards weakened, with the safety net shredded and the message sent out to workers everywhere: You're on your own.
 We'll get a chance to see at President Obama's employment summit whether anything much has changed.

HEADLINE: White House Plan on Immigration Includes Legal Status

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
The Obama administration will insist on measures to give legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants as it pushes early next year for legislation to overhaul the immigration system, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Friday.
 In her first major speech on the overhaul, Ms. Napolitano dispelled any suggestion that the administration -- with health care, energy and other major issues crowding its agenda -- would postpone the most contentious piece of immigration legislation until after midterm elections next November. 
 Laying out the administration's bottom line, Ms. Napolitano said officials would argue for a ''three-legged stool'' that includes tougher enforcement laws against illegal immigrants and employers who hire them and a streamlined system for legal immigration, as well as a ''tough and fair pathway to earned legal status.'' 
 With unemployment surging over 10 percent and Congress still wrangling over health care, advocates on all sides of the immigration debate had begun to doubt that President Obama would keep his pledge to tackle the divisive illegal immigration issue in the first months of 2010. 
 Speaking at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group in Washington, Ms. Napolitano unveiled a double-barrel argument for a legalization program, saying it would enhance national security and, as the economy climbs out of recession, protect American workers from unfair competition from lower-paid, easily exploited illegal immigrants. 
 ''Let me emphasize this: we will never have fully effective law enforcement or national security as long as so many millions remain in the shadows,'' she said, adding that the recovering economy would be strengthened ''as these immigrants become full-paying taxpayers.''
 Under the administration's plan, illegal immigrants who hope to gain legal status would have to register, pay fines and all taxes they owe, pass a criminal background check and learn English. 
 Drawing a contrast with 2007, when a bill with legalization provisions offered by President George W. Bush failed in Congress, Ms. Napolitano said the Obama administration had achieved a ''fundamental change'' in border security and enforcement against employers hiring illegal immigrants. She said a sharp reduction in the flow of illegal immigrants into the country created an opportunity to move ahead with a legalization program. 
 Some Republicans were quick to challenge Ms. Napolitano's claims that border security had significantly improved or that American workers would be helped by bringing illegal immigrants into the system. 
 ''How can they claim that enforcement is done when there are more than 400 open miles of border with Mexico?'' asked Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. He said the administration should ''deport illegal immigrant workers so they don't remain here to compete with citizen and legal immigrant job seekers.'' 
 But Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the top Republican on the Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, agreed that it was time to open the immigration debate. ''My commitment to immigration reform has not changed,'' he said in a statement Friday. ''I am interested in seeing a proposal sooner rather than later from President Obama.'' 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the chairman of that subcommittee, has been writing an overhaul bill and consulting with Republicans, particularly Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Mr. Schumer said that the administration's agenda was ''ambitious,'' but that he was ''confident we can have a bipartisan immigration bill ready to go under whatever timeline the president thinks is best.''
 Ms. Napolitano has been leading the administration's efforts to gather ideas and support for the immigration overhaul, meeting in recent weeks with business leaders, religious groups, law enforcement officials and others to gauge their willingness to go forward with a debate in Congress. 
 Framing the administration's proposals in stark law and order terms, she said immigration legislation should include tougher laws against migrant smugglers and more severe sanctions for employers who hire unauthorized workers. 
 Ms. Napolitano said that the Border Patrol had grown by 20,000 officers and that more than 600 miles of border fence had been finished, meeting security benchmarks set by Congress in 2007. She was echoing an argument adopted by Mr. Bush after the bill collapsed in 2007, and by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in his race against Mr. Obama. They said Americans wanted to see effective enforcement before they would agree to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants. 
 Some immigrant advocates were dismayed by Ms. Napolitano's approach. Benjamin E. Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Council, praised her package of proposals, but said some enforcement policies she outlined ''have proven to do more harm than good.''

HEADLINE: Obama Walks a Delicate Tightrope On His 1st Trip to China as President

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of a tentative global recovery, President Obama and China's leaders will meet in Beijing next week to discuss how to improve relations between the world's reigning economic superpower and its greatest challenger.
 Among the most contentious issues will be currency. Washington believes China's currency, the renminbi, is undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage. Beijing worries that the dollar is depreciating too quickly, threatening to erode the value of China's huge holdings of United States Treasury bills.
 During meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, President Obama is expected to press Beijing to allow its currency to rise, ending an effective peg to the dollar. 
 President Hu Jintao of China is expected to politely decline, insisting that exchange rate reform will come in due time. 
 Instead, as China has increasingly done publicly, he will suggest that Washington get its fiscal house in order and control its ballooning debt.
 ''This currency issue feeds into domestic politics in both countries,'' says Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''President Obama needs to bring up the issue. But the problem is he has few levers.''
 Many analysts say China will move to a more flexible currency, just not now.
 Beijing, they say, is already convinced that exchange rate reform offers benefits. It would, for example, give the government greater control over monetary policy.
 It also would lower the cost of imports, help restructure the Chinese economy, and aid it in building a consumer-oriented economy rather than one so heavily dependent on exports.
 ''It's time for China to make structural adjustments and move out of low-value-added, heavily polluting industries,'' says Fred Hu, a managing director at Goldman Sachs.
 Still, analysts say currency appreciation won't occur to any significant degree until the middle of next year, largely because too many jobs are at stake. But China's hand could be forced if the dollar continued to decline against other major currencies, dragging the Chinese currency down with it and making China's exports even more competitive, says Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 Governments in Asia, Latin America and the European Union are already alarmed by the cheap renminbi and say it is hurting domestic manufacturers.
 President Obama's first trip to China comes at a time when United States unemployment is at a 26-year high. American labor unions, one of the president's major constituencies, are pressing for sanctions against China. While the administration has tried to maintain a hard-nosed but civil stance toward China, it has also slapped Beijing with sanctions that the Bush administration chose to eschew.
 But even Mr. Hu, head of a nominally communist nation, faces challenges at home. Although China's economy is growing at a robust 8 percent, and according to many economists, leading the world out of recovery, China's exports have plummeted by more than 20 percent this year and at least 20 million factory jobs have been lost in the coastal provinces.
 Beijing doesn't want to bring more harm to its huge migrant work force by letting the renminbi rise and with it the cost of Chinese goods aboard.
 Also, China's leaders generally don't like to appear to be bending to pressure from the West.
 Washington's strongest levers to move Beijing -- the threat of sanctions -- could backfire, analysts say, stoking trade wars and perhaps leading China to slow its purchases of United States Treasury bills. Such an action alone could lead to a run on the world's reserve currency.
 ''This is the power the Chinese have right now,'' says Mr. Prasad at Brookings.
 The Obama administration seems to recognize how delicate the situation has become. Since taking office, Mr. Obama has been reluctant to publicly assail China on its currency.
 Indeed, in its report to Congress last month, the Treasury department declined to cite China as a currency manipulator, which, under the law, could lead to trade sanctions. 
 Recently, the administration has signaled a tougher approach by imposing punitive tariffs against Chinese tires and steel pipes. 
 There is common agreement, though, on some of the most pressing challenges facing the two countries.
 The United States and China seem to agree that global imbalances pose a serious threat to economic stability, and that each nation must change course.
 Americans need to save more and China needs to consume more, and restructure its economy in a way that will prevent it from building up huge trade surpluses and then accumulating huge foreign exchange reserves.
 Richard Portes, who teaches economics at the London Business School, says this was at the heart of the global economic collapse.
 But moving to a more flexible exchange rate in China is one of the instruments that many analysts say is necessary to get there.
 Some progress has already been made, experts say, because of slowing demand for imports and Chinese efforts to bolster consumption.
 Weijian Shan, a partner at TPG Capital, the investment firm, says it is in China's best interest to make its exchange rate more flexible and to push ahead with reforms that can help eliminate imbalances within its own economy.
 He says China's economy is too heavily focused on fixed-asset investments and exports. Raising the value of the Chinese currency should discourage exports and encourage a move toward domestic consumption and the creation of higher-value goods.
 ''Revaluation in an orderly way is good for China,'' Mr. Shan says. ''America doesn't need to put pressure. China knows about it. And in my view it's going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Russian Deal Not a Deal Yet

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Clifford J. Levy contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When he met President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia in April, President Obama sought to open an important new supply corridor for Afghanistan by flying American troops and weapons through Russian airspace. Visiting Moscow in July, he sealed a deal for as many as 4,500 flights a year, in what he called a ''substantial contribution'' to the war and a sign of improving relations with Russia.
 Seven months after the idea was raised and four months after the agreement was signed, the number of American flights that have actually traversed Russian airspace? 
 One. And that was for show.
 The failure so far to translate words into reality amid bureaucratic delays, including one involving a Russian agency insisting on charging air navigation fees that the Kremlin had said would be waived, underscores the challenges of Mr. Obama's effort to transform ties between Washington and Moscow. For all of the lofty sentiments expressed at high-profile summit meetings, actual change has never been easy to deliver.
 The need to break through the logjam will soon take on fresh urgency if Mr. Obama decides to deploy tens of thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan. For eight years, the American military has struggled to find and maintain reliable supply routes into Afghanistan, but Mr. Obama may send more troops in a single order than at any point in the war, straining the system.
 Because of the difficulties in getting supplies to Afghanistan through Pakistan, the new Russian air corridor ''would be fairly important,'' said Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy. ''This doesn't answer the question of how much we'll be able to rely on the Russian connection, and that will be a big part of how much of a difference it can make.''
 Anthony H. Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who has advised Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, said the United States ''needs as many options as it can get'' to send troops and equipment.
 ''There is no way to predict how reliable any given route will be during a war that seems nearly certain to last for three to four more years,'' he said. ''There is no way to guarantee Pakistani stability, and almost any major base could be the subject of a large-scale Taliban bombing. The U.S. can live without a Russian option, but it would be much better off with one.''
 The uncertainty comes at a tenuous moment in Russian-American relations, as Mr. Obama seeks more support from the Kremlin in pressing Iran to scale back its nuclear program, and as the United States and Russia race to agree on a new nuclear arms treaty before the current one expires Dec. 5.
 The problems with opening the air corridor as part of a so-called northern distribution network stem from a variety of technical issues that American officials are working to resolve, among them a dispute over who will pay. Under the pact that Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev sealed in July, the Russians agreed to waive air navigation fees typically charged for right of passage and air traffic control. 
 American officials said the new route would save $133 million a year in fuel, maintenance and other costs. But the Russian agency that collects the navigation fees has so far refused to exempt the Americans.
 The Obama administration is sending a technical team to Moscow to try to work out what standards should apply to the flights, and spokesmen for the two governments played down the problem. 
 ''We are working through procedural delays on the Russian side and hope to begin regular flights soon,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary.
 Aleksei Pavlov, a spokesman for Mr. Medvedev, said the Kremlin had every intention of fulfilling the agreement. ''We are eager to resolve this issue in the nearest future,'' he said. 
 But such seemingly minor complications have bollixed Russian-American agreements before. President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsinagreed in 1998 to open a joint early warning center in Moscow, where Russian and American personnel would work side by side to detect missile launches and avoid misunderstandings that could lead to accidental war. 
 Their successors renewed the agreement, but the center has been delayed for 11 years amid disputes over issues like construction liability. Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev vowed to try again last summer, but in the latest holdup, the Russians have delayed allowing American inspectors into the country to examine the still unopened facility.
 The idea of sending American forces through Russia to a war zone is fraught with a complicated history and mutual suspicion. For years, the idea was out of the question. Then in 2008, Russia agreed to open a land corridor, but only for nonlethal supplies. 
 The agreement to allow American troops and weapons to fly over the territory of Russia, its onetime cold war enemy, was seen as a symbolic breakthrough as much as a logistical one, and administration officials argued that it was a triumph even if no planes actually ever used the route. Still, just as some people in Moscow appear apprehensive about American forces in their airspace, some American officials are wary of putting too much faith in the Russians, who could easily close down the corridor if political tension rises again. 
 The latest transit agreement formally went into effect Sept. 4. A week later, the Pentagon sent Moscow a general description of cargo and personnel that would be shipped under the agreement, as well as the regular destinations of the planes, according to an administration official. The Russians accepted the request, and the two sides arranged for a single test flight on Oct. 8, just before Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Moscow.
 But the dispute over the air transit fees has yet to be solved, complicated by whether the planes used will be American military craft or contracted civilian planes. Moreover, the American side is still working to amend its overflight agreements with Poland and Kazakhstan so the flights can traverse those countries as well.
 Administration officials said that they remained confident these issues could be worked out, and that they had requested a second test flight to try to advance the program. They said that they did not expect Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev to talk about the issue when the presidents meet in Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, but that they hoped to resolve it at lower levels.

HEADLINE: J.C. Penney Raises Sales Outlook; Abercrombie & Fitch Looks Overseas for Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
J. C. Penney Company, the department store retailer, reported a 78 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings on Friday, in part because of an expense for its pension plan. 
 The company upgraded its profit and sales outlook, however, because it is selling more goods at regular prices and doing less clearance discounting, though sales remain weak.
 The increases got investors' attention, driving the stock up $1.51, or 5.1 percent.
 The retailer, which is based in Plano, Tex., said Friday that it earned $27 million, or 11 cents a share, for the period ended Oct. 31. That compared with $124 million, or 56 cents a share, a year ago.
 The third-quarter results included a charge of $73 million, or 19 cents a share, to write down the value of the company's pension plan assets. Excluding that impact, adjusted income from continuing operations was $72 million, or 30 cents a share. That was down from $103 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago, excluding a pension plan benefit.
 Revenue was down 3.2 percent to $4.18 billion, from $4.32 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 12 cents a share on revenue of $4.18 billion.
 Sales at stores opened at least a year, a crucial indicator, fell 4.6 percent in the quarter.
 Like other retailers, Penney has been cutting inventory in response to tepid spending. It also has been expanding its assortment of exclusive brands. 
 In other earnings on Friday, the preppy clothing seller Abercrombie & Fitch said that it would add new items at lower prices and continue expanding internationally -- where sales are stronger than the United States -- to combat declining profit.
 The company reported Friday that its third-quarter profit fell 39 percent, but that was less than expected. Revenue fell 15 percent.
 Abercrombie & Fitch's sales have slumped, and it has lost market share to lower-priced competitors like Aeropostale as it kept prices high and invested abroad during the recession.
 In recent quarters it has bowed to the recession and begun marking down items, but the chief executive, Michael S. Jeffries, said Friday that the company planned to add lower-priced inventory in the first quarter, rather than relying on markdowns that he said might hurt its image.
 Profit in the quarter fell to $38.8 million, or 44 cents a share, or 30 cents a share excluding one-time items. That beat the average expectation of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share.
 Revenue fell to $765.4 million, squeaking past analyst expectations of $764.5 million. Expenses fell 16 percent.
 Sales in stores open at least a year, a crucial measure of a retailer's health, dropped 22 percent.

HEADLINE: Kingston: Trading Beach Chairs for Bar Stools

BYLINE: By BAZ DREISINGER

 BODY:
Correction Appended
IT was a steamy Saturday night in Kingston, Jamaica, and the Sky Bar was jammed with its usual weekend crowd: professionals in their 20s and 30s, by all appearances fit for the next flight to South Beach. Ladies in strappy stilettos and sundresses mixed with men in jeans and crisp blazers while the R & B-heavy soundtrack veered from Stevie Wonder to Ne-Yo and Kanye West.
I'd positioned myself on a red barstool beside the mosaic-tiled infinity pool. At the table beside me, two South American business travelers, ties loosened, were tearing into a plate of jerk chicken and drinking Red Stripes. It seemed almost quaint. I ordered a more trendy combination: one dirty martini and one sushi roll made with smoked marlin and ackee, Jamaica's butter-textured national fruit. I chatted with the locals about business and politics, drank in the dramatic vista of the Blue Mountains and relished a muted symphony of car horns, reggae snippets and animated chitchat emerging from the sweeping boulevard below. 
If this scene seems to defy the prevailing image of Kingston, it isn't the only one. These days Kingston is filled with stereotype-busting options for travelers looking for a new, more authentic Jamaican experience. At Pure -- a new, gleaming white lounge with chiffon draperies and V.I.P. skyboxes -- techno music trumps reggae. At the newly opened 107-room Spanish Court Hotel, home of the Sky Bar, the lobby makes one wonder if SoHo has been transported to the Caribbean. Exit wicker and florals; enter bean-shaped white leather sofas, animal-print accents and jatoba-wood floors.
For most travelers, of course, Kingston stereotypes are irrelevant. They would no sooner consider vacationing there than they would in, say, the Gaza Strip. Gang-related violence has plagued Kingston's so-called garrison communities since the 1970s, and the country's high murder rate, though it almost never affects tourists, is a potent deterrent. So is the very urban-ness of the place, which stubbornly refuses to allow for beach chairs, umbrella drinks or ''Jamaica, Mon'' T-shirts.
But new developments, high-end amenities and a cosmopolitan vibe are poised to change Kingston's public face -- and to drive home a point: bypassing Jamaica's vibrant, culturally rich, music-soaked capital city is like taking a grand tour of America and skipping New York.
The Jamaican government is invested in making that point, having begun a 10-year revitalization plan last year for a place that, with upward of 700,000 residents, is the largest English-speaking city in the Americas south of Miami. The current makeover has its roots in the 1960s, when a developing reggae industry offered the potential for revenue that, civic leaders feared, would be undermined by the city's urban blight. Renovations were slow to be made, though, so the 2008 Urban Development Corporation plan is far-reaching. Development incentive packages and public investment programs are scheduled to produce new government buildings, a 200-room hotel and conference center and a number of city parks, among other things.
Thus far, many of the city's noteworthy new offerings, including Pure and the Spanish Court, are in tourist-friendly New Kingston, a triangular area whose skyscrapers and strip-mall-like boulevards have the feel of Anycity, U.S.A. Surrounding New Kingston, the city is divided, broadly speaking, into ''uptown'' and ''downtown,'' which are not so much indicators of geography as of class.
Like Los Angeles, Kingston is a car-friendly sprawl where the wealth gap is baldly visible. Just as one could spend years in Los Angeles and never set car tire in Watts, one can easily visit Kingston, stay in one of many neighborhoods uptown and leave thinking the city consists of palatial residences and suburban serenity.
Uniting uptown and downtown, though, is music. Kingston has been called the nerve center of Jamaica; really, it's the country's D.J. booth. Ever-evolving trends in reggae and dancehall, reggae's digitized contemporary incarnation, are born in the abundant studios and street dances of Kingston, where the week is parceled into parties with regular monikers like Early Mondays, Boasy Tuesdays, Weddy Weddy Wednesdays and so on.
People from uptown venture to rough-and-tumble areas for these weekly dances, which can confound even the most jaded traveler: they require little or no cover charge; they are not designed for tourist consumption; and they are only minimally intended for capitalist gain. They are -- dare I say it? -- pure, uncommercial homage to music and dance.
It's an homage that Jamaicans take seriously, which is why new night-life options are the most prominent feature of Kingston's makeover. ''The economy has provoked Jamaicans living overseas to move back home, and their taste is of a high caliber,'' said Ard Zuar, a Kingstonian entrepreneur. ''They're bringing new, sophisticated products to the marketplace, and they're willing to invest in them.''
Mr. Zuar is part owner of one of these new ''products'': Fiction Lounge, a Kingston nightclub that is so trendy I could barely talk my way past the bouncer on one particularly crammed night and came face-to-face with the Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt on another. Mr. Zuar's design company, Zuar Ltd., built Fiction as what he described as ''a hybrid space: one location catering to multiple demographics.''
On the main dance floor, futuristic murals and oversize chandeliers indulge a pop-culture aesthetic; the adjacent Johnny Walker Lounge caters to more mature (i.e. sober) patrons. Once a month Fiction hosts unplugged performances featuring old- and new-school Jamaican musicians. Oh, and nonreggae thrives there, too: Wednesdays spotlight world beat and electronica, and on one late-night visit I found myself dancing, curiously enough, to Coldplay.
''In many countries, entertainment options increase during tough times,'' Carleene Samuels, a Jamaican film producer, yoga enthusiast and Fiction regular, told me. ''So with music being Jamaica's main way of coping with stress and tension, Kingston really rocks, maybe more than ever.''
Like so much in Kingston, eating entails a choice between extremes -- from fish heads to oxtails.
To fully indulge try the new Truck Stop Grill and Bar, Jamaica's take on Texas, complete with electric blue cocktails and indoor-outdoor seating on wooden barrels. Though the menu is an unofficial homage to Jamaican street food, which means plenty of jerk -- pork, chicken, or lobster rubbed with spices and cooked over a wood fire -- there are grilled fish options, too.
On the other side of the spectrum are the many ital restaurants that adhere to the Rastafarian dietary laws (no meat, fish or salt). One of them, Ashanti Oasis, lives up to its name: it is on a veranda along the manicured lawns of Hope Gardens, the largest botanical gardens in the West Indies. There are plenty of delights, including sweet-and-sour soy meatballs, curried chickpeas, fried brown rice and fresh mango juice.
You'll feel guilty if you don't pay homage to the man who made Jamaica a brand name, so visit the Bob Marley Museum, in the clapboard house where he lived and recorded until he died. Kingston's waterfront downtown area also has its share of historic buildings and museums. Worth a visit is the multimedia exhibition inside the restored Liberty Hall, former home to the Kingston division of Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association.
There are plenty of options for shopping. Clock some time at the Cooyah shop -- the label that calls itself ''the official reggae brand,'' and sells summer gear in the bright colors of the Jamaican flag (yellow, black and green) and the Rastafarian movement (red, gold and green). I bought a pair of flats that are sexier than stilettos at the organic-chic Bridget Sandals store, a center of locally made footwear that Caribbean fashionistas swear by.
And when the sun-and-sand itch kicks in, it's only a 35-minute drive to Hellshire Beach, which is certainly not the tourist beach haven of Negril but makes up for it in other ways. Throngs of city folk co-opt the scene on weekends, and at stall after stall delectably fresh fish is served in brown stew with bammy, a kind of yuca cake. There are no umbrella drinks, but after a few glasses of Appleton rum, you won't miss them.
REGGAE ISN'T THE ONLY VOICE IN TOWN
HOW TO GET THERE
A number of airlines serve Kingston from North America, including Air Jamaica, American and JetBlue. An online search for nonstop flights from New York in late November found the lowest fares at around $360.
WHERE TO STAY
The big hotels are in New Kingston. The Spanish Court Hotel (1 St. Lucia Avenue; 876-926-0000; www.spanishcourthotel.com; starting at $125) is sleek and chic. The 303-room Hilton Kingston (77 Knutsford Blouvard; 876-926-5430; www.hiltoncaribbean.com/kingston; from $149) delivers the pros and cons of a big chain hotel, though its bar and pool area is a lively scene.
WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK
Night or day, you can eat well and quickly in Kingston. Vendors selling jerk chicken dot the streets, and some chains like Island Grill give fast food a good name. Ashanti Oasis (Old Hope Road; 876-970-2079) is an ital delight in Hope Gardens. The food and arts scene at Redbones, the Blues Cafe (21 Braemar Avenue; 876-978-6091; www.redbonesbluescafe.com) are worth sampling. The Truck Stop Grill and Bar (18 West Kings House Road; 876-631-0841; www.truckstopjamaica.com) sells jerk meats and funky drinks.
To experience the new face of Kingston's night life, visit the Fiction Lounge (67 Constant Spring Road; 876-631-8038; www.fictionloungeja.com) and, in New Kingston, Pure/Plush Lounge (18 Trinidad Terrace; www.pureplushja.com) and the Quad Nightclub (20-22 Trinidad Terrace; 876-754-7823).
WHAT TO DO
The Bob Marley Museum (56 Hope Road; 876-927-9152; www.bobmarley-foundation.com/museum.html).
Liberty Hall (76 King Street; 876-948-8639; www.garveylibertyhall.com).
The National Gallery of Jamaica (Kingston Mall; www.aboutgalleryjamaica.org) houses a lovely collection of Jamaican art.
Correction: November 15, 2009
A listing on Page 9 this weekend with an article about Kingston, Jamaica, erroneously includes two specialties among those offered by Island Grill, a street vendor. While Island Grill serves such items as jerk chicken and curry chicken, it does not offer goat and oxtail.

HEADLINE: Moved for the Space; Stayed for the Food

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE house that Michael and Lori Hiller planned to buy in South Park Slope, Brooklyn, was a good size for the neighborhood, and on a pleasant block. But then a problem developed with the building's certificate of occupancy.
Since Mrs. Hiller had been the bigger fan of Park Slope, it was Mr. Hiller who had more zest for a new search. He found himself smitten by Ditmas Park, a leafy area of Victorian houses, south of Prospect Park. Eventually, he struck gold, with a 4,000-square-foot six-bedroom house with a finished basement, a backyard and a four-car driveway.
The Hillers saw it on a Sunday, made an offer on Tuesday, and were in contract by week's end. They paid $1.26 million -- $10,000 less than they had planned to pay for the house in Park Slope, which was about half the size.
A year and a half later, Mr. Hiller said, they are thrilled, partly for the reasons people have always liked Ditmas Park: the grand Victorians, the trees, the big yards and the suburban atmosphere. ''It's just such a great thing to come home and see your kids outside playing,'' he said. 
But some of what keeps the Hillers excited about the neighborhood is new. In recent years, a string of popular restaurants have opened on Cortelyou Road, the main business district. These places, among them the Farm on Adderley, Mimi's Hummus and a pioneering cafe called Vox Pop, have drawn visitors to what Time Out New York calls one of the city's best neighborhoods for food.
And not only prepared foods, it turns out: the Flatbush Food Co-op, a fixture on Cortelyou, is thriving after its 2008 move into a larger space, and a Sunday farmers' market is also doing well.
Brokers say that word of mouth has made a difference. ''They read about it and they say, 'Well, where is that neighborhood?' '' said Mary Kay Gallagher, a broker who specializes in the area's Victorian houses, and who sold the Hillers their house. ''And then they go on the Internet, and they find me.''
Web surfers also find a dedicated blog, ditmaspark.blogspot.com, and an Internet group, the Flatbush Family Network, for area parents.
One result of all the change has been a reinvigorated co-op market, according to Jan Rosenberg, a real estate broker at Brooklyn Hearth Realty.
Stefanie Zadravec, a playwright, moved with her husband, Michael McWatters, a freelance Web designer, to a large two-bedroom on Argyle Road days after giving birth to twins. The giant houses are out of their price range, she said, but are wonderful to look at.
She had lived in Chelsea, in Manhattan, since 1991, but says her family's new place is bigger than they ever could have afforded there. Also, out on the street, she is constantly running into friends. ''They're the kind of people I had stopped meeting in Manhattan,'' Ms. Zadravec said.
Through all the change, residents say, the vibes remain positive. ''The older residents of the neighborhood are very excited about the young people who have moved into the neighborhood,'' said Alvin M. Berk, the chairman of Community Board 14, which covers the area. ''It brings the neighborhood vitality. Everybody loves looking at beautiful babies in a baby carriage.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Ditmas Park is a relatively narrow landmark district bounded by Dorchester Road to the north, Ocean Avenue to the east, Newkirk Avenue to the south and East 16th Street to the west. Yet when most nonpurists refer to Ditmas Park, they are talking about a wider chunk of Victorian Flatbush -- stretching north to Beverley Road, west to Coney Island Avenue and east to Ocean Avenue -- that includes the subsections Ditmas Park West, Beverley Square East and Beverley Square West.
What these sections all have in common, besides the loosely applied Ditmas Park name, is Cortelyou Road.
''One of the exciting things for me about Cortelyou developing is that it holds together a lot,'' said Ms. Rosenberg, also a founder of the civic group Friends of Cortelyou. ''People think of it as the heart of the neighborhood.''
Many of the area's co-op buildings are concentrated in the blocks immediately south of Cortelyou. The grander houses, mostly single-family, with five or six bedrooms, stretch to the north and south on streets with Anglophile names like Marlborough, Argyle and Westminster. Much of the area was rezoned this summer, Mr. Berk said, to curb out-of-scale construction that had begun to creep up on the area's western edge near Coney Island Avenue.
In the interior are a few new buildings, but most of the co-op and rental buildings are decades old, some prewar. The blocks full of houses, with their front porches, large yards and driveways, could easily be mistaken for some other, less urban place. Ms. Rosenberg, who has shown the neighborhood to countless newcomers, has heard comparisons to Pittsburgh or Minneapolis.
''What they're saying is, 'Gee, it doesn't really feel like New York,' '' she said. ''And it doesn't. For a lot of people it feels like home.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
When Ms. Gallagher used to talk about Victorian house prices early this decade, she spoke of the approach to the million-dollar mark. That barrier has long since been leapfrogged, and prices for Victorians are now routinely $900,000 and up, she said.
Still, Aviva Sucher, a broker at Brooklyn Dwellings, says that in the softer economy, there are relative bargains.
''There are houses as low as $800,000,'' she said. ''We haven't seen these kinds of numbers in, I'd say, well over 10 years. Right now, there are very well-priced homes for buyers who would not have been able to come into the area.''
For co-ops, Ms. Rosenberg said buyers should expect to pay $250,000 to $320,000 for a one-bedroom -- occasionally less. Two-bedrooms, she said, range from around $300,000 to $450,000 for very large units like Ms. Zadravec's, which also includes an office. There are almost no three-bedroom co-ops, Ms. Rosenberg said, and few condos of any size.
Rentals can be hard to come by. Units in detached houses are priced unpredictably, with some sprawling apartments over $2,000 a month, and tighter attic spaces well below that. In apartment buildings, one-bedrooms rent for around $1,400, while two-bedrooms are in the $1,700 range.
THE SCHOOLS
There are two public elementary schools. Public School 139, on Rugby Road just north of Cortelyou, has around 1,100 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade. It received an A on its most recent city progress report, with 68.1 percent of students meeting standards in English language arts and 88.8 percent in math. P.S. 217 on Newkirk Avenue also serves prekindergarten through fifth grade, and has around 1,200 students. It, too, got an A on its progress report, with 76.9 percent of students meeting standards in language arts and 94.1 percent in math.
Mr. Berk said both schools had so far been able to accommodate their swelling numbers, although P.S. 217 had to build an annex. Both, he said, have active parents' associations.
The neighborhood's middle-schoolers attend Junior High School 62, which has around 1,100 students, on Cortelyou Road in nearby Kensington. The school received an A on its city progress report, with 59.1 percent testing at or above grade level in language arts, and 70.3 percent in math.
A nearby high school, Midwood High, is a few blocks south of the neighborhood at Brooklyn College. The former Erasmus Hall High School, which was broken up into four smaller schools in 1994, is a few blocks north of the neighborhood on Flatbush Avenue.
WHAT TO DO
Neighborhood life is sedate and suburban. The Parade Grounds at the southern tip ofProspect Park are within walking distance, as is the park's running and cycling loop. At night, the restaurants on Cortelyou -- and off, in the case of Pomme de Terre, a newer place on Newkirk Avenue -- are popular destinations. Residents trade gossip on just-opened and soon-to-open restaurants and bars, and on Sundays head to the farmers' market and playground.
It gives Cortelyou Road a ''village square feel on Sunday morning,'' Mr. Berk said. ''People get together and meet each other and buy rutabaga.''
THE COMMUTE
The Q train runs through the middle of the neighborhood, stopping at Beverley Road, Cortelyou Road and Newkirk Avenue. The B train, which runs express through Brooklyn, also stops at Newkirk. The Q becomes an express train once it enters Manhattan, making the trip into Midtown a relatively quick one, considering the distance. If you time the trains right, Mr. Hiller said, you can be there in half an hour.
THE HISTORY
Ditmas Park, like the rest of Victorian Flatbush, was developed early in the 20th century. In 1908, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City, the Ditmas Park Association was formed, and enacted zoning to preserve the neighborhood. The Ditmas Park Historic District was created in the 1980s.

HEADLINE: Loan Ceiling Extended

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
BUYERS of homes in high-priced markets have some reason to cheer: the federal government recently extended through 2010 the maximum dollar amount for ''conforming loans.'' This will probably mean better options for borrowers who might otherwise have had to take out ''jumbo'' mortgages.
 Conforming loans meet all the guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled agencies that resell packages of loans to investors, and are therefore eligible for purchase by these agencies. Jumbo mortgages, issued in amounts above the government's maximum, are nonconforming. Because lenders assume less risk in making conforming loans, the interest rates are usually lower. 
 For much of the past two years, the government has, through Fannie and Freddie, agreed to buy mortgages of $729,500 or less for properties in high-cost housing areas like Manhattan and parts of northern New Jersey. That ceiling had been scheduled to be lowered to $625,500 at the end of this year, but last month Congress extended the higher limit through the end of 2010.
 Alan Rosenbaum, the chief executive of the Guardhill Financial Corporation in Manhattan, said the extension would have important implications for those in New York City and many suburbs that are designated as high-cost areas.
 ''A lot of people have been sitting on their hands for the past month, waiting to see which way this would go,'' he said. 
 Mr. Rosenbaum said that prospective buyers had also been waiting to see if the government would extend the federal home buyer tax credit past its Nov. 30 deadline, and it did so earlier this month. The extension of the higher conforming loan limit and the home buyer tax credit ''will help our market maintain its momentum,'' he said.
 In early November, Mr. Rosenbaum said, lenders in the region were charging rates of just under 5 percent, on average, for 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages of less than $417,000. That dollar amount was previously the limit for conforming loans, and it is still used as an industry benchmark for lower-risk loans.
 For mortgages of $417,000 to $729,500, the rates were about 5.25 percent, reflecting the slightly higher risk associated with such loans. Jumbo loans -- mortgages above $729,500 -- carried average rates of about 5.7 percent, Mr. Rosenbaum said. 
 In some cases, jumbo borrowers were also required to come up with higher down payments and to maintain higher cash reserves. And some lenders refused to offer jumbo loans on co-ops or condominiums that are not at least 75 percent occupied.
 David Adamo, the chief executive of Luxury Mortgage in Stamford, Conn., said the extension of the loan limit was another sign of improving conditions for New York's jumbo borrowers. 
 By fortifying the market for loans below $729,500, he said, the government is also helping to stabilize demand for more expensive homes. ''I'm much more confident in making million-dollar loans in New York now,'' Mr. Adamo said.
 That confidence all but disappeared from the market after the mortgage and real estate industries faltered in early 2007. In 2006, lenders issued just under $500 billion of jumbo mortgages; last year, that figure dropped nearly $100 billion, Mr. Adamo said, citing data from Inside MBS & ABS, a trade publication.
 Mr. Adamo said that jumbo loans could become less expensive in the coming months, if investor demand for mortgage-backed securities increased. 
 For nearly three years, he noted, jumbo mortgages were significantly pricier than conforming loans, and there was little demand for them from investors. But in recent months, he said, more lenders have sought to buy jumbo loans from him as investments.
 ''More participants in the market means we'll see more product availability, which will bring down the pricing,'' Mr. Adamo said. ''We're seeing some very positive signs.''

HEADLINE: Never Too Old To Act Young

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A JUGGLER on a unicycle wobbles past a cluster of clubgoers, deftly avoiding a collision that might spill their candy-color cocktails down the front of premium-label jeans. A clown on stilts hobbles past a table full of neatly coiffed men with untucked dress shirts who don't even look up from their drinks. It's hard enough to project an air of unwavering cool at New York nightclubs. It's even harder to do so in the presence of a clown. 
 But Carnival at Bowlmor Lanes, which opened last month on University Place, is not just any club; it owes more to the memory of P. T. Barnum than Steve Rubell. With 16,000 square feet of wire walkers, sword swallowers and Coney Island-style games like ring toss and goldfish pong, it's a working carnival within the confines of a nightclub. 
 At this carnival, however, you wash down corn dogs with $14 blue-cotton-candy martinis, and the carnies barking out ''Step right up, folks'' look more like recent N.Y.U. sociology graduates than ex-cons.
 ''It's like a cross between Circus Circus and the Boardwalk at the Jersey Shore,'' said Rudy Temiz, 31, an electronics retailer who had just won two goldfish and three plush toys, and was enjoying a drink with a friend.
 At first glance, such a splashy approach to after-hours fun seems at odds with the recessionary era in night life, where conventional wisdom has it that low-key is the new black. But with its emphasis on participatory fun, Carnival at Bowlmor Lanes is keeping with the move toward interactive night life.
 Nightcrawlers who are weary of Club Row haunts offering little more than $400 bottle service and tedious electronica beats often drop the attitude -- well, some of it -- and settle in for a night of table tennis among the celebrities at SPiN New York (co-owned by Susan Sarandon) in the Flatiron district, martini-fueled gutterballs at Lucky Strike Lanes & Lounge on West 42nd or miniature golf in a foursome of plaid-shirt types at Bushwick Country Club in Brooklyn. (Carnival's proprietor, Tom Shannon, was an early adopter. His Bowlmor Lanes bowling alley one floor below has been a magnet for trendy young clubbers for years.) 
 Particularly in lean times, the thinking goes, people have little patience with velvet ropes and bottles of Grey Goose. What they want is escapism. 
 ''It's the perfect club for this economy,'' said Candice Spano, 23, a hairdresser from Staten Island. ''The standard club is everyone sitting around talking and you can't even hear each other,'' she said. ''Here, you don't have to entertain each other. Here, you get entertained.'' 
 Jack Anteby, 28, a wholesale jeweler from Brooklyn, certainly seemed to be. Surrounded by friends, he fired a fastball into a target a dozen feet away in the ''Get Tanked'' booth. Steee-rike! A lever swung, a trap door opened and a female employee in shorts and a T-shirt plunged into a tank of water. Mr. Anteby raised a fist in triumph. ''I'm the only one who's hit it, with at least 60 balls thrown!'' he crowed.
 His wife, Doris Anteby, said that her husband's favorite place was the Seaside Heights Boardwalk in New Jersey, and he had been pestering her to come to the club since it opened. ''He's almost 30, but he acts 10,'' she said.
 At Carnival that seems to be the point.

HEADLINE: A Gallery Gadfly Revives His Act

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
ONE drizzly Friday night last month dozens of people had crowded into Invisible-Exports, a gallery on Orchard Street, to celebrate the opening of a show by the conceptual artist Stephen Irwin. Works on paper lined the long, hallwaylike space, starting out with white Minimalist abstractions by the front windows and progressing to more figurative imagery at the back. 
 Somewhere in the middle stood the artist himself, explaining his work to Cathy Lebowitz, the longtime reviews editor at Art in America magazine. ''I work with '60s through '80s porn,'' he said earnestly, pointing to a piece on the wall, as Ms. Lebowitz nodded solemnly. ''I'm always trying to isolate the significant gesture in the page.'' 
 At one point a burly silver-haired man, trailed by a 20-something woman with a video camera, thrust a mike between them. 
 ''Oh, no,'' the man interjected in a languid drawl. ''This is like that 'Seinfeld' episode where they were all trying to figure out what was going on in that invisible picture that you could only see if you squinted your eyes a certain way.'' As the camcorder ran, another woman in her 20s snapped still photographs. 
 Yes, the filmmaker Paul Hasegawa-Overacker, a k a Paul H-O, was at it again, provoking people, and preserving the resulting exchanges for posterity, on his show ''Gallery Beat.'' 
 The program, a long-running gonzo video tour of the New York gallery scene, was first broadcast in 1993, long before reality television filled the airwaves. For most of that decade it ran a couple of times a week, late at night, on public-access television. But although its audience was tiny (maybe between 50 and 5,000 viewers, by Paul H-O's estimate), it grew to be a not-insignificant force in the small world it covered, inspiring both love and trepidation, before it petered out in 2001. 
 Now he has revived it with gallerybeat.net, a Web site that began posting material in late September. The site compiles clips from the old 1990s shows, as well as freshly made episodes and other new material, like a video advice column by Dr. Lisa Levy, a performance artist known for her psychoanalyst act. ''Everything is new and different,'' Paul H-O said. ''Everything has changed from one century to the next. We're kind of reinventing the show.''
 Today, Paul H-O, 56, is probably best known as the guy who dated the elusive art star Cindy Sherman for six years, and who made the 2008 documentary ''Guest of Cindy Sherman'' about the experience. The film, as he explained recently, is ''about what it's like to live with an art superstar, and how I was starting to have problems with that.'' (The relationship ended while he was making the film; upon its release, Ms. Sherman, who had originally backed the production, issued a statement saying she regretted her early cooperation.) 
 But back in the early 1990s, when SoHo was still the epicenter of the international art scene and Paul H-O was a struggling sculptor turned carpenter, he and his Sony camcorder came to be known as gallery-opening fixtures. Having come to New York from San Francisco in 1984 to pursue his art career, he began to draw notice with his genial gadfly presence and irreverent video portrait of the art world. 
 His original team included two correspondents, Ms. Lebowitz and Walter Robinson, another Art in America editor. ''Back then the only place you could see art on TV was Channel 13,'' he said, referring to New York City's public television station. ''We used that as a standard for what not to do. We thought it made art look clerical and boring.'' 
 So on ''Gallery Beat'' the camera angles were wacky, the art was haphazardly framed, and the commentary stuck close to the way that art people actually talk to one another when they're out visiting galleries. ''Our concept was, basically, you go into the gallery and look at the art,'' said Mr. Robinson, who now directs the Web magazine Artnet, ''and you say, 'What the hell isthat?' '' 
 Because the Beatsters, as Paul H-O calls them, usually arrived unannounced, dealers sometimes kicked them out -- which made for great footage -- and those who didn't spent the evening on tenterhooks. ''Paul would make very strange comments,'' recalled the SoHo dealer Ron Feldman, who let the team work several times at his gallery on Mercer Street. ''It took time to figure out that it was probably O.K., that you weren't taking your life in your hands when you were saying hello.'' 
 Mr. Feldman also noted that, although he rarely saw ''Gallery Beat'' in its heyday, he had come to realize after viewing old episodes on the Web that it was a surprisingly valuable archive. ''Historically, there's some very interesting material,'' he said, ''as well as some insights that probably don't exist any other place, because he just asked the right sorts of questions and people were taken off guard.'' 
 The excerpts Paul H-O has uploaded thus far hark back to a largely undocumented moment, when the art world, having deflated from the party scene of the 1980s, was floundering through a truly punishing market recession, and the next big thing was yet unknown. The feminist activists the Guerrilla Girls are seen riding in the back of a pickup truck at the long-discontinued Downtown Arts Festival. (''Those girls are hot!'' Paul H-O yells off-camera.) The photographer Andres Serrano, still famous for having incurred the wrath of Jesse Helms, appears at the 1997 opening of his show ''A History of Sex.'' (''I don't understand these just purely pornographic images blown up so big,'' Ms. Lebowitz muses. ''I mean, I thought that was, you know, over.'') 
 Some of the best scenes were shot in the crowded hallways of the Gramercy International, the scrappy hotel art fair that spawned today's slickly corporate Armory Show, where a British unknown called Tracey Emin snootily chides Paul H-O for not remembering her name, and the macho painter Julian Schnabel slams ''Gallery Beat'' as ''a masturbatory exercise in stupidity.'' (Anyone who hung around in the art world long enough eventually got his or her five seconds of ''Gallery Beat'' fame, including this reporter.)
 Of course the program's most notable encounter was with Ms. Sherman, who astonished the Beatsters by making eyes at Paul H-O and consenting to an in-depth interview. She and Paul H-O eventually fell in love, he moved into her SoHo loft and, as he ascended to the A-list on her coattails, ''Gallery Beat'' fell by the wayside. 
 He decided to resuscitate it in early 2008, long after they had broken up, and soon after ''Guest of Cindy Sherman'' had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. Because the film uses clips from the show to tell the story of the couple's courtship, ''it started up this clamor for 'Gallery Beat,' '' he said. ''Whenever it was screened, people always asked: 'Where can we see it? Are you going to do it again?' '' 
 Prodded by an eager investor, he assembled a tiny team and began working on a Web site. Then the economy collapsed and the investor decamped, leaving Paul H-O with unpaid technology bills and a quandary: ''I had to decide whether I was going to go ahead and do it anyway,'' he said. 
 Once again he was persuaded by others, namely the two 23-year-olds who had already signed on as his new co-hosts: Samantha Schlaifer, a former film student who had been his assistant on the documentary, and her friend Tamara Weg, a former gallery assistant who is majoring in art history at Hunter College. To finish the site and conceive a social-media marketing plan, Ms. Weg roped in another friend, Rus Yusupov, 25, the art director for the design team behind the original Web site for Hulu.com.
 Although all four are partners in the new site, the episodes are primarily produced by Paul H-O, with the help of Ms. Schlaifer and other unpaid volunteers and interns. 
 ''What I think 'Gallery Beat' offers to the art world is laughter,'' Ms. Weg said, ''which is missing most of the time.'' Ms. Schlaifer enthusiastically concurred. ''Like Paul says, the last time 'Gallery Beat' was really popular was in a recession,'' she said, ''so I was like, 'This is the perfect time to take chances, the art world is going to be more embracing.' '' (This time around, perhaps because reality shows are by now a familiar concept, no galleries have yet turned them away.) 
 And while the earlier program was made by and for art-world insiders, the new version has a more inclusive focus. Although Ms. Lebowitz will appear in some of the new episodes, most of the hosting so far has been done by Ms. Weg and Ms. Schlaifer, who are clearly learning their subject matter as they go.
 Paul H-O, rather than being fazed by their inexperience, seems to find it a plus. ''I can make them into what I want them to be,'' he said. ''I'm the director. Everyone brings some kind of audience. But my world really is the art world, and these are my stories.''

HEADLINE: In Punishing Fashion, Pacquiao Wins 7th Title

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
All week, as anticipation built for Saturday night's welterweight title fight between Manny Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto, those with a vested interest looked beyond.
 They pointed to the record number of news media credentials issued, to the sponsors suddenly interested in boxing, to Tuesday's introductions that drew an estimated 700 fans, to the celebrities who asked for tickets, to the Friday weigh-in hosted by the actor Jeremy Piven.
Then they hoped, the same way they have hoped for years, that this fight and the interest that it garnered would boost boxing back to relevance. 
 ''Boxing is ready to take off again,'' Bob Arum, the promoter and chairman of Top Rank Boxing said before Pacquiao took Cotto's title with 12th-round technical knockout at the MGM Grand. ''We've been hoping and praying that boxing would get back to the mainstream. This has exceeded that.''
 Of course, Arum and his counterparts have issued similar statements several times before, comments that have been viewed with skepticism, or worse. They have watched the marquee heavyweight division fall into anonymity, seen mixed martial arts boom in popularity.
 But like the fighters they promote, men whose careers can be altered by a single punch, they search for the fight that will bring their sport back.
 ''I don't know,'' Freddie Roach, a boxing lifer and Pacquiao's trainer, said earlier in the week. ''People say a lot of stuff, but they haven't even fought yet.''
 The calls started coming three months earlier, dozens of assistants and handlers of athletes and celebrities trying to reach Ross Greenburg, the president of HBO Sports. Actors like Piven, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg wanted tickets. So did athletes like Brandon Jacobs, Derek Jeter and C. C. Sabathia.
 The last fight Greenburg remembered with comparable demand was when Lennox Lewisknocked outMike Tyson in June 2002. 
 ''I've never seen such anticipation for an event,'' Greenburg said. ''This seems like a can't miss.''
 The September bout betweenFloyd Mayweather Jr. and Juan Manuel Marquez produced one million pay-per-view buys, according to HBO. It expects Pacquiao-Cotto to draw a similar number -- which is viewed with skepticism -- and if it does, that would mark the first time since 1999 that two fights exceeded one million in the same year.
 This bout, which was to be held at the MGM Grand, sold out quickly, and thousands more paid $50 for one of the closed-circuit seats inside the casino.
 On Wednesday, at the final news conference, Mayor Oscar Goodman handed both fighters a key to the city, recognition, he said, of the role the fight has played in heightening interest in Las Vegas despite the struggling economy.
 ''The entire fight world is looking at our town right now, and there's a hum, and there's a buzz,'' Goodman said. ''Boxing is absolutely on the rebound. Look at the interest.''
 Arum promotes both fighters, but as recently as two years ago, he said he never expected that they would fight, or how intriguing their bout would become.
 That was before Pacquiao became an international celebrity, before he appeared the cover of Time magazine, before he won six titles in six weight divisions, moving up from 112 pounds to 140. Should Pacquiao defeat Cotto, he will have won a record seven titles in seven weight classes. The accomplishment would come with a back story fit for the silver screen: he grew up poor in the Philippines, but now acts, sings and runs for political office.
 Pacquiao came in as the unquestionable star of this fight. Roach, who has trained 24 world champions, labeled him the greatest he has ever worked with, a ''once-in-a-lifetime talent.''
 But it was Cotto who entered the fight as the World Boxing Organization welterweight champion, and his story is nearly as compelling -- his one loss entering the bout coming in suspicious fashion to Antonio Margarito, and the split from his longtime trainer, his uncle Evangelista Cotto.
 The two presented a classic contrast in styles, with Pacquiao as a savage left-hander who relies on speed, and Cotto as his bigger, more powerful counterpart. Neither qualifies as a defensive fighter. Both attack, seeking knockouts, never backing down.
 ''These guys will crawl, scratch, fight to win,'' said Bryan Perez, Cotto's assistant. ''The style of the fight will produce something for boxing history.''
 It remains to be seen if Pacquiao's dominating victory Saturday will be considered that, but boxing can at least hope. Before the fight, Arum looked at the welterweight division and saw the potential for it to return to its 1980s heyday, when fighters like Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Roberto Duran and Marvin Hagler produced a boxing boom. Fight fans still relive those fights, Arum said, before predicting they would long remember Pacquiao-Cotto, too.
 Boxing experts warn not to place too much emphasis on one fight, nor to look too far ahead. The fight most want to watch, the fight that will hook the casual boxing fan, is Pacquiao against Mayweather.
 Recently, Pacquiao said that Mayweather is not likely to fight him, that Mayweather views boxing as a business, that he does not care about the fans. But every fighter has his price, even Mayweather. 
 ''Obviously, the winner of this fight is set up for a huge event with Mayweather,'' Greenburg said beforehand. ''This fight can become another turning point for the sport. We need it. If you don't have a significant, popular heavyweight champion, you need stars like Pacquiao and Cotto.
 ''As you look into the future, you can see the kind of megafights in 2010 and 2011.''
 Arum said potential sponsors, including a ''major'' soft drink company and a ''major'' fast-food chain, were going to this fight, gauging interest in opportunities down the road. 
 Should the interest turn into sponsorships, Arum said, fans could see boxing on Saturday afternoon, on cable, even in prime time.
 ''That's going to happen,'' he said. ''And once that happens, boxing will come all the way back.''
 At least they hope. Pacquiao has fought some of the top boxers of his era, knocking out David Diaz, Oscar De La Hoya and Ricky Hatton in succession, and now adding Cotto to the list. Even Pacquiao could sense the stakes this week.
 On stage Wednesday, he called this fight ''the most important'' of his life. Important not just for Pacquiao, but for boxing, too.

HEADLINE: The Cloak of Invisibility Comes Off

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: Franconia, N.H. 

 BODY:
 WHILE Toyota, Honda and Nissan have grown into the American landscape, Suzuki continues to live in the shadows with a profile so low that its products are not even on the radar of many Americans.
 This could be because the company, whose smaller cars are popular in much of the world, has tended to offer larger but unremarkable products in the United States. The 2010 Kizashi could change that.
 The Kizashi, which is pronounced KEE-zah-shee and is loosely translated from Japanese as ''Something great is coming,'' goes on sale in December as a ''premium sport sedan.'' Executives at American Suzuki say it is the most important product introduction in the company's 25-year history of selling cars.
 Suzuki says it is fundamentally changing its strategy, from offering basic transportation appliances -- often rebadged vehicles built by Daewoo in South Korea -- to Japanese-made cars and trucks that the company promises will look great and be fun to drive. 
 Suzuki needs a lift. Its United States sales, which reached about 102,000 in 2007, are likely to end this year around 40,000, said Jeff Schuster, executive director for global forecasting at J. D. Power & Associates.
 ''Suzuki has a lot riding on this single vehicle,'' Mr. Schuster said of the Kizashi. And, somewhat surprisingly, the car seems up to the task. 
 With a clever blend of smooth ride and competent handling, the Kizashi can be fun on roads that twist and turn, yet it doesn't beat up its occupants on broken surfaces. It has plenty of power and offers all-wheel drive. It comes with eight air bags and electronic stability control. For its price, the interior is classy.
 In short, the Kizashi accomplishes the task of making you think differently about Suzuki. Or, more precisely, it may actually make you think about Suzuki.
 Just settling into the car is a revelation. The interior isn't quite as understated as in a German sport sedan, but it is well executed. The soft-touch plastic on the dashboard has a pebbly texture. The armrest on the storage bin between the seats is cushioned. There is no phony woodgrain trim. The sport seats have good lateral support. Indeed, the interior bore an uncanny resemblance to the one in a Mazda 6 that I drove concurrently with the Kizashi.
 The Suzuki's size is closer to that of sport sedans like the Acura TSX and Volvo S60 than to the Mazda 6 or Nissan Altima; it is smaller than the Honda Accord. 
 The Kizashi does have more rear legroom than the TSX or S60, though access is somewhat impeded by the wheel well. The folding rear seat, which is split 60/40, is comfortable and includes a pass-through for long items like skis. The head restraints flip forward for better visibility when the back seat is unoccupied. The trunk capacity is 13.3 cubic feet, which is more than the TSX (12.6), but less than the Mazda 6 (16.6).
 The Kizashi comes in four trim levels: S, SE, GTS and SLS. Except for the SE, all versions come with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. All-wheel drive comes with only the C.V.T. The SE, which Suzuki expects to be its biggest seller, has only a C.V.T. 
 All models have a lot of standard features, including push-button starter, dual-zone temperature controls and tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. Side air bags for the rear seats are standard on the Kizashi; to get them on the $70,000 Lexus LS 460 luxury sedan, you have to buy an option package.
 The base front-drive S with a manual transmission starts at $19,734 and the top-of-the-line SLS at $25, 134. For all models, add $1,100 to $1,500 for the C.V.T. and $1,250 for all-wheel drive. 
 I drove two versions of the sporty GTS: a front-drive manual version for $23,234 and an all-wheel-drive model with the C.V.T. ($25,584), a price that includes a power sunroof and 18-inch wheels. Oddly, unlike most of its competitors that offer full-time all-wheel drive, the system on the Kizashi is engaged by pushing a button to the left of the steering wheel. The company said it wanted to give owners the option of operating in the slightly more fuel-efficient two-wheel-drive mode. It is a second-generation system that Suzuki said is quicker and lighter than the one on its SX4. 
 I tested one of the Suzukis here on Route 116, a two-lane highway that preys on suspensions. As it weaves south from Franconia, the road rises, falls, wobbles, twists and turns, sometimes all at once. The car's body lean is well controlled, and when the road falls away, the Kizashi drops over the crest and settles down in one fluid movement. 
 And the nose resisted diving to the pavement under the hard braking needed to stop as a pair of moose crossed the road and scrambled up the bank on the other side. There was a second brake test on the return trip for a mother and baby bear. And, though Suzuki said the brakes were made by the Akebono Brake Corporation, which makes brakes for Japanese bullet trains, they could have been a bit stiffer. 
 Later, in Michigan, I had a chance to drive the Kizashi alongside sporty cars like the Mazda 3, Mazda 6 and Volkswagen Golf. My opinion of the Kizashi remained favorable.
 In keeping with its sporty aspirations, Suzuki says the electronic stability control system on the Kizashi isn't overly intrusive. Rather, it is programmed not to kick in too soon so it doesn't interfere with enjoyable, slightly aggressive driving. 
 The Kizashi has one engine, a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder rated at 185 horsepower. A Suzuki spokesman, Jeff Holland, said the company had not announced whether a V-6 would be offered, but he conceded that one was being developed. The company has said a gas-electric hybrid will eventually be available. 
 In my testing, I noted a vibration through the steering wheel at around 1,300 r.p.m. The C.V.T., which can be shifted like a manumatic, downshifts quickly and smoothly and has paddle shifters on the steering wheel. I had a chance later to try the 6-speed manual, whose shifter had an annoying notchy feel. I would choose the C.V.T.
 With the manual, the Kizashi is rated at 21 miles a gallon in town and 31 on the highway. With the C.V.T., the estimate is 23/31 with front drive and 23/30 with all-wheel drive.
 The question for Suzuki is whether Kizashi sales will be hurt by the poor economy or helped because consumers see the car as a good value. Suzuki, long a bit player in the American market, said its goal was to move from being an alternative to mainstream brands (Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, Toyota) to being an alternative to aspirational brands (Mini, Volkswagen, Mazda). That will be a tall order indeed, but certainly the Kizashi is a big step in the right direction.
 INSIDE TRACK: Not quite a Mazda or VW, but a credible alternative.

''One million dollars?''
The question was asked with eyes wide and a voice of incredulity. The person asking was Antonio Waldez Goes da Silva, the governor of the Amazonian state of Amapa, which has the biggest national park in the world. I had just shared with Gov. Waldez Goes a recent news article in The Hill, the Congressional newspaper, which said the total cost of stationing one U.S. soldier in Afghanistan for one year is $1 million.
 What if we kept just one soldier back from Afghanistan and gave you the money, I asked the governor? What would it buy you? Gov. Waldez Goes mulled that over: ''If you kept three soldiers back, that would be enough for me to keep the State University of Amapa running for one year, so 1,400 students could take different courses on sustainable development for the Amazon.'' 
 O.K., I know. It is a bit misleading to take a war budget and assume that if it weren't spent on combat, it would all go to schools or parks. And we do have real enemies. Some wars have to be fought, no matter the cost. But such comparisons are still a useful reminder that our debate about Afghanistan is not taking place in a vacuum. We will have to make trade-offs, and there are other hugely important projects today crying out for funding, as my colleague Nick Kristof has pointed out regarding health care. 
 Well, if America is going to assume the primary burden of fixing Central Asia, maybe, say, China, could help pick up the tab for saving what is left of the Amazon and the world's other great tropical forests. Could President Obama raise that idea in Beijing? 
 An intergovernmental working group for saving the rainforests estimates that for about $30 billion we could reduce deforestation in places like Brazil, Indonesia and the Congo by 25 percent by 2015. After that, financing from global carbon markets, plus these countries' own resources, could save much of the rest. China now has $2.2 trillion in reserves. How about it, Beijing? Why don't you step up and provide some public goods for the world for once -- not because you get a direct benefit, but just because it would make the world a better place for everyone? 
 Sure, America should still lead such efforts. But China's days as a global free-rider should be over. China should pay its fair share -- and more -- since it will benefit every bit as much as the U.S., Europe and Japan. Indeed, the U.N. Foundation estimates that because living tropical forests are such huge storehouses of carbon -- which gets released when we chop the trees down -- if we just stop deforestation, we get a big chunk of the carbon-emissions reductions the world needs between now and 2020.
 ''And forest-rich developing countries, like Brazil, are now ready to do their part because they depend on the water that the rainforests provide for energy and agriculture, and because they see a new model for growth based on their natural capital,'' said Glenn Prickett, a senior vice president with Conservation International and my traveling companion here. ''Brazil has developed the science, political will and basic rules and institutions for preserving its rainforests. What Brazil and other rainforest nations like Indonesia lack, though, are the funds to take this new economic model to scale.''
 I was struck by how many of the building blocks for ''natural capitalism'' that Gov. Waldez Goes -- whose state sits at the mouth of the Amazon -- is putting in place, so that he can have an economy based on preserving the rainforest rather than stripping it. He's building on the three P's -- creating protected forest areas, improving productivity on lands that have already been cleared so farmers there will not need more, and establishing property rights for Amazonian lands, which are a legal mess, inviting Wild West land grabs and scaring off investors in sustainable agriculture. 
 Gov. Waldez Goes has already protected 75 percent of his state as rainforest and has enacted the laws and created a technical college to provide for sustainable logging and eco-tourism and for developing medicinal and cosmetic products from rainforest plants. But he needs funds to implement and monitor at scale and prove that ''natural capitalism'' can deliver more than the extractive version.
 ''I am the son of a rubber tapper,'' he explains. ''I was born and raised in the jungle, so even before becoming a politician I had a strong connection to nature.'' The world is facing this relentless ''development path that brings pollution and degradation and deforestation,'' he added. He and other Brazilians want to prove you can do better by bringing ''conservation and development together.''
 Tropical forests represent some 5 percent of the earth's surface but harbor 50 percent of all living species. Conservation International has a motto: ''What is lost there is felt here.'' If we lose what is left of the Amazon, we'll all feel the climate effects, changing rainfall and loss of biodiversity that enriches our world. Brazil seems ready to do its part. Are we? What about you, China?

HEADLINE: Bidding Wars Resume

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
A TWO-BEDROOM apartment on the Upper West Side is listed at $1.595 million and sells within two weeks after nine prospective buyers race to outbid one another, ultimately pushing the price to nearly $1.8 million. 
 Sound like the pandemonium of the last real estate boom, when anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage and it seemed as if prices could go only up? 
 It wasn't. Try last month.
 A year after the economy headed into a tailspin and at a time when most New Yorkers are still wondering whether real estate prices have hit bottom, brokers say that bidding wars are back. They are breaking out in all sectors of the market, from $400,000 one-bedrooms in Brooklyn Heights to $7 million apartments with grand park views at 15 Central Park West, and from stately Park Avenue prewar apartments to new condominiums in Williamsburg. 
 In many cases, the jousting buyers start and end below the asking price. But in others, multiple bidders are pushing prices well above list price. To add a confounding twist, many of the bids are being made by buyers willing and able to pay all cash.
 Brokers say that bidding wars are almost always set up by listings that are ''priced well,'' and by that they mean 20 to 30 percent below the high-water marks of early 2008. 
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, estimated that two-thirds of the roughly 4,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan are priced too high for the current market. 
 ''So,'' Mr. Miller said, ''you have this weird situation right now where you have above-average inventory, but people are fighting over the ones that are priced correctly.''
 Amelia S. Gewirtz, an executive vice president of Halstead Property, and her partner, Andrew Phillips, helped drive the $1.595 million two-bedroom to a $1.8 million contract price. 
 ''If you price for 2009 or even 2010 -- in other words, for buyers who think prices might go down another 5 or 10 percent,'' Ms. Gewirtz said, ''there's a really good shot that you will get rewarded for pricing it to value.'' She said that the buyers who came to see the $1.595 million apartment ''knew what the competition was, and they recognized that it was priced well. If we had priced it for 2008, we wouldn't have gotten what we wanted.'' 
 Five of the nine offers, including the winning bid, were all cash, she said, adding that the prospective buyers were a varied lot, including empty nesters planning to move back to the city from the suburbs, renters who had been waiting for the right moment to buy, and foreigners hoping to take advantage of the falling dollar.
 Brokers say that the months of near inactivity that started with the demise of Lehman Brothers last fall and stretched into late spring also created a great deal of pent-up demand. Many apartment hunters re-entered the market after Labor Day with a steely determination to buy.
 ''There's definitely been a shift in the confidence of buyers in the last two months,'' said Jessica Cohen, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 The sale of Jill and Jonathan Steinberg's apartment on the Upper West Side is a good illustration of the changing real estate psyche. The Steinbergs put their one-bedroom on the market for $699,000 on the day that Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.
 ''The timing couldn't have possibly been worse,'' Ms. Steinberg said. ''It was an absolute disaster.''
 The apartment, a high-rise unit with a balcony and open city views, sat on the market for seven months. Even after they dropped the price to $649,000, the Steinbergs received only three offers, all around $585,000.
 Disheartened, they took the place off the market in June. But by late summer, the market seemed to have leveled off, so they sought a new broker and found Ms. Cohen. She suggested they list it at $645,000 right before Labor Day, to avoid the post-summer rush.
 Fifteen people came to their first open house, and someone made an offer that very day, Ms. Steinberg recalled. ''Then another buyer came along and offered full price -- it was so surreal,'' she said. The first buyer countered with $650,000, but later withdrew the bid. The Steinbergs are now in contract with the second bidder. 
 ''We were beyond ecstatic to take our asking price,'' Ms. Steinberg said. ''It was a much different experience than we had the first time.''
 In some cases, scarcity, or even the perception of scarcity, can spark bidding wars. At the Rialto, a new 31-unit condo in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sales started 14 months ago. The building had its first bidding war in August, when there were only seven units left; two more bidding wars followed in October.
 HighlyAnn Krasnow, an executive vice president of the Developers Group, said that in the current climate, in which developers are cutting prices and offering to pay closing costs to attract buyers, the multiple bids at the Rialto took her by surprise.
 ''It was a little bit unexpected,'' Ms. Krasnow said, ''and I think it's a good sign for the market in general.''
 A more direct way to generate excitement in a property is to price it below market value, said Genifer Lancaster, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman. She advised some clients, sellers at 145 Nassau Street, an iconic building opposite City Hall, to list their 1,800- square-foot loft at $1.1 million. ''This apartment was a jewel,'' Ms. Lancaster said, ''but the financial district is not one of the stronger neighborhoods, and there have been very few transactions down here.''
 David Nemerson, who was selling the apartment as the executor of his father's estate, said that other brokers had suggested $1.4 million, ''but Genifer persuaded us that if we generated a lot of traffic, you never know what might happen.'' 
 It turned out to be a gamble worth taking. Two weeks after the apartment went on the market in late May, there were 13 bids in hand, and the best and highest bid was an all-cash deal for $1.6 million.
 ''Needless to say, the outcome exceeded our expectations,'' Ms. Lancaster said.
 The tentativeness of the credit market has given buyers with large amounts of cash a decided advantage over buyers who need a mortgage and are thus subject to the whims of lenders.
 ''There's a great deal of bargaining power in being able to close promptly without any hiccups that might occur with the borrowing process,'' said Luigi Rosabianca, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
 Of course, not every all-cash buyer is a foreigner arriving with a suitcase stuffed with bills. Mr. Rosabianca said he had one client, a business owner, who had planned to secure 70 percent financing for an apartment on the Upper East Side, but decided against it when the bank withdrew the 5.5 percent mortgage rate it had offered him and raised the rate above 7 percent. 
 Rather than lose the deal and have the loan denied, the buyer ended up taking the unusual step of borrowing against his retirement plan to make it a cash transaction, and was able to close in two weeks, Mr. Rosabianca said.
 Because the ability to close a deal quickly now ranks high in the minds of many sellers and their co-op or condo boards, the whole psychology behind bidding wars has shifted. 
 ''At the height of the market, bidding wars weren't based on real prices,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Twenty people wanted it, there was no inventory and it didn't matter what the number went to.'' But now, she said, ''things are being bid up only when people see real value.''
 When Christopher Stanley, an agent with the Corcoran Group, got an estate listing for a Classic 8 corner apartment on Park Avenue, he knew he would have to price it to move. 
 The 3,200-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms, two baths, three maids' rooms and two maids' baths, and it had been impeccably renovated -- back in 1971. Mr. Stanley thinks it would easily have sold for more than $5 million two years ago. But knowing that any buyer would want to renovate the space, he put it on the market for $4.2 million right before Labor Day.
 Seven buyers put in bids. ''Everybody came in under the asking price because that's what everybody thinks they have to do,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''But the seller stood firm at full ask and the bidders all came up.''
 The bidding war lasted two weeks. The apartment is now in contract in an all-cash deal for about 4 percent above the asking price, or roughly $4.3 million.
 To shorten the process, brokers faced with multiple offers will often set a deadline and ask buyers to submit their best and final offers in sealed envelopes. But they say they are careful not to create a frenzy.
 ''The way we negotiate a bidding war is different now,'' said Jordan Hoch, another vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''You want people to feel comfortable with what they're paying and you don't want them to put out a number that's too big and then have them get buyer's remorse and back out.''
 When a bidding war develops, skeptical buyers often wonder if other bidders truly exist. Tristan H. Harper, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, had just such a client, Larry Ruskin, a retired oil and gas executive from Canada.
 Mr. Ruskin low-balled a $7.9 million two-bedroom apartment at 15 Central Park West, offering $5.8 million. 
 ''They didn't even want to talk to us,'' Mr. Harper said. But he convinced the seller's broker that Mr. Ruskin was a serious buyer. When that broker said another buyer had bid more and called for final offers, Mr. Ruskin offered $7.1 million. But he was wary: His bid came with a proviso that if the seller could prove there really was another viable offer, he would pay an additional $250,000.
 The seller complied, with a signed affidavit. Mr. Ruskin, satisfied, closed on the apartment in August at $7.35 million. 
 ''''I didn't think the market had turned yet,'' said Mr. Ruskin, who had been looking for a New York pied-a-terre for about a year. ''But I thought that if I waited, I might not have the same opportunities again.''
 Brokers say that buyers tend to become more aggressive if they have already lost a bidding war or two.
 Emily Schultz and Wes Mallgren were devastated when they were outbid last June on a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights. The asking price was $412,500, and their offer of $400,000 had been accepted when a higher offer came in. 
 The seller's broker, Jocelyn G. Turken, an agent at Warburg Realty, asked for final offers, advising both buyers ''to come up with a number that will not overextend you and that won't leave you devastated if you lose, because you know you've given your best shot.'' 
 Ms. Schultz and Mr. Mallgren bid $420,000, but the apartment sold for about $422,000.
 ''I had friends who told us they had gotten their hearts broken, too, but that in the end we would find a better apartment,'' Ms. Schultz said. ''All I could think was: 'No, that was the perfect apartment and now it's gone.' ''
 So the next time they found an apartment they liked, they made an offer immediately. When the seller demanded $20,000 more, they quickly agreed, only to withdraw the offer when they realized the 550-square-foot apartment was too small for them.
 ''That was just a psychological mistake,'' Ms. Schultz said. ''We thought we wanted it, but we just really didn't want to lose again.''
 The third time was the charm. Ms. Turken helped them find another one-bedroom a few blocks away for $519,000, with a lower maintenance charge than the previous properties.
 ''Wes fell in love with it immediately, but I was more uncomfortable because I didn't want to make another mistake,'' Ms. Schultz said.
 They sat down and made lists of pros and cons. ''We took our time,'' she said. They offered $500,000, and after some negotiation, ended up paying $505,000. Losing the first apartment in a bidding war had come as a surprise to them, Ms. Schultz said, ''but I wasn't worried this time, I just felt good about it.'' 
 They closed and moved into the apartment last month.

TOO BIG TO FAIL
 The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System From Crisis -- and Themselves
 By Andrew Ross Sorkin
 600 pp. Viking. $32.95
 HOW MARKETS FAIL
 The Logic of Economic Calamities
 By John Cassidy
 390 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28
 Two leading financial journalists have made worthy additions to the increasingly crowded shelf of books on our recent economic failure. In very different ways, John Cassidy and Andrew Ross Sorkin address the critical question of what exactly happened on Wall Street. Until we settle on at least a rough answer, we won't have a prayer of preventing the next crisis.
 Sorkin, a reporter and business columnist for The New York Times, has written what his publisher calls ''a true-life financial and political thriller'': 600 pages of dramatic scene play and salty dialogue in which powerful bankers and government regulators clash on the precipice of global depression. Since the broad outlines of these events are well known by now, ''Too Big to Fail'' can't deliver on the thriller billing. But Sorkin's prodigious reporting and lively writing put the reader in the room for some of the biggest-dollar conference calls in history. It's an entertaining, brisk book. 
 Although Sorkin doesn't attempt much deep analysis, he does concisely summarize what he thinks all the maneuvering and sweaty panic add up to: ''The calamity would definitively shatter some of the most cherished principles of capitalism,'' he writes. ''The idea that financial wizards had conjured up a new era of low-risk profits, and that American-style financial engineering was the global gold standard, was officially dead.'' 
 Cassidy's much shorter ''How Markets Fail'' offers a brilliant intellectual framework for Sorkin's narrative. In the process, Cassidy, a writer for The New Yorker, also sheds skeptical light on Sorkin's conclusions. The calamity of 2008 didn't shatter principles of capitalism; there isn't a static set of capitalist principles to destroy. Capitalism has meant different things to different thinkers and economic players. 
 The recent debacle demonstrated the foolishness of one theory of capitalism: a utopian version of free-market theology that happens to have dominated American economic thinking for two generations. Sadly, the financial wizards Sorkin portrays so colorfully are still very much with us, and their simplistic mythology is far from ''officially dead.'' 
 Cassidy traces ideas about capitalism from Adam Smith's 18th-century ''invisible hand'' through Alan Greenspan's hands-off philosophy toward regulating banks as chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. The theory that Greenspan inherited from Milton Friedman, high priest of the Chicago School, ''says simply: self-interest plus competition equals nirvana,'' Cassidy writes. Greenspan applied this idea in various contexts, perhaps most notably when he opposed government oversight of an increasingly manic Wall Street casino culture based on his faith that rival financiers would police one another and not take potentially self-destructive risks. The blind faith that Greenspan exemplified turned out to be flat wrong. ''For him to claim that the market economy is innately stable wasn't merely contentious,'' Cassidy writes; ''it was an absurdity.'' 
 Greenspan, as Cassidy recounts, credited Adam Smith, the bookish Scotsman, as a pivotal influence. ''Our ideas about the efficacy of market competition have remained essentially unchanged since the 18th-century Enlightenment, when they first emerged, to a remarkable extent, largely from the mind of one man, Adam Smith,'' Greenspan asserted in his 2007 memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence.'' But how carefully, Cassidy asks, did Greenspan and his ilk read what their hero actually wrote?
 Smith did observe that butchers and brewers pursuing individual enrichment tend to produce societal advantages. When it came to financial institutions, though, Smith advocated government restrictions -- for example, preventing banks from issuing too many promissory notes to unworthy borrowers. ''Such regulations may, no doubt, be considered as in some respects a violation of natural liberty,'' Smith wrote. ''But these exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws of all governments.'' 
 Cassidy writes: ''Alan Greenspan and other self-proclaimed descendants of Smith rarely mention his skeptical views of the banking system. . . . The notion of financial markets as rational and self-correcting mechanisms is an invention of the last 40 years.''
 Not coincidentally, Greenspanism serves the interests of two important institutions: the virulently antigovernment ''movement conservatism'' that became a political force in the United States beginning in the 1960s and the Wall Street titans that gained startling influence in an American economy marked by the closure of plants making cars, clothes, electronics and steel. 
 Big banks are different from ordinary companies. When a factory or a trucking firm or a chain of retail stores goes bankrupt, groups of employees and shareholders may suffer terribly. But the damage is contained. When major financial institutions simultaneously make reckless bets with borrowed money, and then approach collapse, the entire economy can freeze up. Credit disappears. Businesses can't borrow for payroll. Layoffs ensue. Consumers stop spending. Stocks plummet. 
 Without careful oversight, financial markets tend naturally toward excess and crisis. The easy-lending housing bubble was preceded by the dot-com stock craze of the 1990s, and before that by the savings-and-loan fiasco of the 1980s, and so on back through time. 
 Many sensible economists and business leaders -- advocates of capitalism, all -- have acknowledged the perilous aspects of self-interested financial enterprise without suggesting a switch to Soviet-style central planning or preindustrial feudalism. Cassidy's favorite is the redoubtable Hyman Minsky, who taught at Washington University in St. Louis and served for years as a director of the charmingly named Mark Twain Bank in that heartland city. No radical, Minsky studied how to create conditions in which businesses can thrive. ''From the early 1960s until shortly before his death in 1996,'' Cassidy writes, ''Minsky advanced the view that free-market capitalism is inherently unstable and that the primary source of this instability is the irresponsible actions of bankers, traders and other financial types. Should the government fail to regulate the financial sector effectively, Minsky warned, it would be subject to periodic blowups, some of which could plunge the entire economy into lengthy recessions.'' Sound familiar?
 With the pithiness of a talented journalist, Cassidy translates Minsky's scholarship into the helpful theory of ''rational irrationality.'' The individual, short-term actions of a bond trader or subprime lender may make sense in that they will yield a quick profit, but taken together and unchecked by stern rules and a public-spirited overseer, the behavior of the herd can destabilize the entire system in a manner that, in retrospect, seems pretty crazy. 
 It's rational for a mortgage company to loan $500,000 to a borrower who can't pay back the money if the lender can immediately sell the loan toa Wall Street investment bank. It's also rational for the investment bank to bundle a bunch of risky home loans and resell them -- for a tidy profit, of course -- to hedge funds as a bond. Such bonds, known as mortgage-backed securities, were attractive to hedge funds and other investors because they paid relatively high interest. Sure, the bonds were risky (remember that the home buyers never really should have qualified as borrowers in the first place), but many investors bought a form of insurance against the bonds' defaulting. The sellers of this insurance, called credit default swaps, assumed they'd be able to collect premiums and never have to pay out very much because real estate prices would keep rising forever -- so those original dubious borrowers would be able to refinance their unrealistic loans. Everyone felt especially rational about all of this because prestigious credit-rating agencies issued triple-A stamps of approval for the exotic, high-interest securities. Never mind that the rating agencies were paid -- i.e., bought off -- by the very investment banks peddling the mortgage-backed securities.
 In ''Too Big to Fail,'' Sorkin skillfully captures the raucous enthusiasm and riotous greed that fueled this rational irrationality. The brokers and bankers and traders he brings to life couldn't resist doing one more insanely hazardous deal because, well, everyone else was doing it, and the profits were too alluring. The only event likely to disrupt the party was if real estate went bust all across the country. And then, that's exactly what happened. The most sobering aspect of Cassidy's fine work is that ''American-style financial engineering,'' as Sorkin calls it, isn't dead at all. Some of the most headstrong captains of Wall Street have been sidelined earlier than they expected, with egos bruised and fortunes reduced. But Congress and the Obama administration are proposing regulatory reforms that tinker with the current system rather than overhaul it. Wall Street, having never really atoned for its latest destructive frenzy, is now winning concessions that weaken the modest proposed reform initiatives with loopholes. ''Evidently, the White House has swallowed the Wall Street line'' on reining in exotic financial products, Cassidy writes. He fails to add that the big banks are spending millions on lobbyists to push their line in Washington. Legislation to provide oversight of credit default swaps and other derivatives would allow so many exemptions that it may turn out to have little meaning. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have the mettle to impose strict limits on the kind of gambling with borrowed money that drove storied investment banks out of business or into the hands of taxpayer-backed rescuers. And no one in a position of authority has had the temerity even to suggest that we ought to revisit the deregulatory moves of the 1990s -- backed by Greenspan and executed by the Clinton administration -- that allowed the creation of unmanageable financial monstrosities like Citigroup, which would have disintegrated absent a huge amount of federal aid. These goliaths are now considered, in the words of Sorkin's title, ''too big to fail.'' Protected by an implied taxpayer safety net, they have a built-in motivation to start taking absurd risks again, as memories of the trauma of 2008 begin to fade. 
 Greenspan, to his credit, admitted in Congressional testimony in October 2008 that his assumption about self-correcting financial markets had flaws. But he's gone from the public stage, and the rest of the country's power elite seem to have forgotten his striking apology. We need a new-generation Hyman Minsky to teach us to fear rational irrationality -- and this time, we need to act before things come apart.

This season's inclement weather affected farmers' markets as much as their crops, and customers lost early on never really came back. Just ask Michael Hurwitz, director of greenmarkets for the Council on the Environment of New York City. 
 ''God, this was a tough year,'' Mr. Hurwitz said. Market problems snowballed from the spring, when less produce than usual was available because of rain, cool weather and late planting on vendors' farms. ''That impacted customers coming back to market,'' he said. ''Spring is not for making money; it's for getting customers in. Fall is for making money -- and less people all season came to the markets.'' 
 Those all-important weekends, including the two biggest market weekends of the season in mid-October, were rainy, and that meant fewer shoppers, Mr. Hurwitz said. At the largest market, in Union Square, business was off by as much as 40 percent this season. The economic crisis compounded the low turnout, though on the bright side, he said, it generally kept vendors from raising prices. 
 But farmers like John Glebocki had little choice. Mr. Glebocki is an Orange County farmer who sells his produce exclusively at 22 farmers' markets, most of them in the New York City system. He figures he lost nearly 50 percent of his 80 acres of mixed vegetables, but he has faith in his customers. ''People understand it's a low production year,'' he said, ''and if we have to tack on another quarter a pound.''

HEADLINE: 10 Years Later, a Much Less Expensive Dow 10,000

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM.

 BODY:
 INVESTORS may take some comfort now that the Dow Jones industrial average is back above 10,000 after slipping to around 9,700 at the end of October. 
 But the return to 10,000 also serves as a bitter reminder that stocks have gone virtually nowhere, on balance, for more than a decade. It was in March 1999 that the Dow first climbed above 10,000, before soaring as high as 14,164 two years ago and plummeting as low as 6,547 this past March. 
 Of course, the Dow gauges only stocks in the United States, and a fairly narrow band of the market at that. And while domestic shares have appeared to run in circles for more than a decade, many global stock markets have prospered. 
 Look a bit deeper, though, and you'll find that there have been some changes in the domestic market, too, in the last 10 years -- and largely for the better. Some of them, however, are hard to see at first glance.
 For example, a majority of sectors have actually posted positive returns since the end of 1999 -- in some cases sizable gains. On average, including dividends, energy stocks have returned nearly 150 percent, shares of consumer staples companies (like Procter & Gamble and others that sell necessities) have gained nearly 65 percent and utility stocks have risen nearly 50 percent. 
 ''That's hardly what I would call a lost decade,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
 Market valuations are another consideration. By almost every measure, stocks are far cheaper at Dow 10,000 today than at Dow 10,000 in March 1999.
 Back then, the price-to-earnings ratio for domestic stocks stood at a very high 41.4. That's based on 10-year average earnings, a conservative measure that smoothes out short-term swings in corporate profits. Since then, using the same measure, the market's P/E has fallen to 18.9. While that's not necessarily a screaming bargain -- the market's long-term average is closer to 16 -- stocks are trading at a discount of more than 50 percent to their 1999 prices.
 ''The reality is that stocks are like any other asset,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif. ''If you buy them cheap, there's a good chance you'll be happy very quickly. But if you buy them at expensive prices, you'll have to wait a long, long time to get rewarded. That's what investors have learned in the past decade.''
 Perhaps the most important change is the one that has occurred in many portfolios. Investors are generally more diversified today than they were a decade ago -- and that has helped many households make money in an equity market that has been in neutral over all.
 Consider that in 1999, four economically sensitive sectors -- technology, financial services, telecommunications and consumer discretionary stocks (which include automakers) -- made up nearly two-thirds of the overall market. 
 Those four areas also happened to be the four worst-performing groups over the last 10 years. Since the end of 1999, tech and telecom shares have lost nearly 8 percent, annualized, according to Standard & Poor's. Financial shares, meanwhile, have fallen almost 3 percent a year, on average, and consumer discretionary stocks are down nearly 2 percent, annualized, S.& P. says. 
 Today, these four sectors make up less than half of the market. 
 At the same time, weightings have grown modestly in traditionally defensive areas of the market like health care, consumer staples and utilities. In fact, those three sectors now make up nearly a third of the S.& P. 500-stock index, up from less than 19 percent in 1999.
 DIVERSIFICATION goes well beyond just sectors. Back in the late '90s, investors held about $1 in foreign stocks for every $8 held in domestic equities -- not counting their own company's stock -- within their 401(k) retirement accounts. That isn't terribly surprising, in that the domestic stock market back then was routinely delivering 20-percent-plus annual returns. 
 Today, that ratio of foreign stocks to domestic shares stands at 1 to 3.
 Why is that important?
 In a decade when domestic stocks ended up going nowhere, foreign shares actually gained a decent amount of ground. In fact, the Vanguard Total International Stock Index fund, a diversified index portfolio that serves as a proxy for all overseas equities, returned more than 4 percent, annualized, from March 1999 through October this year. And the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index fund, which invests in companies based in developing economies abroad, fared even better, climbing more than 12 percent, annualized, during this stretch. 
 If you diversified with, say, 75 percent domestic stocks and 25 percent foreign shares, your overall equity portfolio would have grown slightly -- by more than 1 percent, annualized, since March 1999.
 What's more, foreign assets are now more important in global portfolios. In the last 10 years, emerging markets have gone from 4 percent of the world's market capitalization to 26 percent, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. 
 Despite the Dow's lackluster performance, Mr. Stovall added, ''You can't say that things haven't changed.''

HEADLINE: The Job Of Finding A New Job

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER. 
E-mail: citycritic@nytimes.com

 BODY:
How do you know when it's time to change careers? Perhaps you no longer feel energized about new projects or you've lost confidence in your boss. 
 Or maybe you woke up one day to find that your job was cut, your company was vaporized, your entire industry was consigned to history. So it's gone for millions of Americans over the last year. Unemployment nationwide just hit double digits for the first time in 26 years, a grim milestone that New York had already passed. Some are scrambling to find variations on the jobs they lost. Many others have no choice but to try a whole new direction.
New York is home to a number of career counselors who specialize in helping people make that transition (you can find them at www.careercc.org). I visited a few to get a sense of what it's like. It was a hypothetical exercise, since I am lucky enough to have a job, but also not, since the newspaper industry is shrinking faster than the polar ice caps. It couldn't hurt, I figured, to find a Plan B -- or a life preserver. 
 Getting advice from Karen Palevsky is a homey experience that begins with a walk through the galley kitchen of her apartment to the table where her family eats. A slight woman with a soft voice, she has the gentle, encouraging manner of a therapist, which, in fact, she is. ''I like to learn about the whole person,'' she said. That usually takes four or so sessions, at $110 to $130 an hour. 
 With my resume in front of her, Ms. Palevsky began by asking me about my strengths. 
 How many times have we all heard that question? In a job interview, it's a game, in which you guess what answers the interviewer wants to hear. In a career counseling session, there's no one to impress or win over. The only relevant answer is the one that feels right. 
 I came up blank. 
 She asked about my parents, my education, my hobbies as a child. Then about my current job, my boss, my schedule. She was looking for patterns: What conditions produce the best results? What skills could I carry over from one field to another? If I knew where I wanted to go, she would have helped me start networking. 
 Her first suggestion was not surprising: public relations. Plenty of people who leave journalism head in that direction, but I am not eager to join them. Nor could I get excited about any of the other communications fields she mentioned: advertising, marketing, corporate communications. So what is my dream job, she asked. 
 A reasonable question. If I knew the answer, though, I probably would not seek out professional advice. 
 Another counselor, Hal Flantzer, offered me a seat in his exquisitely generic Midtown office -- desk, phone, plant -- and got down to business. ''I like a no-nonsense approach,'' he said. ''It's not like therapy.'' He focuses on practical elements: what you are good at, what you like doing, what jobs are available. 
 Having given up my dream of reggaeton stardom, I mentioned some passing fantasies about cool nonprofit organizations, and that I don't work well in isolation. He looked up from his notes and said: ''So you could maybe look to the nonprofit sector -- see how your writing skills could be of use, how you could be an effective team member. See where I'm going with this?'' On one level it was laughable: He had just taken a few of the things I said and strung them together into one sentence. But it was further than all my own thinking had ever gotten me. 
 Like many other counselors, Mr. Flantzer uses some standardized tests, like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Campbell Interest and Skill Survey and Career Anchors. And he encourages clients to do research on their own, through job search Web sites like O*NET. But mostly he offers conversation, in packages ranging from four sessions ($600 to $800) to 26 sessions, which sounds like a job in its own right. 
 On the other end of the spectrum stands Allie Roth, who runs the Center for Creativity and Work in Manhattan and in Berkeley, Calif., and calls her approach ''psycho-spiritual.'' As a sample of her ''Discover Your Soul's Work'' package (an average of 10 sessions, $125 to $200 per session), Ms. Roth gave me an assignment: make lists of the things that nourish my soul and of the peak experiences in my life.
 You start thinking about your peak experiences, and things get very personal very fast. When we later met, via Skype, she told me her impressions. ''I'm picking up this depth, in a sense being in love with the world, the awe and wonder of the universe,'' she said, apologizing for moving faster than she would in an ordinary consultation. ''A combination of the big picture and seeing all the nuances and the connections.'' It sounded great. I just wasn't sure it sounded like me. 
 Later Ms. Roth asked me to close my eyes and breathe deeply, until an image of me and my career emerged from my unconscious. Nothing did.
 The potential new career Ms. Roth mentioned -- psychologist -- is intriguing, but her touchy-feely style didn't feel like the right fit. 
 The three counselors I consulted had such different approaches, and headed toward such different conclusions (except about my resume writing, which they all agreed stinks), that I had to wonder how differently my life might turn out if I hired one or another. Would I even take that step? If I were freaking out over the loss of not just a job but a career, I might feel too panicked about the present to invest in my future.
 Judith Gerberg, who is president of the Career Counselors Consortium, said the scary unemployment numbers do not tell the real story. ''Finding a career and a job is kind of like dating,'' she said. ''No matter what the statistics are, all you need is the one you want.''

HEADLINE: Reform and Medical Costs

 BODY:
Americans are deeply concerned about the relentless rise in health care costs and health insurance premiums. They need to know if reform will help solve the problem. The answer is that no one has an easy fix for rising medical costs. The fundamental fix -- reshaping how care is delivered and how doctors are paid in a wasteful, dysfunctional system -- is likely to be achieved only through trial and error and incremental gains. 
 The good news is that the bill just approved by the House and a bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee would implement or test many reforms that should help slow the rise in medical costs over the long term. As a report in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded, ''Pretty much every proposed innovation found in the health policy literature these days is encapsulated in these measures.''
 Medical spending, which typically rises faster than wages and the overall economy, is propelled by two things: the high prices charged for medical services in this country and the volume of unnecessary care delivered by doctors and hospitals, which often perform a lot more tests and treatments than a patient really needs. 
 Here are some of the important proposals in the House and Senate bills to try to address those problems, and why it is hard to know how well they will work:
 FORCED PRODUCTIVITY GAINSBoth bills would reduce the rate of growth in annual Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers by amounts comparable to the productivity savings routinely made in other industries with the help of new technologies and new ways to organize work. This proposal could save Medicare more than $100 billion over the next decade. If private plans demanded similar productivity savings from providers, and refused to let providers shift additional costs to them, the savings could be much larger. 
 Critics say Congress will give in to lobbyists and let inefficient providers off the hook. That is far less likely to happen if Congress also adopts strong ''pay-go'' rules requiring that any increase in payments to providers be offset by new taxes or budget cuts. 
 CADILLAC COVERAGE The Senate Finance bill would impose an excise tax on health insurance plans that cost more than $8,000 for an individual or $21,000 for a family. It would most likely cause insurers to redesign plans to fall beneath the threshold. Enrollees would have to pay more money for many services out of their own pockets, and that would encourage them to think twice about whether an expensive or redundant test was worth it. Economists project that most employers would shift money from expensive health benefits into wages. The House bill has no similar tax. The final legislation should. 
 SIMPLIFIED FORMS Any doctor who has wrestled with multiple forms from different insurers, or patients who have tried to understand their own parade of statements, know that simplification ought to save money. When the health insurance industry was still cooperating in reform efforts, its trade group offered to provide standardized forms for automated processing. It estimated that step would save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. The bills would lock that pledge into law. 
 ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS The stimulus package provided money to convert the inefficient, paper-driven medical system to electronic records that can be easily viewed and transmitted. This requires upfront investments to help doctors convert. In time it should help restrain costs by eliminating redundant tests, preventing drug interactions, and helping doctors find the best treatments. 
 REFORM OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM Virtually all experts agree that the fee-for-service system -- doctors are rewarded for the quantity of care rather than its quality or effectiveness -- is a primary reason that the cost of care is so high. Most agree that the solution is to push doctors to accept fixed payments to care for a particular illness or for a patient's needs over a year. No one knows how to make that happen quickly. 
 The bills in both houses would start pilot projects within Medicare. They include such measures as accountable care organizations to take charge of a patient's needs with an eye on both cost and quality, and chronic disease management to make sure the seriously ill, who are responsible for the bulk of all health care costs, are treated properly. For the most part, these experiments rely on incentive payments to get doctors to try them. 
 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION Testing innovations do no good unless the good experiments are identified and expanded and the bad ones are dropped. The Senate bill would create an independent commission to monitor the pilot programs and recommend changes in Medicare's payment policies to prod providers to adopt reforms that work. The changes would have to be approved or rejected as a whole by Congress, making it hard for narrow- interest lobbies to bend lawmakers to their will. 
 MANAGED COMPETITION The bills in both chambers would create health insurance exchanges on which small businesses and individuals could choose from an array of private plans and possibly a public option. All the plans would have to provide standard benefit packages that would be easy to compare. To get access to millions of new customers, insurers would have a strong incentive to sell on the exchange. And the head-to-head competition might give them a strong incentive to lower their prices, perhaps by accepting slimmer profit margins or demanding better deals from providers. 
 A PUBLIC PLAN The final legislation might throw a public plan into the competition, but thanks to the fierce opposition of the insurance industry and Republican critics, it might not save much money. The one in the House bill would have to negotiate rates with providers, rather than using Medicare rates, as many reformers wanted.
 COMPARING TREATMENTS The president's stimulus package is pumping money into research to compare how well various treatments work. Is surgery, radiation or careful monitoring best for prostate cancer? Is the latest and most expensive cholesterol-lowering drug any better than its generic competitors? The pending bills would spend additional money to accelerate this effort. 
 Critics have charged that this sensible idea would lead to rationing of care. (That would be true only if you believed that patients should have an unbridled right to treatments proven to be inferior.) As a result, the bills do not require, as they should, that the results of these studies be used to set payment rates in Medicare. 
 Congress needs to find the courage to allow Medicare to pay preferentially for treatments proven to be superior. Sometimes the best treatment might be the most expensive. But over all, we suspect that spending would come down through elimination of a lot of unnecessary or even dangerous tests and treatments. 
 NEGOTIATING DRUG PRICES The House bill would authorize the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Some authoritative analysts doubt that the secretary would get better deals than private insurers already get. We believe negotiation could work. It does in other countries. 
 MALPRACTICE REFORM Missing from these bills is any serious attempt to rein in malpractice costs. (Trial lawyers, major supporters of the Democratic Party, have seen to that.) Malpractice awards do drive up insurance premiums for doctors in high-risk specialties, and there is some evidence that doctors engage in ''defensive medicine'' by performing tests and treatments primarily to prove they are not negligent should they get sued. 
 Patients who are injured because of a doctor's or a hospital's negligence must have recourse.We favor reforms that would try to compensate injured people fairly and promptly -- perhaps through mediation or expert tribunals -- but would not prevent them from filing suit as a last resort or cap the awards they could receive. Even then, the savings might be modest. Doctors mostly perform high-cost tests because they want to help their patients and get paid handsomely for doing so.
 Republican critics say, correctly, that the health care bills would saddle the government with large new costs to cover the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance. And they say, incorrectly, that the effort should not move ahead until a sure-fire way is found to rein in rising health care costs. 
 Their arguments overlook the fact that the government is already paying many of these costs, through special payments to hospitals, each time a person without insurance, and with no means to pay, goes to an expensive emergency room for treatment. It also overlooks the fact that both bills are designed to keep deficits from increasing over the next decade or two. 
 It would be unfair, and unnecessary, to leave tens of millions of people uninsured while we wait to figure out ways to hold down the rise in health care costs. 
 This editorial is a part of a continuing series by The Times that is providing a comprehensive examination of the policy challenges and politics behind the debate over health care reform.

HEADLINE: LETTERS: A Salary System for U.S. Doctors?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A New Day for Doctors' Pay'' (Economic View, Nov. 8): 
 In comparing the fee-for-service model in the United States with salary-based systems, Robert H. Frank is correct that ''doctors elsewhere also remain satisfied and respected, though they are paid less than their American counterparts.'' But in arguing that American medical schools ''will be able to attract plenty of talented people willing to work'' under a salaried system, the column doesn't consider several issues young American doctors face: 
 They may graduate from medical school owing more than $200,000 in loans, and are often in their 30s before they complete years of internship and residency. Further, because of wide income disparities and greater social mobility in the United States, they cannot help but compare their incomes and lifestyles with those of their business-world peers, many of whom are paid handsomely with limited personal sacrifice. And American doctors also pay high premiums for malpractice insurance.
 Although I agree that fee-for-service reimbursement can lead to perverse incentives for both physicians and hospitals to overtreat and overspend, physicians must be compensated fairly for their years of sacrifice, long work hours and skill level. 
 Jerome Zisfein, M.D.
 Old Brookville, N.Y., Nov. 8
 To the Editor:
 As a physician 15 years after residency, I have never understood the argument that doctors make more money by ordering more lab tests and procedures. I don't get extra money by ordering lab tests -- the laboratory does, and I need to follow the results. 
 Similarly, with procedures, if I cannot justify the procedure as medically necessary to a patient's insurer, I won't be paid. Additional procedures that are not medically justified would also create increased exposure to malpractice, because the more procedures, the more likely a negative result will occur.

HEADLINE: How Old Is Old Enough?

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
THIS past week the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether children should ever be sentenced to life without parole for crimes that don't involve murder. 
 At the heart of the argument lies a vexing question: When should a person be treated as an adult? 
 The answer, generally, is 18 -- the age when the United States, and the rest of the world, considers young people capable of accepting responsibility for their actions. But there are countless deviations from this benchmark, both around the world (the bar mitzvah, for instance), and within the United States. 
 For drinking, driving, fighting in the military, compulsory schooling, watching an R-rated movie, consenting to sex, getting married, having an abortion or even being responsible for your own finances, the dawn of adulthood in America is all over the place. 
 And if you think separating the men from the boys (or the women from the girls) is difficult today, tracing the history of America's conception of childhood just complicates things further. 
 In the 19th century, teenagers were expected to raise their own children and work in the fields. This was true even though 19th-century teenagers were physically and intellectually less advanced than teenagers today. Thanks to better nutrition and more formal schooling, today's children generally reach puberty earlier and are, at least in theory, more informed about the world around them.
 In other words, the only thing that is consistent about our notions of when a child becomes an adult is our inconsistency, says Steven Mintz, a historian at Columbia University.
 We like to think the threshold is set to protect the welfare of the child, as with statutory rape laws or even movie ratings. But sometimes the cutoff is set for utilitarian reasons: We don't want to hurt young people, but we also don't want young people to hurt us.
 In Florida, for instance, the state got tough on teenage criminals when juvenile crime rates jumped during the 1990s, threatening not only residents and visitors, but Florida's bedrock tourism industry itself. Two such juvenile offenders, one who raped a woman when he was 13, and another who committed armed robbery at 16, brought the appeals heard by the Supreme Court last week.
 Sometimes adulthood is set inconsistently for pragmatic reasons. Maybe we accept that 19-year-olds are not yet fully responsible adults for the purpose of driving a rental car, but hey, we still need someone to drive our tanks in Afghanistan.
 And often the categories are determined by economics, to benefit whoever is making the rules. Some institutions -- say, a law school financial aid office -- dictate that a young person is expected to lean on her parents financially until age 30. Others -- say, a health insurance company -- say that no, a young person is actually expected to stand on her own two feet at age 19.
 These contradictions can be discomfiting. It seems unfair to grant a young person the responsibilities of a grownup without granting that young person the rights of a grownup, too. If the court treats a 13-year-old as an adult, should the DVD rental store, too? What about the local bars?
 Over the years attempts have been made to align these various ages of majority. The voting age was lowered during the Vietnam War, for example, largely because Americans were uncomfortable with a democracy that forced 18-year-olds to die for their country but denied them suffrage.
 But even if you want an elegant, bright line to separate adulthood from childhood, where should it be?
 Since at least Aristotle, scholars have tried to answer this question. And as with so many things, the question has migrated largely from the realm of philosophers to that of scientists.
 Neurological and behavioral research, led by Laurence Steinberg at Temple University, has been particularly influential in recent years. 
 Professor Steinberg, who last week won a $1 million research prize for his work on the development of young people, has found through laboratory experiments that young teenagers seek out risk and have trouble controlling their impulses. That's a very bad combination when it comes to crime, and often a mitigating factor when it comes to judging those crimes.
 These studies helped convince the Supreme Court in 2005 that executing convicts for offenses committed before age 18 was unconstitutional, and the same research is now a centerpiece in the current Supreme Court cases about life without parole.
 But still, scientific research has in many ways further blurred, rather than clarified, the distinction between childhood and adulthood.
 For one, it has shown different people mature at different rates. But more problematically, any given person's abilities also mature at different rates. Young people develop logical reasoning before they develop impulse control, for example. That means kids can recognize bad behavior even before they can overcome the natural urges and social pressures to participate in it. 
 Because young people develop different skills incrementally, rather than all at once, Professor Steinberg says, it makes sense to dole out rights and responsibilities incrementally. Maybe competent voting is different from competent driving, which is different from competent drinking. 
 ''Ask any parent you know,'' Mr. Steinberg said, ''they'll tell you how confused they are that their kids are so smart in some ways, but still do such stupid, stupid things.''

HEADLINE: With Change, Suzuki Tries to Lift Profile

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
AS the 2010 Kizashi comes to market, American Suzuki is promising sweeping changes not only in its vehicles, but in the way it operates. The goal is to raise Suzuki's low profile and put its products on the shopping lists of Americans. 
 Suzuki has shed much of its lineup, which was heavy with rebadged models from Daewoo, the South Korean automaker, and is replacing those also-rans with cars of its own design.
 The Reno subcompact, Forenza compact and Verona midsize sedan are gone. And earlier this year, because of slow sales, Suzuki suspended production of its midsize XL7 sport utility at the plant it shares with General Motors in Ingersoll, Ontario.
 This has left the American operation of the Japanese company with multiple versions of the SX4 (sedan, five-door hatchback and crossover), the Equator pickup truck (a Nissan Frontier in disguise) and the Grand Vitara, a compact sport utility.
 But Suzuki executives insist they are optimistic about the future. They cite some industry forecasts suggesting that auto sales could rebound by 45 percent over the next two years -- and that a lot of those sales will be of small cars and compact S.U.V.'s, which have been relative strengths for Suzuki.
 But in the shorter term, Suzuki has some formidable challenges.
 Its American sales have fallen even more sharply than the industry as a whole, according to figures from J. D. Power & Associates. Sales this year, through October, plunged 54.7 percent from the comparable period a year earlier -- the most of any major automaker in the American market. 
 ''There is no question that they are suffering much worse than the industry as a whole,'' said Jeff Schuster, executive director for global forecasting at J. D. Power.
 Mr. Schuster calls Suzuki a small player in an American market that is getting smaller. While Suzuki's market share had been less than 1 percent before the recession, he said he expected it to be half of that by year-end. He said Suzuki was unlikely to gain market share given how many models it cut.
 If initial positive impressions of the Kizashi hold up, the car may be able to give a lift to Suzuki's reputation on quality -- because, according to some surveys, it couldn't get much worse.
 For years Suzuki hovered near the bottom of the J. D. Power Initial Quality Study, which looks at problems with vehicles after 90 days of ownership. 
 There has already been a glimmer of change. In the 2009 initial quality survey, Suzuki was the most-improved brand, rising to ninth place, from 32nd in 2008. 
 The removal of rebadged Daewoos accounted for much of the gain, said David Sargent, vice president for automotive research at J. D. Power.
 Suzuki is working hard to improve quality, Mr. Sargent said, but with the competition improving as well, relative gains won't come easily.
 ''They are going to have to run hard to try to keep up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Can Public Aid Really Help Business?

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
THE global financial crisis is prompting huge government interventions to stimulate the economies of the United States and many other nations. The burning question is this: Can public-sector initiatives in the private sector be successful, or are they inevitably doomed to failure?
 Josh Lerner tries to answer that question, as it pertains to early-stage businesses, in ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Why Public Efforts to Boost Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Have Failed -- and What to Do About It'' (Princeton University Press, $27.95). 
 ''To be sure, government has a role in stimulating a vibrant entrepreneurial sector,'' Mr. Lerner declares. ''But at the same time, it is easy for the government to overstep its bounds and squander its investments. Only by designing a program that reflects an understanding of, and willingness to learn from, the entrepreneurial process can governments be effective.''
 Mr. Lerner brings impressive academic credentials and practical experience to his examination of public-private issues. He is the Jacob H. Schiff professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School and has done consulting work for governments around the globe.
 Mr. Lerner says that ''far more often than not, public programs have been failures'' when it comes to entrepreneurship and venture capital. Even so, he says many of these failures could have been avoided if some simple steps had been taken. 
 He cites the Small Business Investment Company program, which began offering federal loans and tax incentives 50 years ago. Critics quickly contended that it conducted minimal review of its recipients, Mr. Lerner says. Despite some success, the program is marred by a bureaucracy that scares off the best venture capitalists, he says. 
 Mr. Lerner writes that earlier in this decade, a grant offered through the Small Business Innovation Research Program, a government effort to help small high-tech companies, was pulled from Intronn, a company researching a promising cure for cystic fibrosis. The reason, he writes, was that Intronn had sold a stake to a venture capital firm that had more than 500 employees; that, in turn, forced Intronn to abandon its cystic fibrosis research.
 Mr. Lerner says problems with public-sector help have been common worldwide. He relates stories of Norway, decades ago, squandering a substantial portion of its oil wealth on ''ill-conceived new businesses begun by relatives of parliamentarians and bureaucrats,'' and of the Malaysian government opening a huge complex called BioValley in 2005 without first confirming demand for the facility, which became mocked as the ''Valley of Bio-Ghosts.'' 
 But he says partnerships of the public and private sectors are still crucial, for at least two reasons. The first, he says, is the link between innovation and economic growth. The second is the link between innovation and government-supported new businesses, which typically take on much riskier and potentially more rewarding projects than older, bureaucratically hidebound giants.
 In reply to skeptics who say public-sector interventions can never be effective, he offers a section titled ''The (Uncensored) Story of Silicon Valley.'' In it, he documents that government was a catalyst in the growth of the high-tech sector and numerous prominent companies.
 In World War I and World War II, he notes, military contracts spurred the growth of companies like Magnavox and Hewlett-Packard. More recently, he says, the S.B.I.C. provided support Apple, Compaq and Intel before they went public.
 Mr. Lerner provides more than a dozen rules of thumb for effective government intervention in the private sector. Attesting to his own belief in capitalism, he urges governments to ''let the market decide the direction'' of their stimulus programs and the selection of the appropriate companies and venture capital funds to carry them out.
 ''Rather than fund dozens of groups immediately, programs should first fund a handful of entities,'' he advises. ''As feedback comes in from the early participants, second and third batches of capital may be invested, or the capital of the pioneering firms and funds may be supplemented.''
 LIKEWISE, he cautions against the me-too approach that national and regional governments often take in supporting entrepreneurial projects. He says, for example, that 49 of the 50 states recently started major programs to promote the biotechnology industry in hopes of creating regional activity clusters. 
 ''Realistically,'' he says, ''only a handful of these states had the basic scientific resources and the supporting infrastructure (e.g., lawyers versed in biotechnology patent law and financing practice) to support a successful cluster, so the bulk of these funds were wasted.'' 
 The herd mentality, Mr. Lerner adds, is often further fueled by political expediency. ''All too often technology transfer offices are encouraged to maximize the short-run returns from licensing transactions,'' he says. ''This leads to an emphasis on transactions with established corporations that can make substantial upfront payments, even though licensing new technologies to start-ups can yield substantial returns in the long run.''
 The book is refreshingly easy for a layman to read, and much of the advice is common-sensical, which is as much a weakness as a strength. He emphasizes the importance of combating so-called agency problems, an academic euphemism for the graft and corruption in government programs that he finds to exist around the globe. His remedies involve things like ''creating firewalls between elected officials and program administrators'' and ''careful assessment of the program.'' 
 But, alas, history shows that politicians and bureaucrats don't always use common sense.

HEADLINE: Town Once Known as Inclusive Is Riven by Housing Dispute

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: MILBRIDGE, Me. 

 BODY:
Down a rural road where wood smoke spirals from chimneys in the settling twilight, a five-acre lot thick with spruce trees is the unlikely site of a dream deferred. 
 This is the intended spot for a small apartment complex for farmworkers, a few hundred of whom are Hispanics living year-round in this remote corner of Down East Maine. They harvest blueberries, process seafood and assemble holiday wreaths, and most live in trailers near the fields and factories where they work. 
 A local nonprofit group won a $1 million federal grant last year to build the six-unit complex, a first step toward expanding housing options for the immigrant laborers, most of whom come from Mexico and Honduras. 
 But then ugly words were uttered, a petition was circulated, and voters in this town of 1,300 approved a moratorium on multifamily housing in June, blocking the project. 
 Now the group, Mano en Mano -- Spanish for Hand in Hand -- has filed a federal lawsuit alleging discrimination under the Fair Housing Act and the equal protection clause of the Constitution. And Milbridge, which once won acclaim for its efforts to welcome and integrate immigrants, is smarting from accusations of racism. 
 ''We have always been very open and receptive and accommodating,'' said Lewis Pinkham, the town manager, police chief and code enforcement officer. ''In my personal opinion, this got blown out of proportion.''
 According to the lawsuit and local newspaper accounts, some residents opposed the project on grounds that farmworkers' children overburdened the schools; others predicted it would be a drug haven. The petition, signed by 48 residents, said jobs should be saved for local lobstermen, whose industry is suffering, and not ''given out to minorities that may move into these units.'' 
 Hispanics are a rare sight in Maine; more than 96 percent of the population is white, tying it with Vermont as the least diverse state. And while most immigrant groups here have clustered in cities -- Somalis in Lewiston, for example, and Sudanese in Portland -- Hispanics tend to scatter through smaller communities, making their ranks feel even thinner. 
 Not so in Milbridge, though, where Anais Tomezsko, director of Mano en Mano, said Hispanics made up perhaps 10 percent of the population or more. Washington County, which produces most of the nation's wild blueberries, draws thousands of them every summer to help with the harvest. And when a sea cucumber processing plant opened here in 1995, offering year-round jobs, some began to stay. 
 ''It felt very isolated,'' said Edith Flores, 30, who came with her parents a decade ago to work at the sea cucumber plant. ''But it was sort of like the town where I come from in Mexico, where everyone knows each other. It was calm, peaceful.'' 
 Beth Russet, a nurse practitioner and founding member of Mano en Mano, said their presence has shored up the town as the population of rural Maine has aged and dwindled.
 ''It's great that there are young families excited to stay here,'' she said. 
 But housing has been a constant challenge, Ms. Tomezsko said. The region's only subsidized apartment complex has a long waiting list, she said, and the few rental homes in Milbridge are usually too expensive for farmworkers -- about $500 a month for a one-bedroom. ''We have two or three people coming in every week asking about housing,'' she said, ''and we're usually at a loss.''
 Ms. Russet said the town initially embraced year-round immigrants, even holding potluck suppers to help them fit in. Mano en Mano gave Spanish lessons -- to bank employees who were struggling to communicate with Hispanic customers, among others -- and the town won a grant to tutor immigrants. 
 But the constant drain of jobs has made native residents less receptive, others said, even though most shun the low-paying farm and factory work that immigrants do.
 The county's unemployment rate is 10.4 percent, and 20 percent of its population lives in poverty. In a letter to a local newspaper, one resident pointed out that many native Mainers, not just immigrants, live in tumbledown trailers. 
 ''When there is very little work,'' the letter said, ''bringing more people in does not solve the problem.''
 In another letter, the resident, B. J. Seymour, wrote that multifamily housing complexes ''are popular as halfway homes for recovering addicts, transients, sex offenders, seasonal workers, parolees and those with limited mental abilities.'' 
 The building moratorium was scheduled to expire last month, but at a town meeting in September, residents voted to extend it. They also voted down a proposal to exempt the Mano en Mano project from the moratorium and let it move forward.
 Tenants at Mano en Mano's housing project -- the first of its kind in Maine -- would have to be American citizens or permanent residents who made a certain percentage of their income from agriculture or aquaculture under the terms of the federal grant, from the Department of Agriculture. They could be of any race.
 But Mr. Pinkham said residents were more irked by the fact that Mano en Mano, as a nonprofit group, would be exempt from paying property taxes. 
 ''Everybody feels that everybody should pay their own fair way,'' he said, estimating that the complex would pay $10,000 a year in property taxes if privately owned. ''That's what I've heard the most complaints about.''
 As for the charges of racism, Mr. Pinkham said the town ''can't gag people.'' ''No matter where you go,'' he added, ''you can have one or two people stand up in a crowd and say some comments that aren't the sentiment of the entire town.''
 Mr. Pinkham said the town imposed the building moratorium not to block Mano en Mano's project but to revise its land-use laws.
 Residents will vote Monday on a zoning ordinance that would likely allow the project to move forward, he said.
 Ms. Flores said that during a recent town meeting about the project, the hostility toward it -- and toward Hispanics, she said -- made her feel like ''a cat surrounded by dogs.'' 
 ''I'm brown, dark hair, and it doesn't matter if I'm a citizen of the U.S.,'' she said. ''Just like everyone else in the Latino community, I'm looked at as a newcomer who's taking away jobs or asking for more than what we should have.''

 Re ''A Not-So-Guilty Pleasure: Despite Recession, Sales of Shoes Are Soaring'' (Business Day, Nov. 6):
 I couldn't agree more with Marie Driscoll, who says she thinks of her shoes as her ''car.''
 In fact, I often justify my accessory expenditures with this analogy: In New York, a woman's coat is her car, her shoes are her wheels, and her handbag is her trunk. She needs all these things to commute in comfort and style.

HEADLINE: Closing Out a Season Farmers Want to Forget

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, Conn. 

 BODY:
 ON a raw, unseasonably cold mid-October day, Shelly Oechsler pointed to a few half-filled bins of squash behind her farm stand, where produce from Botticello Farms, which her family has owned for more than 30 years, is sold. 
 ''Normally at this time of the year what you would be seeing would be triple rows over here,'' she said, indicating a row and a half against a greenhouse, then pointing toward an empty space behind the store. ''And you'd be seeing double rows over here. It's way, way down.''
 Like other farmers throughout the region, Butch Botticello, Ms. Oechsler's father, considers it a minor miracle that there is any squash at all. Plagued with inclement weather, disease and complications from both, farms throughout Connecticut, New Jersey and New York generally suffered one of the worst, if not the worst, growing season in memory. By the time the heat and sun finally arrived, in August, mid- to late-season fruits, especially blueberries, cranberries and apples, swollen by the rains, were the only crops that benefited. Mr. Botticello estimated his overall crop loss this year at about 45 percent. 
 It takes a 30 percent loss of any single crop in a county to trigger a disaster request from the federal Farm Service Agency office in an affected state. Losses are still being tallied, but most counties in New York and New Jersey have been declared agricultural disaster areas, and Connecticut is awaiting word from the federal government on the same declaration for nearly all of its counties. 
 ''This year is one of our exceptionally bad years,'' said Marsha Jette, who has been with the agency for 39 years, becoming Connecticut executive director this year. In 2008 Connecticut's farm cash receipts totaled $600 million, New York's were $4.7 billion, and New Jersey's were $1.1 billion. All are expected to be substantially lower this year.
 The rain and chilly weather that began in May never let up until mid-July. Rainfall totals reported by the National Weather Service for the region's airports were generally twice the monthly average, sometimes three times the average -- like the more than 11 inches that fell on Bradley airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., in July. Some areas also suffered from hailstorms and the occasional tornado. The effects cascaded so that when the weather finally stabilized, most farms did not have enough time to recover. Even a later-than-usual frost did not help. 
 ''You cannot make up the early-season losses,'' Ms. Oechsler said. ''You can hope the late season will sustain you for a season next year.''
 At most farms, rain and cold meant late planting; fields too muddy for farm equipment; seed, fertilizer and herbicides that washed away; poor pollination; rampaging weeds; crops like greens so saturated they were prone to rot quickly; and slow crop maturation that led to smaller and later yields and that especially hurt slow-growing vine crops like pumpkins and winter squash. Most troublesome of all was a host of weather-borne diseases and afflictions, most notably late blight. This strain of the same disease responsible for the Irish potato famine of the 19th century devastated the normally high-income tomato crops throughout the Northeast, including those at Botticello Farms, which lost 12,000 plants, more than half of their harvest. 
 At Waldingfield Farm in Washington, Conn., where certified organic tomatoes are Patrick and Quincy Horan's chief crop, late blight ruined 17,000 plants in what was the final blow after weeks of rain and a hailstorm on June 26 that destroyed 6,500 early tomato plants and all the farm's midsummer staple crops. 
 ''We were just a couple of frogs short of a Bible story,'' Patrick Horan said. ''It was surreal. It just kept raining and raining and raining.'' 
 The tomato loss -- about 95 percent of the crop -- meant Mr. Horan could not make the bottled sauce he sells for winter income. Like many farmers he is uninsured, having calculated that it was not worth paying the premium because the percentage of loss needed for the insurance to kick in was so high. That means the only compensation for his lost income will come through the disaster declaration in the form of a low-interest federal loan -- something that sits poorly with him and many other farmers. 
 ''I don't love having more loans,'' said Meredith Compton, who with her husband, Jeremy, owns Peaceful Valley Orchards in Pittstown, N.J. But the Comptons may have no choice. A late July hailstorm that lasted less than a minute shredded their 85 acres of crops. They replanted some vegetables, but their main crop, tree fruit, was gone.
 ''We go into the winter behind the 8 ball as far as income goes,'' said Ms. Compton, saying that many farmers borrow money in the spring to finance planting. ''This year it will probably be a lot more.''
 On Long Island, 25 days of rain out of 30 in June ruined Phil Schmitt's rotation of leafy greens on his 165-acre farm in Riverhead. ''It was a mess,'' he said. ''Hopefully there'll be a little profit at the end of the year. I think it's a big hope, to be honest with you.''
 Having any crop is not enough to guarantee success in 2009. Most growers cited additional costs like spraying more to keep moisture-related diseases at bay. The drop-off in home building, among other factors, meant sod and ornamental plant farmers had fewer sales. Growers could not always raise prices to make up the difference because of the economy, and sometimes they were competing with wholesalers in other regions who were having better summers. And because of the rain, hay farmers could not produce their critical first cutting, which must be dry to sell as top-priced feed instead of low-priced mulch. That also means many dairy farmers now are faced with finding expensive feed for the winter. 
 But the final insult fell on growers who rely on weekend pick-your-own business for their best profits. You got it -- rainy weekends.
 ''You only have so many weeks to move this product,'' said Rick Macsuga, a marketing representative with the Connecticut Department of Agriculture. ''It's not like Macy's or something, where you can stock it for next year.''
 Weather is usually something most farmers take in stride. But those facing near-total losses were sometimes forced far beyond their comfort zones. 
 ''It's stressful,'' said Keith Stewart, a certified organic grower in Orange County, N.Y., who has been a fixture at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan for 23 years. After losing his tomatoes to late blight and his shallots and onions to downy mildew, he decided to do something he never does: spray. Not only did he have to buy organic copper spray, he also had to invest in spray equipment.
 ''Spraying is not something you want to do anyway. It's not the way I like to do things,'' said Mr. Stewart, 65. ''It's a tough year and I'm not happy, but I'm not about to go under.''

HEADLINE: Las Vegas: Encore

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
THE BASICS
 If Steve Wynn's last two Sin City resorts -- Wynn Las Vegas in 2005 and the Bellagio in 1998 -- were about bringing a whiff of Park Avenue to the Strip, the Encore is about the hotelier's loosening his pearls and swinging a little. Encore, which opened in December, is meant to be younger and hipper -- ''boutique,'' as much as a 2,034-room megahotel with an estimated price tag of $2.3 billion can be considered as such. The smallish casino, lit up like a carnival by dozens of cherry-red chandeliers, overlooks the pool. No strollers allowed. Elevators have black alligator-skin detailing. The shopping? More Rock & Republic, less Oscar de la Renta.
 LOCATION 
 The rust-colored hotel arcs next to the similarly shaped Wynn; together they resemble a pair of Richard Serra sculptures. Across the street is the sprawling Fashion Show Mall. It feels quiet on this part of the Strip, perhaps because Encore is not surrounded by casinos, for now. A church is a neighbor to the north, while a nearby parcel of land awaits the Plaza Las Vegas, an $8 billion, seven-tower behemoth that has been delayed by the recession.
 THE ROOM
 Chaotic but calming. One wall of my ''resort suite,'' the hotel's standard room, was covered in a vertigo-inducing hound's-tooth; another was entirely mirrored. Millwork was either white sycamore or high-gloss black. The artwork ranged from classic modern (a reproduction of a Matisse lithograph) to contemporary (a canvas of spectral yellow rings). Somehow it all worked, but calling the room a suite was a stretch. A partial wall -- essentially a counter with a 42-inch flat-screen television on it -- separated the bedroom from the sitting area. I appreciated the fancy control panel next to the bed when it came to closing the drapes, but never did figure out the buttons for lighting.
 THE BATHROOM
 Roomy but routine. Twin sinks dominated one wall, the tub and a separate (glass-enclosed) shower the other. The toilet was hidden in an alcove with a door. The flat-screen television was nice, but a couple of conveniently placed towel hooks would have been nicer.
 AMENITIES
 Fax machine? Check. An iPod alarm clock? Check. Champagne in the minibar? Check. Downstairs, there are eight bars and five restaurants (the fanciest of which is Sinatra, where fish entrees start at $41). There's a spa with 37 treatment rooms. (The signature ''Good Luck Ritual'' treatment combines a Thai herbal massage, a peppermint foot rub and ''wild lime'' scalp salve; 80 minutes, $250.) There is no buffet, but The Las Vegas Review-Journal recently rated the one at the Wynn, accessible through a short shopping esplanade, as the city's best.
 ROOM SERVICE
 It started out poorly: An attendant told us there was ''zero chance'' of getting a newspaper, local or otherwise, delivered with breakfast. The food arrived a short 17 minutes later. A fruit plate was pricey at $22, but the assortment was perfectly ripe. An $18 breakfast sandwich -- two dainty croissants with ham and melted cheese -- was delicious if greasy. A large pot of coffee ($14) came in two small French presses. 
 BOTTOM LINE
 Until the economy improves, the opulent hotel will come across a bit like a boom-times relic. But there's always a market for quality, and Encore offers that in spades. Rooms start at $179 during the week.

HEADLINE: Is There a Method in Cellphone Madness?

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
HERE'S a consolation prize to the millions who recoil in bafflement from cellphone companies' labyrinthine price plans, with their ever more intricate arrays of minutes, messages and megabytes: Economists don't understand them, either.
 ''The whole pricing thing is weird,'' said Barry Nalebuff, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management. ''You pay $60 to make your first phone call. Your next 1,000 minutes are free. Then the minute after that costs 35 cents.'' 
 To economists, it simply doesn't make sense to make chatterboxes pay that penalty. After all, most businesses tend to give discounts to customers who buy more.
 It would be easy to see the cellphone companies simply as avaricious oligopolists trying to gouge consumers for every penny they can. And in some senses they are aiming to maximize revenue, at least as much as the market will let them. 
 But understanding the psychological nuances of how a price plan affects customers' behavior is at least as important to running a cellphone company today as knowing how radio waves spread over a city. Those high charges for going over your allotted minutes, for example, are designed to cause you enough pain that you will switch to a plan with a higher regular fee. 
 ''You give people a really good bargain on this bucket of minutes,'' explained Roger Entner, a senior vice president for telecommunications research at Nielsen. ''People are risk averse, so you have a relatively high overage charge, which gets people to overbuy. You also get really predictable revenue out of it, which Wall Street loves.''
 Neither the cellphone companies nor their customers, as it turns out, always act in the rational way that economists might predict. Consumers often put immediate gratification and the avoidance of unpleasant surprises above their long-term interests. The companies, meanwhile, are trying to meet the sometimes irrational expectations of investors, who want growth without too much nasty volatility, even if their profits suffer. 
 Here are a few other examples of how the dance between cellphone companies and their customers is, to use Professor Nalebuff's term, ''weird'':
 When Apple and AT&T started offering the iPhone for $199, plus $30 a month for Internet access, sales shot up, even though the previous deal -- $399 for the phone and $20 a month -- cost less over a two-year contract.
 Phone companies have doubled the price for text messages, to 20 cents each, in recent years, even though they cost almost nothing to deliver.
 When companies introduce certain discounts -- like Sprint's recent offer of free calling to any mobile number -- the effect is that customers often switch to more expensive plans. 
 One thing that is costing cellphone companies a lot of money to provide is the one thing they offer for a flat rate with no limits: surfing the Web on gadgets like the iPhone.
 There is nothing obvious or necessary about this approach to pricing. In many parts of the world, you simply buy a phone from a store, then buy a card that entitles you to talk for a set number of minutes. Use up the card and buy more minutes. No contracts. No surprising charges. No confused economists.
 But for all the complexity, cellphones American-style do have a certain supersized logic. Americans spend more money each month on their wireless bills than people in any other country. But the money we spend buys a whole lot more talk time and text messages than it does elsewhere. On average, we effectively spend about 5 cents per minute of talk time and about a penny a text message, lower than anywhere else in the developed world. 
 This year, the deals are becoming even better. For people who want to surf the Web on their phones, wireless companies are willing to sell them iPhones, BlackBerrys and other sleek gadgets for hundreds of dollars less than they cost. The catch, of course, is that customers need to pay $30 or so extra each month for Internet access. For those who just want to talk and text without a fancy phone, there is hot competition to offer lower- price, unlimited phone plans that don't require contracts. 
 In many ways, however, the least important factor in setting prices is the actual cost of providing cellular service. Cellphone companies resemble airlines, that other industry whose oblique prices exasperate consumers. Think of a cellphone network as one giant airplane that costs tens of billions of dollars to build. The cellphone companies don't really know how much it costs to handle a call to Aunt Suzy in Syracuse, any more than an airline can calculate a specific cost for Seat 12B. 
 ''Service providers don't have a good measure of their costs,'' said Philip Marshall, an analyst for the Yankee Group. ''They don't have the ability to say if they are going to make money'' on any particular plan.
 PUT simply, all a phone company wants is to get as much money as possible each month from its customers. Then it hopes that this total is more than its costs.
 That's why the carriers put great stock in a measure called average revenue per user, or ARPU (pronounced ''ARE-poo.'') A climbing ARPU makes for happy phone companies and happy investors.
 But in fact, over the last decade, total ARPU has been declining slightly, a result of competition. But unlike the airlines, the two largest cellphone carriers -- Verizon Wireless and AT&T -- have healthy profit margins. The distant third and fourth -- Sprint and T-Mobile -- have had a harder time keeping up.
 Every few years, the companies adopt new technology that expands their networks' capacity. For a while, they passed the benefit of these improvements to customers by periodically increasing the number of minutes in pricing plans. But since 2004, the basic rate for the lowest-priced plan at the largest carriers has stayed constant, at $39.99 for 450 prime-time minutes. 
 The cellphone companies wanted to avoid the sort of price wars that occurred a decade earlier in the long-distance market. So they decided to compete by offering distinctive goodies that cost little, yet had a lot of customer appeal. 
 Verizon Wireless focused, for example, on offering free calls to other Verizon customers. In response, T-Mobile, the smallest of the major carriers, concocted the My Faves plan, which gave users free calling to any five numbers, whatever carrier they used.
 In 2004, Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) introduced what it called rollover minutes, with plans that allow unused minutes of talk time to be used in the following months. 
 An economist would see Cingular's move as a price cut. After all, why buy a big plan as a cushion against what might be an occasional month of high use when you can accumulate your minutes from low-use months? In fact, it worked the other way around, encouraging people to buy larger plans. It turned out that people were happy to buy extra minutes if they knew they could keep them, rather than having them expire.
 In May 2004, Sprint answered the growing complexity of cellphone plans with a much more straightforward approach. Its Fair and Flexible plan offered 300 minutes for $35, and each additional block of 50 minutes for $2.50. It was a plan that an economist could love.
 Unfortunately for Sprint, customers hated it because their bills varied a great deal from month to month. ''Nobody thinks about getting the lowest cost per minute,'' said a former pricing executive for Sprint who asked that his name not be used to avoid offending his former employer. 
 Sprint dropped the plan in early 2007, and reintroduced plans with big buckets of minutes and higher fees for going over the allotted time. 
 Despite allthe carriers' efforts to lure people to buy ever more expensive voice plans, the average revenue per user from voice service has been falling since 2003, according to statistics from CTIA, the wireless trade group.
 MORE recently, the carriers have confronted another problem: People are talking less on their mobile phones, and texting instead. In the first half of this year, the average wireless customer sent 518 texts a month and made 220 phone calls, according to CTIA figures. (That average, of course, is driven up by the furious texting of teenagers.) 
 Revenue from voice plans has fallen 31 percent since peaking in 2003. To fill that hole, the carriers raised the price of a text message from 10 cents to 15 cents, and later to 20 cents. These fees provided nice cash, but as with the voice charges, the main purpose was to persuade customers to subscribe to text-message plans that cost up to $20 a month for unlimited texting on AT&T and Verizon and $10 a month on Sprint and T-Mobile.
 ''It really makes sense, if you are texting at all, to buy an unlimited text plan and not have to worry about it,'' said Will Souder, a vice president for pricing at Sprint. Fewer people are running up big bills from 20-cent text messages, but the company's ARPU has gone up anyway because so many customers signed up for unlimited text plans.
 THE biggest boon to the wireless carriers has been Apple's iPhone, which increased interest in using a mobile phone to surf the Web. 
 When it entered the smartphone business in 2007, Apple tried to turn upside down the traditional model in which carriers subsidized the cost of handsets. It initially wanted customers to pay $599 -- later cut to $399 -- for their handsets, but they would pay AT&T, its exclusive carrier, only $20 a month for the Internet access, a portion of which would go to Apple. 
 Consumers balked at the high upfront cost. By the second generation of the iPhone, Apple reverted to a traditional subsidy model. The iPhone that now costs consumers $199 actually costs AT&T about $550, according to analysts' estimates. To cover the subsidy, the Internet price increased to $30 a month. 
 Yes, consumers come out behind on that deal, to the tune of $40 over two years, but it was only when the opening price dropped to $199 that iPhone sales started to skyrocket. 
 Now all the carriers are selling heavily subsidized smartphones. They hate this state of affairs -- and wish that American consumers would just pay full price for the phones, the way people do in Europe. T-Mobile recently introduced an option for customers to pay a lower monthly bill if they buy their own phones, and even offered to spread the handset cost over two years with no interest charges.
 ''They are trying to break the model and get away from the big subsidies that are going into these phones,'' said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS Securities. ''There is something to that, but I'm not sure it will work because people want their brand-new shiny phones.''
 The growth of smartphones has especially benefited AT&T, which has the iPhone, and Verizon, which is seen as having the best network. Sprint, at No. 3, has been losing customers for several years. In addition to trying to improve its customer service, Sprint has started several pricing changes to try to stem the losses. 
 Sprint's boldest move has been to offer a $50 flat-rate plan, including unlimited voice, text and Internet, through its prepaid Boost brand. In prepaid plans, like those popularized by MetroPCS and Leap Wireless, you don't have to sign a contract, but you also have to buy a handset without a subsidy. Boost has garnered a net 2.1 million new accounts since introducing the unlimited offer early this year. T-Mobile and AT&T have responded in recent months by offering $60 unlimited plans. 
 Boost was successful, said Matt Carter, its president, because its plan stood out from the multitiered offerings of traditional wireless carriers -- including its parent, Sprint. ''There is a lot of complexity out there in the marketplace,'' he said. ''What we are is a force for simplicity.''
 Lower prices that are predictable and easy to understand. Maybe an economist won't find that weird. But will the consumer?

HEADLINE: Stalking Saabs That Soared

BYLINE: By STEVEN ROSSI

 BODY:
SAAB is a relatively young and proudly offbeat automaker, and from the start it has appealed to those who appreciate the unconventional. For aficionados, ''Find your own road'' was more than a slogan.
 Now, with the company in ownership limbo -- awaiting consummation of a Chinese-backed deal in which Koenigsegg, a tiny Swedish supercar maker, is to buy Saab from General Motors -- its future is murky, to say the least. But whatever comes, the Saab legacy is secure, including an innovative streak that helped to transform an aircraft maker into a car company that packed personality into every model.
 Saab is an acronym for Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget, or Swedish Airplane Company, founded in 1937 to build planes for the Swedish Air Force. After the war (during which Sweden remained neutral) Saab turned to auto production to keep its plants running. As its engineers shifted from aeronautics to automobiles, they introduced some unorthodox approaches. (In those early days, engineers -- not marketers -- called the shots at Saab.) 
 Relying on proven aircraft principles, the first Saabs had a teardrop shape for optimal aerodynamics and minimal wind resistance. From the side, the cars resembled a cross-section of a wing, and the design, which resembled an airplane fuselage, was both light and strong and also relatively spacious.
 Given that basic logic and family values are intrinsic to Swedish culture, along with an appreciation for simple but elegant engineering, a 2-stroke engine was first specified instead of the more common 4-stoke motor. A 2-stroke is small, light, simple to make, easy to maintain and powerful for its size. Those same attributes apply to the 2-stroke motors still used in weed trimmers and chainsaws -- and that still require a mix of gasoline and oil.
 The first production model was dubbed 92 -- the next number in the sequence of Saab aircraft projects. That car appeared in 1949 and had just 2 cylinders. It also had front-wheel drive, highly unusual at the time, which made it easier to get around in harsh Swedish winters; the flat floor also made the cabin more useful. Front drive would become a distinguishing characteristic of all Saabs until after G.M. absorbed the company in 2000.
 The 92 distinguished itself in rally competitions, despite a serious shortage of power, and quickly evolved into the 3-cylinder Saab 93. The 93 made its American debut at the 1956 New York auto show and the next year became the first Saab officially imported into the United States. 
 The Saab 93 provided basic, but fun, transportation. Provisions for seat belts were added in 1958. The Saab safety ethic, along with an emphasis on driving satisfaction, would became a core part of the corporate identity.
 The 3-cylinder 2-stroke engine also made its way into a most distinctive station wagon, the 95, which came with a rear-facing third-row seat. A striking two-seat sports car, the Sonett -- a name said to echo the exclamation ''So neat!'' -- even joined the mix.
 But only true Saabophiles -- a group that seemed to include college professors and people who wore sports car caps -- were willing to accept the drudgery of combining gas and oil, even though automatic oil injection was added for convenience' sake.
 By the late 1960s the 2-stroke engine finally succumbed to new emissions standards. In 1967, Saab began using a 4-stroke V-4 engine obtained from Ford of Europe. By then, Saab was already selling an improved version of the 93 called the 96. The 95 wagon and the Sonett sports car were re-engineered to accept the 4-stroke engine as well.
 The next model to emerge was the 99, in 1969. (The project number for the Sonett was 97, and 98 was an airplane designation.)
 The 99 was bigger and boxier than the 96, but still packed with innovations. To help it slip through the air and simultaneously keep occupants out of harm's way, it featured a heavily bowed windshield -- so much that it proved a challenge to develop windshield wipers that followed the pronounced curvature.
 Another new safety feature that would become a Saab hallmark was the floor-mounted ignition switch. Since it was then common to situate the ignition switch on the dashboard, the idea was to move it to a place where the key wouldn't maim the driver's knee in a crash. 
 The 99 also had a 4-cylinder engine, but it came from Triumph, the English sports car maker. A similar engine went on to power the Triumph TR7, but both powerplants proved disappointing. 
 In 1969 Saab merged with Scania, the Swedish maker of heavy-duty trucks, and gained engine-making expertise. By 1972, Saab was building its own engines.
 The 99 EMS, a model that had sporting pretensions but little under the hood to back them up, was soon blessed with a turbocharged engine. A Saab legend was born: the 99 Turbo was one of the earliest executive-class sport sedans, not only fast but fairly economical.
 That car was short-lived, given that the 99 was replaced in 1979 by the 900 -- essentially, a 99 with a longer front end for improved crashworthiness. The 900 was offered with a turbo, too, but may be best remembered as the basis for another Swedish surprise.
 At the insistence of Saab's American importer, the company cut the roof off the car to create the 900 Convertible. At the time, new convertibles had all but disappeared from the market; Saab thus virtually reinvented the modern four-passenger convertible.
 As Saab continued to move upscale, it brought out a bigger and more luxurious offering, the 9000, in 1986. Often called the last true Saab by the cognescenti, this car was the product of a joint venture with Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia. Still, Saab's engineers managed to inject a dose of their Swedish safety ethic into the multinational effort. 
 The 9000 was available as a stately sedan and, more significantly, as a practical hatchback. The line included the 9000 Aero hatchback, which could be seen as the ultimate Saab, given its combination of performance and practicality; enthusiasts have called it ''a five-door Porsche.''
 Today, classic Saabs are becoming more sought after by fanatically loyal collectors who appreciate their engineering virtues, fun-to-drive factor, practicality and safety -- the same attributes that set the cars apart when they rolled out of the factory in Trollhattan.

HEADLINE: Universities Turn to Consultants to Trim Budgets

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
When Holden Thorp, the chancellor of the University of North Carolina, was looking for ways to cut the university's budget, he did what many executives in private industry do -- hired a management consultant.
 The consultant, Bain & Company, came up with recommendations that it said could save the university more than $150 million a year. They included centralizing some of the university's widely dispersed procurement operations (up to $45 million) and information technology functions (up to $19 million) and simplifying its organizational structure (up to $12 million). 
 And since Mr. Thorp hired Bain, both Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley, have followed suit. In each case, the management consultants examined business functions but stayed away from academic issues like courseloads and tenure. 
 ''Like any other large organization,'' Mr. Thorp said, ''we hire people, we buy stuff, we connect to the Internet, we build buildings and take care of our property, and we wanted Bain to look at how we could carry out those functions as efficiently as possible.'' 
 ''I thought someone from outside the university world would provide a new perspective,'' he added. 
 Bain did offer a new take on a university known for its teaching and research and its beautiful old campus: the report summed up the university with a 10-color organizational chart with 380 little boxes, each representing a department. 
 For all its academic prominence, the 107-page report found, the university has plenty of inefficiencies. For example, more than half its managers have three or fewer people reporting directly to them. 
 In addition to the recommended changes that could save up to $161 million a year, the report suggested reining in the more than 100 centers and institutes that have sprung up around the university, many with their own finance, information technology and human resources departments. 
 ''We've already done some of that,'' Mr. Thorp said recently. ''The Institute for Outdoor Drama isn't getting any more state funding.'' 
 While most of Bain's recommendations made intuitive sense, Mr. Thorp said, it would have been far harder without the report to know just how to address the problem areas. 
 ''I felt there were too many layers, but I didn't know exactly what and where,'' he said. ''We're trying to cut out two layers.'' 
 At North Carolina, the consulting project was financed by an anonymous donor, who specified that Bain should be the company to do the analysis and that the cost should not be disclosed. 
 At Berkeley, Robert J. Birgeneau, the chancellor, said the Bain contract would cost $3 million -- and hopefully save far more. 
 ''If we could save $30, $40, $50 million for an investment of $3 million, I'd be ecstatic,'' said Dr. Birgeneau, whose campus has been hit this year with particularly brutal budget cuts. ''I'm a physicist, not an expert on organizational structures. But I believe we can be more efficient.'' 
 For example, he said, Berkeley has one human resources person for every 85 employees, when the university norm is one for 130 and the industry norm is one for 200. 
 ''We have already successfully consolidated some research functions,'' Dr. Birgeneau said, ''and we want to get a comprehensive view of procurement and I.T. and H.R. across the university to see if there's consolidation we should be doing there, too.''
 Shrinking endowments and cuts in state financing have forced many colleges and universities, public and private, to turn to hiring freezes, layoffs and furloughs. But for long-term solvency, many will need to find longer-term ways to trim their budgets without damaging their academic mission. 
 At the same time, parents and politicians alike have become increasingly angry that tuition has been rising far more quickly than inflation -- and that the growth in support staff in recent years has far outpaced the growth in enrollment. 
 Still, some university employees criticize the hiring of Bain, or any outside corporate-oriented consulting firm, to advise on university budget cuts. 
 ''I don't see it as being very productive or valid or worthwhile,'' said Tanya Smith, president of Local 1 of University Professional and Technical Employees, which represents about 900 Berkeley employees. ''What we're seeing is centralization and treatment of the university as if it were a corporation. And I'm just not sure education and efficiency are on the same page.'' 
 Michael Mankins, a Bain partner, said that while there were many differences between corporations and universities -- chief among them that universities do not exist to maximize profits -- there are also many similarities. 
 ''Most corporations can save 15 to 30 percent by standardizing their approach to procurement, and most universities can as well,'' Mr. Mankins said. ''Information technology tends to be very fragmented at corporations, and the same tends to be true in higher education.''
 With those guidelines and the publicly available North Carolina report, why should universities hire a consultant and not just start streamlining procurement and information technology? 
 ''Folks who look at the reports will know that procurement is a major area, I.T. is a major area, and reducing the number of organizational layers is a major area, but just because you know procurement's a problem doesn't give you the expertise of having handled 930 procurement problems in the last decade,'' Mr. Mankins said. ''Most doctors don't do self-diagnosis, and the same reasoning applies in higher education.'' 
 David J. Skorton, the president of Cornell, said he was using the financial crisis as further motivation to grapple with administrative costs. 
 ''We know we have had too much of a proliferation of assistant deans and assistants to ... '' Dr. Skorton said. ''And this crisis has stiffened my spine about it. My office has gone down from seven to five, people I'm never going to replace, and that has to trickle down.'' 
 Dr. Skorton said he was hopeful that the Bain recommendations would have lasting effects on the university's finances. Because the budget situation is so dire, he said, there is widespread consensus on campus -- even some eagerness -- about making changes. 
 ''We've crossed the line where there's a level of awareness that we're facing the most unsettling financial situation we've ever faced and something has to be done,'' he said. 
 ''We have dozens and dozens of faculty, right this minute, involved in a couple dozen task forces around the campus looking at our academic operations, the departments and the curricular questions,'' he continued. ''But I think it's demonstrable that we can save more money, faster, on our business functions by bringing in people from outside to help us.''

HEADLINE: Perfection vs. Provocation When Colts Face Patriots

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
Mike Tanier of FootballOutsiders.com is a co-author of ''Football Outsiders Almanac 2009'' and a contributor to The Fifth Down blog.

 BODY:
Every generation has the cross-country rivalry it deserves. The early 1960s had Packers-Colts, a battle of hard-hitting teams with clean-cut-but-fiery quarterbacks representing rugged shipping towns. The early 1990s had Cowboys-49ers, a booming new economy feud pitting petrodollar-fueled bluster against Silicon Valley efficiency.
 The current generation gets Patriots-Colts, an Internet-ready morality tale of contrasting personalities: Peyton Manning's aw-shucks drawl and the Colts' P.T.A. picnic reputation versus the tabloid pinup Tom Brady and the shadowy Svengali Bill Belichick. The baggage rarely overwhelms the game: the American Football Conference usually hangs in the balance when these teams meet, and the close final scores (18-15, 27-20, and 24-21 in recent years) do not do justice to how dramatic the games typically are. 
 The days when Belichick baffled Manning with his defenses are long gone. Belichick will shift defenders all over the line of scrimmage before the snap to prevent Manning and center Jeff Saturday from customizing the pass protection, but kitchen-sink strategies now have only limited impact on Manning and Indianapolis (8-0). He completed 75 percent of his passes and threw two touchdown passes in beating New England (6-2) last season. 
 But injuries can do to the Colts' 17-game winning streak what defenses cannot. Colts defensive backs Bob Sanders, Kelvin Hayden and Marlin Jackson are out, leaving the rookies Jerraud Powers and Jacob Lacey as the first line of defense against Randy Moss and Wes Welker. Powers and Lacey have been playing well, but they are freshmen working on a master's thesis. 
 8:20 p.m. Line: Colts by 3
 Bengals (6-2) at Steelers (6-2)
 Sweeping the Ravens was well and good, but validation for Cincinnati comes from beating the Steelers in Pittsburgh. The Bengals ushered in their brief period of relevance in 2005 with a 38-31 victory in Week 13 at Heinz Field. The Steelers avenged that loss a month later with a playoff win, and it took the Bengals three years to recover. That is a sign of how quickly the A.F.C. North hierarchy can be re-established. That is bad news for the Bengals -- the Steelers' win Monday night over the upstart Broncos shows they are in re-establishing mode. 
 The injury report favors the Steelers. Defensive end Antwan Odom and linebacker Keith Rivers are out, leaving the Bengals without two of their three most important defenders. Cornerback Johnathan Joseph can shut down Santonio Holmes, but he cannot provide a pass rush or stop the Steelers' running game. The loss of Chris Henry depletes a receiving corps already missing two tight ends, so the Bengals' passing creativity will be limited. The Bengals were at full strength when they beat the Steelers in Week 3, and the Steelers dominated that game for three quarters before some late lapses. 1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 7
 Jaguars (4-4) at Jets (4-4)
 Rex Ryan spent two days in Florida during the bye week. He was not scouting the Jaguars; he was relaxing, his identity concealed from Dolphins fans by a wardrobe of Yankees gear. A tough guy on a Florida beach, in disguise, surrounded by enemies: all you need is a femme fatale and a botched robbery, and you have the makings of a great Elmore Leonard novel. 
 Ryan's priority is stopping Maurice Jones-Drew, who has rushed for 407 yards and 6 touchdowns in his past three games. Jets fans having Ted Ginn Jr. flashbacks can rest easy: Jacksonville has auditioned a half-dozen kick-returners, and none have a return longer than 42 yards.
 1 p.m. Line: Jets by 7
 Eagles (5-3) at Chargers (5-3)
 Some games lend themselves to scouting, others to psychoanalysis. The Chargers and the Eagles rarely play to their Super Bowl-caliber talent, and Norv Turner can easily battle Andy Reid to a 50-move stalemate in a game of Head Scratcher's Chess. Will Turner go for it on all the wrong fourth downs? Will Reid kick a field goal while down by 7 points late in the fourth quarter? Will LaDainian Tomlinson leave the game at the goal line? Will the Eagles abandon the run before you finish reading this sentence? There is one thing to count: sacks. San Diego has 22 sacks but has allowed 18; Philadelphia has 27 sacks but has allowed 21. 4:15 p.m. Line: Chargers by 2
 Lions (1-7) at Vikings (7-1)
 The secret to the Vikings' success is not Brett Favre, the defensive line, Adrian Peterson or the star return man Percy Harvin. The secret, it turns out, is swagger. ''Everyone has a swagger on this team,'' tight end Visanthe Shiancoe said. Several people said that Favre transported said swagger from Green Bay, perhaps illicitly and with accomplices. ''Everybody on that team stole our swagger,'' the Packers great Santana Dotson said of Minnesota. 
 The Greek word for swagger is hubris, and rampant swagger talk often presages a losing streak, which in this case could be blamed on Favre's swagger-squelching groin-muscle injury. There hasn't been any swagger in Detroit since the Thunderbird started looking like an Escort with a spoiler, so the Vikings can walk tall for at least another week. 1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 16 1/2
 Bills (3-5) at Titans (2-6)
 Buffalo was buzzing with Michael Vick talk early in the week. Vick's consigliere, the irreproachable busybody Tony Dungy, suggested that his protege would be a great fit for the Bills. Dungy also said that Missouri would be a better state if it were farther east, and the New Madrid fault rumbled obediently at his commands. Vick is unhappy in Philadelphia, where two poorly conceived Wildcat plays per week are not providing the kind of self-actualization that today's recent parolees expect. 
 While Bills fans dream of re-creating the 2002 Pro Bowl roster, quarterback Trent Edwards prepares to come back from a concussion to face the resurgent Titans. Cortland Finnegan's return has resolidified the Tennessee defense, and the more mature, focused Vince Young has pulled the passing game out of the Negative Zone. If Young needs any more motivation to follow the straight and narrow, he can look to Vick: he is one career reversal away from being the Bills' quarterback of the future. 1 p.m. Line: Titans by 6 1/2
 Buccaneers (1-7) at Dolphins (3-5)
 Josh Freeman can apparently throw straight, run well and read a defense without a decoder ring. So why did Tampa Bay Coach Raheem Morris waste eight weeks on the monolithic Byron Leftwich and the frenetic Josh Johnson? It is easy to get carried away when praising rookie quarterbacks (the Mark Sanchez 16-0 T-shirts you printed in September will make great eBay novelties), but at least now the Buccaneers' rebuilding process can move forward. Tampa Bay and Miami have met twice since 2000 and have little shared history or rivalry. 1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 10
 Falcons (5-3) at Panthers (3-5)
 Atlanta Coach Michael Smith is a mad man. Not only is he willing to mix it up with angry Redskins who venture to the Falcons' sideline, but he is a dead ringer for Roger Sterling of ''Mad Men.'' Smith earned props from his players for scrapping with the usual suspect DeAngelo Hall after a late hit on Matt Ryan. He also earned a $15,000 fine, as the league decided to crack down on the all-too-common 50-year-old man against heavily padded 200-pound athlete violence that is causing society's collapse. Carolina is playing well, and it kept the Week 2 matchup close (a 28-20 Falcons victory). 1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 1 1/2
 Broncos (6-2) at Redskins (2-6)
 Tips if you are going to FedEx Field: 
 1. Do not look DeAngelo Hall in the eyes. He will think you are challenging him. 
 2. Do not carry a sign to the stadium denigrating the Sherman Lewis-Sherman Smith pairing by referencing Mister Peabody, Sherman T. Potter or General Tecumseh Sherman. 
 3. Mike Williams, the Redskins offensive tackle who weighs 345 pounds, is out for several weeks, so there is no risk of being sucked into his event horizon; even if you are, know that plenty of defenders have escaped. 
 4. Even if you spend the fourth quarter watching Todd Collins throw incomplete passes to Todd Yoder, you cannot order a hot toddy, and there are absolutely no refunds. 1 p.m. Line: Broncos by 3 1/2
 Cowboys (6-2) at Packers (4-4)
 The Packers have perfected self-sabotage. They lead the league in sacks allowed (37) and penalties (62); they give up 13.4 yards per punt return and 24.8 yards per kickoff return; and their resume of shame includes a blocked punt, a safety and a 1-of-6 record on fourth-down conversions. The Packers had similar problems last season and will languish around .500 until they become more disciplined. In preparation for the Dallas pass rush, Green Bay Coach Mike McCarthy must take draconian sack-prevention measures. Aversion therapy works well: for every dump-off receiver Aaron Rodgers ignores, he should be forced to run a lap while listening to a Brett Favre-themed podcast. 4:15 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 3
 Seahawks (3-5) at Cardinals (5-3)
 Arizona is not trying to fool anyone. Larry Fitzgerald is getting the ball. He was thrown to 15 times (13 catches) when the Cardinals beat the Seahawks, 27-3, in Week 6 and 14 times (9 catches) in last week's win over the Bears. Few defenders can cover Fitzgerald one-on-one, and none of them play for Seattle. Beanie Wells's emergence gives the Cardinals a viable running game, and Anquan Boldin's expected return gives Warner a surly but capable second option. Fitzgerald gives the Cardinals a head-and-shoulders edge over their division foes. 4:15 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 8 1/2
 Ravens (4-4) at Browns (1-7)
 Cleveland got its last two general managers from Baltimore's front office, so the owner Randy Lerner will be accepting resumes during this game. The recently fired general manager, George Kokinis, was given as much authority as a student council president. The previous executive, Phil Savage, was a road scout who avoided team headquarters as if the walls were made from lead- and radon-coated asbestos; while at his desk, he once fired off a profane e-mail message to an angry fan. On second thought, Lerner may broaden his search beyond the Inner Harbor. 
 Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Ravens by 11
 Saints (8-0) at Rams (1-7)
 Opponents are averaging 160 rushing yards per game against New Orleans over the past three weeks. With defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis (knee sprain) probably out against St. Louis, Steven Jackson will have a big game. Generating rushing yards for Jackson is the Rams' raison d'etre these days, so although they will do little more than scare the Saints, the Rams can at least help some accountant in Old Bridge win his fantasy league. 
 1 p.m. Line: Saints by 13 1/2
 Chiefs (1-7) at Raiders (2-6)
 Larry Johnson's departure from Kansas City cuts the number of potential pregame protesters in half. It also saps most of the interest from this Bad Behavior Bowl. Kickoff is at 4:05 p.m. Eastern; the first embarrassing Twitter tirade is scheduled for 8 p.m.; and the Oakland Raiders have a vehement, paranoid-sounding denial scheduled for 9:15. 
 4:05 p.m. Line: Raiders by 1 1/2

HEADLINE: Economic Lifelines: Jobs, More Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Jobless Recovery'' (editorial, Nov. 8) points to the need for more action by both government and the private sector to combat unemployment. Despite the stimulus spending, employers do not seem to feel the need to create jobs. 
 If companies can survive by getting greater productivity from the labor force, globalizing production and relying on research and design developed by partnerships with companies in other regions of the world, why should they hire United States workers? 
 Using the oxymoron of a jobless recovery dramatizes the gap between abstract indicators and the ''real'' economy, in which men and women need jobs to buy groceries, pay off loans and send their children to college.
 Historically, the creation of full-time jobs is a lagging indicator of recovery that follows growth in production. But pundits today speak of rising stock market values as a ''leading'' indicator. Under current conditions, which indicator should we trust?

 To the Editor:
 So the corporate C.E.O.'s and their friends now reap what they have sown. For the last two decades, they have systematically (with tax subsidies at times) stripped middle- and working-class America of the jobs, financial security and health care that they depended on to buy those same companies' cars, ''labor saving'' devices, electronic devices and all other manner of stuff. 
 The cost savings conveniently floated up the pyramid and were split among the executives and their board members, lawyers, accountants, investment bankers and other friends.
 Now Middle America is broke and can no longer support those at the top of the pyramid. Or their big bonuses. Or their friends and hangers-on.
 It's going to stay that way until they start to undo what they have done and bring jobs back -- real jobs with health care.

 To the Editor:
 Your editorial says the country needs a program to help unemployed teenagers. The problem is that high minimum wages discourage employers from hiring inexperienced workers. 
 Minimum wage laws increase the pay of the employed but prevent other workers from getting that first job. Instead of looking for a new solution, Congress should admit the unintended negative consequences of its previous good will and repeal the minimum wage.
 Damian Bickett Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The American Small Business League is concerned that the Obama administration is doing nothing of major significance to aid our country's 27 million small businesses, or to create jobs. 
 In August, we conducted an analysis of the government's small-business contracting data for the fiscal year 2008. We found 60 large corporations in the top 100 recipients of small-business contracts. Also, scores of Fortune 500 firms were counted toward the government's goal.
 As a senator in February 2008, Barack Obama said it was time to end these abuses, yet he has not taken any action to honor his words. 
 President Obama should support H.R. 2568, the Fairness and Transparency in Contracting Act of 2009. It would redirect approximately $100 billion a year in federal infrastructure spending back to the middle-class economy, saving thousands of businesses and countless jobs.

 To the Editor: 
 How many thousands of our technical workers now face long-term unemployment after seeing their jobs sent offshore? Many of these people have university degrees. Their offshore counterparts are also highly educated but are paid at far lower rates.
 It is clear that these jobs will never return. A significant number of people in this group will remain unemployed. The lucky few will find jobs in alternative areas at far lower salaries than they once enjoyed.
 The permanent underemployment of highly educated people will not only lower their standard of living for the rest of their lives, but will also negatively affect the entire economy unless alternative paths to success can be created. Ideas, please ... anyone?
 Michael Devon Berwyn, Pa., Nov. 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Jobless Rate Hits 10.2%, With More Underemployed'' (front page, Nov. 7):
 You report that 17.5 percent of Americans were unemployed or underemployed last month. This true unemployment rate spotlights the fallacy with unemployment figures globally. The poor and ''unemployable'' are systematically omitted from government statistics. 
 In Latin America, for example, people below the poverty line are not included in the unemployment data. True unemployment in most of the countries of Latin America, taking the approach of your article, hovers between 20 and 30 percent. 
 The tragedy is that the people who are included in these statistics are the potential consumers who would drive the engines of their domestic economies if they could earn a living wage and were integrated into the economy.
 L. Ronald Scheman Charleston, S.C., Nov. 7, 2009
 The writer was United States executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1992 to 1998.
 To the Editor:
 ''The Recession's Over, but Not the Layoffs'' (Week in Review, Nov. 8) explores the reasons that the slight economic improvement has not resulted in job growth.
 The poor performance of the job market should be expected. Over the last 50 years, full employment and job creation have not been central to economic policy-making in the United States. 
 Economic policy has generally focused on maximizing profits by reducing business costs through such devices as tax reductions and minimizing constraints on business. In this context, wages and benefits are costs to be minimized. 
 Until the United States is willing to consider a balanced view of employment as both a business cost and a source of income and aggregate demand that supports economic growth, the bad news from the labor market is likely to continue.

HEADLINE: Workplace Gossip? Keep It To Yourself

BYLINE: By SHAYLA MCKNIGHT. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I'M a technical service assistant at PrintingForLess.com, an online printing company based in Livingston, Mont. I'm part of a three-person team. We provide quality control for print jobs, call local customers to notify them their orders are ready and send sample packs to potential clients. We also help other departments with special projects and take turns sitting at the front desk, greeting customers and answering the phone.
 At the beginning of my employment interview two years ago, Marne Reed, the human resources manager who interviewed me, mentioned the company's no-gossip policy. She said something like this: ''There's no back-stabbing here, and no office politics. Gossiping and talking behind someone's back are not tolerated.'' 
 I remember thinking: ''Really? That's odd. How is that possible?'' Everywhere I've worked people have gossiped, like when someone got into trouble or was laid off. 
 But I signed the company's ''agreement to values'' form, and I remember feeling optimistic. The policy sounded refreshing. Now that I've been here for a while, I can say that it makes one heck of a difference in the work environment.
 At my last job, gossip was rampant. So many people had negative attitudes. Workers would become frustrated if one person was slacking off, so they'd vent about it. 
 I, for one, was afraid to say anything because I didn't know who might repeat something I said, change it around or use it against me. People would even gossip about what others did on the weekend, like what bar they went to. It was every man for himself, and it was uncomfortable.
 There's a greater sense of being part of a team here than in other jobs I've had. If employees do violate the company policy, a manager speaks to them, and if they don't stop, they're let go. It has happened.
 Gossip, however, doesn't seem to interest a majority of the workers here. We all know what's expected, and we hold one another accountable. We count on everyone being aboveboard, and we encourage people to confront one another.
 It appears to me as if everyone has bought into the mind-set. If we ever sense that someone might be gossiping, we call that person out and say, ''You need to go to the source if you have a question.''
 I care about my colleagues, but there are things I don't need to know. I've also found that if people know that you don't gossip and that you don't tolerate it, they won't gossip around you. It might be human nature to think an unkind thought about a co-worker, but it's a choice whether or not to actually say it. 
 There's a mix of personalities in any company, and rarely does everyone in a workplace like one another. But I believe that half the battle is in how people communicate.
 When employees are hired here, they're given a communications assessment, a commercial program that the company uses to pinpoint a person's dominant communications style. The styles are linked to colors that identify how each employee likes to communicate.
 If someone is a ''red,'' for example, he or she appreciates when others are direct and state the facts quickly. A person who's a ''blue'' enjoys having all the details, and time to process them. A ''yellow'' is spontaneous and likes a personal connection.
 I'm a ''green.'' That means I'm sensitive and like to be approached as courteously as possible; greens tend to be compassionate and supportive. 
 Nameplates on our desks have a color bar to identify our styles, or we can easily find them in a company database. This system lets everyone know how co-workers prefer to be approached, and it goes a long way in promoting harmony. If I don't know someone's style, I check before I visit his or her office or send an e-mail message.
 IN this economy, probably one of the biggest things people gossip about at most companies is layoffs. Several workers have been let go here in the last couple of years, but we were expecting the layoffs so there was no reason to gossip.
 Groups have daily meetings with their managers where they go over the orders and sales goals, so we always know how the company is doing. Our C.E.O., Andrew S. Field, explained that some of us might have to be let go. After the layoffs occurred, he held a meeting, reviewed the reasons again and identified those who were laid off. No one had to speculate about anything -- we got the information from the source. 
 That's not to say people weren't fearful about their jobs, but it's not as if we were blindsided. We knew that the company would have to take action in order to stay profitable.
 We respect one another's privacy here. That was obvious to me last year, after I told a few people that I was expecting my first child. When I reached my sixth or seventh month, I passed a colleague in the hall whom I see every day. He glanced at my belly and asked if I was pregnant. ''Ya think?'' I joked.
 He had no idea. My colleagues hadn't spread the word.

PERSON: James R. Lilley 

HEADLINE: James R. Lilley, 81, Envoy in Tiananmen Era, Dies

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
James R. Lilley, a former intelligence agent and ambassador to China who viewed that country with a rare blend of pragmatism and love because of his childhood there, died Thursday at a Washington hospital. He was 81.
 Mr. Lilley, who lived in Washington, died of complications linked to prostate cancer, said his son Jeffrey of Silver Spring, Md. 
 Under his old friend President George H. W. Bush, Mr. Lilley was ambassador in Beijing from 1989 to 1991, a period marked by the brutal suppression of protesters in Tiananmen Square. ''It has been called, and it was, a massacre,'' Mr. Lilley declared in ''China Hands,'' his 2004 memoir, written with his son Jeffrey and published by PublicAffairs. 
 Mr. Lilley was familiar with the students' grievances: only days after arriving in Beijing in 1989, he took to riding his bicycle on the streets to glean firsthand knowledge of what was going on. 
 But while he sympathized with the Chinese students' yearning for more openness and ''an end to cronyism and corruption,'' and appreciated the need for the United States to condemn the bloodshed, he argued against any suggestion that Washington's relationship with China should be cut off or cut back. 
 ''I wanted to make the point that the United States had to stay engaged with China for strategic reasons,'' he wrote of his frequent television appearances after the tanks rolled into the square in June 1989. ''America, I insisted, could contribute in constructive ways to a more open China.'' 
 Mr. Lilley was almost alone in diplomatic circles for the respect he enjoyed among both the Chinese Communist leaders and the Taiwanese. 
 Born in Shandong Province (his father, Frank, was an oil executive, and his mother, Inez, a teacher), James Roderick Lilley grew up attended by a Chinese nanny. He became almost as fluent in Mandarin as in English; he also spoke French.
 As a boy, he played catch with a young Japanese soldier in the occupied China of the 1930s, before the horror of war made such a friendship unthinkable. 
 His family returned to the United States in 1940. He graduated from Yale University and received a master's degree from George Washington University. He also attended Hong Kong and Columbia Universities to study classical Chinese. He served in the Army in 1945-46 and later in the Air Force Reserve.
 Mr. Lilley joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1951 ''as a foot soldier in America's efforts to keep Asia from being dominated by Communist China,'' as he wrote in his memoir. 
 In 1975, he was appointed national intelligence officer for China, the senior post in the intelligence community on Chinese affairs. He was the senior East Asian specialist on the National Security Council early in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. 
 In the mid-1980s, he was a consultant on international security affairs for the Defense Department and deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
 Mr. Lilley then served as ambassador to South Korea, through a time of political tumult that led in 1987 to the first genuine presidential election in 16 years.
 Outside government, Mr. Lilley taught Chinese economics at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies and was a consultant for companies doing business in China. 
 Mr. Lilley was well known for dispensing frank advice. A month after Tiananmen, he told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that a decision to send American Navy ships on an official visit to Shanghai in May 1989 had been a bad miscalculation, leaving the impression among Beijing leaders that Washington was ''cozying up'' to their military just as the Tiananmen protests were boiling up.
 Yet the Chinese continued to view him as a friend as well as a diplomat. In May 1991, as he was preparing to return to America, a series of farewell parties in his honor drew crowds. 
 As for his personal feelings about China, ''The country had defined my family's life since 1916, when my father stepped off a boat in Shanghai harbor to work for Standard Oil,'' he reminisced in his memoir.
 Surviving are his wife, Sally; two other sons, Douglas, of Washington, and Michael, of Rumson, N.J.; a sister, Elinore Washburn, of Andover, Mass.; and six grandchildren.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Nov. 16 and in some copies on Nov. 15 about James R. Lilley, an American diplomat who was ambassador to China from 1989 to 1991, referred incorrectly to his earlier service with the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Lilley was an intelligence officer, not an agent. (An intelligence agent is someone, usually a foreigner, recruited to work on behalf of an intelligence service.)

HEADLINE: Leaders Will Delay Agreement On Climate

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
President Obama and other world leaders have decided to put off the difficult task of reaching a climate change agreement at a global climate conference scheduled for next month, agreeing instead to make it the mission of the Copenhagen conference to reach a less specific ''politically binding'' agreement that would punt the most difficult issues into the future.
 At a hastily arranged breakfast on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting on Sunday morning, the leaders, including Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the prime minister of Denmark and the chairman of the climate conference, agreed that in order to salvage Copenhagen they would have to push a fully binding legal agreement down the road, possibly to a second summit meeting in Mexico City later on. 
 ''There was an assessment by the leaders that it is unrealistic to expect a full internationally, legally binding agreement could be negotiated between now and Copenhagen, which starts in 22 days,'' said Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. ''I don't think the negotiations have proceeded in such a way that any of the leaders thought it was likely that we were going to achieve a final agreement in Copenhagen, and yet thought that it was important that Copenhagen be an important step forward, including with operational impact.''
 With the clock running out and deep differences unresolved, it has, for several months, appeared increasingly unlikely that the climate change negotiations in Denmark would produce a comprehensive and binding new treaty on global warming, as its organizers had intended. 
 The agreement on Sunday codifies what negotiators had already accepted as all but inevitable: that representatives of the 192 nations in the talks would not resolve the outstanding issues in time. The gulf between rich and poor countries, and even among the wealthiest nations, was just too wide.
 Among the chief barriers to a comprehensive deal in Copenhagen was Congress's inability to enact climate and energy legislation that sets binding targets on greenhouse gases in the United States. Without such a commitment, other nations are loath to make their own pledges.
 Administration officials and Congressional leaders have said that final legislative action on a climate bill would not occur before the first half of next year.
 After his breakfast meeting in Singapore, Mr. Obama was scheduled to meet with Asian leaders and to hold a number of one-on-one sessions, including one with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev.
 After his meeting with Mr. Medvedev, Mr. Obama will attend a symbolically important regional meeting of Southeast Asian nations, in which representatives of Myanmar's government will also be present. Mr. Obama, who has made a point of his willingness to engage with adversaries, noted that for the first time an American president would be at the table with Myanmar's military junta. But he has also called on the government to release the leader of the country's beleaguered democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
 APEC summit meetings are not known for accomplishing much that is substantive. The most memorable moments often involve the photo opportunities, in which leaders wear colorful matching shirts. And often communiques issued on dismantling trade barriers are undermined by the attending countries almost as soon as they are signed. 
 Speaking to world leaders at the APEC summit meeting Sunday morning, Mr. Obama said he would hold the 2011 gathering in Hawaii.
 ''The United States was there at the first meeting of APEC at Blake Island when President Clinton started the tradition of having leaders wear outfits picked out by the host nation,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And when America hosts APEC in a few years, I look forward to seeing you all decked out in flowered shirts and grass skirts because today I am announcing that my home state of Hawaii will be hosting this forum in 2011.''
 This year's meeting promises more of the same, complete with charges and countercharges of protectionism. 
 President Felipe Calderon of Mexico got things going early Saturday when he lashed out at what he called politically driven protectionism in the United States. He complained that Congressional coddling of the Teamsters had prevented the United States from opening its borders to Mexican trucks, which it was supposed to do years ago after it signed Nafta.
 ''Protectionism is killing North American companies,'' Mr. Calderon said in Singapore. ''The American government is facing political pressure that has not been counteracted.''
 Mr. Obama is facing high expectations, which may be difficult to meet. For instance, while he has spoken about reducing trade barriers, he also talked during his speech in Tokyo on Saturday of making sure that the United States and Asia did not return to a cycle -- which he termed ''imbalanced'' -- in which American consumerism caused Asians to look at the United States as mainly an export market.
 There are also high hopes among American companies and some Asian countries that the United States will commit to joining a regional trading group called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although Mr. Obama did open the door during his speech in Tokyo on Asia policy, he did not explicitly say that the United States would join the pact. A formal announcement that the United States is beginning negotiations would undoubtedly kick off criticism from free-trade opponents in the United States and pushback from Congress.
 Mr. Obama spoke, instead, of ''engaging the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries with the goal of shaping a regional agreement that will have broad-based membership and the high standards worthy of a 21st-century trade agreement.''
 That line left many trade envoys already in Singapore scratching their heads: did Mr. Obama mean that the United States would begin formal talks to join the regional trade pact, which presently includes Singapore, Brunei and New Zealand, and could later include Vietnam -- an addition that could lead to more Congressional pressure at home? 
 Many regional officials have been waiting for the United States to join the initiative as a demonstration that Washington will play a more active role in the region. But the Obama administration has yet to establish a firm trade policy, as it is still reviewing its options.
 White House officials were not much clearer on what Mr. Obama meant when they were pressed on this after the speech. Mr. Froman, the deputy national security adviser, said that what Mr. Obama meant was that he would engage with the initiative ''to see if this is something that could prove to be an important platform going further.''

HEADLINE: Collective Shrug

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re Adam Kirsch's review of Anne C. Heller's ''Ayn Rand and the World She Made'' (Nov. 1): It is only a few months since Alan Greenspan conceded with a wry shrug that his god, the Rational Individual, has a clay toe. So it is ironic that there is a renewed wave of interest in Ayn Rand, who wanted so desperately to be the prophet of this new god and succeeded so brilliantly with Greenspan. Perhaps it would be only just if the great recession, for which Greenspan served as enabler in chief, were to become known as the ''Atlas Shrugged'' recession. It would be doubly ironic since all the Randians know how to do, in the face of the unpleasant facts, is shrug and blame someone else. J. Claude Evans
 St. Louis The writer is a philosophy professor at Washington University. 
 To the Editor:
 Adam Kirsch's review revived a memory: Back in 1961, Friedrich A. Hayek was visiting Cornell, and he graciously accepted my invitation to speak to my political economy class. His comments were not on the free market but rather on the rule of law. Afterward, he took questions, which were mostly about Ayn Rand and ''Atlas Shrugged.'' The leading questions were ''What was Rand really like?'' and ''What is your evaluation of 'Atlas Shrugged'?''
 Hayek's responses took on the style of a confession. ''Although I tried seriously to read the book, I failed, because there was no romance in it,'' he said. ''I tried even more diligently to read that fellow John Galt's hundred-page declaration of independence, and I knew I'd be questioned on all that, but I just couldn't get through it.''
 As for Rand, he said he had met her only once, quite recently, at a party given in their honor -- ''and you should never have two lions at the same party.'' The host eagerly brought the two together for the introduction. Here are the results, to the best of my memory: ''We had a very brief exchange. She swelled in anger and spun away, remaining only long enough to say, 'You are a compromiser.' '' Twenty-five years later, Stephen Newman, a professor of political science at York University in Canada, innocently provided the explanation for Rand's animosity with the title of his book: ''Liberalism at Wits' End.''
 THEODORE J. LOWI Ithaca, N.Y. The writer is John L. Senior professor of American institutions at Cornell University.
 To the Editor:
 Adam Kirsch shows a deep misunderstanding of capitalism in his analysis of the deal between Ayn Rand and Bennett Cerf, in which he writes that she ''gave up 7 cents per copy in royalties'' to preserve Galt's oration. It was, first and foremost, a capital-based solution to a philosophical and ethical problem that many authors and publishers face -- one whose solution often involves bitter conflicts of ego and power. But more important, Rand did not give up royalties. She accepted a lower rate, which, for all we know, brought her vast returns from increased sales of ''Atlas Shrugged'' and other works. Even if it were a bad investment, it illustrates the heart of capitalism: making bets on the future performance of the marketplace. Some will win, some will not. Capitalism should not be confused with a miserly love of dollars. Rather, to use the agricultural metaphor, it is the sowing of wealth in the expectation of continued good climate and the future reaping of profit.
 BOB PRENER Grahamsville, N.Y.
 To the Editor:
 Adam Kirsch's review repeats a story from Bennett Cerf's 1977 autobiography, ''At Random,'' about Rand's response when Cerf asked her to cut Galt's speech: ''Would you cut the Bible?'' she supposedly said. When Cerf's book came out, I asked Rand about the story. With obvious indignation, she replied, ''I never said that -- the Bible needs cutting.''
 In general, the portrait of Rand contained in the review clashes dramatically with the Rand whom I first met in 1964 and with whom I was good friends in her final years. The Rand I knew was a unique combination of disciplined rationality and emotional intensity. Well, not completely unique: there are also the fictional heroes she created.

HEADLINE: China's Sprint for the Gold

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
 PRESIDENT OBAMA's first official visit to China brings him this weekend to a country that, despite the global downturn, is increasingly wealthy, confident, ambitious -- and perplexing.
 Over the past decade, even as China's exports have soared, the nation has begun transforming itself from a global font of low-priced goods fueled by cheap labor into a much more diverse and complex economic power. Along with that, it has developed huge disparities of wealth.
 ''There are a lot of billionaires, but there's also a lot of poverty in China,'' says C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It's a very bipolar society. People have to recognize that both elements are there.'' 
 Per capita income, for example, is still small -- about $3,200, which is less than 10 percent that of the United States and slightly more than that of Iraq -- and many farmers earn less than a dollar a day. Yet China is also home to the fastest-growing number of billionaires.
 China doesn't just dominate trade; it scours the globe for resources; doles out multibillion-dollar loans to other developing nations; and holds stakes in Wall Street giants like Morgan Stanley and the Blackstone Group.
 A nation that sold about 600,000 cars in 2000 is now poised to eclipse the United States and is on course to sell nearly 15 million vehicles in 2009. No country has ever accumulated larger foreign exchange reserves ($2.2 trillion). No country has more Web surfers (338 million).
 And China leads the world in initial public stock offerings.
 Ask the world's luxury brands where sales are holding up, and where they are expanding, and they will tell you here, in China. Every big city is building five-star hotels and the country's newest airports make America's look shabby.
 In Washington, China is now viewed as both an economic rival and an increasingly important partner in trying to address some of the world's most pressing problems. China is not just America's biggest trading partner; it's also America's biggest foreign lender, buying up Treasury bonds and helping to finance the national debt. So American leaders talk about ''strategic dialogues,'' ''strategic and economic dialogues,'' and now ''strategic reassurance.''
 But even leading economists confess to difficulty at fully understanding the role of a nation dominated by state-owned companies.
 For instance, while some argue that China's low-cost manufacturing hurts America by draining away American jobs, other economists say that exporting those jobs to China allows companies to become more profitable in America, and expand their better-paying advertising, service and development departments at home. They also point out that Chinese factories hold down the price of everyday goods for Americans. One study, cited in ''China: The Balance Sheet'' (Public Affairs, 2006), said that, on average, America is about $70 billion a year richer because of trade with China.
 Through all the arguments and counterarguments, one thing seems clear: China's momentous shift is creating the need for armies of analysts, economists and experts to explain and forecast how China's rise will remake the world, and the lives of ordinary Americans. At right are a few indicators of this country's seemingly unparalleled rise, just over 30 years after the death of Mao. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about China's economic growth described the trade relationship between China and the United States incorrectly. China is America's biggest source of imports, not its biggest trading partner. (America's biggest trading partner, a category that takes account of American exports as well as imports, is Canada.)

HEADLINE: Memoir Is Palin's Payback to McCain Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
GOING ROGUE
 An American Life
By Sarah Palin
 413 pp. HarperCollins. $28.99
 ''Going Rogue,'' the title of Sarah Palin's erratic new memoir, comes from a phrase used by a disgruntled McCain aide to describe her going off-message during the presidential campaign: among other things, for breaking with the campaign over its media strategy and its decision to pull out of Michigan, and for speaking out about reports that the Republican Party had spent more than $150,000 on fancy designer duds for her and her family. 
 The most sustained and vehement barbs in this book are directed not at Democrats or liberals or the news media, but at the McCain campaign. The very campaign that plucked her out of Alaska, anointed her the Republican vice-presidential nominee and made her one of the most talked about women on the planet -- someone who could command a reported $5 million advance for writing this book. 
 In what reads like payback for disparaging comments by John McCain's aides about her after the ticket's loss to Barack Obama, Ms. Palin depicts the McCain campaign as overscripted, defeatist, disorganized and dunderheaded -- slow to shift focus from the Iraq war to the cratering economy, insufficiently tough on Mr. Obama and contradictory in its media strategy. She also claims that the campaign billed her nearly $50,000 for ''having been vetted.'' The vetting, which was widely criticized in the press as being cursory and rushed, was, she insisted, ''thorough'': they knew ''exactly what they're getting.'' 
 Although Ms. Palin writes that she is ''proud of the senator'' for being bold enough to put her on the ticket, some of her loudest complaints in this volume are directed at the McCain campaign's chief strategist, Steve Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt, ironically enough, was one of the aides to most forcefully make the case for putting her on the ticket in the first place, arguing to Mr. McCain, as Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson reported in their recent book, ''The Battle for America 2008,'' that she would shake up the race and help him get his ''reform mojo back.'' Over the weekend McCain aides fired back at Ms. Palin: Mr. Schmidt was quoted on Politico.com saying that charges about him were ''all fiction.'' 
 Back in 2008 Robert Draper reported in The New York Times Magazine that neither Mr. Schmidt nor Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, apparently saw Ms. Palin's ''lack of familiarity with major national or international issues as a serious liability,'' and that Mr. McCain, a former Navy pilot, saw the idea of upending the chessboard as a maverick move.
 All in all Ms. Palin emerges from ''Going Rogue'' as an eager player in the blame game, ungrateful to the McCain campaign for putting her on the national stage. As for the McCain campaign, it often feels like a desperate and cynical operation, willing to make a risky Hail Mary pass to try to score a tactical win, instead of making a considered judgment as to who might be genuinely qualified to sit a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.
 In ''Going Rogue'' Ms. Palin talks perfunctorily about fiscal responsibility and a muscular foreign policy, and more passionately about the importance of energy independence, but she is quite up front about the fact that much of her appeal lies in her just-folks ''hockey mom'' ordinariness. She pretends no particular familiarity with the Middle East, the Iraq war or Islamic politics -- ''I knew the history of the conflict,'' she writes, ''to the extent that most Americans did.'' And she argues that ''there's no better training ground for politics than motherhood.'' 
 A CNN poll taken last month indicates that 7 out of 10 Americans now think Ms. Palin is not qualified to be president, and even as ardent a conservative as Charles Krauthammer lamented in September 2008 ''the paucity of any Palin record or expressed conviction on the major issues of our time.'' 
 Yet Mr. McCain's astonishing decision to pick someone with so little experience (less than two years as the governor of Alaska, and before that, two terms as mayor of Wasilla, an Alaskan town with fewer than 7,000 residents) as his running mate underscores just how alarmingly expertise is discounted -- or equated with elitism -- in our increasingly democratized era, and just how thoroughly colorful personal narratives overshadow policy arguments and actual knowledge. Ms. Palin herself had a surprisingly nonchalant reaction to Mr. McCain's initial phone call about the vice president's slot, writing that she was not astonished, that it felt ''like a natural progression.'' 
 Ms. Palin suggests that she and her husband, Todd, are ideally qualified to represent the Joe Six-Packs of the world because they are Joe Six-Packs themselves. ''We know what it's like to be on a tight budget and wonder how we're going to pay for our own health care, let alone college tuition,'' she writes in ''Going Rogue.'' ''We know what it's like to work union jobs, to be blue-collar, white-collar, to have our kids in public schools. We felt our very normalcy, our status as ordinary Americans, could be a much-needed fresh breeze blowing into Washington, D.C.'' 
 ''Going Rogue'' (written with an assist from Lynn Vincent, the features editor of World, an evangelical magazine) is part cagey spin, part earnest autobiography, part payback hit job. And its most compelling sections deal not with politics but with Ms. Palin's life in Alaska and her family. Despite an annoying tendency to drop the names of lots of writers and philosophers gratuitously -- in the course of this book she quotes or alludes to Pascal, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Paine, Pearl S. Buck, Mark Twain and Melville -- she does a lively job of conveying the frontier feel of the 49th state, where television broadcasts were tape-delayed in her youth and they shopped for clothes ''via mail order through the Sears catalog,'' where ''we don't have big-league professional sports teams or many celebrities (except famous dog mushers),'' and so regard politics as a local sport.
 The self-portrait created in these pages recalls the early profiles of Ms. Palin that appeared just after her debut on the national stage: a self-reliant frontierswoman who knows how to field dress a moose; a feisty gal with lots of moxie and pep; a former beauty queen with a George W. Bush-like aptitude for mangling the English language. (The first paragraph of the book contains the phrase ''I breathed in an autumn bouquet that combined everything small-town America with rugged splashes of the Last Frontier.'') She talks about juggling motherhood with politics, and gives a moving account of learning that her son Trig would be born with Down syndrome.
 She recalls her initial feeling -- ''I don't think I could handle that'' -- and her ''sudden understanding of why people would grasp at a quick 'solution,' a way to make the 'problem' just go away,'' though her own pro-life stance would deny women the choice of having an abortion. 
 Elsewhere in this volume she talks about creationism, saying she ''didn't believe in the theory that human beings -- thinking, loving beings -- originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea'' or from ''monkeys who eventually swung down from the trees.'' In everything that happens to her, from meeting Todd to her selection by Mr. McCain for the Republican ticket, she sees the hand of God: ''My life is in His hands. I encourage readers to do what I did many years ago, invite Him in to take over.'' 
 Just as Ms. Palin's planned book tour resembles a campaign rollout -- complete with a bus tour and pit stops in battleground states -- so the second half of this book often reads like a calculated attempt to position Ms. Palin for 2012. She tries to compare herself to Ronald Reagan by repeatedly invoking his name and record. She talks about being ''a Commonsense Conservative'' and worrying about the national deficit. And she attempts to explain, rationalize or refute controversial incidents and allegations that emerged during the 2008 race. 
 She says she ''never sought to ban any books'' as mayor of Wasilla, and has always had a ''special passion for reading.'' She suggests that the $150,000-plus designer clothes were the campaign's idea, that she and her family are actually frugal coupon clippers who shop at Costco. And she says that she was manipulated into doing that famous series of Katie Couric interviews (which would do much to cement an image of her as an easily caricatured ignoramus) by Nicolle Wallace, a communications aide for the campaign, and that Ms. Couric just seemed to want ''to frame a 'gotcha' moment.'' 
 Along the way Ms. Palin acknowledges that she is a busy, ''got to go-go-go'' sort of person -- and for an average hockey mom, pretty ambitious.
 ''As every Iditarod musher knows,'' she writes of the well-known Alaska dog-sled race, ''if you're not the lead dog, the view never changes.''

 CORRECTION:
A report in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column on Sept. 30 and The Books of The Times Review on Monday about ''Going Rogue,'' by Sarah Palin, misstated the role of Lynn Vincent, Ms. Palin's collaborator on the book, at World, an evangelical magazine. She is a senior writer and former features editor; she is not the editor or the features editor. (The editor of World pointed out the errors in an e-mail message this week.)

HEADLINE: China's Role as Lender Alters Dynamics for Obama's Visit

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER, MICHAEL WINES and DAVID E. SANGER; Helene Cooper reported from Singapore, Michael Wines from Beijing, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

 BODY:
This article is by Helene Cooper, Michael Wines
 and David E. Sanger.
 When President Obama visits China for the first time on Sunday, he will, in many ways, be assuming the role of profligate spender coming to pay his respects to his banker.
 That stark fact -- China is the largest foreign lender to the United States -- has changed the core of the relationship between the United States and the only country with a reasonable chance of challenging its status as the world's sole superpower.
 The result: unlike his immediate predecessors, who publicly pushed and prodded China to follow the Western model and become more open politically and economically, Mr. Obama will be spending less time exhorting Beijing and more time reassuring it.
 In a July meeting, Chinese officials asked their American counterparts detailed questions about the health care legislation making its way through Congress. The president's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, answered most of their questions. But the Chinese were not particularly interested in the public option or universal care for all Americans. 
 ''They wanted to know, in painstaking detail, how the health care plan would affect the deficit,'' one participant in the conversation recalled. Chinese officials expect that they will help finance whatever Congress and the White House settle on, mostly through buying Treasury debt, and like any banker, they wanted evidence that the United States had a plan to pay them back.
 It is a long way from the days when President George W. Bush hectored China about currency manipulation, or when President Bill Clinton exhorted the Chinese to improve human rights. 
 Mr. Obama has struck a mollifying note with China. He pointedly singled out the emerging dynamic at play between the United States and China during a wide-ranging speech in Tokyo on Saturday that was meant to outline a new American relationship with Asia.
 ''The United States does not seek to contain China,'' Mr. Obama said. ''On the contrary, the rise of a strong, prosperous China can be a source of strength for the community of nations.''
 He alluded to human rights but did not get specific. ''We will not agree on every issue,'' he said, ''and the United States will never waver in speaking up for the fundamental values that we hold dear -- and that includes respect for the religion and cultures of all people.'' 
 White House officials have been working for months to make sure that Mr. Obama's three-day visit to Shanghai and Beijing conveys a conciliatory image. For instance, in June, the White House told the Dalai Lama that while Mr. Obama would meet him at some point, he would not do so in October, when the Tibetan spiritual leader visited Washington, because it was too close to Mr. Obama's visit to China. 
 Greeting the Dalai Lama, whom China condemns as a separatist, weeks before Mr. Obama's first presidential trip to the country could alienate Beijing, administration officials said. Every president since George H. W. Bush in 1991 has met the Dalai Lama when he visited Washington, usually in private encounters at the White House, although in 2007 George W. Bush became the first president to welcome him publicly, bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal on him at the Capitol. Mr. Obama met the Dalai Lama as a senator.
 Similarly, while he was campaigning for the presidency, Mr. Obama several times accused China of manipulating its currency, an allegation that the current Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, repeated during his confirmation hearings. But in April, the Treasury Department retreated from that criticism, issuing a report that said China was not manipulating its currency to increase its exports. 
 While American officials said privately that they remained frustrated that China's currency policies lowered the cost of Chinese goods and made American products more expensive in foreign markets, they said that they were relieved that China was fighting the global recession with an enormous fiscal stimulus program to spur domestic growth, and added that now was not the time to antagonize Beijing.
 China is not viewed as a trouble spot for the United States. But this administration, like its predecessor, has had difficulty grappling with a rising power that seems eager to avoid direct clashes with the United States but affects its interests in many areas, including currency policy, nuclear proliferation, climate change and military spending.
 In that regard, two members of Mr. Obama's foreign policy team said that the United States' interactions with the Chinese had been far too narrow in past years, focusing on counterterrorism and North Korea. Too little was done, they said, to address China's energy and environmental policies, or its expansion of influence in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Africa, where China has invested heavily and used billions of dollars in aid to advance its political influence.
 One hint of the Obama administration's new approach came in a speech this fall by James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, who has deep roots in China policy. He argued that China needed to adopt a policy of ''strategic reassurance'' to the rest of the world, a phrase that appeared intended to be the successor to the framework of the Bush era, when China was urged to embrace a role as a ''responsible stakeholder.''
 ''Strategic reassurance rests on a core, if tacit, bargain,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''Just as we and our allies must make clear that we are prepared to welcome China's 'arrival,' '' he argued, the Chinese ''must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others.''
 The Chinese reaction has been mixed, at best. The official China Daily newspaper ran a column just before Mr. Obama's arrival suggesting that the United States needed to provide some assurance of its own -- to ''respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' code words for entirely backing away from the issues of how China deals with Taiwan and Tibet. 
 In the United States, the phrase ''strategic reassurance'' has been attacked by conservative commentators, who argue that any reassurance that the United States provides to China would be an acknowledgment of a decline in American power. 
 In an op-ed article in The Washington Post, the analysts Robert Kagan and Dan Blumenthal argued that the policy had echoes of Europe ''ceding the Western Hemisphere to American hegemony'' a century ago. ''Lingering behind this concept is an assumption of America's inevitable decline,'' they wrote. White House officials shot back, insisting that it is China that needs to do the reassurance, not the United States.
 In China, Mr. Obama will meet with local political leaders and will host an American-style town hall meeting with students in Shanghai. He will then spend two days in Beijing meeting with President Hu Jintao. 
 It seems unlikely that Mr. Obama will get the same celebrity-type reception in Beijing that he received in Cairo, Ghana, Paris and London. China seems mostly immune to the Obama fever that swept other parts of the world, and the Chinese are growing more confident that their country has the wherewithal to compete with the United States on the world stage, analysts say.
 ''Obama is still a positive guy, and all over the world most people think he's more energetic, more sincere, than Bush, more a reformist,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor and an expert on United States-China relations at People's University in Beijing. ''But in China, Obama's popularity is less than in Europe, than Japan or Southeast Asia.'' In China, he said, ''there is no worship of Obama.''
 For instance, during the Bush and Clinton years, China might release a few political dissidents on the eve of a visit by the president as a good-will gesture. This time, American officials say, they do not expect any similar gestures, although they say that Mr. Obama will raise human rights issues privately with Mr. Hu.
 ''This time China will agree to have a human rights dialogue with the U.S. on some cases,'' Mr. Shi said, but ''the arguments have changed compared to the past. Now we say, 'We are a different country, we have our own system, our own culture.' ''

HEADLINE: High Costs Weigh On Troop Debate For Afghan War

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
While President Obama's decision about sending more troops to Afghanistan is primarily a military one, it also has substantial budget implications that are adding pressure to limit the commitment, senior administration officials say.
 The latest internal government estimates place the cost of adding 40,000 American troops and sharply expanding the Afghan security forces, as favored by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan, at $40 billion to $54 billion a year, the officials said. 
 Even if fewer troops are sent, or their mission is modified, the rough formula used by the White House, of about $1 million per soldier a year, appears almost constant.
 So even if Mr. Obama opts for a lower troop commitment, Afghanistan's new costs could wash out the projected $26 billion expected to be saved in 2010 from withdrawing troops from Iraq. And the overall military budget could rise to as much as $734 billion, or 10 percent more than the peak of $667 billion under the Bush administration. 
 Such an escalation in military spending would be a politically volatile issue for Mr. Obama at a time when the government budget deficit is soaring, the economy is weak and he is trying to pass a costly health care plan. 
 Senior members of the House Appropriations Committee have already expressed reservations about the potential long-term costs of expanding the war in Afghanistan. And Mr. Obama could find it difficult to win approval for the additional spending in Congress, where he would have to depend on Republicans to counter defections from liberal Democrats.
 One senior administration official, who requested anonymity in order to discuss the details of confidential deliberations, said these concerns had added to the president's insistence at a White House meeting on Wednesday that each military option include the quickest possible exit strategy.
 ''The president focused a lot on ensuring that we were asking the difficult questions about getting to an end game here,'' the official said. ''He knows we cannot sustain this indefinitely.''
 Sending fewer troops would lower the costs but would also place limitations on the buildup strategy. Sending 30,000 more troops, for example, would cost $25 billion to $30 billion a year while limiting how widely American forces could range. Deploying 20,000 troops would cost about $21 billion annually but would expand mainly the training of Afghans, the officials said. 
 The estimated $1 million a year it costs per soldier is higher than the $390,000 congressional researchers estimated in 2006. 
 Military analysts said the increase reflects a surge in costs for mine-resistant troop carriers and surveillance equipment that would apply to troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. But some costs are unique to Afghanistan, where it can cost as much as $400 a gallon to deliver fuel to the troops through mountainous terrain.
 Some administration estimates suggest it could also cost up to $50 billion over five years to more than double the size of the Afghan army and police force, to a total of 400,000. That includes recruiting, training and equipment. 
 At a stop at a military base in Alaska on Thursday, Mr. Obama told a gathering of soldiers that he would not risk more lives ''unless it is necessary to America's vital interests.'' He added during his visit to Tokyo on Friday that he wanted to avoid taking any step that could be seen as an ''open-ended commitment.''
 The administration said Friday that it planned to cut up to 5 percent at domestic agencies in fiscal 2011 as part of an effort to reduce the federal budget deficit, which rose to $1.4 trillion with the economic stimulus and financial bailouts.
 Several leading Republicans have criticized Mr. Obama's willingness to spend more freely on domestic programs and urged him to provide General McChrystal with the resources he is seeking in Afghanistan.
 ''Keeping our country safe: Isn't that the first job of government?'' said Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican from Missouri and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ''If we have just a minimalist counterterrorism strategy, the Taliban will come back over the mountains from Pakistan, and they will be followed by their co-conspirators from the Al Qaeda organization.'' 
 Cost is far from the only concern about escalating the war. The debate intensified last week amid disclosures that the United States ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, had sent cables to Washington expressing his reservations about deploying additional troops, citing weak Afghan leadership and widening corruption.
 That kind of doubt could also make some in Congress hesitant to support an expansion of the war, especially with the midterm elections coming next year.
 Representative David R. Obey, a Democrat from Wisconsin who heads the House Appropriations Committee, said recently that sending more troops to Afghanistan could drain the Treasury and ''devour virtually any other priorities that the president or anyone in Congress had.''
 Representative John Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of a subcommittee on defense appropriations, said in an interview that because of concerns about President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, he thought a majority of the 258 Democrats in the House would vote against any bill to pay for more troops. ''A month ago, I would have said 60 to 70,'' he said. 
 ''Can you pass one?'' Mr. Murtha said. ''It depends on the Republicans.''
 Mr. Murtha said he opposed sending more troops, though he would support any decision Mr. Obama made. He said he was concerned that even without a supplemental bill, total spending on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars would surge past $1 trillion next year, which could hamper the economy for years to come. 
 Others said some Republicans could find it hard to justify a yes vote on troops after criticizing Mr. Obama for his spending. Some liberal Democrats said voters who had been drawn to Mr. Obama for his early opposition to the Iraq war could become disenchanted if he approved a major expansion in Afghanistan. 
 ''In the times we're in right now, I just totally believe that the public that elected President Obama really wants to see something different,'' said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California. 
 During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama was careful to say that he would not cut military spending while the nation was engaged in two wars. He also said it was important to shore up the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. And shortly after he took office, he approved sending an additional 21,000 soldiers there, bringing the total American force to 68,000.
 Still, many of his supporters assumed that his pledges to withdraw from Iraq, and to rein in the cost overruns on high-tech weapons programs, would still produce significant savings.
 But even though Mr. Obama has won battles to cancel the F-22 fighter plane and other advanced programs, the immediate savings have been offset by increased spending on the surveillance drones and mine-resistant vehicles needed in the field now. 
 And he recently signed a $680 billion military authorization bill for fiscal 2010 that represented a 2.7 percent increase over the 2009 spending level and a 1.9 percent increase over President Bush's peak budget in fiscal 2008.
 The administration has projected that spending on Iraq would drop by $25.8 billion in fiscal 2010, to $60.8 billion, as most of the troops withdraw. 
 It also expected spending on the Afghanistan war to increase by $18.5 billion in fiscal 2010, to $65.4 billion, for a net savings on the two wars of $7.3 billion, if no more troops wereadded.

HEADLINE: At Bloomberg, A Modest Strategy To Rule The World

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
PLOPPED in a white leather chair in a small office in Bloomberg L.P.'s Manhattan headquarters, Andrew Lack knows exactly how to articulate the aspirations of this 28-year-old media and technology company. 
 ''We want to be the world's most influential news organization,'' says Mr. Lack, who oversees Bloomberg's television, radio and dot-com endeavors.
Very clear. The most influential. On the planet. 
 It's a goal several other Bloomberg executives have already mentioned to a pair of visitors. And when Mr. Lack, 62, a former head of NBC News, hears his guests wonder if something funny is in his company's coffee -- a special sauce that keeps all Bloombergians marching so efficiently and effectively to the same tune -- he looks a tad chagrined. 
 ''Oh, my! I don't want to sound as if I'm on message,'' he says, laughing apprehensively while also sending a ''help me'' look to a Bloomberg spokeswoman nearby.
 These days, truth be told, the entire company is on message. That's because the data behemoth that Michael R. Bloomberg created and named after himself in 1981, long before he became mayor of New York, finally has the reach, resources and appetites to try snaring the mantle of Most Influential -- at least in the rarefied world of business news.
 After years of being an underdog pushing its troops to be better and faster, Bloomberg now has an upper hand. Publishing giants like Conde Nast, Time Inc. and The New York Times, with their veteran scribes and rich histories, have laid off people and scaled back. Bloomberg may lack the pedigree and gloss of some of its rivals, but it has one thing they don't right now: money to throw around.
 This year alone, Bloomberg, deploying the cash spouting from its data business, has recruited refugees from The Wall Street Journal and Fortune and opened bureaus in places like Ecuador and Abu Dhabi. Its editorial staff (which includes radio, TV and Web site workers) now numbers 2,200, compared with 1,250 journalists at The Times and 1,900 at Dow Jones (a figure that includes the newswires and the Journal staff). 
 When the 80-year-old BusinessWeek went on the block, Bloomberg opened its wallet and snatched it away from circling private equity firms in October for just $5 million in cash -- a relatively small sum that still represents a big change. For the last decade, Bloomberg has barely bothered to venture outside the realm of high finance; its news was produced to help subscribers to its terminals make more money for themselves. 
 With BusinessWeek, likely to be renamed Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the company is setting its sights on a much broader audience. That includes Main Street readers and, much more important for Bloomberg, senior executives, government leaders and other global movers and shakers. It's also trying to revamp its Web site and television programming -- long neglected inside the company -- into services that appeal to people who don't trade securities for a living. 
 At a time when most media companies can barely pay for cake at going-away parties, Bloomberg appears to be rolling in dough. 
 Its headquarters, on the East Side, has the crystalline look and smooth textures of an airport terminal from the 22nd century. It has sleek, elegantly curved glass walls, outdoor patios, art installations hanging over escalators, fish tanks filled with exotic species and digital screens overhead that display the weather -- with lightning flashes -- and trading levels for the Nasdaq. Employees snack on free kiwis and pomegranates and gulp fancy sodas. The company even employs full-time bathroom attendants to wipe up errant droplets of water on the countertops. 
 Although Bloomberg, which is privately held, draws attention for its media ambitions, a vast majority of the company's projected $6.3 billion in revenue -- and nearly all of its profit -- derives from financial information systems. These software packages, still known as ''terminals'' from when Bloomberg made the hardware, can be found on virtually all Wall Street trading desks, housing huge amounts of data and analytics, from price quotations for fixed-income and derivative products to complex risk analysis -- making Bloomberg a live-on-Wall-Street, die-on-Wall-Street enterprise. 
 During the financial boom of the last two decades, Bloomberg terminals flew out the door. This year, for the first time in the company's history, the number of installed terminals will fall, albeit modestly. Some analysts wonder whether the company's fast-growth days could be behind it, spurring it to seek new ways to make money on Wall Street while upping the ante in its media game. 
 The time has come, company officials say, to move beyond a hard-core clientele of financial information hounds.
 ''We need a broader audience,'' says Daniel L. Doctoroff, Bloomberg's president. ''The history of this company is you do the counterintuitive, countercyclical thing. It's part of our DNA.''
 IN an odd way, for all of Bloomberg's new-media savvy, the company now finds itself trying to wedge old-media acquisitions and culture into a company built on speed, efficiency and digital technology.
 Since emerging out of nowhere in 1981, Bloomberg now controls a third of the $16 billion global financial data market, according to year-end 2008 numbers from Inside Market Data Reference, a research firm. (Thomson Reuters Markets controls another third, and a handful of smaller players jockey for the rest.)
 Bloomberg got a strong hold on Wall Street in the '90s, in part through its messaging capabilities, which allowed traders, long before e-mail was prevalent, to swap price information for securities that traded privately between brokers and buyers.
 That was just the simple stuff. Wall Street gurus now use Bloomberg's whiz-bang systems to graphically map their portfolios or to assess counterparty risk. 
 This operation accounts for 85 percent of Bloomberg's revenue, and the focus is helping roughly 280,000 customers who each pay about $20,000 annually to get millisecond head starts on pricing or market-moving headlines, as well as in-depth financial analysis.
 During the recent, bubbly boom on Wall Street, from 2004 to 2007, Bloomberg's revenue climbed an average of 13 percent annually, according to the company. But the financial crisis and the collapse of several companies that were large Bloomberg customers -- Lehman Brothers alone had 3,500 terminals -- has translated into a slowdown. 
 Revenue at Bloomberg is expected to grow around 3 percent this year, but the firm's installed base of terminals will most likely be down about 2 percent, says Mr. Doctoroff. 
 It's unlikely that Bloomberg will have the same robust levels of growth it did during Wall Street's boom years, Mr. Doctoroff acknowledges. ''But the growth will still be meaningful,'' he added. ''We should see single-digit percentage growth in terminal units.''
 These days, for instance, Bloomberg is looking for new revenue streams from trading and internal risk-management programs for Wall Street firms, says Thomas F. Secunda, who oversees Bloomberg's financial products.
 A slightly rumpled figure who liberally sprinkles the term ''killer app'' into conversations, Mr. Secunda met Mr. Bloomberg at Salomon Brothers, the onetime Wall Street bond-trading powerhouse, in the 1970s. (Mr. Bloomberg started his company with a $10 million severance check he received when he left Salomon.) 
 Though Mr. Bloomberg stepped back from the company when he became mayor in 2002, his fingerprints are still all over it. Mr. Doctoroff worked for him as a deputy mayor before joining the company, and Peter T. Grauer, the company's chairman, met Mr. Bloomberg through their daughters' horse-jumping competitions. Mr. Bloomberg, who owns 85 percent of the company, was consulted on and approved the Merrill Lynch and BusinessWeek deals, Mr. Grauer says, as is allowed under the city's conflict-of-interest guidelines. 
 Inside the company's sleek headquarters is a buzzing collection of worker bees and brainiacs. Although Ph.D.'s in physics and math are hired to develop quantitative programs for the terminals, one of Bloomberg's biggest challenges is getting customers to use those myriad applications. Many customers use only a small fraction of the machines' 30,146 functions. 
 On the hunt for new customers, Bloomberg is testing a Web-based product aimed at law firms. Executives are also looking at the sports arena, sussing out interest among team owners or even fantasy leagues for a system to analyze sports statistics.
 Shoveling money into research for corporate customers thirsty for more information may prove to be a winning growth formula. But heads are definitely being scratched as Bloomberg invests more money in news -- an industry that, by and large, is struggling mightily to merely stay afloat, much less find financial growth.
 BLOOMBERG'S newsroom is so Sam's-Club-warehouse-big that it needs guideposts for what each long aisle of editors and reporters covers: ''Stocks,'' ''Emerging Markets,'' Corporate Finance'' and so on. On a recent morning, it was surprisingly quiet, with reporters speaking on their headsets and clacking away at multiple Bloomberg screens spreading horizontally across their desks.
 In one corner, a signpost designates the ''Speed Desk.'' The members of this department -- 200 people worldwide -- spend their days spitting out headlines, in an effort to give subscribers a three-second lead that can mean a better price on a commodity or a stock.
 Former employees complain that they often felt surveilled in the newsroom, and the place can still come across as something of a white-collar, digital sweatshop -- terminals and ID cards, for example, closely monitor employees' comings and goings. Still, that same rigid culture and disciplinary zeal have produced a formidable enterprise.
 ''We started with nothing when Bloomberg News began in 1990,'' says Matthew Winkler, who, as editor in chief, has overseen the news operation from the beginning. ''There was no pedigree, no platform, no reputation to speak of.'' 
 For many years, Bloomberg viewed news as little more than an added service for Wall Street traders. To that end, Mr. Winkler demanded short, direct articles. He ordered reporters to avoid adverbs and adjectives, along with ''but'' and ''however,'' which he said muddled the clarity of sentences. 
 ''I could write a Bloomberg earnings story in my sleep, because it's the same formula for every single story,'' says Chris Roush, a business journalism professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who worked at Bloomberg News in the late 1990s. ''To a certain degree, the reporters there feel like their creativity is stifled because of that.''
 Mr. Winkler's reputation as a volatile manager also made recruiting more- seasoned talent a challenge. Nowadays, in interviews at least, he makes efforts to check his high-horsepower persona. Although he manages more journalists than almost any other editor in the business, Mr. Winkler, 54, still seems to think like an underdog. He uses verbs like ''prove'' and ''aspire'' when discussing Bloomberg News. After he leaves the interview -- in which he doesn't say a single inappropriate word -- Mr. Winkler e-mails his media-relations chief to ask: ''WAS I OKAY?''
 Two floors above the sprawling newsroom, wedged in the corner of the corporate department -- take a right at ''Philanthropy'' -- is a recent arrival to Bloomberg, a longtime newsman. At 67, Norman Pearlstine has already held two of the biggest jobs in old media: managing editor of The Journal and editor in chief of Time Inc. 
 ''Norm Pearlstine comes to Bloomberg, he provides instant credibility for people who wonder what is Bloomberg up to,'' Mr. Winkler says. 
 So last year, Mr. Pearlstine was recruited from the Carlyle Group, the private equity firm, and named chief content officer. The role has him playing media consigliere to Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Grauer, advising on Web, television and news operations. 
 Mr. Pearlstine didn't expect his role to be hugely taxing when he signed on, and his responsibilities, by design, have been relatively open-ended. ''I actually came in with what I thought was the perfect job,'' he says. ''I had two desks and no one reporting to me. I thought I deserved this after all this time.'' 
 Despite Mr. Pearlstine's years of experience as an editing maestro, he has largely stayed away from Mr. Winkler's news operation. 
 ''I've seen him around,'' says Christine Harper, chief financial correspondent, of Mr. Pearlstine, but ''he doesn't seem to be as directly involved in the news.''
 The ambitions for Bloomberg's news operation were changing even before Mr. Pearlstine arrived. Bloomberg has used the cash spraying from its terminal business to hire an astounding number of journalists in recent years, becoming something of a haven in a downsizing industry. Top writers or editors from Fortune, Forbes and The Journal land there seemingly weekly. (Six of the company's 11 executive editors have worked at The Journal.)
 Bloomberg now has 142 journalists in Washington, 196 in Tokyo and 30 in Paris. It recently opened bureaus in Nigeria, Ghana and Cyprus. It has won numerous journalism awards and, to cite just one example, has offered some of the shrewdest coverage of the financial crisis over the last couple of years. 
 The problem is that all of this work is largely distributed through its 280,000 Bloomberg machines, so its audience is confined mostly to those who subscribe to its terminals. Bloomberg essentially has a giant army of reporters with no route to the broader media sea.
 TO reach that broader audience and to have its name and its brand distributed beyond its terminals, Bloomberg has been dependent on newspapers to carry its reports. 
 Newspapers like The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville use a lot of Bloomberg articles. More significantly, Bloomberg is collaborating with The Washington Post on a newswire service set to start in January. Bloomberg is also planning a host of new charges for newspapers to use its content. 
 To carve out its own destiny in print while also reaching a new audience of decision-makers, Bloomberg snapped up BusinessWeek. Mr. Pearlstine had been sniffing around other media properties, including Congressional Quarterly, when BusinessWeek came on the block this summer. BusinessWeek's parent company, McGraw-Hill, was under pressure to sell the magazine, which lost more than $43 million last year. 
 What attracted Bloomberg was BusinessWeek's audience. With a circulation of more than 900,000, and about 11 million Web site visitors a month, BusinessWeek potentially expands Bloomberg's readership -- and sources -- well beyond its trading-floor customers.
 Executives hope BusinessWeek will become a place where President Obama or Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric will go to for the kind of exclusive interviews they have traditionally given more established news publications. (Although Bloomberg has some arts and culture coverage, the company says it has no interest in moving substantially beyond its core offering of business information and news.)
 BusinessWeek employees are interviewing to keep their jobs and have to submit essays outlining goals for themselves and the magazine, along with fresh resumes. Mr. Pearlstine is leaning on old-media hands to advise him on the integration, including the former Time editor Jim Kelly and Stephen B. Shepard, who edited BusinessWeek for 20 years before being succeeded by Stephen J. Adler in 2005. (Mr. Adler resigned from the magazine after Bloomberg acquired it.) 
 Mr. Pearlstine says Bloomberg will maintain the magazine as a weekly, improve the paper quality and expand globally, with The Economist as a model. A culture clash might emerge in bringing a magazine, with its individualistic writers, into Bloomberg's monochrome culture. 
 ''The company isn't in the business of building stars -- I think that they're based on teamwork and contribution,'' says Andrew Leckey, president of the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism. ''How the magazine fits in there is a little tricky.'' One early antistar move: on Friday, Bloomberg ended the BusinessWeek column of CNBC's Maria Bartiromo. (Jack and Suzy Welch also announced that they're ending their column in the magazine.)
 Although Mr. Pearlstine and Mr. Winkler both report directly to Mr. Doctoroff, Mr. Pearlstine will have to report through Mr. Winkler on BusinessWeek matters ''because it's editorial,'' Mr. Winkler says. 
 Other media players, meanwhile, are watching what Bloomberg does with the existing BusinessWeek and Bloomberg Web sites. Will it combine them? Will they charge readers for content? And -- more important -- does Bloomberg care if any of its media properties actually make money? 
 ''BusinessWeek we expect will be profitable, but it doesn't have to be profitable a year or two years from now,'' Mr. Doctoroff says.
 OTHER Bloomberg media holdings have not been under much, if any, pressure over the years to make money and for the most part have seemed like second thoughts at the company. Consider Bloomberg Markets, a magazine free to terminal subscribers that was introduced in 1992 and is not profitable. Its first cover featured a drawing of the terminal.
 ''It was basically a monthly users' manual,'' says Ron Henkoff, the current editor. ''There were no sections. There were no photos.'' Although the magazine looks and reads a lot better today, it's still terminal-focused. Articles run first on the terminal, and even the most ambitious pieces, like ''Street of Broken Dreams,'' a report in May about laid-off financial employees, carry terminal tip boxes. (''Type UKWILOMA <Index> GP <Go> to graph changes in payrolls.'')
 Likewise, when Bloomberg Television was introduced in 1994, Mr. Lack, then at NBC, was unimpressed. Bloomberg covered most of the screen with an L-shaped box jammed with market information. ''Bloomberg basically said: 'We don't care if you like us or not. Just look at this. Isn't it amazing?''' recalls Mr. Lack. ''You almost felt as though you were choked by all that data.'' 
 When Mr. Pearlstine recruited him last year to run the multimedia business -- television, radio and Web -- what Mr. Lack found was alarming. ''I thought it was going to be a turnaround,'' he says. ''Then I found that it felt more like a start-up. There wasn't an infrastructure here to produce a professional cable television channel.'' 
 Mr. Lack has made some changes, including decluttering on-screen graphics, pulling anchors from a dark studio into a newsroom setting, and adding shows like day-after repeats of ''Charlie Rose'' at night. Still, Bloomberg's cable audience in the United States is much smaller than CNBC's. 
 ''We'll make this into a business, don't get me wrong,'' Mr. Lack says. ''Four or five years from now, this will be a business.''
 As recently as a year ago, when Bloomberg tried to hire Mr. Lack, he thought that executives' talk of being ''most influential'' was absurd. ''I, of course, completely dismissed it.''
 Now, he says, he's a convert. ''This is not an old-media company,'' Mr. Lack says. ''We're a new kid on the block in a new world order.''

HEADLINE: At Bloomberg, A Modest Strategy To Rule The World

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
PLOPPED in a white leather chair in a small office in Bloomberg L.P's Manhattan headquarters, Andrew Lack knows exactly how to articulate the aspirations of this 28-year-old media and technology company. 
 ''We want to be the world's most influential news organization,'' says Mr. Lack, who oversees Bloomberg's television, radio and dot-com endeavors.
 Very clear. The most influential. On the planet. 
 It's a goal several other Bloomberg executives have already mentioned to a pair of visitors. And when Mr. Lack, 62, a former head of NBC News, hears his guests wonder if something funny is in his company's coffee -- a special sauce that keeps all Bloombergians marching so efficiently and effectively to the same tune -- he looks a tad chagrined. 
 ''Oh, my! I don't want to sound as if I'm on message,'' he says, laughing apprehensively while also sending a ''help me'' look to a Bloomberg spokeswoman nearby. 
 These days, truth be told, the entire Bloomberg organization is on message. That's because the financial data behemoth that Michael R. Bloomberg created and named after himself in 1981, long before he became mayor of New York, finally has the reach, tools, resources and outsize appetites to try snaring the mantle of Most Influential -- at least in the rarefied world of business news. 
 After years of being an underdog forced to push its troops to be better and faster, Bloomberg now has an upper hand. Publishing giants like Conde Nast, Time Inc. and The New York Times, with their veteran scribes and rich histories, have laid off staff members and scaled back. Bloomberg may lack the pedigree and gloss of some of its rivals, but it has one thing they don't right now: money to throw around. 
 This year alone, Bloomberg, continuing to deploy the cash spouting from its data business, has recruited refugees from The Wall Street Journal and Fortune to its news division and opened bureaus in such far-flung places as Ecuador and Abu Dhabi. Its editorial staff (which includes radio, TV and Web site workers) now numbers 2,200, compared with 1,250 journalists at The Times and 1,900 at Dow Jones (a figure that includes the newswires and the Journal staff). 
 When the 80-year-old BusinessWeek went on the block, Bloomberg opened its wallet and snatched it away from circling private equity firms in October for just $5 million in cash -- a relatively small sum that still represents a big change. For the last decade, Bloomberg has barely bothered to venture outside the realm of high finance; its news was produced to help subscribers to its terminals make more money for themselves. 
 With BusinessWeek, likely to be renamed Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the company is setting its sights on a much broader audience. That includes Main Street readers and, much more important for Bloomberg, senior executives, government leaders and other global movers and shakers. It's also trying to revamp its Web site and television programming -- long neglected inside the company -- into services that appeal to people who don't trade securities for a living. 
 At a time when most media companies can barely pay for cake at going-away parties, Bloomberg appears to be rolling in dough. 
 Its headquarters, on the East Side, has the crystalline look and smooth textures of an airport terminal from the 22nd century. It has sleek, elegantly curved glass walls, outdoor patios, art installations hanging over escalators, fish tanks filled with exotic species and digital screens overhead that display the weather -- with lightning flashes -- and trading levels for the Nasdaq. Employees snack on free kiwis and pomegranates and gulp fancy sodas. The company even employs full-time bathroom attendants to wipe up errant droplets of water on the countertops. 
 Although Bloomberg, which is privately held, draws attention for its media ambitions, a vast majority of the company's projected $6.3 billion in revenue -- and nearly all of its profit -- derives from financial information systems. These software packages, still known as ''terminals'' from when Bloomberg made the hardware, can be found on virtually all Wall Street trading desks, housing huge amounts of data and analytics, from price quotations for fixed-income and derivative products to complex risk analysis -- making Bloomberg a live-on-Wall-Street, die-on-Wall-Street enterprise. 
 During the financial boom of the last two decades, Bloomberg terminals flew out the door. This year, for the first time in the company's history, the number of installed terminals will fall, albeit modestly. Some analysts wonder whether the company's fast-growth days could be behind it, spurring it to seek new ways to make money on Wall Street while upping the ante in its media game. 
 The time has come, company officials say, to move beyond a hard-core clientele of financial information hounds. 
 ''We need a broader audience,'' says Daniel L. Doctoroff, Bloomberg's president. ''The history of this company is you do the counterintuitive, countercyclical thing. It's part of our DNA.'' 
 IN an odd way, for all of Bloomberg's new-media savvy, the company now finds itself trying to wedge old-media acquisitions and culture into a company built on speed, efficiency and digital technology. 
 Since emerging out of nowhere in 1981, Bloomberg now controls a third of the $16 billion global financial data market, according to year-end 2008 numbers from Inside Market Data Reference, a research firm. (Thomson Reuters Markets controls another third, and a handful of smaller players jockey for the rest.) 
 Bloomberg got a strong hold on Wall Street in the '90s, in part through its messaging capabilities, which allowed traders, long before e-mail was prevalent, to swap price information for securities that traded privately between brokers and buyers. 
 That was just the simple stuff. Wall Street gurus now use Bloomberg's whiz-bang systems to graphically map their portfolios or to assess counterparty risk. 
 This operation accounts for 85 percent of Bloomberg's revenue, and the focus is helping roughly 280,000 customers who each pay about $20,000 annually to get millisecond head starts on pricing or market-moving headlines, as well as in-depth financial analysis. 
 During the recent, bubbly boom on Wall Street, from 2004 to 2007, Bloomberg's revenue climbed an average of 13 percent annually, according to the company. But the financial crisis and the collapse of several companies that were large Bloomberg customers -- Lehman Brothers alone had 3,500 terminals -- has translated into a slowdown. 
 Revenue at Bloomberg is expected to grow around 3 percent this year, but the firm's installed base of terminals will most likely be down about 2 percent, says Mr. Doctoroff. 
 It's unlikely that Bloomberg will have the same robust levels of growth it did during Wall Street's boom years, Mr. Doctoroff acknowledges. ''But the growth will still be meaningful,'' he added. ''We should see single-digit percentage growth in terminal units.'' 
 These days, for instance, Bloomberg is looking for new revenue streams from trading and internal risk-management programs for Wall Street firms, says Thomas F. Secunda, who oversees Bloomberg's financial products. 
 A slightly rumpled figure who liberally sprinkles the term ''killer app'' into conversations, Mr. Secunda met Mr. Bloomberg at Salomon Brothers, the onetime Wall Street bond-trading powerhouse, in the 1970s. (Mr. Bloomberg started his company with a $10 million severance check he received when he left Salomon.) 
 Though Mr. Bloomberg stepped back from the company when he became mayor in 2002, his fingerprints are still all over it. Mr. Doctoroff worked for him as a deputy mayor before joining the company, and Peter T. Grauer, the company's chairman, met Mr. Bloomberg through their daughters' horse-jumping competitions. Mr. Bloomberg, who owns 85 percent of the company, was consulted on and approved the Merrill Lynch and BusinessWeek deals, Mr. Grauer says, as is allowed under the city's conflict-of-interest guidelines. 
 Inside the company's sleek headquarters is a buzzing collection of worker bees and brainiacs. Although Ph.D.'s in physics and math are hired to develop quantitative programs for the terminals, one of Bloomberg's biggest challenges is getting customers to use those myriad applications. Many customers use only a small fraction of the machines' 30,146 functions. 
 On the hunt for new customers, Bloomberg is testing a Web-based product aimed at law firms. Executives are also looking at the sports arena, sussing out interest among team owners or even fantasy leagues for a system to analyze sports statistics. 
 Shoveling money into research for corporate customers thirsty for more information may prove to be a winning growth formula. But heads are definitely being scratched as Bloomberg invests more money in news -- an industry that, by and large, is struggling mightily to merely stay afloat, much less find financial growth. 
 BLOOMBERG'S newsroom is so Sam's-Club-warehouse-big that it needs guideposts for what each long aisle of editors and reporters covers: ''Stocks,'' ''Emerging Markets,'' Corporate Finance'' and so on. On a recent morning, it was surprisingly quiet, with reporters speaking on their headsets and clacking away at multiple Bloomberg screens spreading horizontally across their desks. 
 In one corner, a signpost designates the ''Speed Desk.'' The members of this department -- 200 people worldwide -- spend their days spitting out headlines, in an effort to give subscribers a three-second lead that can mean a better price on a commodity or a stock. 
 Former employees complain that they often felt surveilled in the newsroom, and the place can still come across as something of a white-collar, digital sweatshop -- terminals and ID cards, for example, closely monitor employees' comings and goings. Still, that same rigid culture and disciplinary zeal have produced a formidable enterprise. 
 ''We started with nothing when Bloomberg News began in 1990,'' says Matthew Winkler, who, as editor in chief, has overseen the news operation from the beginning. ''There was no pedigree, no platform, no reputation to speak of.'' 
 For many years, Bloomberg viewed news as little more than an added service for Wall Street traders. To that end, Mr. Winkler demanded short, direct articles. He ordered reporters to avoid adverbs and adjectives, along with ''but'' and ''however,'' which he said muddled the clarity of sentences. 
 ''I could write a Bloomberg earnings story in my sleep, because it's the same formula for every single story,'' says Chris Roush, a business journalism professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who worked at Bloomberg News in the late 1990s. ''To a certain degree, the reporters there feel like their creativity is stifled because of that.'' 
 Mr. Winkler's reputation as a volatile manager also made recruiting more- seasoned talent a challenge. Nowadays, in interviews at least, he makes efforts to check his high-horsepower persona. Although he manages more journalists than almost any other editor in the business, Mr. Winkler, 54, still seems to think like an underdog. He uses verbs like ''prove'' and ''aspire'' when discussing Bloomberg News. After he leaves the interview -- in which he doesn't say a single inappropriate word -- Mr. Winkler e-mails his media-relations chief to ask: ''WAS I OKAY?'' 
 Two floors above the sprawling newsroom, wedged in the corner of the corporate department -- take a right at ''Philanthropy'' -- is a recent arrival to Bloomberg, a longtime newsman. At 67, Norman Pearlstine has already held two of the biggest jobs in old media: managing editor of The Journal and editor in chief of Time Inc.

HEADLINE: In House Record, Many Spoke With One Voice: The Lobbyists'

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the official record of the historic House debate on overhauling health care, the speeches of many lawmakers echo with similarities. Often, that was no accident. 
 Statements by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten, in whole or in part, by Washington lobbyists working for Genentech, one of the world's largest biotechnology companies. 
 E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times show that the lobbyists drafted one statement for Democrats and another for Republicans. 
 The lobbyists, employed by Genentech and by two Washington law firms, were remarkably successful in getting the statements printed in the Congressional Record under the names of different members of Congress. 
 Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss drug giant Roche, estimates that 42 House members picked up some of its talking points -- 22 Republicans and 20 Democrats, an unusual bipartisan coup for lobbyists. 
 In an interview, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said: ''I regret that the language was the same. I did not know it was.'' He said he got his statement from his staff and ''did not know where they got the information from.''
 Members of Congress submit statements for publication in the Congressional Record all the time, often with a decorous request to ''revise and extend my remarks.'' It is unusual for so many revisions and extensions to match up word for word. It is even more unusual to find clear evidence that the statements originated with lobbyists.
 The e-mail messages and their attached documents indicate that the statements were based on information supplied by Genentech employees to one of its lobbyists, Matthew L. Berzok, a lawyer at Ryan, MacKinnon, Vasapoli & Berzok who is identified as the ''author'' of the documents. The statements were disseminated by lobbyists at a big law firm, Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal.
 In an e-mail message to fellow lobbyists on Nov. 5, two days before the House vote, Todd M. Weiss, senior managing director of Sonnenschein, said, ''We are trying to secure as many House R's and D's to offer this/these statements for the record as humanly possible.'' 
 He told the lobbyists to ''conduct aggressive outreach to your contacts on the Hill to see if their bosses would offer the attached statements (or an edited version) for the record.'' 
 In recent years, Genentech's political action committee and lobbyists for Roche and Genentech have made campaign contributions to many House members, including some who filed statements in the Congressional Record. And company employees have been among the hosts at fund-raisers for some of those lawmakers. But Evan L. Morris, head of Genentech's Washington office, said, ''There was no connection between the contributions and the statements.'' 
 Mr. Morris said Republicans and Democrats, concerned about the unemployment rate, were receptive to the company's arguments about the need to keep research jobs in the United States.
 The statements were not intended to change the bill, which was not open for much amendment during the debate. They were meant to show bipartisan support for certain provisions, even though the vote on passage generally followed party lines.
 Democrats emphasized the bill's potential to create jobs in health care, health information technology and clinical research on new drugs. 
 Republicans opposed the bill, but praised a provision that would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to approve generic versions of expensive biotechnology drugs, along the lines favored by brand-name companies like Genentech.
 Lawmakers from both parties said it was important to conduct research on such ''biosimilar'' products in the United States. Several took a swipe at aggressive Indian competitors.
 Asked about the Congressional statements, a lobbyist close to Genentech said: ''This happens all the time. There was nothing nefarious about it.''
 In separate statements using language suggested by the lobbyists, Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and Joe Wilson of South Carolina, both Republicans, said: ''One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India.''
 In remarks on the House floor, Representative Phil Hare, Democrat of Illinois, recalled that his family had faced eviction when his father was sick and could not make payments on their home. He said the House bill would save others from such hardship.
 In a written addendum in the Congressional Record, Mr. Hare said the bill would also create high-paying jobs. Timothy Schlittner, a spokesman for Mr. Hare, said: ''That part of his statement was drafted for us by Roche pharmaceutical company. It is something he agrees with.''
 The boilerplate in the Congressional Record included some conversational touches, as if actually delivered on the House floor. 
 In the standard Democratic statement, Representative Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania said: ''Let me repeat that for some of my friends on the other side of the aisle. This bill will create high-paying, high-quality jobs in health care delivery, technology and research in the United States.''
 Mr. Brady's chief of staff, Stanley V. White, said he had received the draft statement from a lobbyist for Genentech's parent company, Roche.
 ''We were approached by the lobbyist, who asked if we would be willing to enter a statement in the Congressional Record,'' Mr. White said. ''I asked him for a draft. I tweaked a couple of words. There's not much reason to reinvent the wheel on a Congressional Record entry.'' 
 Some differences were just a matter of style. Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, said, ''I see this bill as an exciting opportunity to create the kind of jobs we so desperately need in this country, while at the same time improving the lives of all Americans.'' 
 Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey, used the same words, but said the bill would improve the lives of ''ALL Americans.'' 
 Mr. Payne and Mr. Brady said the bill would ''create new opportunities and markets for our brightest technology minds.'' Mr. Pascrell said the bill would ''create new opportunities and markets for our brightest minds in technology.''
 In nearly identical words, three Republicans -- Representatives K. Michael Conaway of Texas, Lynn Jenkins of Kansas and Lee Terry of Nebraska -- said they had criticized many provisions of the bill, and ''rightfully so.'' 
 But, each said, ''I do believe the sections relating to the creation of a market for biosimilar products is one area of the bill that strikes the appropriate balance in providing lower cost options.''

HEADLINE: I.P.O.'s Return in Force to the Nasdaq

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
The recent flurry of start-up acquisitions could signal an economic recovery for Silicon Valley. But is a real recovery possible without the return of initial public offerings?
 Probably not. But the I.P.O. landscape is looking better, too, says Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, the exchange where most technology companies go public. 
 ''There have been more fits and starts, and we have clearly seen a dramatic increase in I.P.O. activity,'' Mr. Greifeld said. ''It's been a healthy couple of months.''
 So healthy, in fact, that Nasdaq has brought its confetti machine out of the closet, where it had been collecting dust. It is a Nasdaq tradition to shower confetti when a new company is listed on the exchange, but even though there were a few I.P.O.'s in 2008, the economy as a whole was too grim to warrant confetti.
 Acquisitions are essential to a healthy Silicon Valley, but public offerings bring the huge, Googlelike returns that technology investors depend on. And as Cameron Lester of the venture capital firm Azure Capital Partners put it: ''We have 10 percent unemployment. M.& A. kills jobs; I.P.O.'s create them.''
 Twenty-seven companies have gone public on the Nasdaq this year, and all but three of those were in the second half. There are signs that private tech companies are getting more confident about the public markets, too. There are 82 I.P.O. applications in the Nasdaq pipeline, and 80 percent of those have come in the last 75 days, Mr. Greifeld said.
 OpenTable, the restaurant reservation Web site that went public in May, broke the logjam, he said. A123 Systems, which makes lithium-ion batteries, went public in September and inspired the re-emergence of the confetti machine. Mr. Greifeld said that offering was promising because the company was unprofitable and pitched to investors based on its story and promise. Shares of A123 Systems are down 17 percent since then.
 Fortinet, which makes network security appliances, is set to go public next week, according to Renaissance Capital. So are HealthPort, which provides electronic medical records, and Archipelago Learning, an online education company for students in kindergarten through high school.
 ''We believe fundamentally that good companies today have the ability to come out'' into the public markets, Mr. Greifeld said. CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

HEADLINE: Protecting Open Spaces

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your Nov. 10 editorial ''Promises on Open Space'' struck nearly the right chord when saying Americans are willing to protect open spaces ''even in the midst of a recession.'' One of the best reasons to protect open space now is that we're in a recession, not in spite of it. 
 A dollar invested today protects far more land for future generations than it did a few years ago. That makes the returns on our investment -- in the form of clean water, clean air and much more -- even higher than usual. 
 President Obama's increased appropriation of open-space funds takes advantage of this logic. The value of these investments resonates across party lines. In New Jersey's Nov. 3 vote to invest $400 million in its open spaces, the measure passed in seven counties that favored the Republican Chris Christie, and seven counties that favored the Democrat Jon S. Corzine.

 BODY:
NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Finances Flabby?
 Tighten the Body
 Just because your bank account has lost some of its muscle does not mean your body has to suffer the same fate. 
 Take Charlene Bryant, 45, who has lost 10 pounds since being laid off from her job with Citibank.
 ''With the flexibility that my schedule has given me, I can go to the gym more often, I can go at different times of the day,'' said Ms. Bryant, who is a member of the YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
 She saves money by cooking at home more often, she said, cutting calories and costs.
 Many others have joined their local YMCA, where rates differ from neighborhood to neighborhood and financial aid is an option.
 ''They feel like working out and being part of a community is part of their therapy,'' said Dordy Jourdain, executive director of the Bed-Stuy Y. ''We've distributed almost twice as much financial assistance than last year.''
 Edmundo Vicuna, an architect who was laid off six months ago and a member of the Bed-Stuy Y, said that sitting at home, e-mailing resumes and stewing over a lost job, would threaten his sanity.
 ''There's a lot of free time, and you need to spend it some way,'' said Mr. Vicuna, who acknowledged that in the past he had not been too concerned with working out.
 ''You need to spend some energy -- and if you feel rage, you cannot do anything,'' he added.
 Still others have taken to the city's parks and free spaces for basketball, soccer, walking, running, bike riding and even tai chi.
 Diery Prudent, 47, a personal fitness trainer who operates a small studio out of his home in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, said many of his colleagues were offering free classes or limited-time introductory rates to pull in clients. 
 ''Several of my clients have lost jobs, and one took a buyout,'' Mr. Prudent said on a recent afternoon in Prospect Park. ''So my clientele is down.''
 He said he encouraged his clients to take the knowledge he had given them in training to the city's parks and other public spaces.
 Philip Cruse, 49, a tai chi practitioner, said a recession could bring many people to simpler methods of achieving physical, mental and spiritual health.
 ''In hard economic times, practices like tai chi flourish because people are forced to go back to the basics,'' Mr. Cruse said, sitting at a bench near the Oriental Pavilion in Prospect Park.
 His friend and fellow practitioner Devron Wong Sam, 43, said the economic benefits did not hurt, either.
 ''I don't have to spend really anything to come out here and practice for free,'' Mr. Sam said. ''Tai chi is an anywhere-at-any-time exercise,'' he said. TRYMAINE LEE

HEADLINE: At CUNY, Mission to Elevate Science Begins to Bear Fruit

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The most visible manifestation yet of the billion-dollar transformation taking place at the City University of New York might also be the most unassuming: a so-called science cafe series in a Japanese restaurant on the Upper West Side. There, the public listened as faculty members described their work in fields ranging from the global water crisis to the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
 Four years ago, CUNY declared the ''Decade of Science,'' a neat rubric that encapsulated an ambitious plan to attract nationally recognized scientists in emerging disciplines and erect a half-dozen new science buildings on several campuses.
 On Monday, CUNY officials and politicians will thrust a ceremonial shovel in the ground in East Harlem to start the construction of the university's new School of Public Health at Hunter College. The school will be headed by Kenneth Olden, a cancer researcher who was the first African-American to direct one of the National Institutes of Health. It will be housed in a $131 million structure along with the Lois V. and Samuel J. Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College. 
 Across CUNY's 11 senior colleges, the science initiative has already started bearing fruit.
 Construction and renovation projects are under way or in the planning stages at Brooklyn, Lehman, Hunter and City Colleges. Nearly 100 full-time faculty members in science, technology, engineering and math have been recruited. And the foundation was just poured on the Advanced Science Research Center, which will have its headquarters at City College but will involve faculty from across the university overseeing research in five cutting-edge areas, including photonics, nanotechnology and structural biology.
 Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor and a mathematician by training, said the push to raise the university's profile in the sciences started with a ''nagging feeling'' several years ago. ''No great university can truly claim to be on the forefront of the development of knowledge unless it takes seriously its involvement with science,'' he said. 
 But the campaign for science comes as the university experiences record enrollment across its campuses and also as the economy founders. Some faculty members worry that the laserlike focus on science will divert money from more mundane but pressing needs, like classroom space, while others wonder whether government financing and private philanthropy can be sustained to see the plan through to fruition.
 The thrust in the sciences follows a decade in which CUNY sought to reverse a long period of wrenching decline by strengthening its admissions standards, increasing enrollment and hiring faculty. In many ways, the science push is an attempt to play catch-up.
 ''CUNY fell behind other campuses for decades,'' said John H. Marburger III, the science adviser to President George W. Bush and now a professor of physics and electrical engineering at Stony Brook University. ''Thirty years of open admissions, fiscal crises and an awkward administrative arrangement for research and graduate education inhibited what might have been the normal growth of federally funded research.''
 But Dr. Marburger said he was struck by the ''determination and thoughtfulness'' of CUNY's investments in science. ''CUNY has always had faculty who rank with the best, but the system was not organized to provide an attractive research environment,'' he said. ''That seems to be changing.''
 Others outside the university have also applauded CUNY's science initiative. ''The thing that impresses me about the CUNY plan is that it's strategic,'' said Ellis Rubinstein, president and chief executive of the New York Academy of Sciences, a nonprofit group with 24,000 members.
 ''It's picked some very key core areas that are not just curiosity-driven research, which is what we often see,'' he said. ''It's mission-oriented. There's no issue that will be bigger or more dramatic of a challenge in our world than water.''
 Mr. Rubinstein was referring to one of the research areas to be addressed in the 200,000-square-foot Advanced Science Research Center, now under construction: water and environmental sensing. Last year, CUNY lured Charles J. Vorosmarty away from the University of New Hampshire, where for more than three decades he taught and researched the threats to water resources around the world.
 Dr. Vorosmarty said he was impressed by the transformation CUNY was trying to engineer in such a compressed time frame. ''I was courted by some other places, but it's different here,'' he said. ''Other places might plug a gap in their capability. But this is a serious enterprise, and they want to get it right.''
 Dr. Vorosmarty, a professor of civil engineering who now heads CUNY's Environmental Crossroads Initiative, praised the interdisciplinary potential of the new research center, which was designed with an open plan to allow the free flow of people and ideas. Dr. Vorosmarty and his colleagues will have the top floor.
 Still, there are some misgivings about the rapid expansion in the sciences, even among CUNY scientists. Manfred Philipp, a chemist at Lehman College and chairman of the University Faculty Senate, said he was ''overjoyed'' that the administration was finally giving science its due, especially at a university that counts 10 Nobel laureates in science and medicine among its alumni. ''We were often working in labs dating to the 1930s and '40s that were totally out of date,'' he said. 
 But the Advanced Science Research Center was conceived, he said, before the current boom in enrollment. ''There is a concern that the level of investment in the center may have an effect on our investment in actual classroom space,'' he said. ''It's clear that the center will not touch on the lives of undergraduates.''
 Gillian M. Small, CUNY's vice chancellor for research, estimated the capital investment in the new and renovated science buildings at more than a billion dollars. ''It's the most expensive discipline to support,'' she said.
 Still, it is unclear when, and whether, the focus on sciences will bring CUNY to a place of national and international competitiveness. ''It's trying to come back and making valiant efforts to do that,'' said Sanjoy Banerjee, distinguished professor of chemical engineering, who was hired from the University of California, Santa Barbara, last year to head the university's new energy institute. 
 ''We've chosen the areas well,'' he said. ''But it's an uphill battle. Losing 20 or 30 years is hard to make up.''
 In the meantime, CUNY will advance the cause of science in ways large and small. Dr. Banerjee is among the professors who stepped outside the esoteric discourse of their fields at the Kouzan restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue. ''In some ways, people are scared of science,'' said Dr. Small, who started the science cafe series last year. ''If you can make it more amenable to people, they can come in on their way home from work and have a glass of wine and have the opportunity for a lot of interaction.''

HEADLINE: DRUG COMPANIES INCREASE PRICES IN FACE OF CHANGE

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Even as drug makers promise to support Washington's health care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the nation's drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years.
 In the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale prices of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, according to industry analysts. That will add more than $10 billion to the nation's drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. By at least one analysis, it is the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since 1992. 
 The drug trend is distinctly at odds with the direction of the Consumer Price Index, which has fallen by 1.3 percent in the last year. 
 Drug makers say they have valid business reasons for the price increases. Critics say the industry is trying to establish a higher price base before Congress passes legislation that tries to curb drug spending in coming years. 
 ''When we have major legislation anticipated, we see a run-up in price increases,'' says Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota. He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP, the advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health care legislation that the drug industry opposes. 
 A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after Congress added drug benefits to Medicare a few years ago, giving tens of millions of older Americans federally subsidized drug insurance. Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years.
 ''They try to maximize their profits,'' Mr. Newhouse said. 
 But drug companies say they are having to raise prices to maintain the profits necessary to invest in research and development of new drugs as the patents on many of their most popular drugs are set to expire over the next few years.
 ''Price adjustments for our products have no connection to health care reform,'' said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, which raised its prices about 8.9 percent in the last year, according to a stock analyst's report. 
 This year's increases mean the average annual cost for a brand-name prescription drug that is taken daily would be more than $2,000 -- $200 higher than last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. 
 And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster. Merck, for example, now sells daily 10-milligram pills of Singulair, the blockbuster asthma drug, at a wholesale price of $1,330 a year -- $147 more than last year. Singulair is now selling at retail, on drugstore.com, for nearly $1,478 a year. 
 The drug companies ''can charge what they want -- it's not fair,'' Eric White, the 42-year-old owner of a small jewelry store in Queens, said as he left a pharmacy recently.
 Despite having drug insurance, Mr. White says he now pays $110 a month out of pocket for two brand-name allergy medicines, even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door. 
 He shook his head. ''What can I do?'' he said. ''I need my medicines.''
 The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost-cutting provisions in the House legislation, which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $14 billion a year over a decade. 
 But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $8 billion a year -- $80 billion over 10 years -- from the nation's drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government. That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks. 
 But this year's price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement. And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10-year deal. 
 ''It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $80 billion because they'll be making more money,'' said Steven D. Findlay, senior health care analyst with the advocacy group Consumers Union. 
 Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. But name brands account for 78 percent of total prescription drug spending in this country. And as long as a name-brand drug still has patent protection it faces no price competition from generics. 
 Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the industry association -- the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America -- criticized the analysis Professor Schondelmeyer had conducted for AARP, saying it was politically motivated. 
 ''In AARP's skewed view of the world, medicines are always looked at as a cost and never seen as a savings -- even though medicines often reduce unnecessary hospitalization, help avoid costly medical procedures and increase productivity through better prevention and management of chronic diseases,'' he said.
 But Professor Schondelmeyer's analysis -- which found prices for the name-brand drugs most widely used by the Medicare population rising by 9.3 percent in the last year, the fastest rate since 1992 -- is in line with the findings of a leading Wall Street analyst, too. 
 Catherine J. Arnold, a drug industry analyst at Credit Suisse, said her latest study of the nation's eight biggest pharmaceutical companies showed markedly similar results: list prices rising an average of 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 -- the highest rate of growth since at least 2004. 
 As does Professor Schondelmeyer, Ms. Arnold based her price calculations on reported wholesale prices and a formula that puts more emphasis on each company's best-selling drugs.
 Ms. Arnold said the prospect of cost containment under health care reform, as well as the tougher business environment, entered into the decisions of manufacturers to raise prices this year.
 The industry stands to gain about 30 million customers with drug insurance from the legislation pending in Congress. But the industry also faces the prospect of tougher negotiations from both public and private buyers as the government tries to squeeze savings out of the health system. 
 ''If you're going to take price increases,'' Ms. Arnold said, ''here and now might be the place to do that, because the next year and the year after that might be tough.''
 Mr. Johnson did not dispute the Credit Suisse study or deny Ms. Arnold's finding that American drug makers have raised prices at the fastest rate in five years.
 He said both studies were incomplete by failing to include rebates that drug makers give distributors. But Ms. Arnold, Professor Schondelmeyer and a 2007 Congressional study of Medicare said the rebates often accrue to the middlemen, not consumers, and higher manufacturer prices lead to higher retail prices. 
 And the drug industry's own major consulting firm, IMS Health, has also reported a significant run-up in prices. Back in April, IMS predicted that United States drug sales might actually decline this year. 
 Billy Tauzin, president of the industry's trade association, highlighted the gloomy prediction in a June 1 letter to President Obama shortly before striking the deal to cut drug costs by $80 billion. In negotiating the deal, the drug makers argued that they could not afford to give up more than that. 
 But in October, IMS made an unusual change in the middle of its forecasting cycle, saying it now believed United States sales would grow at least 4.5 percent in 2009 -- or $21 billion more than expected six months earlier. 
 A major reason, IMS said, was higher-than-expected price increases for drugs in the United States.

HEADLINE: Liberate Iraq's Economy

BYLINE: By FRANK R. GUNTER. 
Frank R. Gunter, an associate professor of economics at Lehigh University, was the senior civilian economics adviser to the Multinational Corps in Iraq from 2008 to 2009.

DATELINE: Bethlehem, Pa. 

 BODY:
 AFTER returning from the second of two tours in Iraq, I can attest to notable progress. Iraqi civilian casualties have dropped sharply, the result of both the United States surge and negotiations with Sunni groups. There has been political progress as well. Provincial elections were held this year and national elections are scheduled for early 2010.
 The future of the Iraqi economy, however, remains bleak. Without fundamental change, unemployment and the accompanying instability will rise while the widespread corruption will worsen. The political and security gains made at such great cost in Iraqi and American blood and treasure will be imperiled. 
 Iraq not only has a severe shortage of jobs, it also has a growing number of job-seekers. As much as 51 percent of the Iraqi labor force is either unemployed or underemployed; the number is even higher for young workers. For three decades, the Iraqi government has been the primary source of employment. Almost half of the country's labor force is paid by the government from its revenues from petroleum exports. With the exception of agriculture, legitimate private-sector employment is small -- by my calculations, about 6 percent of the labor force. Most of the remainder of the Iraqi labor force is either unemployed or working in the underground economy. 
 In 2008, the sharp rise in oil revenues and improved security led to an economic boom. The government created more than enough new public sector jobs to absorb the approximately 250,000 young people who enter the work force every year. 
 However, this economic surge was short-lived. After oil prices dropped by almost $100 a barrel earlier this year, the government imposed a hiring freeze and unemployment began to rise. 
 Unfortunately, there is nowhere for these job-seekers to go. Iraq's private sector is unable to employ many of the jobless because the country has one of the most hostile business regulatory environments in the world. (Of the 183 countries ranked by the World Bank for the ''ease of doing business,'' Iraq is 153rd.) In Iraq, it is hard to legally start a business, get credit or trade internationally. As a result, most private businesses either hide in the underground economy -- with all of the associated inefficiencies -- or accept the necessity of bribing an unending stream of government officials. 
 This is not sustainable. In 2010, the Iraqi government will hit the wall. A combination of low oil prices, exhausted cash reserves and the expense of paying for a bloated government sector will prevent the creation of public sector jobs. And the private sector, as it continues to struggle with excessive regulation and corruption, is unlikely to create more than a fraction of the needed employment. Rapid growth in the number of unemployed young men will likely follow -- and these young men will be attractive recruits for political insurgents, fundamentalist terrorist groups and criminal gangs. Increased instability is almost certain.
 There is another path. The potential for private sector job growth in Iraq is great. The country is blessed with a strong entrepreneurial tradition, a relatively well-educated labor force and a natural resource more valued in the Middle East than oil: water. Only Iraq and Turkey have sufficient water for large-scale agribusiness, and Iraq is surrounded by wealthy countries that need to import food. But to exploit these advantages, Iraq needs to make important changes. And it should start by rationalizing its commercial code.
 The chief problems in Iraq's commercial code are its incredible complexity, long delays in processing requests for licenses and high cost. For example, registering a new business in Iraq costs almost $2,800 compared to $139 in Delaware. (However, a group of Iraqi businessmen assured me that if $600 in cash was given to the right person, a license would be available immediately and no further fees would be required.) 
 The country could simply throw out its current commercial code and adopt a less restrictive, regionally acceptable one -- like Saudi Arabia's. Or, more realistically, it could make its code more user-friendly by, say, allowing business owners to work with one ministry -- as opposed to a dozen.
 The government could take other steps, too. With the exception of tax collection and international trade regulations, responsibility for regulating private businesses could be taken from the Baghdad ministries and delegated to the country's 18 provinces. Encouraging the provinces to compete for private-sector jobs would lead to friendlier regulatory environments around the country -- just as it has in the United States. 
 But whatever is decided, the government of Iraq is running out of time. It must either end its hostility toward private businesses -- or accept that a sharply growing mass of unemployed will nullify the progress of the last three years.

HEADLINE: The Great Wallop

BYLINE: By NIALL FERGUSON and MORITZ SCHULARICK. 
Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard, is the author of ''The Ascent of Money.'' Moritz Schularick is a professor of economic history at the Free University in Berlin.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago we came up with the term ''Chimerica'' to describe the combination of the Chinese and American economies, which together had become the key driver of the global economy. With a combined 13 percent of the world's land surface and around a quarter of its population, Chimerica nevertheless accounted for a third of global economic output and two-fifths of worldwide growth from 1998 to 2007.
 We called it Chimerica for a reason: we believed this relationship was a chimera -- a monstrous hybrid like the part-lion, part-goat, part-snake of legend. Now we may be witnessing the death throes of the monster. The question President Obama must consider as he flies to Asia this week is whether to slay it or to try to keep it alive. 
 In its heyday, Chimerica consisted largely of the combination of Chinese development, led by exports, and American overconsumption. Thanks to the Chimerican symbiosis, China was able to quadruple its gross domestic product from 2000 to 2008, raise exports by a factor of five, import Western technology and create tens of millions of manufacturing jobs for the rural poor. 
 For America, Chimerica meant being able to consume more and save less even while maintaining low interest rates and a stable rate of investment. Overconsumption meant that from 2000 to 2008 the United States consistently outspent its national income. Goods imported from China accounted for about a third of that overconsumption.
 For a time, Chimerica seemed not a monster but a marriage made in heaven. Global trade boomed and nearly all asset prices surged. Yet, like many another marriage between a saver and a spender, Chimerica was not destined to last. The financial crisis since 2007 has put the marriage on the rocks. Correcting the economic imbalance between the United States and China -- the dissolution of Chimerica -- is now indispensable if equilibrium is to be restored to the world economy.
 China's economic ascent was a result of a strategy of export-led growth that followed the examples of West Germany and Japan after World War II. However, there was a key difference: China made a sustained effort to control the value of its currency, the renminbi, which resulted in a huge accumulation of reserve dollars. 
 As Chinese exports soared, the authorities in Beijing consistently bought dollars to avoid appreciation of their currency, pegging it at around 8.28 renminbi to the dollar from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s. They then allowed a modest 17 percent appreciation in the three years after July 2005, only to restore the dollar peg at 6.83 when the global financial crisis intensified last year.
 Intervening in the currency market served two goals for China: by keeping the renminbi from rising against the dollar, it promoted the competitiveness of Chinese exports; second, it allowed China to build up foreign currency reserves (primarily in dollars) as a cushion against the risks associated with growing financial integration, painfully illustrated by the experience of other countries in the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. The result was that by 2000 China had currency reserves of $165 billion; they now stand at $2.3 trillion, of which at least 70 percent are dollar-denominated. 
 This intervention caused a growing distortion in the global cost of capital, significantly reducing long-term interest rates and helping to inflate the real estate bubble in the United States, with ultimately disastrous consequences. In essence, Chimerica constituted a credit line from the People's Republic to the United States that allowed Americans to save nothing and bet the house on ... well, the house. 
 Nothing like this happened in the 1950s and 1960s. At the height of postwar growth in the 1960s, West Germany and Japan increased their dollar reserves roughly in line with the American gross domestic product, keeping the ratio stable at about 1 percent before letting it move slightly higher in the early 1970s. By contrast, China's reserves soared from the equivalent of 1 percent of America's gross domestic product in 2000 to 5 percent in 2005 and 10 percent in 2008. By the end of this year, that figure is expected to rise to 12 percent. 
 The Chimerican era is drawing to a close. Given the bursting of the debt and housing bubbles, Americans will have to kick their addiction to cheap money and easy credit. The Chinese authorities understand that heavily indebted American consumers cannot be relied on to return as buyers of Chinese goods on the scale of the period up to 2007. And they dislike their exposure to the American currency in the form of dollar-denominated reserve assets of close to $2 trillion. The Chinese authorities are ''long'' the dollar like no foreign power in history, and that makes them very nervous.
 Yet there is a strong temptation for both halves of Chimerica to keep this lopsided partnership going. Despite much talk of the need to reduce global imbalances, the biggest imbalance of all persists. This year, America's trade deficit with China will be around $200 billion, the same as last year. And China has again intervened in the currency markets, buying $300 billion to keep its currency and hence its exports cheap.
 United States policy makers, meanwhile, seem equally willing to prolong America's addiction to cheap money as long as economic recovery seems so fragile, regardless of the effect on the dollar's exchange rate with other currencies. (When American officials insist that they favor a ''strong dollar,'' it's usually a sure sign that they want the opposite.) And why would Americans want to discourage the Chinese from buying yet more dollar-denominated securities? With trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, the Treasury needs all the foreign buyers it can get. 
 The reality, however, is that an end to Chimerica is in the American interest for at least three reasons. First, adjusting the exchange rates between the currencies would help reorient the American economy -- primarily by making American exports more competitive in China, the world's fastest-growing economy. 
 Second, an end to Chimerica would lessen the potentially dangerous reliance of American economic policy on measures to stimulate domestic purchasing. American fiscal policy is clearly on an unsustainable path, and the Federal Reserve's negligible interest rates and the printing of dollars are artificially inflating equity prices. 
 Finally, renminbi revaluation would reduce the risk of potentially serious international friction over trade. The problem is that as the dollar weakens against other world currencies -- notably the euro and the Japanese yen -- so does the renminbi, magnifying China's already large advantage in global export markets. The burden of post-crisis adjustment falls disproportionately outside Chimerica. Unless China's currency is revalued, we can expect an uncoordinated wave of defensive moves by countries on the wrong side of Chimerica's double depreciation. Already we are seeing the danger signs. Last month Brazil imposed a tax on ''hot money'' -- large, volatile flows of foreign investment that may exit an economy as quickly as they appeared -- to try to slow the appreciation of its currency, the real. A number of Asian economies last week intervened to weaken their own currencies relative to the dollar. Similar currency games were a feature of the worst economic decade of the 20th century, the 1930s. 
 Historically, as production costs and income levels in countries have risen, their currencies have adjusted against the dollar accordingly. From 1960 to 1978, for example, the deutsche mark appreciated cumulatively by almost 60 percent against the dollar, while the Japanese yen appreciated by almost 50 percent. The lesson is that exporters can live with substantial exchange rate revaluations so long as they are achieving major gains in productivity, as China still is. 
 To be sure, China's central bank has suggested that it might be willing to switch from the dollar peg to some form of exchange-rate management, taking account of ''international capital flows and movements in major currencies.'' But, like the recent Chinese comments about replacing the dollar as the premier international reserve currency, this may be no more than rhetoric. 
 During his visit to China this week, President Obama must resist the temptation to respond to these overtures with rhetoric of his own. This is not the time for big speeches, but for subtle diplomacy. Right now, Chimerica clearly serves China better than America. Call it the 10:10 deal: the Chinese get 10 percent growth; America gets 10 percent unemployment. The deal is even worse for the rest of the world -- and that includes some of America's biggest export markets and most loyal allies. The question is: What can the United States offer to make the Chinese abandon the dollar peg that has served them so well?
 The authorities in Beijing must be made to see that any book losses on its reserve assets resulting from changes in the exchange rate will be a modest price to pay for the advantages they reaped from the Chimerica model: the transformation from third-world poverty to superpower status in less than 15 years. In any case, these losses would be more than compensated for by the increase in the dollar value of China's huge stock of renminbi assets. 
 It is also in China's interest to kick its currency-intervention habit. A heavily undervalued renminbi is the key financial distortion in the world economy today. If it persists for much longer, China risks losing the very foundation of its economic success: an open global trading regime. 
 And this is exactly what President Obama can offer in return for a substantial currency revaluation of, say, 20 percent to 30 percent over the next 12 months: a clear commitment to globalization and free trade, and an end to the nascent Chinese-American tariff war. 
 For as long as the People's Republic has existed, the United States has been the principal upholder of a world economic order based on the free movement of goods and, more recently, capital. It has also picked up the tab for policing the oil-rich but unstable Middle East. No country has benefited more from these arrangements than China, and it should now pay for them through a stronger Chinese currency. Chimerica was always a chimera -- an economic monster. Revaluing the renminbi will give this monster the peaceful death it deserves.

HEADLINE: Money Starts to Trickle North as Mexicans Help Out Relatives

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Dominique Jarry-Shore from San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico.

DATELINE: MIAHUATLAN, Mexico 

 BODY:
During the best of the times, Miguel Salcedo's son, an illegal immigrant in San Diego, would be sending home hundreds of dollars a month to support his struggling family in Mexico. But at times like these, with the American economy out of whack and his son out of work, Mr. Salcedo finds himself doing what he never imagined he would have to do: wiring pesos north.
 Unemployment has hit migrant communities in the United States so hard that a startling new phenomenon has been detected: instead of receiving remittances from relatives in the richest country on earth, some down-and-out Mexican families are scraping together what they can to support their unemployed loved ones in the United States.
 ''We send something whenever we have a little extra, at least enough so he can eat,'' said Mr. Salcedo, who is from a small village here in the rural state of Oaxaca and works odd jobs to support his wife, his two younger sons and, now, his jobless eldest boy in California. 
 He is not alone. Leonardo Herrera, a rancher from outside Tuxtla Gutierrez in the southern state of Chiapas, said he recently sold a cow to help raise $1,000 to send to his struggling nephew in northern California.
 Also in Chiapas, a poor state that sends many migrants to the United States, Maria del Carmen Montufar has pooled money with her husband and other family members to wire financial assistance to her daughter Candelaria in North Carolina. In the last year, the family has sent money -- small amounts ranging from $40 to $80 -- eight times to help Candelaria and her husband, who are both without steady work and recently had a child.
 ''When she's working she sends money to us,'' the mother said. ''But now, because there's no work, we send money to her.''
 Statistics measuring the extent of what experts are calling reverse remittances are hard to come by. But interviews in Mexico with government officials, money-transfer operators, immigration experts and relatives of out-of-work migrants show that a transaction that was rarely noticed before appears to be on the rise.
 ''It's something that's surprising, a symptom of the economic crisis,'' said Martin Zuvire Lucas, who heads a network of community banks that operate in poor communities in Oaxaca and other underserved Mexican states. ''We haven't been able to measure it but we hear of more cases where money is going north.''
 At one small bank in Chiapas that used to see money flowing in from the United States, more money is going out than coming in. 
 ''I'd say every month 50,000 pesos are sent from here to there,'' said Edith Ramirez Gonzalez, a sales executive at Banco Azteca in San Cristobal de las Casas. ''And from there, we'd receive about 30,000 pesos.'' Fifty thousand pesos is $3,840. 
 With nearly half its population living in poverty, Mexico is not well placed to prop up struggling citizens abroad. Mexico could lose as many as 735,000 jobs this year and its economy may decline 7.5 percent, government economists predict, making the country one of the worst affected by the global recession.
 Still, poverty is a relative concept. It is easier to get by on little in Mexico, especially in rural areas, allowing the poor to help the even more precarious.
 In Miahuatlan, Sirenia Avendano and her husband may be more down and out than their two sons, both in their 20s, who wait tables at a Mexican restaurant in central Florida and have seen their hours reduced and their tips drop precipitously. But they live in their own home, on land they use to grow corn and other crops.
 ''We're poor, but nobody can throw us out of this house,'' Ms. Avendano said, wiping away tears at her kitchen table as she spoke of her sons' economic travails. ''They worry about that. What happens if they can't pay the rent?'' To help make ends meet, she sells chiles rellenos, a popular delicacy, around the neighborhood.
 ''We have an obligation to help them,'' said her husband, Javier. ''They're our sons. It doesn't matter if they are here or there.''
 In other cases, the migrants are returning home, as the many passengers who hop off the bus that runs regularly from northern California to a gas station in Miahuatlan make clear. ''There's nothing up there,'' said a young man with an overflowing suitcase who returned one recent night.
 Still, although a study by the Pew Hispanic Center from July showed a sharp decrease in the number of Mexicans heading north, there has been no sign of a mass exodus of migrants back to Mexico. Immigrants' families say it took great effort to scrape together the thousands of dollars needed to send relatives to the United States, a sum that includes the fees charged by the people who help them sneak in.
 ''It's expensive to cross, and it was a great sacrifice for us,'' said Mr. Salcedo, 43, who has sent about five wire transfers to his son Alfonso, 18, who this year lost his job as a cafeteria dishwasher. 
 As expected during an economic slowdown, the money sent home by immigrants has fallen. The Bank of Mexico reported recently that remittances during the first nine months of this year dropped to $16.4 billion, a 13.4 percent decline compared with the same period in 2008. 
 The flow of money out of Mexico is believed to be a tiny fraction of the remittances still arriving. ''The evidence in this regard so far is anecdotal,'' said Juan Luis Ordaz, senior economist at the Spanish bank BBVA Bancomer, who has begun investigating the reverse money flow.
 Families of migrants speak proudly of their successful relatives in the United States and use the remittances they receive to do anything from buying livestock to replacing dirt floors with concrete. The importance of such money, which is among Mexico's top sources of foreign currency, cannot be overstated. An estimated 5.9 percent of Mexican households, about 1.8 million families, receive economic support from abroad, studies show. For them, the money represents roughly 19 percent of total income for urban households and 27 percent for rural ones, according to government data analyzed by BBVA Bancomer.
 For the Salcedos, the economic woes are intense on both sides of the border. The ones still here had moved to the outskirts of Mexico City seeking opportunity, but now they are on the verge of returning to Oaxaca because the owner of the land they are squatting on ordered them out.
 For Alfonso, the situation has been just as difficult. He crossed into the United States in December with about $500 that his father gave him, supplemented with money he earned doing odd jobs in Tijuana. He found a job in San Diego paying enough for him to send home $170 the first month and $120 the next. The third month, he told his family he could afford to send only $40.
 Then, like so many others, he lost the job and stopped sending anything.
 Now his father has begun sending money the other way, usually about $60, less transfer fees. ''We've decided to tighten our belt until we're all working again,'' Mr. Salcedo said.

HEADLINE: Art Prices (And Mood) Inch Back Up

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Oh the drama of auctions: the salesrooms packed with smartly dressed collectors; the tension of having to decide in seconds whether to drop another million dollars on an artwork or let it go; the steely smile of the auctioneer trying gently to squeeze another hundred thousand from bidders. And the final results of the last two weeks of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions in New York, which saw the return of a surprising number of collectors, their wallets open, but only if the price was right.
 ''The numbers may not be the same as they were two years ago,'' said Guy Bennett, a former co-head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's who is now a private dealer, ''but confidence is back.'' 
 And when it comes to auctions, confidence is everything. As soon as one person in the audience senses hesitancy, others sense it too. But when a collector is sure enough about an artwork to keep bidding, that kind of conviction becomes contagious. 
 The feel-good factor is one thing, the reality quite another. While prices for the best works seemed high and bidding was often deep, the volume of sales -- nearly $600 million between the two companies -- was vastly diminished from a year ago, when Sotheby's and Christie's sold a combined $729 million or two years ago when the market peaked at $1.6 billion. But the relief that prices are crawling back up was palpable. 
 ''A year ago people were distracted and primarily assessing their own net worth,'' said Marc Porter, president of Christie's in the Americas. ''Now that the worst of the financial crisis seems to be over, people are once again focusing on collecting.'' 
 Last fall there was a sense of panic because nobody knew if prices had hit bottom, not just for art but for any asset, and even the richest collectors froze. This season was all about the estimates. ''Ultimately that's what provided buyers with the confidence to bid,'' said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of Sotheby's contemporary art department, who added that for some artists, prices have dropped more than 40 percent from their high two years ago. 
 The deliberately low estimates became catnip for bidders. Or so it seemed when Warhol's 1962 silkscreen painting ''200 One Dollar Bills'' incited a bidding war among five collectors and ultimately sold for a staggering $43.7 million (including Sotheby's fees), more than three times its $12 million high estimate.
 Would what proved to be the star of the last two weeks have made more at the peak of the market? No, said both Mr. Meyer and Mr. Porter. Mr. Meyer pointed out that during the boom, big money went for highly colorful images like a 1976 triptych by Francis Bacon ($86.3 million in May 2008) and a Rothko canvas, the 1950 ''White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose),'' from the collection of the retired banker David Rockefeller ($72.8 million in 2007). 
 ''Because this Warhol is black and white, it could have very well been overlooked at the height of the market,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''Although it is art-historically important, it takes a little knowledge to appreciate.''
 It also took a sophisticated collector to realize that the 1962 image was rare and few like it come up for sale. Or to appreciate the luster of its provenance: it had once belonged to Robert C. Scull, the taxi tycoon who amassed a world-class collection of Pop and Minimalist art. When it was offered for sale at Sotheby's in 1986, the year Mr. Scull died, Pauline Karpidas, a London collector, bought it for $385,000, then a record price for a Warhol at auction. Yet when she decided to sell it 23 years later, the high estimate of $12 million seemed cheap. And that enticed buyers. 
 Another perceived bargain was a Giacometti bronze, ''L'Homme Qui Chavire'' (or ''Falling Man,'' conceived in 1950) at Sotheby's. A similar sculpture brought $18.5 million at Christie's in 2007. The seller of this season's work, S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate who owns Conde Nast, bought it from a London gallery for more than $20 million. He spent a year trying to sell it privately through Gagosian and then Christie's. Its price went from $22 million to $18 million, and Mr. Newhouse ended up consigning it to Sotheby's, where it was estimated at $12 million tops. Six collectors, thinking it seemed cheap, bid it up and the sculpture wound up selling for $17.2 million, or $19.3 million, including Sotheby's fees. 
 At Christie's a group of paintings and drawings that were presents to the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, who died in July, and his partner in life and work, John Cage, who died in 1992, were also priced low despite their celebrated past. Jasper Johns's ''Dancers on a Plane'' (1980-81) brought $4.3 million (including fees), more than $2 million above its high estimate, and a drawing of clocks by Robert Rauschenberg made more than six times its high estimate, selling for $780,000 ($938,500 with fees). 
 ''We had 10 to 15 active bidders on it,'' Mr. Porter said. ''I hadn't seen that since the boom. It may have been lower priced, but nearly $1 million for a drawing is still real money for anybody.''
 With art prices readily available at Artnet.com, collectors can easily do their homework. So if something appears too expensive, it often fails to sell without a bid. That was the case with ''Brother Sausage,'' a six-panel painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat at Christie's that was estimated at $9 million to $12 million.
 Of the two auction giants, Sotheby's came out the winner this season in total sales because it had secured several prized properties and was able to price them conservatively. Its Impressionist and modern art sale featured a group of paintings that had belonged to the fabled Paris dealer Paul Durand-Ruel as well as works from Arthur M. Sackler, a leading collector who died in 1987. 
 But if any one artist dominated the auctions it was Warhol. Besides ''200 One Dollar Bills,'' several of his drawings made strong prices. And a 1965 self-portrait by the artist that was expected to bring a high of $1.5 million at Sotheby's sold for $5.4 million ($6.1 million with fees) to Laurence Graff, the London jeweler. 
 Who bought ''200 One Dollar Bills'' remains a mystery. That element, guessing who is actually paying, is part of the magic of auctions. Officials at Sotheby's and Christie's said there were buyers from Russia and Asia -- parts of the world that were barely represented six months ago -- as well as the United States. 
 But only the auction house knows for sure who took home the $43.7 million Warhol. Some dealers said it might have been Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager who collects contemporary art like Damien Hirst's famous shark, or Philip Niarchos, the contemporary-art collector who is a member of the Greek shipping family. Others said it was a Russian oligarch like Roman Abramovich, who is said to have bought the $86.3 million Bacon triptych. Or maybe even Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian billionaire and contemporary art collector. And if it was Mr. Pinchuk, will ''200 One Dollar Bills'' be on view at his art foundation in Kiev?
 Mr. Meyer's lips were sealed.

HEADLINE: China Is Sending More Students to U.S.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
American universities are enrolling a new wave of Chinese undergraduates, according to the annual Open Doors report. 
 While India was, for the eighth consecutive year, the leading country of origin for international students -- sending 103,260 students, a 9 percent increase over the previous year -- China is rapidly catching up, sending 98,510 last year, a 21 percent increase. 
 ''I think we're going to be seeing 100,000 students from each for years to come, with an increasing share of them being undergraduates,'' said Peggy Blumenthal, executive vice president of the Institute of International Education, which publishes the report with support from the State Department. 
 Over all, the number of international students at colleges and universities in the United States increased by 8 percent to an all-time high of 671,616 in the 2008-9 academic year -- the largest percentage increase in more than 25 years, according to the report. 
 With the current recession, the influx of international students has been especially important to the American economy, according to Allan E. Goodman, president of the institute. 
 ''International education is domestic economic development,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''International students shop at the local Wal-Mart, rent rooms and buy food. Foreign students bring $17.8 billion to this country. A lot of campuses this year are increasing their international recruitment, trying to keep their programs whole by recruiting international students to fill their spaces.'' 
 The number of international students exceeded the past peak enrollment year, 2002-3, by 14.5 percent. In 2008-9, undergraduate enrollment rose 11 percent, compared with only a 2 percent increase in graduate enrollment. 
 In China, that shift has been quite sharp. Last year, China sent 26,275 undergraduates and 57,451 graduate students to the United States -- compared with 8,034 undergraduates and 50,976 graduate students five years earlier. 
 Ms. Blumenthal said the growing share of undergraduates would change the face of the Chinese students' presence in the United States. 
 ''It used to be that they were all in the graduate science departments, but now, with the one-child policy, more and more Chinese parents are taking their considerable wealth and investing it in that one child getting an American college education,'' she said. ''There's a book getting huge play in China right now explaining liberal arts education.'' 
 The book, ''A True Liberal Arts Education,'' by three Chinese undergraduates from Bowdoin College, Franklin & Marshall College and Bucknell University, describes the education available at small liberal arts colleges, and the concept of liberal arts, both relatively unknown in China. 
 Meanwhile, many large public universities are devoting new resources to building up their share of international undergraduates. The State University of New York, for example, recently made Mitch Leventhal the vice chancellor for global affairs. Mr. Leventhal, who at the University of Cincinnati helped build a network of ties abroad, expects to increase undergraduate recruiting, especially in India and China. 
 ''There's growing disposable income in China, and not enough good universities to meet the demand,'' he said. ''And in China, especially, studying in the United States is a great differentiator, because when students get home, they speak English.'' 
 Although the report tracks only the 2008-9 numbers, a smaller survey by the institute last month found that over all, the increase in international students seems to be continuing, with China remaining strong. Of the institutions surveyed this fall, 60 percent reported an increase in Chinese students, and only 11 percent a decline. In contrast, the number of institutions reporting increases in their enrollment of Indian students equaled the number reporting declines. 
 The survey also found continuing growth this year in the number of students from the Middle East, and continuing declines in the numbers from Japan.

HEADLINE: Official End To Recession In Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's economy grew at a robust annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter as stimulus spending and a rebound in exports appeared to bring the country firmly out of its worst recession in the postwar era.
 Gross domestic product grew 1.2 percent in the July-to-September period from the previous three months, or at an annual pace of 4.8 percent, the government said on Monday. It was the second consecutive quarter of growth for Japan and offered more evidence of a widespread recovery from the global economic crisis. 
 Last week, the 16-country euro zone said its economy grew 0.4 percent in the three months to September, the first uptick in six quarters. The G.D.P. in the United States expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the quarter that ended in September, also partly propelled by stimulus programs.
 The reading for Japan, an initial estimate that could yet be revised, beat a 2.9 percent median forecast of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Still, the outlook for Japan's economy remains unclear, with a new government indicating it will slow down stimulus spending just as the recovery starts to gain steam.
 ''We're finally seeing a rebound in domestic demand, and a high rate of growth over all. It's clear that the economy has bottomed out,'' Koichi Haji, chief economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo, said.
 ''But much of the recovery has been thanks to government spending, so we'll most likely see growth slow going forward,'' Mr. Haji said. ''It's too soon to say we're out of the woods.''
 Strong investment by companies helped drive the recovery. Capital spending rose a better-than-expected 1.6 percent in the quarter, the first gain in a year and a half. Exports grew 6.4 percent, helped by stimulus spending by governments around the world, which has led to a recovery in global trade.
 Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, climbed 0.7 percent, propped up by more than 20 trillion yen in stimulus spending by Japan. In particular, government incentives on purchases of energy-efficient appliances and cars have bolstered sales at companies like Toyota Motor and Sony.
 Citing increases in demand, manufacturers like Toyota and Nissan recently upgraded their earnings forecasts for the fiscal year. Still, Japan's exporters remain under pressure from the strong yen, which makes their products less competitive overseas and erodes profits in the home currency.
 The recent expansion goes only so far to make up for ground lost in the global downturn. Though Japan's banks were not at the epicenter of the financial crisis, the country suffered as demand for its exports collapsed, wiping out a full five years of economic growth.
 Industrial production still remains a fifth off last year's levels, and unemployment, at 5.3 percent, is close to a record high. Deflation is back in full force, eroding profits and wages.
 And despite the frailty of Japan's recovery, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has been fiercely critical of further spending on public works. His Democratic Party of Japan, which swept to a landslide victory in August, has blocked 2.9 trillion yen ($32.4 billion) in stimulus measures introduced by the departing government and could hold on to the funds until next year.
 Instead, Mr. Hatoyama says he plans to divert the money toward social welfare spending, like subsidizing child care and lowering tuition fees at schools. His deputy, Naoto Kan, said on Monday that the government could outline an extra budget for this year that focuses on support for workers and the environment.
 But while better safety nets could ease the blow of high unemployment and help raise the birthrate, economists say those measures would take time to carry out and to take effect -- and such a delay could hurt economic recovery in the short term.
 ''As the Democrats move from investment in concrete to investment in people, a smooth transition will be key,'' said Mr. Haji of NLI. ''Any public works money not spent now is a direct loss to the economy. We could see a slight slump before the Democrats' measures kick in.''
 Critics also warn that Mr. Hatoyama's programs could be detrimental to Japan's rising debt, which is approaching twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. Last week, the Fitch Ratings agency warned that it would review its rating on Japan's public debt if the government failed to rein in spending.
 Uncertainty over Japan's economic recovery has weighed on Tokyo's Nikkei index, which has fallen 1.8 percent since the start of July, despite a rebound in corporate profits.

HEADLINE: Citi Sells Stake in Japanese Call Center

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The private equity firm Bain Capital Partners is buying a controlling stake in the leading call center operator in Japan, Bellsystem24, from Citigroup. 
 Citigroup Capital Partners Japan, a private investment unit of Citi, will receive $1 billion for the 93.5 percent stake, Citigroup said Sunday, valuing all of Bellsystem24 at $1.1 billion.
 Citigroup in October completed the sale of its Japanese brokerage business to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking in an $8.7 billion deal.
 The bank, one of the hardest hit during the credit crisis and recession, received $45 billion in loans from the United States government, which now owns a 34 percent stake in Citi. The bank has also received guarantees to protect against losses on more than $300 billion in risky assets.
 As part of its efforts to recover, Citi is selling assets it acquired as it became a financial giant.

HEADLINE: Outlook Grim in South Bend, and Dim for B.C.S.

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

 BODY:
The one theme of this college football season has been its predictability. Just take a peek at next week's feeble slate of games. There are no games between top-25 teams in the Associated Press poll, something virtually unheard of this late in the season. The top three teams in the country -- No. 1 Florida, No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Texas -- play Florida International, Chattanooga and woefully underachieving Kansas. That means three teams that are 30-0 will beat up on three teams that are 14-16. 
 But there are other issues percolating in the sport. 
 NOTRE DAME The Charlie Weis era appears to be fading into the sunset in South Bend. The Irish have lost back-to-back games to Navy and Pittsburgh, falling to 6-4, and they host plucky Connecticut and travel to No. 14 Stanford to complete the season. In his fifth year, Weis has a 35-25 record, in the same neighborhood as his predecessors Bob Davie and Tyrone Willingham. 
 The Irish's new athletic director, Jack Swarbrick, told reporters over the weekend that the six years remaining on Weis's gigantic contract would not influence his job status. There have been multiple and varied reports of just how much a buyout of Weis's contract would be. (The Sporting News reported $18 million on Sunday.) To be safe, just say it is an excessive amount of money, especially in this economy. 
 The top candidate to replace Weis would probably be Cincinnati Coach Brian Kelly. He has won at every level of college football and has the No. 5 Bearcats, with a revamped defense and a revolving door at quarterback, on the cusp of their second consecutive Bowl Championship Series berth. 
 Perhaps more important, he is everything that Weis is not -- charismatic, comfortable shaking hands and a proven winner in the college game. 
 BAD YEAR FOR THE B.C.S. The matchups for the B.C.S. bowl games remain unclear. A projected blockbuster national title game between the Southeastern Conference winner (Florida/Alabama) and Texas is expected, but the rest of the games look unattractive, especially for television. 
 Jerry Palm, an independent B.C.S. analyst and the publisher of collegebcs.com, said that one of the few certainties about the B.C.S games would be low ratings. None of these teams in the hunt for a B.C.S. game are likely to inflate ratings: Texas Christian, Boise State, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Oklahoma State and Georgia Tech. 
 There is a good chance four of those teams will end up in B.C.S. games, and American viewers will probably respond by watching something else. 
 Palm said that seven of the eight lowest-rated games in B.C.S. history involved teams from conferences outside the series or the Big East champion. Though T.C.U. seems assured of a slot, Boise State is emerging as more of a possibility. A lot will depend on No. 12 Oklahoma State, which if it beats Colorado and Oklahoma is probably headed to the Fiesta Bowl, taking away a berth from a higher-ranked team. 
 Either way, a collective yawn awaits. 
 ''When you guarantee teams like T.C.U. a spot in this thing, and I don't care how good they are, people don't want to watch,'' Palm said. ''They want to watch the names that they're familiar with.''
 WEIRD YEAR FOR THE HEISMAN The Heisman Trophy race appears to be coming down to Dec. 5, with the better player in the Florida-Alabama game between the Gators' Tim Tebow and the Crimson Tide's Mark Ingram likely to win it. 
 ''I never seen one this wide open,'' Southern Methodist Coach June Jones said. ''I can't ever remember one this wide open. It's anybody's game right now.''
 This may not be fair to Texas' Colt McCoy, Stanford's Toby Gerhart, Clemson's C. J. Spiller, Boise's Kellen Moore or Houston's Case Keenum. But the reality is that it is hard to have faith in the Heisman's antiquated and flawed selection process, which has nearly 1,000 voters. 
 Familiarity is still key, so Tebow may win as more of a career appreciation than an indicator of him being the sport's most outstanding player this season. 
 FALL OF THE ELITE Along with Notre Dame, two other traditional powers -- Southern California and Michigan -- are in downward spirals. Michigan's is much worse, but even with the inevitable whipping the Wolverines will receive against Ohio State this weekend, it is hard to imagine their replacing Rich Rodriguez after two years. The biggest factor here is with Bill Martin, the lame-duck athletic director. It would seemingly be difficult for Martin to fire Rodriguez and leave his successor as athletic director with a coach he did not hire, along with the financial fallout that would come with paying Rodriguez. 
 As for U.S.C., the Trojans' blowout loss to Stanford shows that there's a new pecking order in the Pacific-10. It will be interesting to see how Coach Pete Carroll deals with his defense's shortcomings after the season. After all, he runs the defense. Will he bring in coaching help? 
 TELEVISION NOWHERE It is a shame that the Mountain West's television package limits its teams' visibility. There appears to be no way to see the ratings from college football's marquee game over the weekend between T.C.U. and Utah because, according to The Dallas Morning News, CBS College Sports does not subscribe to Nielsen, which produces ratings. 
 And in an era when perception is so important, T.C.U.'s reality is that it is nearly invisible to mainstream viewers.

HEADLINE: World Out of Balance

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
International travel by world leaders is mainly about making symbolic gestures. Nobody expects President Obama to come back from China with major new agreements, on economic policy or anything else.
 But let's hope that when the cameras aren't rolling Mr. Obama and his hosts engage in some frank talk about currency policy. For the problem of international trade imbalances is about to get substantially worse. And there's a potentially ugly confrontation looming unless China mends its ways.
 Some background: Most of the world's major currencies ''float'' against one another. That is, their relative values move up or down depending on market forces. That doesn't necessarily mean that governments pursue pure hands-off policies: countries sometimes limit capital outflows when there's a run on their currency (as Iceland did last year) or take steps to discourage hot-money inflows when they fear that speculators love their economies not wisely but too well (which is what Brazil is doing right now). But these days most nations try to keep the value of their currency in line with long-term economic fundamentals. 
 China is the great exception. Despite huge trade surpluses and the desire of many investors to buy into this fast-growing economy -- forces that should have strengthened the renminbi, China's currency -- Chinese authorities have kept that currency persistently weak. They've done this mainly by trading renminbi for dollars, which they have accumulated in vast quantities. 
 And in recent months China has carried out what amounts to a beggar-thy-neighbor devaluation, keeping the yuan-dollar exchange rate fixed even as the dollar has fallen sharply against other major currencies. This has given Chinese exporters a growing competitive advantage over their rivals, especially producers in other developing countries.
 What makes China's currency policy especially problematic is the depressed state of the world economy. Cheap money and fiscal stimulus seem to have averted a second Great Depression. But policy makers haven't been able to generate enough spending, public or private, to make progress against mass unemployment. And China's weak-currency policy exacerbates the problem, in effect siphoning much-needed demand away from the rest of the world into the pockets of artificially competitive Chinese exporters.
 But why do I say that this problem is about to get much worse? Because for the past year the true scale of the China problem has been masked by temporary factors. Looking forward, we can expect to see both China's trade surplus and America's trade deficit surge. 
 That, at any rate, is the argument made in a new paper by Richard Baldwin and Daria Taglioni of the Graduate Institute, Geneva. As they note, trade imbalances, both China's surplus and America's deficit, have recently been much smaller than they were a few years ago. But, they argue, ''these global imbalance improvements are mostly illusory -- the transitory side effect of the greatest trade collapse the world has ever seen.''
 Indeed, the 2008-9 plunge in world trade was one for the record books. What it mainly reflected was the fact that modern trade is dominated by sales of durable manufactured goods -- and in the face of severe financial crisis and its attendant uncertainty, both consumers and corporations postponed purchases of anything that wasn't needed immediately. How did this reduce the U.S. trade deficit? Imports of goods like automobiles collapsed; so did some U.S. exports; but because we came into the crisis importing much more than we exported, the net effect was a smaller trade gap.
 But with the financial crisis abating, this process is going into reverse. Last week's U.S. trade report showed a sharp increase in the trade deficit between August and September. And there will be many more reports along those lines.
 So picture this: month after month of headlines juxtaposing soaring U.S. trade deficits and Chinese trade surpluses with the suffering of unemployed American workers. If I were the Chinese government, I'd be really worried about that prospect. 
 Unfortunately, the Chinese don't seem to get it: rather than face up to the need to change their currency policy, they've taken to lecturing the United States, telling us to raise interest rates and curb fiscal deficits -- that is, to make our unemployment problem even worse. 
 And I'm not sure the Obama administration gets it, either. The administration's statements on Chinese currency policy seem pro forma, lacking any sense of urgency.
 That needs to change. I don't begrudge Mr. Obama the banquets and the photo ops; they're part of his job. But behind the scenes he better be warning the Chinese that they're playing a dangerous game.

HEADLINE: Off the Chart

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Ten months ago, at the beginning of the great stimulus debate, President-elect Barack Obama's economic advisers produced an unfortunate chart. 
 The chart plotted out two lines. One projected the unemployment rate through 2014 with a stimulus package; the other projected unemployment across the same period without it. 
 The first line -- the hopeful line, the one that was used to sell $800 billion worth of stimulus -- showed the rate of joblessness peaking this fall at 8 percent, and dropping swiftly thereafter. The second line -- the no-stimulus scenario -- showed unemployment peaking at 9 percent, holding there across 2010, and then declining in 2011 and 2012. 
 Now reality has produced numbers of its own. In every month since May, the unemployment rate has been roughly a percentage point higher than the chart's grimmer, stimulus-free scenario. This October, when Obama's advisers predicted that unemployment would stand at 8 percent with the stimulus and just under 9 percent without it, the actual jobless rate leaped to 10.4 percent.
 This dire figure isn't Barack Obama's fault. Even in an age of near-trillion-dollar spending sprees, the president of the United States has only limited influence over the unemployment numbers. But the White House spent the winter pretending otherwise. The stimulus bill was framed and sold primarily as a jobs bill, and the Obama administration placed a substantial bet on the promise that the unemployment rate would start dropping before 2010 arrived.
 When the stimulus passed with almost no Republican support, Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, declared that ''the most important number ... is how many jobs it produces, not how many votes it gets.''
 He was right. But with unemployment near a 25-year high, that ''most important number'' isn't looking very good. The White House is stuck arguing counterfactuals -- how much worse the economy would be without the stimulus -- and trumpeting obviously inflated estimates of how many jobs have been ''created or saved'' by federal dollars. 
 If the midterm elections were held today, the Democrats would probably take an unemployment-driven beating. In Gallup's generic Congressional ballot, Republicans are up 22 points among independents, and they've opened up a rare lead among the voting public as a whole. 
 ''Most of the prior Republican registered-voter leads,'' Gallup notes, ''occurred in 1994 and 2002.'' Both were ugly years for liberalism.
 If there's any comfort for Democratic legislators in this landscape, it's the possibility that the angst-ridden health care debate may matter less to their re-election prospects than anyone expects. Amid the town-hall tumult in August, Obamacare looked like 2010's defining issue. But when you talk to Republicans on Capitol Hill today, it sounds as if health care will play a relatively modest role in the campaign they plan to run. 
 If a bill passes, they'll attack the Democrats for reorganizing the nation's health care sector instead of putting Americans back to work. If the legislation fails, they'll attack the Democrats for trying to reorganize the health care sector instead of putting Americans back to work. 
 Either way, though, they expect the jobs issue to matter much, much more than the specific details of health care reform.
 The Democrats seem to be expecting this as well. Obama is planning an ostentatious ''jobs summit'' for December, and a ''jobs bill'' has suddenly materialized on Harry Reid's to-do list. Nobody in the Democratic Party will call it a second stimulus, but the liberals who have complained that the first $800 billion wasn't enough may get the second round of pump-priming they've been asking for.
 They won't get much else, though. It's hard to imagine any legislation that might be attacked as ''job killing'' -- like the Employee Free Choice Act, immigration reform or even cap-and-trade -- finding traction in Congress next year. 
 This means that the broader Democratic agenda is essentially a hostage to the unemployment numbers. And Republicans are hoping that if they win enough seats in 2010, Obama will turn into Bill Clinton redux, pursuing compromises on deficits and entitlement reform in lieu of more liberal legislation. 
 Of course, they haven't won yet. Even without a second stimulus, there's still plenty of money from the first one set to wash into the economy before next year's election (It almost seems as if Nancy Pelosi drew it up that way ...). The Republicans remain broadly unpopular: they're leading the polls more by default than because they inspire any deep affection. And they aren't exactly overflowing with their own ideas for job creation at the moment. 
 If unemployment stays high enough, though, they may not need them. All they'll have to do is tally up the job market's performance since Barack Obama took office, and then draw a third line, in red, on a certain overly optimistic chart.

PERSON: James R. Lilley 

HEADLINE: James R. Lilley, 81; U.S. Envoy to China

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT. 
Reprinted from Sunday's late edition.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
James R. Lilley, a former intelligence agent and ambassador to China who viewed that country with a rare blend of pragmatism and love because of his childhood there, died Thursday at a Washington hospital. He was 81.
 Mr. Lilley, who lived in Washington, died of complications linked to prostate cancer, said his son Jeffrey of Silver Spring, Md. 
 Under his old friend President George H. W. Bush, Mr. Lilley was ambassador in Beijing from 1989 to 1991, a period marked by the brutal suppression of protesters in Tiananmen Square. ''It has been called, and it was, a massacre,'' Mr. Lilley declared in ''China Hands,'' his 2004 memoir, written with his son Jeffrey and published by PublicAffairs. 
 Mr. Lilley was familiar with the students' grievances: only days after arriving in Beijing in 1989, he took to riding his bicycle on the streets to glean firsthand knowledge of what was going on. 
 But while he sympathized with the Chinese students' yearning for more openness and ''an end to cronyism and corruption,'' and appreciated the need for the United States to condemn the bloodshed, he argued against any suggestion that Washington's relationship with China should be cut off or cut back. 
 ''I wanted to make the point that the United States had to stay engaged with China for strategic reasons,'' he wrote of his frequent television appearances after the tanks rolled into the square in June 1989. ''America, I insisted, could contribute in constructive ways to a more open China.'' 
 Mr. Lilley was almost alone in diplomatic circles for the respect he enjoyed among both the Chinese Communist leaders and the Taiwanese. 
 Born in Shandong Province (his father, Frank, was an oil executive, and his mother, Inez, a teacher), James Roderick Lilley grew up attended by a Chinese nanny. 
 He became almost as fluent in Mandarin as in English; he also spoke French.
 As a boy, he played catch with a young Japanese soldier in the occupied China of the 1930s, before the horror of war made such a friendship unthinkable. 
 His family returned to the United States in 1940. He graduated from Yale University and received a master's degree from George Washington University.
 He also attended Hong Kong and Columbia Universities to study classical Chinese. He served in the Army in 1945-46 and later in the Air Force Reserve.
 Mr. Lilley joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1951 ''as a foot soldier in America's efforts to keep Asia from being dominated by Communist China,'' as he wrote in his memoir. 
 In 1975, he was appointed national intelligence officer for China, the senior post in the intelligence community on Chinese affairs. He was the senior East Asian specialist on the National Security Council early in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. 
 In the mid-1980s, he was a consultant on international security affairs for the Defense Department and deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
 Mr. Lilley then served as ambassador to South Korea, through a time of political tumult that led in 1987 to the first genuine presidential election in 16 years.
 Outside government, Mr. Lilley taught Chinese economics at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies and was a consultant for companies doing business in China. 
 Mr. Lilley was well known for dispensing frank advice. A month after Tiananmen, he told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that a decision to send American Navy ships on an official visit to Shanghai in May 1989 had been a bad miscalculation, leaving the impression among Beijing leaders that Washington was ''cozying up'' to their military just as the Tiananmen protests were boiling up.
 Yet the Chinese continued to view him as a friend as well as a diplomat. In May 1991, as he was preparing to return to America, a series of farewell parties in his honor drew crowds. 
 As for his personal feelings about China, ''The country had defined my family's life since 1916, when my father stepped off a boat in Shanghai harbor to work for Standard Oil,'' he reminisced in his memoir.
 Surviving are his wife, Sally; two other sons, Douglas, of Washington, and Michael, of Rumson, N.J.; a sister, Elinore Washburn, of Andover, Mass.; and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: President Obama in China

 BODY:
Economy, Security and, Yes, Human Rights
 Ever since Richard Nixon opened the door in 1972, all presidents have faced a balancing act with China. For President Obama, who arrived in China on Sunday, the challenge is even tougher and more urgent. He needs Beijing's help on a host of hugely important and extremely difficult problems, including stabilizing the global financial system, curbing global warming, prying away North Korea's nuclear weapons, and ensuring that Iran doesn't get to build any. 
 To do that he needs to encourage China to play an even stronger international role -- but also curb some of its darker instincts, including its mistreatment of its own citizens, its less than savory relationships with countries like Sudan and its tendency to bully its neighbors. 
 Mr. Obama has already acknowledged China's growing clout (and that of other fast-growing economies), when he made the G-20 instead of the G-8 the main forum for global economic issues. We hope that will pay off in more responsible behavior from Beijing.
 Still in the search for common ground, Mr. Obama has his work cut out for him. While the two countries have enacted huge stimulus packages, profound tensions remain over China's exchange-rate policy. 
 On the security side, China joined America and other major powers in imposing tougher nuclear-related sanctions on North Korea. But it is still Pyongyang's main economic benefactor and has shown a willingness to exploit loopholes in the sanctions. Beijing also evinces concern about Iran's nuclear program. But it seems more concerned about its own voracious energy needs, and Iran's ability to satisfy them. Mr. Obama will have to work harder to persuade China of the dangers out there, and of the need for tough United Nations sanctions to curb the nuclear appetites of Tehran and Pyongyang. 
 China has long and close ties with Pakistan. We hope Mr. Obama will urge China's president, Hu Jintao, to provide more economic assistance for Islamabad and press its leaders to keep fighting the Taliban insurgency. While China-Taiwan relations are improving, Mr. Obama should still press Beijing to remove hundreds of missiles it has aimed at the island.
 Some activists worry that the Obama administration has been too muted in its criticism of China's abysmal human rights. Mr. Obama postponed a meeting with the Dalai Lama until after this summit meeting. But trying a less confrontational approach, for a while, isn't unreasonable. 
 China's success as a modern superpower is not guaranteed. Job shortages and worker malcontent pose a huge challenge, as do separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. 
 Mr. Obama needs to find a way to subtly remind his hosts of those vulnerabilities -- and the fact that they are better dealt with through more political openness rather than more repression. A China that respected its own people and its neighbors would be more stable, economically stronger, have more international influence and be a much better American partner.
 From Beijing to Copenhagen
 What everyone has suspected for weeks has now been made more or less official by President Obama and other world leaders: no new legally binding climate treaty will emerge at discussions in Copenhagen next month. The continuing differences between industrialized and developing nations over who should bear the burden of stopping global warming mean that at best Copenhagen will be a steppingstone. This does not make the talks between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China any less important. Even an interim agreement will be impossible without enthusiastic participation by both countries, which together account for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
 Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, has sketched the outlines of a fallback position that would have all countries commit to achievable, transparent domestic targets while negotiations on a broader treaty continued. This is an honorable proposition that Mr. Obama can easily accept, but getting Mr. Hu to sign on -- and bring other developing countries with him -- may take some doing. 
 For years, Washington and Beijing have dodged their own responsibilities by making unreasonable demands of each other. China has insisted that the United States reduce emissions by 40 percent over 10 years, which is politically and technologically unrealistic. Many American lawmakers insist that China commit to binding emission caps now, but China -- which regards all caps with suspicion -- sees this as infringing on its freedom to manage its own economy.
 At the same time, both nations are mindful of the potentially disastrous consequences of unchecked climate change, and both have taken steps to tame their emissions -- steps that could build a foundation for a more positive relationship. China has adopted tough fuel economy standards and strict efficiency codes for new buildings. Eager to win the global race for green jobs, it has stepped up investment in solar panels, wind turbines, rapid transit and hybrid electric cars. And while coal still provides 70 percent of its power, it is building fewer coal-fired plants and those it is building are cleaner.
 For his part, Mr. Obama has embraced the climate challenge in a way his predecessor did not. He has approved new greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, proposed regulatory controls on power plant emissions and included $80 billion in his stimulus package for greater energy efficiency and cleaner technologies. Congress is halfway toward producing a bill to cap emissions. 
 The prospects for collaboration on clean energy are promising. An American company will soon build a solar-powered electric utility in China, and China has agreed to help build a wind farm in Texas. But the most important single thing the two countries can do is join in moving a new climate agreement forward.

HEADLINE: Senate's Counting And Recounting Add Up to Delay

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, hopes to finalize the Senate version of major health care legislation this week. 
 But don't count the days. Mr. Reid and his aides have been saying the same thing for a month, ever since the Senate Finance Committee approved its bill on Oct. 13. 
 Mr. Reid is tied up in the numbers: the 10-year cost to taxpayers and the impact on future health spending; the number of people who will gain health coverage versus the number who will be left uninsured; the price of premiums for a new public insurance plan; and the effect on premiums for the 160 million Americans who already have insurance. 
 Finally, there is the most crucial number of all: the members of the Democratic caucus who will vote in favor of a motion to bring the bill up for debate. (Mr. Reid needs the unanimous support of those 60 members.) 
 That last number will depend heavily on all the other numbers. And all the other numbers depend entirely on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the official bean counters who have worked night and day for months on the many incarnations of the health care legislation in the Senate and in the House. 
 The Congressional Budget Office is so essential to the process and its time and attention are so precious that after the House approved its health care bill on Nov. 7, Mr. Reid's elation was only partly about Democrats having advanced landmark legislation. 
 ''Now that they are done with the House bill,'' he told a reporter, ''C.B.O. can focus on us.''
 The process is complicated. About 11 p.m. last Tuesday, the budget office sent Mr. Reid 11 pages of questions about his legislation. On Wednesday afternoon Mr. Reid's staff met with budget office officials. And the back-and-forth continues. 
 But Mr. Reid has already received some substantial analysis of his measure, and if the numbers had been what he wanted, he would have released a bill by now. 
 Instead, he has repeatedly gone back to the budget office with variations of the legislation, trying to figure out how to limit the overall cost of the bill while increasing the number of people who would gain health coverage. 
 Mr. Reid has put forward a proposal to increase the Medicare payroll tax on wealthy taxpayers, in part to help reduce a proposed tax on high-price health insurance plans, which is opposed by organized labor interests. 
 But the tax on high-price insurance plans is one of the few proposals still included in the legislation that the Congressional Budget Office has said would help slow the growth of the nation's health care costs. So Mr. Reid must choose between following the recommendation of experts on health economics and angering a crucial Democratic constituency. 
 Should there be any doubt about the importance of the cost calculations, consider the recent comments of some Democratic senators who are considered crucial centrist votes. 
 ''The message at times has gotten garbled, where it has been more about extending coverage to individuals than it has been about bending the cost curve,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. ''I think we need to control costs.'' 
 The budget office is also working on a request by Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana for an analysis of the legislation's potential effect on premium costs for people who already have coverage -- a deeply complex calculation. 
 In the meantime, frustration has been growing among some lawmakers over the delay, especially as they are asked repeated questions about a bill they have not yet seen. 
 ''I don't think the bill text is being shown to anybody,'' Mr. Nelson said last week. 
 At the same time, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, is mounting his own numbers-driven attack. 
 Mr. McConnell criticized the bill's size -- 2,000 pages -- and said it should be debated on the Senate floor for as long as Mr. Reid has been working to finish it. 
 ''This is a bill that cuts Medicare, raises taxes and raises insurance premiums,'' Mr. McConnell said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We know it has been in Harry Reid's office for six weeks and the other 99 senators have not seen it.'' 
 Of course, it has been only four weeks since the Finance Committee approved its bill. But who's counting?

HEADLINE: A Surefire Florida Republican Becomes a Right-Wing Target

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: NEWBERRY, Fla. 

 BODY:
In retrospect, even Charlie Crist admits that ''the optics'' of The Hug are not great.
 It was in the glow of a new day in politics last February when Mr. Crist, this state's popular Republican governor, took the stage with President Obama and declared that Republicans and Democrats had to rise above partisanship in support of an economic stimulus. And Mr. Obama embraced him.
 Now, as a season of tea parties and fractious town hall meetings has energized the right wing, that embrace has endangered what once seemed like Mr. Crist's surefire bid for a Senate seat and put Florida at the center of a debate about the future of the Republican Party.
 Republican pragmatists argue that to take back its majority, the party has to appeal to a broader range of voters, even if it means running candidates who might stray from the party orthodoxy. 
 Conservatives counter that Republicans have become Democrats' enablers in bigger deficits and bigger government, and that the way to win is to sharpen the distinctions between the parties. 
 A raft of conservative groups, commentators and politicians are supporting a primary challenge to Mr. Crist by Marco Rubio, a telegenic former speaker of the Florida House christened a Reaganite's answer to Mr. Obama by The National Review. 
 Mr. Crist, who has been endorsed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is seen by these conservatives as too moderate -- even liberal -- in his judicial appointments and his support of policies like cap and trade for emissions that contribute to global warming and restoring voting rights to ex-felons.
 ''Florida is a hill to die on for conservatives,'' said Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative blog RedState.com, which leads a daily drumbeat against Mr. Crist. ''This is the clearest example we have of these two competing concepts.''
 Similar fights are playing out in primary races in other states. In a California Senate primary that promises to be just as intense as this one, conservatives are championing Chuck DeVore, a state assemblyman, over Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard whose candidacy has the support of prominent Republican senators and the party's 2008 presidential nominee, John McCain.
 ''Some of the Republicans who've been around a long time, they're the big spenders, they're the big government people,'' said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who as chairman of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee, has become a kingmaker for conservative challengers, and has endorsed Mr. Rubio. 
 ''What's going to happen, the voters are going to weed out these Republicans who no longer share the core principles that make our country great,'' Mr. DeMint said.
 It may be a principled debate, but it is not shaping up as a polite one.
 As Mr. Crist was introduced at the Ronald Reagan Black Tie and Blue Jeans Barbeque at an open-air rodeo in this Central Florida town this month, hecklers with Rubio bumper stickers on their backs called out, ''Go Hug Obama!''
 People posting on FreeRepublic.com mock Mr. Crist as Charlie Loafers. ''Charlie Crist Delenda Est,'' declared a RedState headline: ''Charlie Crist must be destroyed.''
 Conservative and moderate Republicans take very different lessons from this month's special Congressional election in upstate New York, in which a third-party conservative challenged the moderate Republican candidate. In the end, a Democrat won the seat in the historically Republican district after the Republican dropped out under pressure from the right and then endorsed the Democrat.
 Republicans took it as evidence that candidates from the far right cannot win. But conservatives say their candidate would have prevailed if the establishment had been smart enough to put its money behind him, rather than a Republican they argue was a Democrat in thin disguise. 
 Before polls closed on Election Day, Mr. Erickson and Mr. DeMint convened a conference call to identify the next conservative battlegrounds, urging thousands of followers to direct the energy and money they had spent in the New York race toward a Rubio victory. The Club for Growth is now backing Mr. Rubio, and produced an anti-Crist ad featuring the hug. 
 Endorsements from conservative leaders like Mike Huckabee and Dick Armey and glowing coverage from George F. Will and National Review have made Mr. Rubio, 38, the sudden standard bearer for a more conservative Republican Party. In the past few months, he has begun pulling closer to Mr. Crist in polls and fund-raising, collecting nearly $1 million in the last cycle.
 Mr. Crist, endlessly tanned, endlessly sunny, is known as a gifted campaigner with savvy for symbolism. 
 Hoping to emphasize his record as tough on crime when he ran for governor, he had the host of ''America's Most Wanted'' deliver his papers to elections officials. He came into office promising to cut property taxes, and promoting consensus on issues like the environment and stem cell research. And if they sometimes say he is trying too hard to please everyone, voters, Democrat as well as Republican, have rewarded him with high ratings.
 The National Republican Senatorial Committee backed Mr. Crist as soon as he announced he was running in May, thinking it would save trouble. He is as avid a fund-raiser as he is a campaigner, and helped deliver the state, and effectively the Republican presidential nomination, to Mr. McCain -- so the party could save money in Florida to spend elsewhere.
 ''I think pragmatism is not a bad thing,'' said the committee's chairman, Senator John Cornyn of Texas. 
 But, hounded by conservative bloggers, Mr. Cornyn announced this month that he did not plan to spend any money in the primary. The committee does not usually spend in primaries; the need for such a statement spoke to the heat of the race, 10 months before primary day.
 Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles and a protege of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, is known as an eloquent speaker and is quick with a quip. (''Charlie Crist supported the stimulus, and I've got the pictures to prove it.'') 
 He argues for small government and reduced spending, but mostly, he talks about the need to stop what he calls the Obama agenda. ''The bottom line is that if you're a Republican, the Republican Party should be an alternative, not a facsimile,'' he said in an interview. ''And I think I offer that.''
 He has been trouncing Mr. Crist in party straw polls across Florida. In Palm Beach County, the party held off a censure of Mr. Crist with a 65-65 tie. Sid Dinerstein, the party chairman there, said most of those voting against censure had done so only because they thought it should be used to condemn moral failings, not political ones.
 In an interview, Mr. Crist, 53, called himself a ''pragmatic Reaganite conservative.'' He is against abortion and same-sex marriage, and supports gun rights and the death penalty. 
 He sees how the hug could make him seem too cozy with Democrats. ''I understand the optics,'' he said. ''I also know where the polls are, still.''
 A Quinnipiac University poll late last month showed Mr. Crist beating Mr. Rubio, 50 percent to 35 percent, and the presumed Democratic candidate, Representative Kendrick B. Meek, 51 to 31 percent. The poll also showed Mr. Meek beating Mr. Rubio, 36 to 33 percent.
 But Mr. Crist's lead over Mr. Rubio had shrunk to 15 points from 29 points in August. And Rubio supporters point to an Rasmussen Reports poll in October that showed him doing better than Mr. Crist in a Meek matchup.
 In part, Mr. Crist's troubles are local: the Obama embrace reinforced a sense that the governor shifts with the political winds.
 ''He hugged Obama when it was convenient, and now he's trying to distance himself,'' said Johanne Artman, 68. ''I don't trust him.''
 Ms. Artman was corralling people to collect Rubio literature at the Reagan barbeque. ''I've never been so excited about anyone as I am about Marco Rubio,'' she said. ''Everything as a conservative I believe in, he stands for.''
 But the complaints about the hug also reflect anger about the stimulus -- as Roger Pennington, a 56-year-old pharmacist, called it, ''bad money after bad.''
 That anger has fueled the broader anti-establishment furor expressed in the tea parties -- directed as much at Republicans as Democrats, and especially at those like Mr. Crist who can be associated with Mr. Obama.
 ''He'll never be able to get over that photo,'' Mr. Pennington said, declining the opportunity to shake hands with Mr. Crist and his new wife, Carole, as they campaigned at the barbeque. 
 Mr. Crist does not apologize for appearing on stage with Mr. Obama, saying it was the polite thing to do when a president visits your state for the first time. ''He's the president of the United States,'' he said. ''I campaigned for the other guy. The bona fides on where I was are very clear.''
 His supporters argue that the voices that are loudest now are not the voice of the majority.
 ''The majority of our country is not on either end of the spectrum, but somewhere in the middle,'' said Jason Rosenberg, 41, a plastic surgeon in Gainesville. 
 ''I think the governor has crossed party lines well,'' he said. And, he said, ''I want someone who's going to win.''

HEADLINE: President Obama in China: From Beijing to Copenhagen

 BODY:
What everyone has suspected for weeks has now been made more or less official by President Obama and other world leaders: no new legally binding climate treaty will emerge at discussions in Copenhagen next month. The continuing differences between industrialized and developing nations over who should bear the burden of stopping global warming mean that at best Copenhagen will be a steppingstone. This does not make the talks between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China any less important. Even an interim agreement will be impossible without enthusiastic participation by both countries, which together account for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, has sketched the outlines of a fallback position that would have all countries commit to achievable, transparent domestic targets while negotiations on a broader treaty continued. This is an honorable proposition that Mr. Obama can easily accept, but getting Mr. Hu to sign on -- and bring other developing countries with him -- may take some doing.
 For years, Washington and Beijing have dodged their own responsibilities by making unreasonable demands of each other. China has insisted that the United States reduce emissions by 40 percent over 10 years, which is politically and technologically unrealistic. Many American lawmakers insist that China commit to binding emission caps now, but China -- which regards all caps with suspicion -- sees this as infringing on its freedom to manage its own economy.
 At the same time, both nations are mindful of the potentially disastrous consequences of unchecked climate change, and both have taken steps to tame their emissions -- steps that could build a foundation for a more positive relationship. China has adopted tough fuel economy standards and strict efficiency codes for new buildings. Eager to win the global race for green jobs, it has stepped up investment in solar panels, wind turbines, rapid transit and hybrid electric cars. And while coal still provides 70 percent of its power, it is building fewer coal-fired plants and those it is building are cleaner.
 For his part, Mr. Obama has embraced the climate challenge in a way his predecessor did not. He has approved new greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, proposed regulatory controls on power plant emissions and included $80 billion in his stimulus package for greater energy efficiency and cleaner technologies. Congress is halfway toward producing a bill to cap emissions. 
 The prospects for collaboration on clean energy are promising. An American company will soon build a solar-powered electric utility in China, and China has agreed to help build a wind farm in Texas. But the most important single thing the two countries can do is join in moving a new climate agreement forward.

HEADLINE: Illinois Site May Be Path To Closing Cuba Prison

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE; Susan Saulny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Top Illinois Democrats on Sunday wholeheartedly embraced the idea of sending terrorism suspects from Guantanamo Bay to a maximum-security prison about 150 miles west of Chicago, raising the possibility of a major breakthrough in the Obama administration's efforts to close the military detention facility in Cuba.
 But while Gov. Patrick J. Quinn and Senator Richard J. Durbin endorsed housing the detainees at the Thomson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in a rural area, other local leaders were drumming up opposition to the idea, which could still face considerable opposition in Congress.
 For the White House, which confirmed the administration's interest, it could be the best chance so far to cut through the legal and political knots that have stopped it from closing down the prison camp in Cuba. For supporters in Illinois, it is an attractive economic opportunity. And just as opponents have done elsewhere, some in Illinois cast this plan as an unacceptable risk. 
 Mr. Quinn and Mr. Durbin, in news conferences to promote the plan, said that turning over the state prison, which is unoccupied, to the federal penal system, and using it for maximum-security inmates including as many as 100 captives from the campaign against terrorism, would create several thousand jobs. 
 But leading Republicans in the state -- including Representatives Donald Manzullo, whose district includes Thomson, and Mark Steven Kirk, who is running for the United States Senate seat once held by Mr. Obama -- signed a letter to the president on Sunday strongly opposing any such move.
 ''As home to America's tallest building, we should not invite Al Qaeda to make Illinois its No. 1 target,'' the letter said, referring to the Willis Tower in Chicago, formerly the Sears Tower. ''The United States spent more than $50 million to build the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to keep terrorists away from U.S. soil. Al Qaeda terrorists should stay where they cannot endanger American citizens.''
 The sharp local debate echoed vehement arguments heard all weekend, after the administration announced that it would try the man accused as the operational leader of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and several co-conspirators, in a federal court in New York, while putting others accused of terrorism before military commissions for an attack on the U.S.S. Cole. That, too, was presented as a step along the path to closing Guantanamo.
 News of the possible deal in Illinois was first reported over the weekend by The Chicago Tribune. On Sunday, a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because no decision had been made, said that Thomson had emerged as ''a leading option'' for becoming the new facility the administration needs, and confirmed that government officials would tour the prison site on Monday.
 Days after his inauguration, Mr. Obama declared that within a year he would close the Guantanamo prison, a signature component of the Bush administration's counterterrorism policy. In a speech at the National Archives in May, Mr. Obama proposed bringing those detainees deemed too dangerous to release to a facility inside the United States -- including some who could not be tried for lack of evidence but were called committed Al Qaeda terrorists and might be held as ''combatants.''
 Lawmakers of both parties have expressed deep unease all along. Congress enacted a law this year forbidding the administration from bringing Guantanamo detainees into the United States except for the purpose of prosecution. But leading Democratic lawmakers said at the time that they were open to rescinding the restriction once the administration came up with a plan for how to handle the detainees.
 As a home-state ally of Mr. Obama, Mr. Quinn provided the kind of enthusiasm no other governor has offered. He called the proposal ''good for our state, good for economy and good for our public safety.'' By some estimates, it would provide 3,200 jobs and cut the local unemployment rate in half.
 But the governor acknowledged the hurdles ahead, saying, ''This is not a done deal.'' The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday that the detainees should not be moved to prisons on United States soil from the base in Cuba, which is also known as Gitmo. 
 ''What problem is the president going to solve by moving these trials to New York or by moving Gitmo prisoners to Michigan, to Illinois, to Colorado?'' Mr. Hoekstra said. ''Why move them into the United States while we are still under the threat from radical jihadists?''
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said in three appearances on television talk shows that by treating these prisoners in the civilian system, the administration was mishandling the fight against terrorism.
 ''It would seem to me what the Obama administration is telling us loud and clear is that both in substance and reality, the war on terror, from their point of view, is over,'' Mr. Giuliani said on Fox News Sunday. ''We're no longer going to treat these people as if this was an act of war.'' 
 For months, an interagency administration task force has been examining ways to handle the Guantanamo population, including looking at state and federal prisons around the country that might be used. Thomson, a maximum-security state prison that was built in 2001 at a cost to Illinois taxpayers of about $120 million, only to sit almost unused, is one of them.
 Its chances got a lift last month when the president of the Village of Thomson, Jerry Hebeler, contacted Mr. Quinn's office to suggest a federal takeover of the prison, according to a letter Mr. Quinn sent to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. last week. Mr. Quinn agreed and personally raised the issue in a meeting with Mr. Obama two weeks ago.
 The Thomson prison is contained by a 146-acre reservation near the Mississippi River and has eight 200-cell compartments designed for strict control of inmates. It is surrounded by an electrified fence capable of carrying 7,000 volts, has 312 surveillance cameras with motion detection capability, and armed inner and outer perimeter towers.
 If a decision is made to proceed, the official said, the Federal Bureau of Prisons would buy the prison from Illinois and convert it into a maximum-security federal penitentiary. The bureau would house ordinary federal inmates in part of the facility and lease another part to the Defense Department to hold former Guantanamo detainees. The two populations would not have contact, the official said. 
 The federal government would also retrofit the facility to take it beyond the security specifications of the federal ''Supermax'' facility in Florence, Colo., from which no prisoner has ever escaped, including by adding extra external perimeter fencing, the official said. It would be operated with the most restrictive security conditions, ''including individual confinement and isolation capabilities,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: Memoir as Payback: Palin Vents About the McCain Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
GOING ROGUE
 An American Life
 By Sarah Palin
 413 pp. HarperCollins. $28.99
 ''Going Rogue,'' the title of Sarah Palin's erratic new memoir, comes from a phrase used by a disgruntled McCain aide to describe her going off-message during the presidential campaign: among other things, for breaking with the campaign over its media strategy and its decision to pull out of Michigan, and for speaking out about reports that the Republican Party had spent more than $150,000 on fancy designer duds for her and her family. 
 The most sustained and vehement barbs in this book are directed not at Democrats or liberals or the news media, but at the McCain campaign. The very campaign that plucked her out of Alaska, anointed her the Republican vice-presidential nominee and made her one of the most talked about women on the planet -- someone who could command a reported $5 million advance for writing this book. 
 In what reads like payback for disparaging comments by John McCain's aides about her after the ticket's loss to Barack Obama, Ms. Palin depicts the McCain campaign as overscripted, defeatist, disorganized and dunderheaded -- slow to shift focus from the Iraq war to the cratering economy, insufficiently tough on Mr. Obama and contradictory in its media strategy. She also claims that the campaign billed her nearly $50,000 for ''having been vetted.'' The vetting, which was widely criticized in the press as being cursory and rushed, was, she insisted, ''thorough'': they knew ''exactly what they're getting.'' 
 Although Ms. Palin writes that she is ''proud of the senator'' for being bold enough to put her on the ticket, some of her loudest complaints in this volume are directed at the McCain campaign's chief strategist, Steve Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt, ironically enough, was one of the aides to most forcefully make the case for putting her on the ticket in the first place, arguing to Mr. McCain, as Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson reported in their recent book, ''The Battle for America 2008,'' that she would shake up the race and help him get his ''reform mojo back.'' Over the weekend McCain aides fired back at Ms. Palin: Mr. Schmidt was quoted on Politico.com saying that charges about him were ''all fiction.'' 
 Back in 2008 Robert Draper reported in The New York Times Magazine that neither Mr. Schmidt nor Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, apparently saw Ms. Palin's ''lack of familiarity with major national or international issues as a serious liability,'' and that Mr. McCain, a former Navy pilot, saw the idea of upending the chessboard as a maverick move.
 All in all Ms. Palin emerges from ''Going Rogue'' as an eager player in the blame game, ungrateful to the McCain campaign for putting her on the national stage. As for the McCain campaign, it often feels like a desperate and cynical operation, willing to make a risky Hail Mary pass to try to score a tactical win, instead of making a considered judgment as to who might be genuinely qualified to sit a heartbeat away from the Oval Office.
 In ''Going Rogue'' Ms. Palin talks perfunctorily about fiscal responsibility and a muscular foreign policy, and more passionately about the importance of energy independence, but she is quite up front about the fact that much of her appeal lies in her just-folks ''hockey mom'' ordinariness. She pretends no particular familiarity with the Middle East, the Iraq war or Islamic politics -- ''I knew the history of the conflict,'' she writes, ''to the extent that most Americans did.'' And she argues that ''there's no better training ground for politics than motherhood.'' 
 A CNN poll taken last month indicates that 7 out of 10 Americans now think Ms. Palin is not qualified to be president, and even as ardent a conservative as Charles Krauthammer lamented in September 2008 ''the paucity of any Palin record or expressed conviction on the major issues of our time.'' 
 Yet Mr. McCain's astonishing decision to pick someone with so little experience (less than two years as the governor of Alaska, and before that, two terms as mayor of Wasilla, an Alaskan town with fewer than 7,000 residents) as his running mate underscores just how alarmingly expertise is discounted -- or equated with elitism -- in our increasingly democratized era, and just how thoroughly colorful personal narratives overshadow policy arguments and actual knowledge. Ms. Palin herself had a surprisingly nonchalant reaction to Mr. McCain's initial phone call about the vice president's slot, writing that she was not astonished, that it felt ''like a natural progression.'' 
 Ms. Palin suggests that she and her husband, Todd, are ideally qualified to represent the Joe Six-Packs of the world because they are Joe Six-Packs themselves. ''We know what it's like to be on a tight budget and wonder how we're going to pay for our own health care, let alone college tuition,'' she writes in ''Going Rogue.'' ''We know what it's like to work union jobs, to be blue-collar, white-collar, to have our kids in public schools. We felt our very normalcy, our status as ordinary Americans, could be a much-needed fresh breeze blowing into Washington, D.C.'' 
 ''Going Rogue'' (written with an assist from Lynn Vincent, the features editor of World, an evangelical magazine) is part cagey spin, part earnest autobiography, part payback hit job. And its most compelling sections deal not with politics but with Ms. Palin's life in Alaska and her family. Despite an annoying tendency to drop the names of lots of writers and philosophers gratuitously -- in the course of this book she quotes or alludes to Pascal, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Paine, Pearl S. Buck, Mark Twain and Melville -- she does a lively job of conveying the frontier feel of the 49th state, where television broadcasts were tape-delayed in her youth and they shopped for clothes ''via mail order through the Sears catalog,'' where ''we don't have big-league professional sports teams or many celebrities (except famous dog mushers),'' and so regard politics as a local sport.
 The self-portrait created in these pages recalls the early profiles of Ms. Palin that appeared just after her debut on the national stage: a self-reliant frontierswoman who knows how to field dress a moose; a feisty gal with lots of moxie and pep; a former beauty queen with a George W. Bush-like aptitude for mangling the English language. (The first paragraph of the book contains the phrase ''I breathed in an autumn bouquet that combined everything small-town America with rugged splashes of the Last Frontier.'') She talks about juggling motherhood with politics, and gives a moving account of learning that her son Trig would be born with Down syndrome.
 She recalls her initial feeling -- ''I don't think I could handle that'' -- and her ''sudden understanding of why people would grasp at a quick 'solution,' a way to make the 'problem' just go away,'' though her own pro-life stance would deny women the choice of having an abortion. 
 Elsewhere in this volume she talks about creationism, saying she ''didn't believe in the theory that human beings -- thinking, loving beings -- originated from fish that sprouted legs and crawled out of the sea'' or from ''monkeys who eventually swung down from the trees.'' In everything that happens to her, from meeting Todd to her selection by Mr. McCain for the Republican ticket, she sees the hand of God: ''My life is in His hands. I encourage readers to do what I did many years ago, invite Him in to take over.'' 
 Just as Ms. Palin's planned book tour resembles a campaign rollout -- complete with a bus tour and pit stops in battleground states -- so the second half of this book often reads like a calculated attempt to position Ms. Palin for 2012. She tries to compare herself to Ronald Reagan by repeatedly invoking his name and record. She talks about being ''a Commonsense Conservative'' and worrying about the national deficit. And she attempts to explain, rationalize or refute controversial incidents and allegations that emerged during the 2008 race. 
 She says she ''never sought to ban any books'' as mayor of Wasilla, and has always had a ''special passion for reading.'' She suggests that the $150,000-plus designer clothes were the campaign's idea, that she and her family are actually frugal coupon clippers who shop at Costco. And she says that she was manipulated into doing that famous series of Katie Couric interviews (which would do much to cement an image of her as an easily caricatured ignoramus) by Nicolle Wallace, a communications aide for the campaign, and that Ms. Couric just seemed to want ''to frame a 'gotcha' moment.'' 
 Along the way Ms. Palin acknowledges that she is a busy, ''got to go-go-go'' sort of person -- and for an average hockey mom, pretty ambitious.
 ''As every Iditarod musher knows,'' she writes of the well-known Alaska dog-sled race, ''if you're not the lead dog, the view never changes.''

HEADLINE: In China, Obama to Press For Tough Stance on Iran

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and DAVID BARBOZA; Brian Knowlton contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
President Obama, fresh from making progress in his efforts to get Russia on board for possible tough new sanctions against Iran, arrived in China on Sunday, where he will attempt the even more difficult task of prodding China's leaders to get tough on Iran.
 Making his first trip to China, Mr. Obama landed in Shanghai during a late-night downpour and was set to begin three days of meetings to discuss climate change, North Korea and the global economic crisis with President Hu Jintao. 
 The economic negotiating began even before Mr. Obama touched down. China's top banking regulator, Liu Mingkang, sharply criticized United States policy on Sunday, saying the weakening dollar and low interest rates were contributing to global speculation in stocks and real estate, endangering the global recovery and inflating asset prices, The Associated Press reported. 
 China holds more than $2.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, much of it in dollars, and has increasingly expressed concern that the value of its investments is deteriorating. 
 But for Mr. Obama, one of the top priorities here will be to try to get Mr. Hu close to the spot where Russia, the other permanent member of the United Nations Security Council reluctant to impose sanctions on Iran, appears to have arrived.
 After an hourlong meeting in Singapore on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Obama managed to get President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia to express dissatisfaction with Iran's response to a nuclear offer made by world powers, raising the prospect that sanctions may be the next step in the West's continuing effort to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
 The leaders, meeting on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Singapore, also made progress in efforts to negotiate a replacement for a key arms control treaty between the United States and Russia that is set to expire in December, administration officials said. 
 While White House officials acknowledged on Sunday that there was no way a new agreement to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, would be ratified by the legislatures of either country even if it was completed by the end of the year, they said that they expected to at least reach an interim ''bridge'' agreement that would preserve the status quo until a new agreement was reached.
 Sunday afternoon's session was the fifth bilateral meeting with Mr. Medvedev since Mr. Obama took office vowing to repair America's relationship with Russia, and administration officials expressed satisfaction with their progress so far. 
 ''The reset button has worked,'' Mr. Obama said after the meeting, alluding to the administration's early promise to press a ''reset'' button in America's relationship with Russia after several years of bickering over a host of issues like missile defense and the status of Kosovo.
 With Start set to expire soon, the Obama administration is searching for ways to keep inspectors in Russia -- or it risks losing eyes on the world's second most formidable nuclear arsenal for the first time in decades. 
 Under Start, the United States is allowed a maximum of 30 inspectors in Russia to monitor compliance with the treaty. Russia likewise has interests in finding a bridge mechanism to continue its similar right to inspections in the United States.
 On Iran, Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev discussed a timetable for imposing sanctions if Tehran and the West do not reach an accord soon on a proposal in which Iran would send its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for either temporary safekeeping or reprocessing into fuel rods, administration officials said. 
 ''Unfortunately, so far at least, Iran appears to have been unable to say yes to what everyone acknowledges is a creative and constructive approach,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We are running out of time with respect to that approach.'' 
 More significant, Mr. Medvedev also alluded to running out of patience. He said that while the negotiation with Iran was continuing, ''we are not completely happy about its pace. If something does not work, there are other means to move the process further.''
 Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said that the United States had set an internal deadline of the end of the year. 
 During Mr. Obama's trip, his first to Asia as president, he has taken to referring to himself as ''America's first Pacific president,'' a term he first used during a speech in Tokyo on Saturday morning. 
 Mr. Obama drew some fire from conservative American bloggers who accused him of going too far to reassure Asian leaders: they complained that he should not have bowed to Emperor Akihito of Japan when he went to the emperor's residence for lunch.
 ''During his meetings and his speech in Tokyo, the president observed protocol and enhanced the status of American interests in Japan and across Asia,'' said an administration official traveling with the president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to protocol. ''Those who suggest otherwise are way off base and only looking to score political points.''
 On Sunday, Mr. Obama became the first American president to meet with Myanmar's military leaders when he attended a summit meeting of the Southeast Asian group Asean, held on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation talks in Singapore. Mr. Obama, who has made his willingness to engage with adversaries one of his foreign policy hallmarks, sat four places away from Gen. Thein Sein, the prime minister of Myanmar, at the meeting table on Sunday afternoon.
 After the talks, the group issued a joint statement that called for Myanmar's elections scheduled for next year to be free and fair. But the statement did not call for the release of the Myanmar opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. White House officials said that Mr. Obama made a point of demanding her release when he made a speech to Asean members. 
 Since Myanmar is a member of Asean, there was never much chance that the organization's joint statement would call for the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi or other political prisoners unless Myanmar's military leaders agreed to that first.
 Early Monday afternoon, Mr. Obama entered an auditorium on the top floor of Shanghai's Museum of Science and Technology to give an audience of 500 a taste of what Americans have endured for the past several years: a town hall event. . 
 Mr. Obama referred to Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement to talk about how far America has come, and said America's struggles with inequality explained why the United States would speak out for core principles like access to information and freedom of movement. 
 ''These are all things that you should know about America,'' he said. ''This is my first time traveling to China and I'm excited to see this majestic country.''

HEADLINE: The Climate Bog

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Paris, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama came into office pledging to end eight years of American inaction on climate change under President George W. Bush, and all year he has promised that the United States would lead the way toward a global agreement in Copenhagen next month to address the warming planet.
 But this weekend in Singapore, Mr. Obama was forced to acknowledge that a comprehensive climate deal was beyond reach this year. Instead, he and other world leaders agreed that they would work toward a more modest interim agreement with a promise to renew work toward a binding treaty next year. 
 The admission places Mr. Obama in the awkward position of being, at least for now, as unlikely to spearhead an international effort to combat global warming as his predecessor -- if for different reasons.
 In Mr. Bush's case, he remained skeptical about the science of global warming until near the end of his presidency and dubious about the need for concerted global action. 
 And his reluctance was echoed by a Congress that wanted to see clear commitments from developing countries like China.
 But Mr. Obama has been a champion of climate change regulation. He has moved unilaterally to limit greenhouse gases from vehicles and large sources such as coal-burning power plants. And in recent months, China, India, Brazil and some other developing countries have issued promises to slow the growth of emissions, although with the knowledge that a binding treaty to enforce such pledges will not take effect for at least several years. 
 Yet Mr. Obama has found himself limited in his ambitions by a Congress that is unwilling to move as far or as fast as he would like. 
 American negotiators have been hamstrung in talks leading to the Copenhagen conference by inaction on legislation supported by the administration that would impose strict caps on carbon dioxide emissions. The House passed a relatively stringent bill in June, but the Senate is not expected to begin serious debate on the measure until next year.
 Without a firm commitment from the United States -- for decades the world's leading emitter of climate-altering gases -- other nations have been reluctant to deliver firmer pledges of their own. Mr. Obama's aides say he remains determined to use his domestic authority and international clout to continue pressing toward a global agreement. despite the latest setback. 
 ''Is this impasse the United States' fault? Of course. But others are at fault as well,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign in Washington, citing the opposition of polluting industries and the reluctance of emerging economies to commit to binding curbs on emissions. ''We have both the obligation and capability of taking the lead on this issue. The longer we delay, the more extreme the steps that will have to be taken.''
 Mr. Obama expressed support on Sunday for a proposal from Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark to pursue a two-step process at the Copenhagen conference. 
 Under the plan, the 192 nations convening in the Danish capital would formulate a nonbinding political agreement calling for reductions in global warming emissions and aid for developing nations to adapt to a changing climate. The group would also promise to work to put together a binding global pact in 2010, complete with firm emissions targets, enforcement mechanisms and specific dollar amounts to aid poorer nations.
 ''We must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible,'' Mr. Rasmussen said in Singapore, making clear he would prefer to lock in the progress that has been made to date and not postpone action until countries are prepared to accept legally-binding commitments. 
 Although many read the compromise as a sign that the Copenhagen talks were doomed to produce at best a weak agreement, Yvo de Boer, the United Nations official managing the climate negotiations, said the statements out of the Singapore meeting did not limit his ambitions.
 ''Copenhagen can and must deliver clarity on emission reduction targets and the finance to kick start rapid action,'' Mr. de Boer said. ''I have seen nothing that would change my view on that.''
 Not everyone blames the United States for the apparent deadlock. A European Union official, who asked that his name not be used so he could speak more freely, said that Mr. Obama was moving to use his executive authority to regulate greenhouse gases, but that India and China had delivered little beyond promises.
 He said that it had been clear for months that Copenhagen was not going to yield a breakthrough and that there was plenty of blame to go around.
 Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the compromise agreed to by the leaders in Singapore was an honest admission of what had become obvious over the past several weeks, as negotiations toward a climate treaty stalled.
 But he said the admission was a severe disappointment from President Obama and the other leaders.
 ''It signifies an abandonment of moral responsibility that a position of leadership on the world stage clearly implies,'' Mr. Pachauri said in an e-mail message, adding that the scientific consensus on global warming demanded immediate action, not stalling tactics. 
 Mr. Obama, speaking in Japan on Friday, seemed to anticipate the criticism the United States will face for the setback in the Copenhagen talks. He said he had started a momentous change in American policy on global warming that would take some time to complete.
 ''Already, the United States has taken more steps to combat climate change in 10 months than we have in our recent history,'' Mr. Obama said, ''by embracing the latest science, by investing in new energy, by raising efficiency standards, forging new partnerships and engaging in international climate negotiations. 
 ''In short, America knows there is more work to do,'' he said, ''but we are meeting our responsibility, and will continue to do so.''

HEADLINE: NEW GUIDELINES SUGGEST CUTBACK IN MAMMOGRAMS

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA; Roni Caryn Rabin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Most women should start regular breast cancer screening at age 50, not 40, according to new guidelines released Monday by an influential group that provides guidance to doctors, insurance companies and policy makers. 
 The new recommendations, which do not apply to a small group of women with unusual risk factors for breast cancer, reverse longstanding guidelines and are aimed at reducing harm from overtreatment, the group says. It also says women age 50 to 74 should have mammograms less frequently -- every two years, rather than every year. And it said doctors should stop teaching women to examine their breasts on a regular basis.
 Just seven years ago, the same group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, with different members, recommended that women have mammograms every one to two years starting at age 40. It found too little evidence to take a stand on breast self-examinations.
 The task force is an independent panel of experts in prevention and primary care appointed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. 
 Its new guidelines, which are different from those of some professional and advocacy organizations, are published online in The Annals of Internal Medicine They are likely to touch off yet another round of controversy over the benefits of screening for breast cancer.
 Dr. Diana Petitti, vice chairwoman of the task force and a professor of biomedical informatics at Arizona State University, said the guidelines were based on new data and analyses and were aimed at reducing the potential harm from overscreening. 
 While many women do not think a screening test can be harmful, medical experts say the risks are real. A test can trigger unnecessary further tests, like biopsies, that can create extreme anxiety. And mammograms can find cancers that grow so slowly that they never would be noticed in a woman's lifetime, resulting in unnecessary treatment. 
 Over all, the report says, the modest benefit of mammograms -- reducing the breast cancer death rate by 15 percent -- must be weighed against the harms. And those harms loom larger for women in their 40s, who are 60 percent more likely to experience them than women 50 and older but are less likely to have breast cancer, skewing the risk-benefit equation. The task force concluded that one cancer death is prevented for every 1,904 women age 40 to 49 who are screened for 10 years, compared with one death for every 1,339 women age 50 to 74, and one death for every 377 women age 60 to 69. 
 The guidelines are not meant for women at increased risk for breast cancer because they have a gene mutation that makes the cancer more likely or because they had extensive chest radiation. The task force said there was not enough information to know whether those women would be helped by more frequent mammograms or by having the test in their 40s. Other experts said women with close relatives with breast cancer were also at high risk.
 Dr. Petitti said she knew the new guidelines would be a shock for many women, but, she said, ''we have to say what we see based on the science and the data.''
 The National Cancer Institute said Monday that it was re-evaluating its guidelines in light of the task force's report.
 But the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology both said they were staying with their guidelines advising annual mammograms starting at age 40.
 The cancer society, in a statement by Dr. Otis W. Brawley, its chief medical officer, agreed that mammography had risks as well as benefits but, he said, the society's experts had looked at ''virtually all'' the task force and additional data and concluded that the benefits of annual mammograms starting at age 40 outweighed the risks.
 Other advocacy groups, like the National Breast Cancer Coalition, Breast Cancer Action, and the National Women's Health Network, welcomed the new guidelines.
 ''This is our opportunity to look beyond emotions,'' said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. The task force ''is an independent body of experts that took an objective look at the data,'' Ms. Visco said. ''These are the people we should be listening to when it comes to public health messages.''
 Some women, though, were not pleased. ''I know so many people who had breast cancer and survived, and what saved their lives was early detection,'' Janet Doughty, 44, of San Clemente, Calif., said in a telephone interview. She said she had had an annual mammogram since her late 30s and would not stop now.
 The guidelines are not expected to have an immediate effect on insurance coverage but should make health plans less likely to aggressively prompt women in their 40s to have mammograms and older women to have the test annually.
 Congress requires Medicare to pay for annual mammograms. Medicare can change its rules to pay for less frequent tests if federal officials direct it to.
 Private insurers are required by law in every state except Utah to pay for mammograms for women in their 40s. 
 But the new guidelines are expected to alter the grading system for health plans, which are used as a marketing tool. Grades are issued by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a private nonprofit organization, and one measure is the percentage of patients getting mammograms every one to two years starting at age 40.
 That will change, said Margaret E. O'Kane, the group's president, who said it would start grading plans on the number of women over 50 getting mammograms every two years.
 The message for most women, said Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, a professor in the department of medicine, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, is to forgo routine mammograms if they are in their 40s. 
 Starting at age 50, Dr. Kerlikowske said, ''the message is to get 10 mammograms in a lifetime, one every two years.'' That way they get the most benefit and the least harm from the test. If women are healthy, she added, they might consider having mammograms every two years until age 74. 
 Nearly two-thirds of all women in their 40s had mammograms within the last two years, as did 72 percent of women age 50 to 65, according to an editorial by Dr. Kerlikowske that accompanies the report. 
 In order to formulate its guidelines, the task force used new data from mammography studies in England and Sweden and also commissioned six groups to make statistical models to analyze the aggregate data. The models were the only way to answer questions like how much extra benefit do women get if they are screened every year, said Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and head of one of the modeling groups.
 ''We said, essentially with one voice, very little,'' Dr. Berry said. ''So little as to make the harms of additional screening come screaming to the top.'' 
 The harms are nearly cut in half when women have mammograms every other year instead of every year. But the benefits are almost unchanged.
 The last time the task force issued guidelines for mammograms, in 2002, the reportwas announced by Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services. When the group recommended mammograms for women in their 40s, some charged the report was politically motivated. But Dr. Alfred Berg of the University of Washington, who was the task force chairman at the time, said ''there was absolutely zero political influence on what the task force did.''
 It was still a tough call to make, Dr. Berg said, adding that ''we pointed out that the benefit will be quite small.'' In fact, he added, even though mammograms are of greater benefitto older women, they still prevent only a small fraction of breast cancer deaths. 
 Different women will weigh the harms and benefits differently, Dr. Berg noted, but added that even for women 50 and older, ''it would be perfectly rational for a woman to decide she didn't want to do it.''
 Researchers worry the new report will be interpreted as a political effort by the Obama administration to save money on health care costs. 
 Of course, Dr. Berry noted, if the new guidelines are followed, billions of dollars will be saved. 
 ''But the money was buying something of net negative value,'' he said. ''This decision is a no-brainer. The economy benefits, but women are the major beneficiaries.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about revised guidelines on breast cancer screening misstated a statistic from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which released the recommendations. The task force concluded that one cancer death was prevented for every 1,339 women aged 50 to 59 who were screened for 10 years -- not 50 to 74.

HEADLINE: No 'Choice of Evils' Defense in Oil Lease Case, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
A college student who bid on and won more than $1.8 million in federal oil and gas leases last year without the intent or ability to pay will not be allowed to argue in court that he acted out of necessity to protect the environment, a federal judge ruled on Monday. 
 The student, Tim DeChristopher, 27, an economics major at the University of Utah, faces up to five years in prison and huge fines on each of two felony charges -- making false statements and interfering with an auction -- arising from the sale last December in Utah. 
 He has said he believed the looming dangers of climate change and environmental impact from drilling were so great and urgent that he had no choice but to take whatever action he could to stop the drilling program. His lawyer, Ronald J. Yengich, recently asked that the jury be allowed to consider a defense of necessity, or ''choice of evils,'' when the trial begins, perhaps early next year.
 But Judge Dee Benson said in his ruling that Mr. DeChristopher had not met the threshold requirements under federal law.
 First, the harm that Mr. DeChristopher perceived from the lease sale was not imminent, the judge wrote, in the sense of a crisis like a fire or unfolding crime scene. 
 Nor, the judge said, could Mr. DeChristopher have known with a reasonable certainty that a bad result for the climate or the environment would definitely occur if he did nothing. And Mr. DeChristopher could have taken legal actions, the judge said, including participation in a lawsuit against the lease sale. Such a suit did eventually block the sale process.
 Finally, the judge said Mr. DeChristopher could not have ''reasonably anticipated'' that his actions would really stop the lease sale. ''Unlike a person demolishing a home to create a firebreak,'' Judge Benson wrote, ''DeChristopher's actions were more akin to placing a small pile of dirt in the fire's path.''
 Mr. Yengich said he would make a decision by the end of the week about whether to appeal. Mr. DeChristopher said, ''It's a big setback for us, obviously.'' He said there were ''other options we're going to pursue,'' but he declined to elaborate.

HEADLINE: A Revolutionary War Widow's Estate Becomes a Preservation Battleground

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the mid-1980s J. Dennis Delafield and his cousins faced a hard fact: They could no longer afford to maintain the estate established in 1802 by their distant ancestor, Janet Livingston Montgomery, widow of Gen. Richard Montgomery, a hero of the Revolutionary War.
 ''It was eating us up alive,'' Mr. Delafield said of Montgomery Place, a majestic house overlooking the Hudson River that is but one small part of the 434-acre property here. ''We had to let it go, though it broke our hearts.''
 They decided to turn the house and its grounds, with working orchards and more than a dozen outbuildings, into a museum. So they sold it to what is now Historic Hudson Valley, a nonprofit group founded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. that owns Washington Irving's house, Sunnyside, in Tarrytown, N.Y., and several other properties.
 ''We made a bargain sale in the belief that that way the house would be protected,'' Mr. Delafield said. 
 Now, though, Mr. Delafield and others are worried about the fate of Montgomery Place. The house was closed to the public in 2006 -- though the grounds were available for weddings, photo shoots and other events -- until August, when it was hastily reopened for four hours on Fridays after a state official began inquiring about its status. Under the terms of a state financing package, the house must be open at least 12 days a year.
 Rumors have run rampant this fall that Historic Hudson Valley plans to sell the house, vexing public officials who have sought definitive information from the group's leader, Waddell W. Stillman. ''I've dealt with him on a number of occasions, and I've never felt we always got the full story,'' said Marcus J. Molinaro, the New York state assemblyman who represents the area.
 In a recent interview at Montgomery Place, Mr. Stillman denied that the organization's board planned to sell all or any part of the property. ''We have not discussed a sale,'' he said.
 However, minutes of board meetings obtained by The New York Times make it clear that the board discussed just that on several occasions. ''Mr. Herbert E. Nass asked whether we could sell Montgomery Place in parts, and whether doing so could yield a better price over time,'' the minutes of a March 10 meeting state.
 At the same meeting the board chairman, Michael Hegarty, raised concerns about rebuilding the organization's endowment, which like many others was hard hit by the economic downturn. ''To do this, Mr. Hegarty believes we must consider the sale of assets, such as the president's house adjacent to the Philipsburg Manor'' -- another of the organization's historic houses -- ''and some or perhaps all of the property at Montgomery Place,'' the minutes say.
 The board even formed a committee to explore ''existing conditions and constraints'' at Montgomery Place; at a June meeting its members described several potential buyers, according to notes by board members. 
 Asked about the discrepancy, Mr. Stillman said the minutes represented ''old news.'' ''The board's March meeting coincided exactly with the nadir in the financial markets,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Everyone was distressed about the decline in our endowment, and economic prospects were grim. A wide-ranging discussion ensued about the sale of assets, including Montgomery Place, and nothing was decided or acted upon, then or since.''
 ''The topic is no longer on the board's agenda,'' he wrote.
 A draft resolution to offer to sell some of the land to a state agency that holds an easement on part of the estate had been floated for consideration at a meeting on Wednesday.
 Mr. Stillman said the resolution had not been considered by or proposed to the board and would not be taken up on Wednesday. He also said the reopening of the house on Fridays was unrelated to the state official's inquiries.
 Mr. Stillman, who joined Historic Hudson Valley in 1992, said his group could not afford the $500,000 in annual operating costs for Montgomery Place, let alone pay for necessary renovations. Nor would it be possible to reopen the house next year, as originally planned, he said. Indeed, he said, the decision to buy the house in the first place had been a bad one. ''We broke some of the textbook rules for not getting ahead of yourself,'' he said. ''We didn't have the money to buy it, we didn't have the money to maintain it, and we way underestimated how much it would take to restore it.''
 But several former board members, led by the Wall Street financier Richard Jenrette, said they had proposed ways to support Montgomery Place, including offers to help Historic Hudson Valley cover some costs.
 Because of its continuous ownership by descendants of Mrs. Montgomery, Montgomery Place is a rare example of an intact Hudson Valley estate. Alexander Jackson Davis, the influential 19th-century architect who designed many of the area's prominent houses, redesigned Montgomery and designed several other structures on the property. The landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing provided advice on the design of the grounds and designed one garden himself. 
 The house plays an important role in the community, too, Mr. Molinaro said, attracting tourists and helping to educate students in the area's history. 
 Mr. Jenrette has proposed that Historic Hudson Valley donate the property to the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust, a foundation to which he has donated six historic houses. He and others have offered to create a friends group to raise money to support Montgomery Place. Most recently, he and John S. Dyson, another former board member and a venture capitalist, offered to put up $100,000 a year for five years to keep it open. ''We think we can get at least another $100,000 to match that, and if we could create a friends group, we could raise a lot more money,'' Mr. Jenrette said.
 In a meeting earlier this month, however, Mr. Stillman and Mr. Hegarty rejected that offer. Mr. Stillman said in the interview that he did not want to create another nonprofit group that would do the same thing as Historic Hudson Valley.
 In addition to owning three other historic houses and a church in the region, Historic Hudson Valley recently broke ground on a regional history center in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., on nine acres donated by Laurance Rockefeller.
 The center will provide offices for the organization, as well as space for scholars and researchers seeking access to its extensive archives and records.
 Mr. Stillman envisions creating a digital archive of the contents of Historic Hudson Valley's houses to provide virtual tours and other activities to attract a new breed of tourists. 
 Although the group does not yet have the $15 million it needs to build the center, it began construction last month because it would otherwise lose a $6 million grant from a state financing agency.
 In their meetings, according to the minutes obtained by The Times, Historic Hudson Valley board members discussed their concerns that public officials and others would assume they were using proceeds from the sale of Montgomery Place to finance the construction of the center. 
 ''They will deny that, but money is fungible,'' said John H. Dobkin, a preservation expert who was the organization's executive director from 1984 to 2000. ''They'll say it's to replenish the endowment, but you don't sell a unique asset like Montgomery Place to do that.''
 As chairman of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, Mr. Stillman put through a plan ending that organization's membership structure, selling its historic home and handing over its archives to the New York Public Library, keeping only a digitized version of them. ''Historic house museums are in the same place as classical music orchestras,'' he said. 
 Historic Hudson Valley's endowment fell to $45 million last spring from about $70 million and now stands at roughly $49 million, according to Rob Schweitzer, spokesman for the organization.
 By the standards of organizations supporting historic homes, that is a handsome sum even at its depleted level. The Classical American Homes trust, for example, operates six houses with $9 million in liquid assets.
 ''There's a pact between nonprofits and the people because we extend to them certain tax benefits and, in the case of Historic Hudson Valley, millions of dollars in public grants,'' Mr. Molinaro, the assemblyman, said.
 ''If they have a desire to divest of this asset, they certainly shouldn't benefit financially from all that public investment.''

Air travelers in the United States are already paying for sandwiches and drinks, pillows and headsets. So, as airlines look for more ways to help their bottom lines, they have started asking the next logical question: Why not sell limousine services or even tickets to Broadway shows? 
 For most carriers, the idea remains just that. But American Airlines has begun a limited test of the retail concept. It is selling Heathrow Express train tickets on London-bound flights, and it is offering in-flight Internet access and items from SkyMall -- the glossy catalog that has had a reserved space in the seatback pocket of airliners for 20 years -- on 165 airliners. 
 ''We wouldn't invest if we didn't feel comfortable it would provide a fair rate of return,'' said John Tiliacos, managing director of onboard products for American Airlines. 
 ''Given where we find ourselves as an industry, financially it behooves us to identify every source of revenue we can identify.'' 
 Other airlines declined to talk on the record about their plans, but nearly all the major carriers acknowledged that they were working on expanding retail offerings. 
 Whether air travelers will open up their wallets once the aircraft pushes back from the gate remains to be seen. But Michael Levy, a marketing professor and the director of the Retail Supply Chain Institute at Babson College in Massachusetts, expects that they will. 
 ''Look at what's going on in airports,'' he said. ''Anytime you have customers who are captive, who have nothing better to do, they'll shop.''
 The technology making the onboard sales possible is being provided by GuestLogix, a Canadian company that sells the credit card readers and sales software to the airline industry. A brochure promoting its products describes onboard retail as unique because ''operators are able to lock their doors with their shoppers still inside.''
 In an interview, Brett Proud executive vice president of global sales and client support for GuestLogix, described the jetliner as ''a retail space that is probably the biggest retail opportunity ever uncovered,'' adding, ''It's huge.''
 Passengers can learn about products for sale from seatback advertisements, brochures and announcements by flight attendants and gate agents, as well as on airline Web sites and through social media. Finding the right mix of products is important because if an airline offers the wrong items, it could irritate its customers. 
 ''We're not going to put anything in front of you that you would say, 'You got to be kidding,' '' said Mr. Tiliacos of American Airlines.
 In the past, customers could browse the SkyMall catalog, but placing an order could be done only after the plane had landed. With the addition of what SkyMall's president, Christine Aguilera, calls ''a cash register in the air,'' sales can be completed on the plane. ''These are some of the greatest consumers on the planet,'' she said.
 Charles Flateman, vice president of marketing for the Schubert Organization, said in an interview that he had been talking to GuestLogix about selling tickets to Broadway shows and other live performances. The Walt Disney Company is discussing making theme park tickets available on airplanes as well. The credit card readers do not now transmit information in real time, so it will require a ''trick of technology'' to assure that show tickets sold during a flight still exist in the theater when the plane is on the ground, Mr. Flateman said. 
 ''It's our desire to market and merchandise and conclude ticket sales wherever our customers are,'' he said. ''If that's at 35,000 feet en route to New York, that's wonderful and we're excited by the prospect.''
 While the concept of shopping in flight is new to large American carriers, Ireland's discount airline, Ryanair, has been selling travel services a la carte since the early '90s. It uses the profits to subsidize ticket prices. The cheap tickets put more passengers in seats.
 ''Fundamentally we're an airline with a retail tail,'' said Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive of Ryanair. ''We can expand our business by lowering fares and any additional profitability means we can grow our business.''
 The job of selling falls to flight attendants, and some in the United States have already expressed concern. In a letter to American Airlines, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants wrote that sales commissions with SkyMall or any other vendor must be negotiated as part of the labor contract with the airline.
 ''There are a myriad issues surrounding SkyMall,'' said Diana Dunn, a member of the union's negotiating committee. ''What is the commission they want to pay us? What if a customer returns something, how are they going to get the money back?''
 Flight attendants at other airlines are also worried that retail commissions may be used to replace salaries, according to Corey Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants. ''If airlines are encouraging flight attendants to participate in selling of products and services, it needs to be done when the flight attendant has completed safety and security activities onboard the flight.'' Ms. Caldwell said. ''It's definitely a proceed with caution type of thing.''
 Currently, the average amount a passenger spends with an airline after purchasing a ticket is $1, according to statistics prepared by GuestLogix. At Ryanair, by contrast, Mr. Cawley said customers spend on average about $15. 
 But Robert Herbst a commercial pilot who created the Web site AirlineFinancials.com, said retail therapy was not enough to solve the financial problems of airlines in the United States.
 ''By my estimates, the revenues have to go up by 15 to 20 percent before airlines can become solvent again,'' he said. ''Any additional sales they make is going to be a positive for them and more of a convenience for the passenger. But it will be minimal. Not enough revenue will be generated.'' 
 Ms. Caldwell of the Association of Flight Attendants said she understood the economics behind the idea. ''It doesn't take an expert to see there are airlines that are not charging what the cost of the service is,'' she said. ''There is a huge deficit between what a seat costs and what the airline charges.''
 But even if airplanes begin to resemble retail space, Mr. Cawley of Ryanair insisted that its business was transportation.
 ''The single most important thing is selling the airline ticket,'' he said. ''All the ancillary sales flow from that.''

HEADLINE: An Air-Traffic Upgrade to Improve Travel by Plane

BYLINE: By GUY GUGLIOTTA

DATELINE: EGG HARBOR, N.J. 

 BODY:
Up in the cockpit, Larry Van Hoy, a Federal Aviation Administration pilot, was flying low-tech. Radar showed a bit of nearby cloud cover, and to learn about other aircraft, he talked to the ground controller or looked out the window.
 Back in the passenger cabin of the same plane, a Bombardier Global 5000, Wilson N. Felder, director of the F.A.A.'s William J. Hughes Technical Center, was flying in the cockpit of the future.
 Dr. Felder was watching an Automatic Dependent Surveillance -- Broadcast, or A.D.S.-B., display that uses the Global Positioning System for navigation. The display gave him an overview of the terrain below with airports labeled. He could tune in weather at any altitude. A ground-based data feed sent him a constantly updated picture of the other aircraft sharing the sky. These appeared on the display screen as green crescents.
 The screen also showed two green spearheads. These, Dr. Felder said, were the nearby aircraft that were also equipped with the new technology. They sent their positions directly to the Global 5000. 
 A.D.S.-B. is a linchpin of the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen, the aviation agency's master plan for fixing the shortcomings of 21st-century air travel. 
 The United States air traffic system normally handles about 50,000 flights per day, and in the first half of 2008, more than 25 percent were either late or canceled. The scorecard improved slightly after the economy collapsed -- flights are currently down to 47,500 per day -- but by 2025 the F.A.A. predicts daily air traffic will be up to 80,000 flights. The current system is struggling badly. By 2025, it will not have a prayer.
 There are many reasons for this mess. Radar is rapidly becoming a dinosaur -- too slow for modern times. Air traffic controllers see a new ping from the planes on their scopes every six or seven seconds, and air traffic radars ''see'' for only about 150 miles. When aircraft are crossing the Gulf of Mexico on the same compass heading, they leave airports 10 minutes apart because each must be surrounded by 100 square miles of ''sanitized'' space to avoid accidents. This curtails service.
 Over busy airports, planes often circle in altitude ''layers,'' speeding up and slowing down to get into proper landing sequence. This wastes fuel. To land, they depend on controllers who are talking to every plane in a stream of nonstop oral radio transmissions. In the tower, controllers keep track of vital details by means of plastic ''flight strips'' that look like tile racks in a Scrabble game. A ground controller hands the strip to a local controller, who gets the plane in the air and passes the strip to another controller. The controllers have to keep everything straight on their radar screens, in their minds and on the radio. Theirs is one of the most stressful jobs around.
 NextGen is supposed to fix all this. By 2025, all aircraft will be using GPS-based technology for navigation, and radar will be a backup. New technologies, like A.D.S.-B., will deliver fixes every second, and aircrews will monitor their progress on digital cockpit displays like the one Dr. Felder was using.
 Electronics will give controllers recommended changes in altitude, course and trajectory to ensure the most efficient and smoothest ride possible. And when a plane reaches the airport, it will use precision navigation, even in bad weather, to come straight in, like a jewel on a string of beads. The controllers will be there, but they will not be talking constantly -- only when pilots need help.
 Victoria Cox, the F.A.A.'s senior vice president for NextGen and operations planning, described the system as a ''supermodern concept of aviation.'' 
 But in the computer age, many may wonder why changes like these have not been in place for years. After all, motorists already use GPS devices to find their relatives in the suburbs, weekend sailors use them to fish for blues off Cape Cod and aircraft have had access to GPS for years. Pilots in the United States can already use what is known as the Wide Area Augmentation System, which offers enhanced GPS so they can fix their location more precisely.
 NextGen is different. Wide Area Augmentation ''gives more accurate information to let you know where you are,'' said Michael Romanowski, the F.A.A.'s director of NextGen integration and implementation. 
 But, Dr. Romanowski added, ''A.D.S.-B. lets everyone else, including controllers, know where you are.''
 NextGen's progress has been rocky. Since its beginning in 2004, lawmakers and civil aviation experts have complained of its vagueness and the absence of a concrete plan. Also, the Government Accountability Office regarded the F.A.A.'s procurement strategy generally as inefficient and ''high risk,'' raising fears that the agency would never be able to see the program through to a finish.
 This year appears somewhat smoother. The F.A.A. is off high risk for the first time in a decade, and in January it issued a plan that described how the NextGen air traffic system would look at ''midterm'' in 2018 on its way to completion. 
 The F.A.A. has asked the civil aviation industry to come up with a method of rewarding the forward-looking. Ms. Cox said companies that were the ''best equipped'' early innovators should be the ''best served'' at airports and during flights. At the same time, however, laggards must be accommodated for some years. As a result, the two systems, old and new, will have to co-exist until NextGen builds enough momentum to eclipse yesterday.
 Many of NextGen's needed technologies are being developed at the F.A.A.'s technical center, a 5,000-acre stretch of runways, labs and grassland in the South Jersey flats near Atlantic City. On one summer afternoon, engineers were testing NextGen air control techniques at a virtual Newark Liberty International Airport, while F.A.A. experts a few doors away fine-tuned a futuristic electronic depiction of the runways at Logan International Airport in Boston.
 A.D.S.-B. figures to be a core NextGen technology, integrated with other GPS-linked systems that will let aircraft not only fly more efficient routes, but also pick up continuous digital data feeds for updated weather and traffic information.
 In the future, NextGen will provide a ''data cube'' that taps weather sources all over the country and delivers data that will tell aircraft and controllers what lies ahead for any flight in all three spatial dimensions and time.
 Governments will cover the nation with GPS-linked ground stations about half the size of a standing refrigerator. As the technology improves, aircraft will find it easier to land in bad weather, and at some point, the electronics will be able to place them on a safe track and bring them in quickly on several runways at the same time. Airports must have the technologies ready when aircraft are ready to use them.
 There appears to be little doubt that the new technology works. Unlike radar, with its immense installations costing millions of dollars, the A.D.S.-B. ground stations can be mounted anywhere. 
 As proof of concept, the F.A.A. distributed enough of them to cover Alaska. The accident rate in the state -- extremely high because of vast, radar-free areas and wretched weather -- dropped 47 percent for the small commercial aircraft that were outfitted with onboard A.D.S.-B.
 In the Gulf of Mexico, the agency is mounting A.D.S.-B. ground stations on some of the gulf's 9,000 gas and oil rigs, giving the helicopters that supply them a way to travel to and from the coast in reasonably bad weather without getting laid low by a derrick. The F.A.A. expects the system to begin operations next month.
 And at its hub in Louisville, Ky., UPS has outfitted all 263 of its jet cargo aircraft with A.D.S.-B. equipment and is using it to improve spacing and maneuvering during ''continuous descent arrivals'' into the airport.
 ''It's much faster,'' said Christian Kast, an advanced flight manager and UPS captain. ''The old system has given us a great service for many, many years, but it's time to move on.''

HEADLINE: A U.S. Visa, Shouts of Corruption, Barrels of Oil

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
Several times every year, Teodoro Nguema Obiang arrives at the doorstep of the United States from his home in Equatorial Guinea, on his way to his $35 million estate in Malibu, Calif., his fleet of luxury cars, his speedboats and private jet. And he is always let into the country.
 The nation's doors are open to Mr. Obiang, the forest and agriculture minister of Equatorial Guinea and the son of its president, even though federal law enforcement officials believe that ''most if not all'' of his wealth comes from corruption related to the extensive oil and gas reserves discovered more than a decade and a half ago off the coast of his tiny West African country, according to internal Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement documents.
 And they are open despite a federal law and a presidential proclamation that prohibit corrupt foreign officials and their families from receiving American visas. The measures require only credible evidence of corruption, not a conviction of it. 
 Susan Pittman, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement in the State Department, said she was prohibited from discussing specific visa decisions. But other former and current State Department officials said Equatorial Guinea's close ties to the American oil industry were the reason for the lax enforcement of the law. Production of the country's nearly 400,000 barrels of oil a day is dominated by American companies like ExxonMobil, Hess and Marathon.
 ''Of course it's because of oil,'' said John Bennett, the United States ambassador to Equatorial Guinea from 1991 to 1994, adding that Washington has turned a blind eye to the Obiangs' corruption and repression because of its dependence on the country for natural resources. He noted that officials of Zimbabwe are barred from the United States.
 ''Both countries are severely repressive,'' said Mr. Bennett, who is now a senior foreign affairs officer for the State Department in Baghdad. ''But if Zimbabwe had Equatorial Guinea's oil, Zimbabwean officials wouldn't still be blocked from the U.S.''
 Shown the Justice Department documents that detail the accusations of corruption against Mr. Obiang, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who wrote the law restricting visas, expressed frustration and anger with the State Department, which is responsible for enforcing the law at the border.
 ''The fact that someone like Mr. Obiang continues to travel freely here suggests strongly that the State Department is not yet applying the law as vigorously as Congress intended,'' Mr. Leahy said. The law was partly inspired by the accusations of corruption surrounding Mr. Obiang's family and the Equatorial Guinean government, Mr. Leahy's staff said. 
 ''There are many instances of corrupt foreign officials plundering the natural resources of their countries for their own use while their people starve,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''The law states clearly that if you do that, you are no longer welcome in the United States.''
 Daniel Whitman, who retired in September as the deputy director of the Office of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in the Bureau of African Affairs at the State Department, agreed that the law should be used more forcefully. ''We just seem to lack the backbone to use this prohibition,'' Mr. Whitman said. ''In the rare cases it is used, no one at State was willing to talk about it.''
 When asked how many times the laws have been used to bar corrupt foreign officials from entering the country, State Department officials declined to answer, citing privacy reasons, though Ms. Pittman said thousands of visas had been denied to corrupt officials using other legal means. A 2007 State Department report said the presidential proclamation, signed by President George W. Bush in 2004, had been used ''dozens'' of times.
 A State Department official who handles corruption investigations said that while the measures were important tools, the department as a matter of policy did not want to reveal the number of times they had been used because it would show that the number was actually quite small. The official asked not to be identified because of departmental rules barring public comment.
 The Justice Department memorandum, dated Sept. 4, 2007, and obtained by The New York Times, said the government believed Mr. Obiang's assets were derived ''from extortion, theft of public funds or other corrupt conduct.'' From April 2005 to April 2006, the memorandum said, Mr. Obiang funneled at least $73 million into the United States, using shell corporations and offshore bank accounts to launder the money and ultimately buy his Malibu estate and a luxury jet.
 The document identified several wire transfers by Mr. Obiang from 2005 and 2006, beginning with a bank in Equatorial Guinea, then going to the central Banque de France and landing in American accounts at Wachovia, Bank of America and UBS. In one six-week period in 2006, Mr. Obiang transferred $33,799,799.99 to the United States, it said, which was used to buy a Gulfstream V jet.
 Part of his wealth, the document said, comes from a ''revolutionary tax'' that Mr. Obiang placed on timber. Instead of sending the payments to the treasury of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Obiang, who is considered likely to be a successor to his father, has ''insisted that the payments be made directly to him,'' it said.
 In addition, the memorandum said, the Justice Department believes that Mr. Obiang ''may be receiving bribes or extortion payments'' from the oil companies as a percentage of their contracts.
 Spokesmen for ExxonMobil and Marathon said the companies followed all relevant laws. A request for comment from Hess was not answered. The Justice Department declined to comment on the memo.
 Another document, prepared by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Homeland Security Department, said Mr. Obiang ''routinely travels to the United States with over $1 million in cash'' that he fails to declare, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Obiang regularly visits the country using a diplomatic passport, though he rarely does diplomatic business here, said the I.C.E. document. The document said the immigration agency's goal was to deny a safe haven to Mr. Obiang and to ''identify, trace, freeze and recover assets within the United States illicitly acquired through kleptocracy by Teodoro Obiang and his associates.''
 The documents were originally obtained by Global Witness, a British human rights group that monitors corruption in natural resources industries, after they were released in response to a legal complaint filed in France against several African dictators, including Mr. Obiang's father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea. The Justice Department and I.C.E. would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents.
 Through a spokesman at Qorvis Communications, a public relations firm working for the Equatorial Guinean Embassy in Washington, Teodoro Nguema Obiang declined to be interviewed. But his brother denied the charges of corruption.
 ''This is the problem when a country becomes very successful,'' said Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima, the vice minister of mines, energy and industry and another of the president's sons. ''Everyone assumes us guilty until proven innocent.''
 The vice minister said his government had made great strides in dealing with corruption. He cited as an example his country's participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an international coalition of governments, civil society groups and companies that sets global standards for transparency in oil, gas and mining.
 But a 2009 internal document from the initiative says the organization is ''particularly concerned about the pace of progress'' in Equatorial Guinea. The country has failed to produce a required report regarding its revenue, even though it joined the organization more than three years ago, the report says. 
 In 2004, President Bush signed a proclamation barring entry to the United States for any foreign officials and their family members ''whose misappropriation of public funds'' has had serious adverse effects on American businesses or national security interests. Congress followed up in 2007 with a law containing even stronger language, barring entry to anyone ''involved in corruption relating to the extraction of natural resources in their countries.'' 
 Otto Reich, who served until 2004 as the United States' special envoy to the Western Hemisphere, said there was resistance to applying these sorts of prohibitions even before the presidential proclamation was drafted. 
 ''Senior State Department people especially from Africa kept saying that if something like this is used they wouldn't have anyone to talk to in their home countries,'' Mr. Reich said. ''It's politically simply something they do not want to take on.''
 The Obiang family and Equatorial Guinea have been the focus of corruption accusations for years. In 2004, a Senate panel accused Riggs Bank in Washington of having ''turned a blind eye to evidence suggesting the bank was handling the proceeds of foreign corruption'' in accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits from Equatorial Guinea.
 Committee investigators found dozens of irregular payments, multiple individual signatories to accounts and even deposits of millions of dollars in shrink-wrapped currency. Riggs Bank was fined more than $25 million for its handling of the Equatorial Guinean and other accounts, and several of the bank's directors were criminally prosecuted. 
 But in more recent years millions of dollars of the country's money has found its way to other American banks, including the ones named in the Justice Department memo. Wachovia and Bank of America, according to the memo, filed suspicious activity reports to the authorities, and ultimately closed all accounts associated with Mr. Obiang and his associates, but not before tens of millions of dollars had already entered the United States.
 ''These banks appear to have facilitated a grand corruption, and it may even have been done legally,'' said Gavin Hayman, director of campaigns for Global Witness. ''Those that filed suspicious activity reports may have been complying with their regulatory obligations under the law, but at the same time they went ahead and forwarded transfers of tens of millions of dollars about which they already had suspicions. Effectively, the regulations are allowing banks to earn money from corruption.''
 All three banks declined to answer questions about the transactions. Although Wachovia said Mr. Obiang was not a client, the Justice Department documents described how he used third parties to open accounts at some banks. 
 Since oil was discovered there in 1996, Equatorial Guinea has become the third-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria and Angola, with estimated revenues of $4.8 billion in 2007. But although petroleum has made the ruling Obiang family and its associates vastly rich, the oil and gas wealth has not been spread beyond ruling elites.
 In 2006, more than three-quarters of the population was living below the poverty line, according to a 2009 International Monetary Fundreport. 
 By some measures, conditions in the country are getting worse. Though the nation's gross domestic product grew more than tenfold from 1990 to 2007, infant mortality rose to 12 percent from 10 percent, according to a 2009 Unicef report.

HEADLINE: Do Stockholders Really Know What's Best?

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
When news of Kraft's hostile bid for Cadbury broke in England a couple of months back, it caused intense debate, including whether an American company should, by all rights, really be the new home of a well-known British brand that dates back to 1824.
 Felicity Loudon, the granddaughter of the former Cadbury Brothers managing director Egbert Cadbury, was quoted in The Sunday Telegraph saying that she was ''particularly saddened by the possibility of one of the last remaining British icons disappearing into an American plastic cheese company.'' 
After giving the back of her hand to Kraft, she made a plea to her fellow countrymen: ''I cannot believe that something can't be done for totally patriotic reasons.''
 Let's set aside for a moment the charged rhetoric over the merits of Cheez Whiz versus a Dairy Milk candy bar, and consider this instead as Exhibit A in the argument that maybe, just maybe, the notion of shareholder democracy isn't all it's cracked up to be. 
 First, some context. Kraft's $16.7 billion hostile takeover bid for Cadbury, the confectionery company, is one of the largest deals of the year. If the takeover battle were happening in the United States, it would most likely be a fierce fight.
 And yet when I visited London two weeks ago, there wasn't much talk of a fight at all. Indeed, most takeover experts I talked to said the deal is a fait accompli -- it's just a matter of time and the price Kraft will end up paying. 
 The reason is that, unlike in the United States, British takeover law essentially handcuffs the board of a target company from doing anything to block a deal. No poison pills. No staggered boards. No changing the shareholder vote date. The potential for a C.E.O. or entrenched board to block a deal -- or otherwise act in its own self- interest -- is virtually nil. In other words, England is as close as any country gets to a true shareholder democracy. Any bid gets put to a vote, and all the board can do is offer an opinion. 
 To many people, this is how the rest of the world should work.
 ''I'm a majority-rules guy,'' said Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. ''The U.K. system is better.''
 Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, also said that, in theory, the British system has much to commend it. ''Economists will say it is much purer,'' he said. ''It creates a tremendous fluidity.''
 So what's not to like? Professor Sonnenfeld noted an important asterisk -- that this push for shareholder democracy may create a perverse incentive system so that short-term shareholders can end up determining the long-term fate of the company. So the balance of interests becomes skewed. 
 ''It raises a question about short-termism,'' Professor Sonnenfeld said.
 Indeed, one parlor game in London has been to guess how much of Cadbury's long-term shareholder base has already sold out to arbitrageurs, whose goal is to see the company sold as quickly as possible and then move on to another deal. (That's not to say the right strategic decision isn't for Cadbury to be sold to Kraft, though that's the position of Cadbury's board.)
 People involved in the deal estimate that about a third of the shares have already changed hands, moving from long-term shareholders to hedge funds. Those funds, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School, ''have a long-term time horizon of about 12 minutes.''
 If the board lacks power to weigh in on the deal, that also means nobody with any clout is looking out for other stakeholders, like employees. Most mergers never live up to their hype, resulting in lower values and fewer jobs. So the question worth asking is: Shouldn't someone be looking further into the future?
 That's been the argument of people like Martin Lipton, the takeover lawyer who invented the poison pill. He has long argued that shareholders don't necessarily know what's good for them, and that companies need someone looking out for their best interests. That best interest may include holding out for a higher offer, or even roping in other bidders. As a result, he has often been branded a friend of entrenched boards.
 Without the first-line defense of boards, shareholders may simply jump at the first bid.
 ''It gives the company less negotiating leverage,'' Professor Sonnenfeld said.
 That's certainly the argument that some Cadbury insiders and bankers made to me, saying they feel helpless that their votes count for so little in this case study in shareholder democracy.
 There is also very little evidence that shareholder democracy works better than directors in deal-making. A number of academic studies suggest it is a wash. 
 There will always be exceptions to every rule. Some boards make bad calls.
 ''Look at the lost opportunity with Yahoo and Microsoft,'' said Professor Sonnenfeld about the decision by Yahoo's board to originally block Microsoft's offer, a decision that probably lost Yahoo shareholders billions.
 Professor Kaplan argues that both boards and shareholders will always make mistakes, but that when shareholders are in charge, ''Net-net, the shareholder wins.''
 And he may have a point: While Cadbury's fate may now be in the hands of fast-money arbitrageurs, ''some long-term investor had to make the decision to sell.'' And selling is in itself a vote on the long-term future of the company.
 Democracy is indeed messy.

HEADLINE: A Racial Divide Is Bridged by Hard Times

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: McDONOUGH, Ga. 

 BODY:
During the housing boom, Henry County, a suburb of Atlanta, had its share of racial tension as more and more blacks joined the tens of thousands of others pouring in, creating a standoffish gap between the newcomers and the county's oldtimers. 
 But the recession has begun to erase those differences.
 Blacks and whites have encountered one another in increasing numbers recently in the crowded waiting rooms of the welfare office and at the food pantry, where many of both races have ventured for the first time. Struggling black-owned businesses are attracting the attention of white patrons. Neighbors are commiserating across racial lines.
 At the Division of Family and Children Services, Keasha Taylor, 36 and black, helped explain the system recently to a white mother. Ms. Taylor, who was there because her family had been evicted, told the mother, who was in line for food stamps, that a child with acute asthma might be eligible for Social Security. 
 ''Right now, a lot of white people are in this situation,'' Ms. Taylor said, recalling the conversation later. ''We're already used to poverty; they're really not.''
 Denese Rodgers, the county director of social services, who is white, has held several lunch meetings at A J's Turkey Grill, owned by Diane Walker, a black woman, in hopes of helping business. 
 ''It was in one of our abandoned strip malls, a forlorn looking kind of place, but when you walk in, it's just pristine,'' Ms. Rodgers said. ''She's doing everything right, it's just not full.''
 Peggy Allgood, a 54-year-old black woman who lost her job and four-bedroom house and is now living in a trailer park, said she had noticed the recession obliterating racial differences up and down the economic scale. 
 ''It's gotten to the point where everyone I talk to, their hours have been cut, their jobs have been cut,'' Ms. Allgood said. ''My neighbor, she's white, she's trying to find a job. She hasn't had any luck.''
 The recession hit Henry County, for years one of the nation's fastest growing areas, at a time when it was already struggling to come to terms with startling demographic change. In 1990, the county was almost 90 percent white. Now, as its population has more than tripled to 192,000, according to 2008 census estimates, the white percentage of the population has shrunk to 60 percent. 
 The county's elected government is still all white and Republican, and some leaders and newcomers alike have tried in various ways to make local board and governments more diverse. But nothing else has worked to remove barriers as quickly as economic hardship. 
 ''There used to be a lot of racial tension here, but everybody knows that we need each other to survive this recession,'' said Eugene Edwards, the president of the Henry County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''People now, they seem to be starting to care for one another.''
 Once fueled by construction, the county has been left by the recession with a blighted crop of abandoned white utility hookups, meant for new subdivisions, sprouted in the woods. 
 Last year, the Chamber of Commerce took a multiracial group of leaders to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, but such officially sponsored efforts at bonding have slowed. 
 ''The recession has pretty much tied folks down to survival mode,'' said Steve Cash, the executive director of the Henry Council for Quality Growth, who is white. ''A lot of things that were happening before aren't happening now.''
 And a lot of things that were unheard of before are happening now. Women in Jaguars pull up to the local food pantry, and former millionaires hunker down in grand, unsellable homes.
 One reason blacks have not gained more political power is that they are not heavily concentrated in any single area in the county -- the cul-de-sacs carved out of farmland and pastures in the last decade became racially mixed enclaves for the upwardly mobile. Now, the foreclosure notices and uncut lawns in those same subdivisions reinforce the notion that everyone is in the same sinking boat.
 Statistics also suggest that the recession's burden is falling with similar force on both races. In June 2006, 55 percent of the families receiving food stamps were black, and 44 percent were white. Those percentages remain the same today, although the size of each group has increased by about 50 percent.
 Unemployment claims follow that pattern: in January 2008, 49 percent of those who filed for unemployment were white, and 45 percent were black. In August 2009, 49 percent were white, and 48 percent were black.
 Across the country, there have been many reports about the recession's racial divide, as blacks have lost their jobs and houses at far higher rates than whites. But Henry County, about a 30-minute drive south of downtown Atlanta, has a very different profile from the rest of the nation. In Henry, the median income of black families, $56,715 in 2008, approaches that of whites, $69,728 (nationally, the average income gap was $20,000). Blacks in Henry County, many of whom are retirees from the North or professionals who work in Atlanta, are more likely than whites to have a college degree.
 That does not mean that Henry County is a perfect laboratory of equality. Blacks made up a disproportionately high number of those seeking government assistance both before and after the slowdown. Since 2006, the number of blacks on Medicaid has more than tripled, outpacing the increase among whites. 
 And as in the rest of the country, blacks in Henry were more than twice as likely as whites to take out risky sub-prime mortgages, meaning more black families than white are struggling to keep their homes.
 Keith and Kenya Rucker, who are black, recently declared bankruptcy in an effort to keep the home they bought for $155,000 with an adjustable-rate mortgage when they had two incomes, before Mr. Rucker lost his job as a restaurant manager. Both said they could not rely on family members for help with their ballooning payments. 
 ''I'm not racist, but it's harder for black men,'' Mr. Rucker said, as his wife huddled with their 8-year-old daughter, KeUnica. Mr. Rucker, who is from Orlando, Fla., echoed many experts who say that middle-class blacks have fewer resources, either financial or social, to fall back on if they get into trouble. ''Where I'm from,'' he said, ''every friend that I had is a drug dealer, locked up, on drugs or dead.''
 But Dennis and Jenny Duncan, a white couple who once owned millions of dollars in real estate assets as former developers, felt equally stymied. Interviewed in the lavish home they built for themselves, they said the sheriff had just come to call and told them their belongings would soon be seized to satisfy debts. Unlike Ms. Rucker, neither has a college degree, making work difficult to find. 
 The idea that the recession is an equalizer has become accepted in Henry County. Both black and white residents were hesitant to say that either race had taken a greater hit. But Ms. Taylor, the black woman who dispensed advice at the county food stamp office, said there were some notable distinctions between blacks and whites.
 ''They're a little weaker than we are at handling things like this,'' she said, adding without rancor, ''but I know they get more sympathy than we do.''

HEADLINE: Their Future Is Ours

 BODY:
There are 16 million children in immigrant families in the United States, one of the fastest-growing segments of the population. It's an old American story made new in the age of globalization, when waves of human displacement in recent decades have led to immigration on a scale not seen since Ellis Island. But a country that has been so good for so long at integrating new Americans is stumbling under the challenge. 
 That is the conclusion of Professors Marcelo and Carola Suarez-Orozco, fellows at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and co-directors of immigration studies at New York University. They have done basic research in immigration for more than 20 years, five of them studying 400 children from China, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Central America and Mexico.
 The results of their research, released this month, show the stark effects of what Marcelo Suarez-Orozco calls ''the age of global vertigo.'' Dislocation breeds a host of difficulties, starting with family separation. Nearly half of the children in their sample had at some point lost contact with one or both parents, either through migration directly or through divorce or death. The absent parent was most often the father for long stretches or permanently. For 49 percent of the Central American children, separations lasted more than five years.
 The children from separated families were, perhaps unsurprising, more likely to show signs of depression. Those symptoms were often accompanied by poverty, isolation and -- despite an early period of hopefulness and engagement -- a downward academic slide. Immigrant children lagged in mastering standard academic English, the passport to college and to brighter futures. Whereas native-born children's language skills follow a bell curve, immigrants' children were crowded in the lower ranks: More than three-quarters of the sample scored below the 85th percentile in English proficiency.
 There is clearly a need for policies and programs to support immigrant parents and children, but the reality is as haphazard and tenuous as these children's lives often are. Millions are growing up in mixed families, with some members here illegally, others not. Bills to help immigrant families with a path to legalization have died repeatedly in Congress, and small-scale reforms like the Dream Act, a path to college or the military for children of illegal immigrants have been stymied for years. New investments in language education, citizenship preparation and after-school and preschool programs have been derailed by economic crisis, harsh immigration politics and a general lack of attention.
 This is the great challenge that is forgotten in the heat of the immigration debate. The children of immigrants are Americans. ''They'' are ''us,'' a cohort of newcomers who will be filling the demographic void left as the baby boomers start fading away. Their future is our country's future. The job of integrating them is not only unfinished but in many critical ways has hardly begun.

HEADLINE: BIG TIME, TOUGH TIMES

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
New York's state university system is among the largest in the country, but it has never been known for athletic prominence, unlike major public institutions in states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
 SUNY officials aimed to change that in 1986, when the trustees lifted a ban on athletic scholarships and cleared the way for the system's four research universities -- Buffalo, Stony Brook, Albany and Binghamton -- to upgrade their sports programs.
 Buffalo led the way to Division I in 1991, ending New York's distinction as the only state system in the country, other than Alaska's, not competing at the highest level of intercollegiate sports. Since then, tens of millions of dollars have been invested toward the effort by New York State and the institutions themselves. Yet nearly two decades after the migration started, there is no clear consensus as to whether this project is an all-around success. 
 Certain SUNY teams have risen on a national stage -- Buffalo's football team played in a bowl game for the first time in January, and Albany and Binghamton have qualified for the exclusive and lucrative N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. But there have also been public embarrassments along the way, none more glaring than at Binghamton, which is facing an athletics scandal that has drawn national headlines. The university is under investigation by the state's former chief justice.
 Now, with the university system facing a proposed $90 million cut in state financing, some are questioning whether the emphasis on athletics is misguided. Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera, a Democrat from the Bronx, said state money should not be spent on building athletic powerhouses.
 ''That's not the purpose of a SUNY school,'' he said. ''The purpose of a SUNY school is to provide the best education possible.''
 Those who defend the move to Division I say that the benefits of high-profile sports programs, like other aspects of higher education, are difficult to measure. 
 ''I suppose you can say that the universities are all looking toward intangible goals in terms of student education,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, who helped bring Division I sports to Stony Brook as its president from 1994 until her retirement this year. ''There's very little way to measure it, unless you're going to wait 40 years.''
 Even if the benefits are not easy to assess, they are real to Warde Manuel, the Buffalo athletic director, who arrived at the university in 2005. Manuel had left a job as an associate athletic director at Michigan and said he was stunned to see more Buffalo students wearing Michigan, Syracuse and Notre Dame sweatshirts than their own school colors. ''There was a sense of apathy, a sense of 'we can't win,' '' he said.
 Since then, Manuel said, the change has been palpable. Even though Buffalo's football team is 3-7 this season, its International Bowl appearance has generated enthusiasm on campus. ''I think now there's an expectation that we will win,'' he said. 
 The scandal at Binghamton highlights the way intangible sports benefits so sought after by university administrators -- like increased visibility and buzz -- can backfire. The university is facing an investigation by the State University of New York into accusations that it bent its academic standards to build a competitive men's basketball team. Three of the team's players have been arrested in the past three years, including one in September on charges of selling crack cocaine. This fall, six players were dismissed from the team. The athletic director has resigned, the basketball coach has been placed on paid leave, and university administrators have been accused of retaliating against an instructor who said she was pressured to show grading favoritism to athletes.
 Binghamton's president, Lois B. DeFleur, declined to comment on the investigation but said that over all, the move to Division I had enhanced the university's ties to its students as well as to the surrounding community. ''The bulk of the people put a terrible event in perspective with the overall university and its other programs and what's going on,'' she said. 
 The adjustment has been painful at the other universities as well. In 1999, the N.C.A.A. placed Buffalo's men's basketball team on probation for recruiting violations. The N.C.A.A. has also cited Buffalo's football team for the players' poor academic performance. In 2006, three Albany football players were arrested on charges of raping a fellow student and were dismissed from the university. And in 2005, the N.C.A.A. placed Stony Brook on three years' probation for a series of minor violations involving more than 50 athletes. The N.C.A.A. cited the university for a ''lack of institutional control,'' removed 12 1/2 scholarships for two years, and said Stony Brook had been ''ill-equipped'' to handle the transition. 
 Supporters of SUNY's move to Division I caution patience, noting that building a successful athletics tradition takes time.
 ''What you're seeing is typical growing pains,'' said Patrick Nero, commissioner of the America East Conference, to which Albany, Binghamton and Stony Brook belong. He declined to comment on the Binghamton investigation, but said of SUNY's transition to Division I, ''I really do believe that in 10 to 20 years, I think time will show that they will be successful programs.'' 
 The transition to high-level athletics began in the 1980s, when administrators at Buffalo were looking to raise visibility and establish a rallying point for the university, which had a sprawling campus and a large number of commuter students. Buffalo and the other state universities, which range from 15,000 to 30,000 students, were large research institutions, yet they competed against small, private colleges. SUNY's 12 smaller four-year colleges with athletic teams continue to play in Division III.
 ''At Division III, we were playing institutions that simply were not of our type,'' recalled William R. Greiner, who served as Buffalo's president from 1991 until 2004. ''It was simply a peculiarity, our athletics program.''
 Buffalo entered Division I in 1991 and in 1999 moved to the top N.C.A.A. division, I-A, now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision. The same year, Stony Brook and Albany joined Division I-AA, now known as the Football Championship Subdivision. Binghamton was the final university to upgrade its program, moving to Division I in 2001. Unlike the other three universities, it has no football team. 
 Because universities changed the way they report athletic finances in 2003, it is difficult to compare spending over time. But athletic spending at the four universities has increased over the last few years, according to annual financial data reported to the N.C.A.A. 
 Binghamton's operating expenses increased 79 percent from 2003-4 to 2007-8, to $17.73 million. The increase was similar at Albany, where expenditures rose to $13.34 million from $7.49 million over the same period. Stony Brook's spending increased 87 percent, to $22.07 million from $11.80 million. And Buffalo, which has been in Division I the longest, increased spending by 22 percent, to $21.85 million from $17.86 million.
 While ticket sales, student fees, private donations and other revenues help pay for athletics, the universities' contribution has grown in recent years. At Albany, the university subsidy to athletics increased 77 percent, to $6.7 million in 2007-8 from $3.8 million in 2003-4. During the same period, Binghamton's contribution rose 47 percent, to $3.1 million from $2.1 million. Buffalo contributed $7.5 million to athletics in 2007-8, a 31 percent increase over 2003-4, when it provided $5.7 million. 
 Stony Brook calculates its contribution differently than the other SUNY members, but officials said its subsidy totaled $8.5 million in 2007-8, a 119 percent increase over the $3.9 million contributed in 2003-4. The large increase was a result of a one-time payment by the university to relieve the athletic department of its debts in 2007-8, officials said.
 Two of the universities have benefited from connections to powerful state senators. In 2002, Stony Brook completed construction on a football stadium that is named for State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, the former chairman of the chamber's higher education committee, who helped procure the $22 million in state money used to build it. The Binghamton University Events Center, an all-purpose arena where the Bearcats play basketball, opened in 2004 and cost the state $33 million. The financing was secured with the help of a local senator, Thomas W. Libous. 
 Tangible results of the moves have been hard to quantify. Applications to Albany, which played in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament in 2006 and 2007, have increased by 21 percent since 2006, but applications to the other three universities also rose during that period.
 At Stony Brook, Jim Fiore, the athletic director, said the upgraded sports program contributed to changes that include a 93 percent increase in applications and a jump in test scores of the freshman class since 1999. 
 But some university officials and experts in intercollegiate athletics cautioned against drawing too many conclusions, noting that several factors affect statistics like applications and enrollment. 
 At a public university, application and enrollment rates are often a function of the economy as families opt for lower tuition in a recession. And several economic studies over the past decade -- including some commissioned by the N.C.A.A. -- have shown little or no link between investing in big-time athletics and success in other areas.
 Jonathan Orszag, an economist who has evaluated for the N.C.A.A. the financial impact of moving to Division I, said that if the intangible benefits were significant enough, ''you should expect some of that to be reflected in the financial data.'' An increase in school spirit or heightened visibility should translate to higher application rates, for example. ''And during the period that we're studying, we didn't observe it,'' he said.
 This investment in athletics comes at a difficult time for the SUNY system, which has weathered $334 million in budget cuts since 2008 and is facing an additional $90 million reduction proposed by Gov. David A. Paterson. Athletic directors at the universities said they had not been immune to budget cuts and had taken measures to reduce costs, like not filling open positions. 
 University officials also noted that athletic spending makes up a relatively small proportion of the universities' overall budgets -- no more than 5 percent in 2007-8. 
 ''We've had a lot of success in a short period of time,'' said Lee McElroy, the Albany athletic director. McElroy said he was not looking to make Albany into the next Ohio State or U.C.L.A., adding, ''The goal is to operate our program within the confines of our resources, and to do it with the same mission and the same plan and the same purpose that we've always done.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 20, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the upgrading of sports programs in the State University of New York system omitted two state university systems that did not have athletics programs in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the 1980s. Besides Alaska and New York, North Dakota and South Dakota also did not have any state universities or colleges in Division I during that period. The article also misstated the title once held by the person who is investigating the Binghamton University sports program. Judith S. Kaye, who was not identified by name in the article, was New York State's former chief judge; there is no ''chief justice'' in New York.

HEADLINE: After Microsoft, Bringing a High-Tech Eye to Professional Kitchens

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

DATELINE: BELLEVUE, Wash. 

 BODY:
Inside a nondescript warehouse on a nondescript street of this Seattle suburb is a research laboratory that looks like it came out of a James Bond movie -- had Q the gadget master been a gastronome. 
 Here Nathan Myhrvold, a former chief technology officer at Microsoft, and his company, Intellectual Ventures, pursue an eclectic array of speculative and potentially world-changing ideas -- inventing a new battery, taming hurricanes, defeating disease. And here, along with the laser designed to shoot mosquitoes out of the air (a high-speed camera counts the rate of wing-flapping to ensure that innocent insects are not vaporized), is the best-equipped restaurant kitchen anywhere that never serves any customers. 
 Dr. Myhrvold exuded a Willy Wonka enthusiasm as he talked of the foods that came out of his industrial food dehydrator. ''Raw lobster tail, freeze dried, is amazing,'' he said. 
 At another machine, rose petals spun inside a glass globe. ''This is basically a still,'' he said. ''You could crank the temperature up and distill alcohol. What we're trying to do here is get an essence of rose petals.'' 
 The yield would be a few fragrant tablespoons of liquid.
 Around the corner, he pointed to two machines side by side. ''Here's our ice cream machine, and here's our ultrasonic welder,'' he said.
 Had he used the welder as a cooking appliance? ''Not yet,'' he said, earnestly,'' but we're going to try it out.''
 After all, an autoclave designed to sterilize lab equipment has proven culinarily productive -- ''It's basically the pressure cooker from hell,'' Dr. Myhrvold said -- as has a 100-ton hydraulic press, for beef jerky. 
 All of this high-tech kitchen tinkering feeds another of Dr. Myhrvold's projects: a cookbook. 
 The book, still untitled, intends to be the authoritative reference for chefs wishing to employ so-called molecular gastronomy -- adapting food industry technologies to restaurant cooking. 
 Dr. Myhrvold, who once presided over Microsoft Windows, did not undertake this endeavor as a lonely intellectual pursuit. He hired 15 people, including 5 professional chefs, a photographer, an art director and writers and editors, to create it. They included Christopher Young, a biochemistry-graduate-student-turned-chef who headed the research kitchen at the Fat Duck near London, one of the most innovative restaurants in the world.
 Dr. Myhrvold has long pursued a Renaissance man portfolio of interests. While still at Microsoft, he showed that sauropod dinosaurs might have been able to accelerate the tips of their tails to supersonic speeds, like cracking a whip. More recently, he has been proselytizing among paleontologists, urging them to hunt for fossilized dinosaur vomit. Owls and some other birds of prey regurgitate the bones of what they eat, and Dr. Myhrvold surmises that dinosaurs, as the ancestors of birds, might have done the same thing.
 Every month or so, the cookbook team gathers in a conference room to review their progress. Dr. Myhrvold scans each page, points out glitches and sketches how he wants a chart to look.
 ''It's basically like a software project,'' Dr. Myhrvold said. ''It's very much like a review we would do at Microsoft.'' 
 The project has grown in size and scope. Originally planned as a 300-page discussion of sous vide, an increasingly popular restaurant technique of cooking food in vacuum-sealed bags in warm water baths, the book has swelled to 1,500 pages that will also cover microbiology, food safety, the physics of heat transfer on the stove and in the oven, formulas for turning fruit and vegetable juices into gels, and more.
 ''And they're big pages,'' Dr. Myhrvold said. 
 Because he is self-publishing the book, Dr. Myhrvold does not have to convince a publisher or anyone else that such a huge book aimed primarily at a narrow of audience of restaurant chefs makes economic sense. He said the book would be out in a year, although he admitted that was also what he said a year ago.
 ''There's not a chef on Earth who won't learn something from this,'' Dr. Myhrvold said. 
 At least some chefs are taking interest.
 ''I think there are parts of it that are definitely new to me,'' said Wylie Dufresne, the chef and owner of WD-50 in Manhattan, who visited the kitchen laboratory. ''It's a cookbook that's going to be in its own category.''
 In September, Dr. Myhrvold, Mr. Young and two of the other chefs gave a presentation at the StarChefs.com International Chefs Congress, an annual Manhattan trade show for restaurant professionals. 
 They demonstrated how to encrust a pork loin within what was essentially a large crispy pork rind, how to make stewed prunes look like coal and how to make a ''constructed cream'' -- breaking apart a fat and a liquid into tiny droplets and mixing them together into something that had the fluidity of heavy cream.
 ''For example, why not make a pistachio cream where, instead of milk fat, we use pistachio oil?'' Mr. Young said. ''If you can get the droplets small enough, if you can coat them in proteins, you can create a dairy-free pistachio gelato that's 100 percent pistachio oil.''
 They also demonstrated cryoseared duck breast, a technique that calls for implements not typically found in a kitchen: a small satchel of loose metal, dry ice, dog hair brush.
 ''We do have to perforate it to get the fat out,'' Mr. Young said. ''The easiest way is a stainless steel dog hair brush. It will poke a lot of little holes that aren't going to show up.'' 
 ''For God's sake,'' Dr. Myhrvold interjected, ''buy a new one for this.''
 The duck breast was placed skin down on the dry ice before being seared, weighed down by the satchel. The cold froze not only the skin, but also a thin layer of the meat next to the skin, which acted as a cold barrier to prevent overcooking. ''Until that melts, heat won't go above it,'' Mr. Young said.
 The result was a crispy skin while the meat remained tender and juicy.
 The book presents some concepts like wet bulb temperature that will be new to cooks of all skill levels. The usual temperature set in an oven is scientifically known as the dry bulb temperature. But for cooking, the wet bulb temperature, which is essentially a measure of the evaporation rate of water and depends on the humidity, is often more important.
 ''Nathan would make the point that food is water with a bunch of impurities in it,'' Mr. Young said.
 Dr. Myhrvold said the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures could sometimes differ by 30 degrees, which might be the difference between a souffle that rises and one that collapses. (One advantage of sous vide is that because the food is immersed in water, the wet and dry bulb temperatures are the same.) 
 In another discovery of culinary heat transfer physics, Dr. Myhrvold said the bulbous shape and black color of Weber grills were wrong. To achieve an even cooking temperature across the cooking grate, the inside of the grill should be vertical and shiny to reflect the heat.
 That can be fixed by adding an aluminum insert to the grill. ''So we have directions for that,'' Dr. Myhrvold said. 
 The conclusions have often been backed up by careful scientific exploration. For example, confit, the French technique of cooking slowly in fat, is supposed to impart a unique taste and texture as the fat penetrates the meat.
 But Dr. Myhrvold said: ''There's no way it could penetrate. The molecules are too big.''
 He said double-blindtaste tests proved that the same tasty results could be achieved by steaming and then rubbing some of the fat on the outside.

HEADLINE: The Nation Of Futurity

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
When European settlers first came to North America, they saw flocks of geese so big that it took them 30 minutes to all take flight and forests that seemed to stretch to infinity. They came to two conclusions: that God's plans for humanity could be completed here, and that they could get really rich in the process.
 This moral materialism fomented a certain sort of manic energy. Americans became famous for their energy and workaholism: for moving around, switching jobs, marrying and divorcing, creating new products and going off on righteous crusades. 
 It may seem like an ephemeral thing, but this eschatological faith in the future has motivated generations of Americans, just as religious faith motivates a missionary. Pioneers and immigrants endured hardship in the present because of their confidence in future plenty. Entrepreneurs start up companies with an exaggerated sense of their chances of success. The faith is the molten core of the country's dynamism.
 There are also periodic crises of faith. Today, the rise of China is producing such a crisis. It is not only China's economic growth rate that produces this anxiety. The deeper issue is spiritual. The Chinese, though members of a famously old civilization, seem to possess some of the vigor that once defined the U.S. The Chinese are now an astonishingly optimistic people. Eighty-six percent of Chinese believe their country is headed in the right direction, compared with 37 percent of Americans.
 The Chinese now have lavish faith in their scientific and technological potential. Newsweek and Intel just reported the results of their Global Innovation Survey. Only 22 percent of the Chinese believe their country is an innovation leader now, but 63 percent are confident that their country will be the global technology leader within 30 years. The majority of the Chinese believe that China will produce the next society-changing innovation, while only a third of Americans believe the next breakthrough will happen here, according to the survey.
 The Cultural Revolution seems to have produced among the Chinese the same sort of manic drive that the pioneer and immigrant experiences produced among the Americans. The people who endured Mao's horror have seen the worst life has to offer and are now driven to build some secure footing. At the same time, they and their children seem inflamed by the experience of living through so much progress so quickly.
 ''Do you understand?'' one party official in Shanxi Province told James Fallows of The Atlantic, ''If it had not been for Deng Xiaoping, I would be behind an ox in a field right now. ... Do you understand how different this is? My mother has bound feet!''
 The anxiety in America is caused by the vague sense that they have what we're supposed to have. It's not the per capita income, which the Chinese may never have at our level. It's the sense of living with baubles just out of reach. It's the faith in the future, which is actually more important. 
 China, where President Obama is visiting, invites a certain sort of reverie. It is natural, looking over the construction cranes, to think about the flow of history over decades, not just day to day. And it becomes obvious by comparison just how far the U.S. has drifted from its normal future-centered orientation and how much this rankles. 
 The U.S. now has an economy shifted too much toward consumption, debt and imports and too little toward production, innovation and exports. It now has a mounting federal debt that creates present indulgence and future hardship.
 Americans could once be confident that their country would grow more productive because each generation was more skilled than the last. That's no longer true. The political system now groans to pass anything easy -- tax cuts and expanding health care coverage -- and is incapable of passing anything hard -- spending restraint, health care cost control.
 The standard thing these days is for Americans to scold each other for our profligacy, to urge fiscal Puritanism. But it's not clear Americans have ever really been self-disciplined. Instead, Americans probably postponed gratification because they thought the future was a big rock-candy mountain, and if they were stealing from that, they were robbing themselves of something stupendous.
 It would be nice if some leader could induce the country to salivate for the future again. That would mean connecting discrete policies -- education, technological innovation, funding for basic research -- into a single long-term narrative. It would mean creating regional strategies, because innovation happens in geographic clusters, not at the national level. It would mean finding ways to tamp down consumption and reward production. The most pragmatic guide for that remains Michael Porter's essay in the Oct. 30, 2008, issue of Business Week.
 As the financial crises ease, it would be nice if Americans would once again start looking to the horizon.

HEADLINE: Attacks Threaten Fragile Security Gains in Cradle of Iraq Insurgency

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: RAMADI, Iraq 

 BODY:
Maj. Gen. Tariq al-Youssef caught a fleeting glimpse of the man who wanted him dead.
 As his armored sport utility vehicle pulled past the battered yellow taxi, General Youssef, the commander of the police in Anbar Province, recalled thinking that the driver looked like so many men in this impoverished territory -- another poor peasant trying to eke out a living.
 Then the taxi driver crashed his car into the general's, detonating his explosives. 
 ''I was not sure if I was alive or dead,'' General Youssef recalled. ''Parts of the suicide bomber were scattered all around me.''
 The attack in June, from which General Youssef walked away unscathed, marked the beginning of what Iraqi and American officials say has been a concerted effort by Sunni insurgents to reassert themselves in a part of the country that was once their stronghold. 
 Early Monday morning, men dressed in Iraqi Army uniforms killed at least 13 people, including a local cleric. The victims were rousted from their homes in a village west of Baghdad. A doctor at Abu Ghraib Hospital, where the bodies were brought, said they all had gunshot wounds in the head.
 On Monday night, a series of bombs in Falluja struck the house of a police officer and an Iraqi Army patrol, wounding at least seven people.
 In recent weeks the targets of suicide bombers in Anbar have included a restaurant popular among the police in Falluja, where 16 people were killed; a police officer's funeral in Haditha, where 6 were killed; a water tanker in Ramadi that exploded, killing 7 police officers escorting the vehicle; and a national reconciliation meeting in Ramadi, where 26 were killed. 
 There have also been dozens of attacks on checkpoints and, in the last two months, assassinations of influential tribal leaders and the destruction of vital infrastructure. 
 ''In the last few months you have had an attempt by A.Q.I. to regain a foothold here,'' said Brig. Gen. Stephen R. Lanza, using the military's term for Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a largely homegrown Sunni militant group thought to have foreign support. 
 The level of violence is still greatly reduced from that in 2005, when the local police force collapsed, or 2007, when an increase in American troops began and tribal leaders banded together to fight -- or co-opt -- the militants. But this is a delicate moment in a region where militants once controlled the streets and were able to direct attacks into Baghdad. 
 With American forces in a period of transition, Iraqi politicians positioning themselves for the national elections, basic services still in shambles and rampant unemployment, Iraqi security officials say that Qaeda and other militants would like to exploit the moment and derail the fragile security gains.
 Anbar, the desert region west of Baghdad, has played a critical role since the American invasion.
 It is where the insurgency first rose, where Al Qaeda established a base to stage spectacular attacks that ignited the sectarian bloodletting and also where the tide of the war began to shift in America's favor as tribal leaders and former insurgents turned against Al Qaeda.
 Anbar borders Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as Syria, a country that the government accuses of aiding militants, and the province runs right up to the outskirts of Baghdad.
 The fact that Monday's attackers wore army uniforms raised a number of troubling questions, including the prospect of infiltration of the security forces or extrajudicial killings carried out by soldiers. Even if the attackers were merely posing as Iraqi soldiers, since uniforms can be easily bought in stores, the episode could further undermine the trust of the population. 
 ''We no longer trust the army after this incident,'' said Abdul Rahman, who saw the abductions and knew some of the men later found dead. ''If the army came to capture someone now, he would not go with them, fearing he would face the same destiny.''
 While Iraqi security forces work to thwart the militant networks, the American role here continues to evolve and diminish. Anbar is the first province in Iraq where American combat brigades have moved out completely.
 At the peak of the surge in troops to Iraq in 2007, about 20,000 Marines were in Anbar, working out of 10 large bases. There are now 3,500 troops spread across five bases, newly trained Americans whose role is to ''advise and assist'' Iraqi security forces. 
 But the Iraqis now rarely ask for assistance.
 When militants blew up a major bridge last month in Ramadi, less than a mile from the American base on the outskirts of the city, no American forces responded. Iraqis asked for assistance only days later and only regarding complicated forensic and engineering work, according to American officials.
 American officials noted the vast difference in the level of violence from two years ago and the increasing capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
 ''These attacks are designed to threaten the police,'' General Lanza said. ''But you do not see the institutions of the state falling apart.''
 Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha, one of Anbar's prominent leaders who helped mobilize a tribal rebellion against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia in 2007, said the chief aim of militants was not to reignite sectarian fighting.
 ''They want to attack for two main reasons,'' he said. ''They target the police because the police have achieved a victory over them. And the second major reason is because they want to keep investors out.''
 The most dangerous areas in Anbar are those just outside Baghdad, including the area where Monday's attack took place.
 One witness, who identified himself as Abu Ali, said he watched as some of the victims were taken from their homes.
 ''I saw men dressed in army uniforms going into houses and arresting people,'' he said. 
 There were conflicting reports as to whether some of those killed were former insurgents who had joined the effort to fight Al Qaeda or were still active members of a militant group known as the 1920 Revolutionary Brigades.
 On Monday, the village was locked down, with dozens of Iraqi Army vehicles cordoning off the area. Witnesses saw American military vehicles in the area as well.
 There were also attacks on Iraqi security forces in other parts of the country on Monday, including two bombings in Baghdad that killed five Iraqi Army soldiers and wounded a dozen more soldiers and civilians.
 In Kirkuk, an explosion in the middle of a crowded market killed 6 people and wounded 12 more.

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
The solicitations have been flooding people's mailboxes lately: pay a bit more on your electricity bill for 100 percent clean wind power. Or, the fliers say, buy ''green power certificates'' to offset your global warming emissions.
 Close to a million electricity customers have signed up for such payments voluntarily, and the amount of electricity sold in this way has nearly tripled since 2005, amid rising concern about climate change and energy security. But the participants are in a distinct minority, with a sign-up rate of only about 2 percent in programs run by utilities.
 The low sign-up rate raises a question: If large majorities of Americans favor increased government support for clean energy, as polls suggest, why are so many people reluctant to back such programs when it comes to paying extra themselves?
 One reason might be that they think the added expense is too high. Solar and wind power generally cost more than power generated with fossil fuels. While many people support alternative energy in principle, they personally may not want to spend hundreds of dollars more for electricity, especially in the current economic environment. 
 But in the back of some people's minds, there may be another issue: Do these programs really cause more renewable energy projects to get built? The government has looked at the question, and says it is difficult to draw an overall conclusion. Its experts say they believe that some green power programs work better than others. 
 ''It's a tricky issue. It's not a one-size-fits-all market,'' said Lori Bird, a senior analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado and co-author of a report in September on green power markets.
 At least one major program has come under fire from regulators. Last year, a Florida Power and Light green power program, called Sunshine Energy, was terminated by the state's Public Service Commission after an audit found that promised solar power facilities were far behind schedule. The program had more than 38,000 customers, and was once the sixth-largest in the country, according to the renewable energy laboratory.
 The audit also found that the vast majority of homeowners' payments went into marketing and administration.
 ''No reasonable person would have contributed to the Sunshine Energy program had they known that approximately 76.4 percent of the contributions would be spent on marketing and administrative expenses instead of renewable energy,'' wrote Nathan Skop, a commissioner on the Florida Public Service Commission, in a note accompanying the termination decision.
 Eric Silagy, the vice president of development for Florida Power and Light, said in an interview that the program had exceeded its renewable energy objectives. ''Yes, we spent money on educating the customers, but I don't know how you do it otherwise,'' he said.
 Over all, according to the national laboratory report, a median of 19 percent of the money that utilities are raising in these voluntary programs goes into promotion and marketing, with the numbers for smaller utilities often being much higher.
 About a quarter of the country's utilities offer green power programs, and the way they are structured varies. In practice, no big utility delivers 100 percent renewable power to any customer, since electricity from all sources -- coal plants, wind farms, solar panels -- is mingled in the same wires. The utilities are essentially collecting extra money that they promise to use to support the development of renewable energy, a pitch that some customers find persuasive.
 ''It's about what's good for the planet,'' said Mark Renfrow, a Dallas homeowner who this summer began paying an extra $26 or so a month to his electric company, Direct Energy, for 100 percent wind power.
 Typically, the extra payments reach the operators of wind or solar farms through the buying and selling of renewable energy certificates. Many wind and solar farms offer such certificates, which are meant to attach a cash value to the environmental benefits associated with renewable power.
 For example, the green power arm of a utility like Con Edison, of New York, might sell green power to its customers, then buy certificates for that amount of power on the open market. Green power advocates argue that such payments help new facilities get built, though they acknowledge that other factors, like bank financing, may play more important roles.
 Paul Copleman, a spokesman for Iberdrola Renewables, a major developer, called the system of voluntary payments ''an essential component of wind farm financing,'' although he said that no particular Iberdrola project had been built just to supply the voluntary demand.
 ''We don't set out early in the development process determined to build a project to supply the voluntary market specifically,'' Mr. Copleman said in an e-mail message. ''But its presence provides flexibility and helps improve project economics.''
 Rob Harmon, the chief innovation officer for the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, a nonprofit Oregon group that directs voluntary payments toward solar and wind farms, said that projects he worked withtypically increased their revenue by about 17 percent throughvoluntary payments, an amount that he says can bump up profit margins enough to make the difference in whether a project should go forward. ''This market is working, it's thriving, it's good and it should be embraced,'' Mr. Harmon said.
 But some advocates for electricity consumers argue that the payments make little difference. Matthew Freedman, a staff lawyer with the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group in California, said the short-term nature of voluntary green power commitments meant that they were often meaningless on long-term projects like new wind or solar farms.
 ''There is very little evidence to suggest that customer subscriptions have resulted in any new additions of renewable power,'' Mr. Freedman said.
 The utility for the city of Palo Alto, Calif., has the largest percentage of enrollments in the country, with 21 percent of customers participating, according to the government laboratory study.
 But for many other groups, even green-minded ones, the higher price of clean electricity has caused soul-searching and hesitation. Early this year, the city government of Durango, Colo., stopped buying renewable power from its utility, saving $45,000 a year. The clean electricity had cost 40 percent extra -- and the city manager, Ron LeBlanc, was irked that part of the payment went into putting solar panels on a school in a different city.
 ''Paying more and then investing in a community 16 miles away was offensive to a lot of us,'' he said, adding that Durango was exploring other options to develop clean energy locally.
 In Texas, Austin Energy sells the most green power of any utility in the country, buying electricity from wind farms in west Texas. But its customers' appetite for renewable power has shrunk with higher prices. 
 Earlier this year, it managed to sell only 1 percent of a batch of wind power it offered to customers -- no doubt because the program would have added $58 a month to the average home electric bill. That was far more than in previous years, resulting from a combination of factors, like congestion of transmission lines in Texas.
 The utility has since slashed the prices, and Roger Duncan, its general manager, said that Austin Energy might change its program so that its green power costs for future projects are spread to all customers -- not just the few who voluntarily pay extra.
 ''If we're going to transition to renewable energy,'' Mr. Duncan said, ''you can't depend on a small percentof the customer base to do this.''

HEADLINE: What the Future May Hold

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
What will the United States be like in 20 years when today's toddlers are in college or trying to land that first job or maybe thinking about starting a family?
 The answer will depend to a great extent on decisions we make now about the American infrastructure.
 This came to mind as I was reading about yet another closure of the problem-plagued San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which is more than 70 years old. In 20 years, will today's toddlers be traveling on bridges and roads that are in even worse shape than today's? Will they endure mammoth traffic jams that start earlier and end later? Will their water supplies be clean and safe? Will the promise of clean energy visionaries be realized, or will we still be fouling the environment with carbon filth to the benefit of traditional energy conglomerates and foreign regimes that in many cases wish us anything but good? 
 The answers to these and many other related questions will depend to a great extent on decisions we make now (even in the midst of very tough economic times) about the American infrastructure. We're trundling along in the infrastructure equivalent of a jalopy, with bridges rotting and falling down, while other nations, our competitors in the global economy, are building efficient, high-speed, high-performance infrastructure platforms to power their 21st-century economies.
 We used to be so much smarter about this stuff. A recent publication from the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution reminds us that:
 ''Since the beginning of our republic, transportation and infrastructure have played a central role in advancing the American economy -- from the canals of upstate New York to the railroads that linked the heartland to industrial centers and finally the interstate highway system that ultimately connected all regions of the nation.
 ''In each of those periods, there was a sharp focus on how infrastructure investments could be used as catalysts for economic expansion and evolution.''
 Policy makers all but gave up on that kind of thinking years ago. America's infrastructure, once the finest in the world, has been neglected for decades, and it shows. Felix Rohatyn's book on the subject, ''Bold Endeavors,'' opens with: ''The nation is falling apart -- literally.''
 It's almost as if we no longer understand the crucial links between infrastructure and the health of the American economy, the state of the environment and the viability of the nation as a whole. We've become stupid about this.
 Consider transportation. As Brookings tells us, ''Other nations around the globe have continued to act on the calculus that state-of-the art transportation infrastructure -- the connective tissue of a nation -- is critical to moving goods, ideas and workers quickly and efficiently. In the United States, however, we seem to have forgotten.''
 Much of the nation's rail infrastructure is approaching the tail end of its useful life. If you've flown anywhere recently, you know what a nightmare that can be.
 To the extent that we have any infrastructure policy at all, it is badly disjointed, dysfunctional, often doing more harm than good as it serves the interests of politicians who are crazy for pork rather than the real needs of the American public.
 Brookings' studies of American infrastructure policy have been extensive, and a conversation last week with one of its executives, Bruce Katz, offered a glimpse of the kind of economic environment today's toddlers could face in a couple of decades if we started getting things right now. 
 ''We'll very likely have a low-carbon-based economy,'' said Mr. Katz, ''which will require enormous innovation with regard to energy and the infrastructure. We'll be much more export-oriented than we are today, less consumption-focused.'' And as a nation, he said, we should have a better understanding of the importance of the metropolitan areas that are the major drivers of the U.S. economy, and how essential it is to give them the coordinated national support that they need on infrastructure and other forms of development.
 You can't thrive as a nation while New Orleans is drowning, and Detroit is being beaten into oblivion decade after decade, and a bridge in Minneapolis is collapsing into the Mississippi River, and cities in upstate New York and the Rust Belt are rotting from lack of employment opportunities, and so on.
 Imagine, instead, an America with rebuilt, healthy, dynamic metropolitan areas, and gleaming new port facilities, and networks of high-speed rail, an America with electric vehicles and a smart grid and energy generated by the power of the sun and wind and water and the ocean's waves. Imagine if the children of today's toddlers had access to world-class public schools all across the nation and a higher education system that is both first-rate and affordable.
 Imagine if we set out seriously to do all this.
 Imagine.

HEADLINE: A Dental Shift: Implants Instead of Bridges

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
If I have one serious regret about my age, it is that my permanent teeth developed before New York, my hometown, got fluoridated water. I first lost a permanent molar to decay in my early 20s, and the resulting bridge has had to be replaced several times in subsequent decades, ultimately as a four-part apparatus. 
 Now that has to go as well. Because I could not floss and clean properly under the bridge and between the supporting crowns, I developed a severe periodontal infection. 
 Dr. Michael Zidile, the young periodontist I consulted, took one look at my mouth and said: ''This is not how we do restorations nowadays. A bridge is not a permanent solution and makes it too hard for most people to keep their gums and underlying bone healthy. Now we do implants and individual crowns where needed.'' 
 More out of curiosity than distrust -- and before I invested thousands of dollars and countless hours on new teeth -- I did my own homework and got a second opinion. Dr. Zidile, I learned, is correct. In an overwhelming majority of cases, implants to replace lost teeth are by far the best long-term solution for maintaining a healthy mouth. Also, because they rarely need to be replaced, in the long run they are more economical than bridges. 
 A Growing Option
 Implants for replacing lost teeth have come a long way in the 25 years since I last wrote about them in this column. Better materials, procedures and professional experience result in far fewer problems than occurred in the early years of implants.
 Critical to their success, however, is proper selection of both patients and practitioners -- and, after the implant, a commitment to good oral hygiene. Dental implants must be treated like natural teeth: kept clean and free of plaque through proper brushing, flossing and periodic professional cleanings.
 ''Bridges are not the standard of care anymore,'' Dr. Lawrence J. Kessler, a periodontist and associate professor of surgery at the University of Miami School of Medicine, told me in an interview. ''For most people who lose teeth, implants are the treatment of choice.''
 Implants do not decay, and adjacent healthy teeth do not require crowns to support them. And because it is easy to clean and floss between implants, the gum tissue and underlying bone are more likely to remain healthy.
 With a bridge, if one of the supporting crowned teeth breaks or develops decay or nerve damage, the bridge and its three or more crowns must be removed and replaced. 
 Implants can replace individual lost teeth or many teeth in a row. For those who have lost most of their teeth, implants can be used to anchor a full or partial denture. About half a million implants are placed each year in this country. 
 On average, the total cost of an implant to replace a single tooth is $3,500 to $4,000 (more if other procedures are required), or about one-third more than the cost of a bridge. But while bridges have an average life span of 10 years, an implant can last a lifetime.
 Many insurance companies now cover implants, but most people do not have dental insurance and must pay out of pocket. If cost is an issue, consider treatment at a dental college, where implants may be available at reduced rates as part of the teaching process.
 Not a Quick Procedure
 The basic technique involves surgically inserting a titanium screw -- the implant -- into the supporting bone, which can be done under local anesthesia in less than an hour, and attaching a small fake tooth called an abutment, followed by a crown. The resulting tooth looks and feels like a natural one.
 The procedure is a lengthy one. Unlike a bridge, which can be completed in two weeks, implants usually take about eight weeks for the screw to become firmly attached to bone before the final crown can be placed. ''A patient's health, not age, determines suitability for an implant,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''I just did implants for a 93-year-old who needed them to fit a partial denture. I put 2 implants in a man when he was 85 and 5 more when he was 88, with no problems either time.
 ''If cases are chosen well, implants are very successful -- 96 to 97 percent successful. And they rarely fail down the road.''
 A most important element is having enough bone in the jaw to support the implant, although in some cases bone cells removed during drilling for the implant or taken from elsewhere in the mouth can be used to fill in gaps. 
 ''If someone has diabetes or is a smoker,'' Dr. Kessler said, ''the chances of success are reduced because a poorer blood supply diminishes the fusion of bone cells to the implant.''
 Also important is healthy gum tissue, free of periodontal disease. Before I could undergo an implant procedure, I had to have periodontal treatment to get rid of the plaque, tartar and infection on the tooth roots and gum tissue around my bridge and supporting crowns. 
 In some cases when a tooth must be pulled, an implant can be placed right after the extraction, with the advantage of limiting bone loss in the area. When bone is not being stimulated, it tends to break down. I consider myself lucky that although I've had this troublesome bridge for many decades, my underlying bone has remained healthy enough to support an implant. 
 Choosing a Doctor
 Just as any physician can legally perform surgery, any dentist can legally do implants. Be sure to choose someone thoroughly trained in the technique. Taking a weekend course in implantology is rarely adequate. There are risks involved in placing implants, including damage to a nerve or sinus cavity, which are magnified when the practitioner lacks adequate training.
 Implants were once done mainly by oral and maxillofacial surgeons, most of whom operated independently of dentists. Now at least as many implants are placed by periodontists who are schooled in the technique and who coordinate their work closely with the patient's dentist. Ideally, the periodontist should be board-certified. 
 Just as you might ask for referrals for a prospective nanny or house cleaner, consider asking to speak with other patients of the practitioner before deciding to proceed with an implant. Though every case is different, at the least you can determine how well you are likely to be cared for.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Help Spur 1.4% Increase in U.S. Retail Sales

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Retail sales in the United States increased by a higher-than-expected 1.4 percent in October from September, helped by a strong demand for cars, the government said Monday. 
 Prices, however, were 1.7 percent below October a year ago.
 The data gave hope to the idea that consumers might begin spending again even in the absence of government incentives like the cash-for-clunkers program. But the numbers were also high because the Commerce Department substantially revised downward its September data. It said sales were down 2.3 percent in September, not the 1.5 percent it had originally estimated.
 The increases came in large part because of automobile sales, which climbed 7.4 percent. In September, after the government ended its clunkers program, auto sales fell 14.3 percent. When auto sales were excluded from the numbers, the overall rise was 0.2 percent, which was lower than expectations.
 Auto sales were higher than a year ago.
 Consumers spent more in October at restaurants and bars (up 1.2 percent) and on Internet and mail orders (up 1 percent) than in the previous month. But sales of home furnishings fell, with furniture down 0.8 percent and building and garden supplies down 2.4 percent.
 In a related report, the Commerce Department said on Monday that businesses continued to reduce inventories in September.
 The department said that business inventories declined 0.4 percent in September, slightly less than the 0.7 percent drop that had been forecast. The August decline was 1.6 percent.
 Ian Morris, head of United States economics at HSBC, said the numbers suggested that the consumption was on track to grow by 1.5 to 2 percent in the last part of the year. 
 ''We get an overall picture of reasonable growth and little, if any, inflation,'' he wrote in a research note on Monday.
 Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell all types of goods, from butter to television sets. A revival in sales is considered crucial to nursing the economy back to health because consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the nation's economy.
 Economists worry that high unemployment will slow the economic recovery as consumers keep a lid on spending, even as the government continues to inject billions into the economy. The unemployment rate reached 10.2 percent in October, the highest in 26 years. 
 As the holiday season approaches, analysts are combing retail sales data for signs of how busy stores will be in the coming months. An earlier report on October sales at department stores showed gains at high-end retailers like Nordstrom.
 Meanwhile, a report on the state of manufacturing in New York State released Monday showed that factory activity slowed in November.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State index of general business conditions fell to 23.51 in November, after hitting a five-year high of 34.57 in October. Economists had predicted that the index would reach 30 for the month.

HEADLINE: Continuing Unemployment Is Predicted By Fed Chief

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned on Monday that high unemployment and a continued reluctance by banks to make loans were likely to slow the economic recovery for the next year.
 And in a departure from the usual practice of Fed chairmen, Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure global investors about the recent fall in the value of the dollar by saying that the central bank was ''attentive to the implications of changes'' and would ''continue to monitor these developments closely.''
 It is rare for Fed officials to comment on exchange rates, which for decades have been the responsibility of the Treasury Department. Mr. Bernanke's message seemed to be that the Fed saw no cause for alarm in the dollar's weakness and that it would not need to bolster the dollar by raising interest rates sooner than it would otherwise. 
 Taken together, the Fed chairman's comments highlighted the conflicting goals that Fed officials may have to balance. To nurture the slow recovery and bolster employment, the central bank has vowed to keep interest rates low for ''an extended period,'' but to prevent a precipitous drop in the value of the dollar, which could stoke inflation, the Fed would have to raise interest rates.
 In an otherwise gloomy speech to the Economic Club of New York, a group packed with financial executives, Mr. Bernanke played down fears that the recent jump in economic growth -- to 3.5 percent in the third quarter after four quarters of contraction -- would be likely to sputter out as stimulus measures wind down.
 ''My own view is that the recent pickup reflects more than purely temporary factors and that continued growth is likely,'' he told the business group.
 But he also made it clear that worries about high unemployment still trump concerns about future inflation. Unemployment, now 10.2 percent, is likely to remain ''quite high'' for the next year and will tamp down both growth and inflation.
 Private forecasters have echoed the Fed's somber outlook. Economists responding to the Philadelphia Fed's quarterly survey, released on Monday, predicted that unemployment would average about 10 percent through the end of 2010 -- slightly more pessimistic than their outlook three months ago.
 Mr. Bernanke warned that banks are still very reluctant to lend money, especially to small businesses that normally generate most of the nation's new jobs.
 ''Small businesses have seen their bank credit lines reduced or eliminated, or they have been able to obtain credit only on significantly more restrictive terms,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The fraction of small businesses reporting difficulty in obtaining credit is near a record high, and many of these businesses expect credit conditions to tighten further.''
 ''The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly,'' he said. 
 One standard indicator of job trends -- new claims for unemployment benefits -- has still not fallen enough to signal a start toward net increases in monthly employment.
 Mr. Bernanke said that unemployment has climbed twice as rapidly for men as for women, and that the jobless rates for young workers has soared even higher. For workers ages 16 to 24, unemployment is 19 percent. For young African-Americans, unemployment is 30 percent. 
 The Fed chairman said this recovery, like the previous two, was likely to seem like a recovery with no new job growth, in part because companies have become more reluctant to rebuild their work forces and have found new ways to increase the productivity of existing workers.
 In a clear retort to more hawkish Fed policy makers who have worried that inflationary pressures might be nearer than they seem, Mr. Bernanke declared the high unemployment and unused factory capacity -- economic ''slack,'' in Fed jargon -- was still too high, meaning that the economy does not face inflationary pressures yet.
 ''Although resource slack cannot be measured precisely,'' he said, ''it certainly is high, and it is showing through to underlying wage and price trends. Inflation expectations, which are measured through surveys and through the premiums that investors pay for inflation-protected Treasury bonds, remain ''stable,'' he added. 
 Perhaps the biggest surprise of Mr. Bernanke's speech was his comment about exchange rates -- a topic that the Federal Reserve normally avoids, because of an agreement dating back to 1951 that the Treasury had responsibility for managing the value of the dollar.
 But amid growing anxiety in many parts of the world about the falling value of the dollar in recent months, Mr. Bernanke not only talked about the exchange rate but added that the Fed would monitor the dollar's value closely.
 At first glance, his comments suggested that he might be warning about the need to shore up the dollar by raising interest rates. But Mr. Bernanke described the dollar's recent drop as a natural development that did not necessarily require Fed action.
 Mr. Bernanke said the dollar initially climbed sharply when the financial crisis was at its most acute in late 2008 and early 2009, because investors had sought safety in Treasuries. But those ''safe haven flows'' have since abated, he said, and the dollar had ''accordingly retraced its gains.''
 ''We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to our dual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor these developments closely.''

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Prods Obama on Job Losses

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With unemployment among blacks at more than 15 percent, the N.A.A.C.P. will join several other groups on Tuesday to call on President Obama to do more to create jobs.
 The organizations -- including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group-- will make clear that they believe the president's $787 billion stimulus program has not gone far enough to fight unemployment.
 They will call for increased spending for schools and roads, billions of dollars in fiscal relief to state and local governments to forestall more layoffs and a direct government jobs program, ''especially in distressed communities facing severe unemployment.'' 
 In speaking out on jobs, N.A.A.C.P. leaders say they are not trying to pick a fight with the first African-American president. Rather, they say, they are pressing Mr. Obama in an area where they believe he wants to be pressured.
 ''It's time for us to really stoke this issue up,'' said Hilary O. Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.'s senior vice president for advocacy and policy. ''We're not so much trying to convince him to do something he doesn't want to do, but urging him to move forward on an issue we have agreement on.''
 African-American leaders say it makes sense to pressure the president on jobs because the unemployment rate for blacks has jumped to 15.7 percent, from 8.9 percent when the recession started 23 months ago. That compares with 13.1 percent for Hispanics and 9.5 percent for whites.
 The black unemployment rate has climbed above 20 percent in several states, reaching 23.9 percent in Michigan and 20.4 percent in South Carolina.
 In recent months, the N.A.A.C.P. has lobbied Mr. Obama on numerous issues, including the hate crimes bill and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for employees to sue over pay discrimination. But this is the first time in Mr. Obama's presidency that the organization is throwing its full weight into the economic debate. 
 It is being joined by another group that fought for civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
 ''Make no mistake, for us this is the civil rights issue of the moment,'' said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference. ''Unless we resolve the national job crisis, it will make it hard to address all of our other priorities.''
 Mr. Obama has invited groups nationwide to voice their views and recommendations on jobs in preparation for his job summit next month. 
 ''Obama keeps saying, 'Push me to do the right thing,' said Steven Pitts, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I don't see this as any break with Obama. The current political alignment of forces doesn't support a new economic stimulus package. They're trying to create an alignment of political forces to counteract that.''
 Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative group, said it was laudable that the N.A.A.C.P. and other liberal groups were pressuring Mr. Obama, although he said their call for additional stimulus was wrong.
 ''Everybody should pressure him,'' Mr. Hassett said. ''And it might be the conservative groups aren't pressuring him enough, because they think maybe he won't listen. I would hope the people pressuring the president would push away from the divisive type of recommendations that we need more of the same, that we need more stimulus.''
 Mr. Hassett called for cutting taxes to create jobs and for reducing many workers to three-fifths or four-fifths time in work-sharing programs to avoid layoffs. 
 The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, coordinated the jobs statement being released Tuesday, which will also be joined by the Center for Community Change.
 ''Despite an effective and bold recovery package, we are still facing a prolonged period of high unemployment,'' the groups say. ''Two years from now, absent further action, we are likely to have unemployment at 8 percent or more, a higher rate than attained even at the worst point of the last two downturns.''
 The groups call for spurring private-sector job growth through tax credits and loans to small and medium businesses. They note that 17.5 percent of the labor force -- more than 27 million Americans -- are underemployed, including one in four minority workers. They say they expect one-third of the work force -- and 40 percent of minority workers --to be unemployed or underemployed at some point over the next year.
 ''Americans are confronting the worst jobs situation in more than half a century,'' the groups say. ''This is not a situation we must continue to tough out. A robust plan to create jobs in transparent, effective, and equitable ways can put America back to work.''

HEADLINE: 49 Million Americans Report a Lack of Food

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of Americans who lived in households that lacked consistent access to adequate food soared last year, to 49 million, the highest since the government began tracking what it calls ''food insecurity'' 14 years ago, the Department of Agriculture reported Monday.
 The increase, of 13 million Americans, was much larger than even the most pessimistic observers of hunger trends had expected and cast an alarming light on the daily hardships caused by the recession's punishing effect on jobs and wages. 
 About a third of these struggling households had what the researchers called ''very low food security,'' meaning lack of money forced members to skip meals, cut portions or otherwise forgo food at some point in the year. 
 The other two-thirds typically had enough to eat, but only by eating cheaper or less varied foods, relying on government aid like food stamps, or visiting food pantries and soup kitchens.
 ''These numbers are a wake-up call for the country,'' said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
 One figure that drew officials' attention was the number of households, 506,000, in which children faced ''very low food security'': up from 323,000 the previous year. President Obama, who has pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015, released a statement while traveling in Asia that called the finding ''particularly troubling.''
 The ungainly phrase ''food insecurity'' stems from years of political and academic wrangling over how to measure adequate access to food. In the 1980s, when officials of the Reagan administration denied there was hunger in the United States, the Food Research and Action Center, a Washington advocacy group, began a survey that concluded otherwise. Over time, Congress had the Agriculture Department oversee a similar survey, which the Census Bureau administers.
 Though researchers at the Agriculture Department do not use the word ''hunger,'' Mr. Obama did. ''Hunger rose significantly last year,'' he said.
 Analysts said the main reason for the growth was the rise in the unemployment rate, to 7.2 percent at the end of 2008 from 4.9 percent a year earlier. And since it now stands at 10.2 percent, the survey might in fact understate the number of Americans struggling to get adequate food.
 Rising food prices, too, might have played a role.
 The food stamp rolls have expanded to record levels, with 36 million Americans now collecting aid, an increase of nearly 40 percent from two years ago. And the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed last winter, raised the average monthly food stamp benefit per person by about 17 percent, to $133. Many states have made it easier for those eligible to apply, but rising applications and staffing cuts have also brought long delays.
 Problems gaining access to food were highest in households with children headed by single mothers. About 37 percent of them reported some form of food insecurity compared with 14 percent of married households with children. About 29 percent of Hispanic households reported food insecurity, compared with 27 percent of black households and 12 percent of white households. Serious problems were most prevalent in the South, followed equally by the West and Midwest. 
 Some conservatives have attacked the survey's methodology, saying it is hard to define what it measures. The 18-item questionnaire asks about skipped meals and hunger pangs, but also whether people had worries about getting food. It ranks the severity of their condition by the number of answers that indicate a problem.
 ''Very few of these people are hungry,'' said Robert Rector, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ''When they lose jobs, they constrain the kind of food they buy. That is regrettable, but it's a far cry from a hunger crisis.''
 The report measures the number of households that experienced problems at any point in the year. Only a ''small fraction'' were facing the problem at a given moment. Among those with ''very low food security,'' for instance, most experienced the condition for several days in each of seven or eight months.
 James Weill, the director of the food center that pioneered the report, called it a careful look at an underappreciated condition. 
 ''Many people are outright hungry, skipping meals,'' he said. ''Others say they have enough to eat but only because they're going to food pantries or using food stamps. We describe it as 'households struggling with hunger.' ''

HEADLINE: Obama and China's Leader Pledge to Expand Cooperation on Many Issues

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and HELENE COOPER; David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China met in private off Tiananmen Square here on a frigid Tuesday morning to discuss issues like trade, climate change and the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, in a session that signaled the central role of China on the world stage.
 The leaders told reporters afterward that the United States and China were in agreement on a range of issues, but they spoke only in general terms. 
 At a news conference where both presidents appeared, neither took questions from reporters, staying in line with the minutely stage-managed atmosphere of Mr. Obama's first visit to China. They said in separate speeches that the two nations would work together to stabilize the teetering world economy, contain the dangers of climate change and prevent nuclear proliferation. 
 The public pronouncements were full of familiar rhetoric. At the start of their first meeting, Mr. Obama told Mr. Hu: ''We believe strong dialogue is important not only for the U.S. and China, but for the rest of the world.'' 
 The leaders greeted each other at the door of the Great Hall of the People after Mr. Obama's motorcade slithered its way past thousands of onlookers crowding around Tiananmen Square, in front of the giant portrait of Mao, to catch a glimpse of the American president. 
 The leaders shook hands and walked up the red carpet, Chinese military leaders facing them. At the conference table where the first bilateral meeting was held, Mr. Obama sat flanked by senior cabinet members.
 The meeting came the day after Mr. Obama tried to hold a frank and public discussion with Chinese students in Shanghai. The event was called a town hall, but Mr. Obama's meeting with about 500 students had little in common with the sometimes raucous exchanges that have become a fixture of American politics.
 It was, instead, an example of Chinese stagecraft. Most of those who attended the event at the Museum of Science and Technology turned out to be members of the Communist Youth League, an official organization that grooms obedient students for future leadership posts. 
 Some Chinese bloggers whom the White House had tried to invite were barred from attending. Even then, the Chinese government took no chances, declining to broadcast the event live to a national audience -- or even mention it on the main evening newscast of state-run China Central Television.
 The scripted interaction underscored the obstacles Mr. Obama faces as he tries to manage the American relationship with an authoritarian China, whose wealth and clout have surged as its economy has weathered the global downturn far better than the United States' or Europe's.
 It remained unclear whether the United States would make progress on several issues on this trip, including on the management of its tightly controlled currency, the renminbi, or on how to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons. China has rejected American pressure to allow the renminbi to float freely and has opposed tougher sanctions on Iran.
 The degree of control exercised over the most public event of Mr. Obama's three-day stay in China suggests that Chinese leaders are less willing to make concessions to American demands for the arrangements of a presidential visit than they once were.
 The White House spent weeks wrangling with the Chinese authorities over who would be allowed to attend the Shanghai town hall meeting, including how much access the media would have and whether it would be broadcast live throughout the country. In the end, Mr. Obama had little chance to promote a message to the broader Chinese public.
 One student who participated in the meeting said she was trained for four days by the Chinese government, and told not to ask questions about Tibet or human rights and to be respectful of President Obama and consider the implications any question would have on U.S.-China relations. She asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by her university.
 The event in some respects signaled a retreat from the reception given at least two earlier American presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who both asked for, and were granted, the opportunity to address the Chinese people and answer their questions in a live national broadcast. 
 One local television station broadcast Mr. Obama's session live. But the official Xinhua news agency offered only a transcript of the exchange on its Web site instead of the live Webcast it had promised. The White House streamed the event live on its Web site, which did not appear to be blocked inside China. But that site is not a common destination for most Chinese looking for breaking news.
 Although it was carefully choreographed, the event gave Mr. Obama a little room to prod the Chinese authorities toward more openness. In his initial remarks at the forum, Mr. Obama said the United States was not seeking to impose its political system on other countries, but he called freedom of expression and worship among the ''universal rights'' common to all people.
 He did, however, steer clear of the most delicate human rights topics, like the recent unrest in the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and he focused most of his comments on the need for China and the United States to become partners instead of rivals. 
 His tone reflected the fact that China had become the largest foreign lender to the United States at a time when America's total public debt is surging and its economy is still trying to claw its way out of a deep slump. Mr. Obama said the two countries carried a ''burden of leadership'' on issues like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation, and said they needed to work more closely on matters of mutual concern.
 ''I will tell you, other countries around the world will be waiting for us,'' Mr. Obama said at the town hall meeting. He later flew to Beijing for a dinner and full state visit hosted by Mr. Hu.
 At the Shanghai forum, Mr. Obama was asked only one question -- ''Should we be able to use Twitter freely?'' -- that delved into an area the Chinese government considers controversial.
 His cautious answer stood out as a sign that he hopes to reach China's youth without offending its increasingly influential leaders. He delivered an oblique critique of China's rigid controls and restrictions on the Internet and free speech without mentioning that China practices online censorship as a matter of policy.
 ''I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me,'' he said. But, he added, ''I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger, and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I don't want to hear.''
 That snippet, at least initially, captured the attention of Chinese netizens. It was a topic of discussion on Web sites for a couple of hours after Mr. Obama spoke, before being deleted or removed from prominent positions. According to several Web snapshots in the hours after the meeting, ''What's Twitter?'' and ''Obama Shanghai'' shot up to the list of top 10 Chinese Google searches.
 ''I will not forget this morning,'' one Chinese Twitter user posted on the Internet, apparently using software to get around the government firewall. ''I heard, on my shaky Internet connection, a question about our own freedom which only a foreign leader can discuss.''
 But most of the questions appeared to reflect the careful vetting of the crowd by the Chinese. Beijing vetoed the White House's attempt to invite a group of popular bloggers, an audience componentthat administration officials hoped would make the session more authentic, according to several people who were asked to participate in the forum.
 ''I was invited, but then a few days ago I was told we can't go,'' said Michael Anti, a popular blogger who formerly worked as a research assistant at The New York Times and was a Nieman fellow at Harvard last year. ''I don't know why.''

HEADLINE: Capital Holds Breath as He Crunches Numbers

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Most people have never heard of Douglas W. Elmendorf. But all of official Washington is waiting to hear what he has to say.
 Mr. Elmendorf, a mild-mannered economist with a Harvard Ph.D., runs the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency charged with assessing how legislation, like President Obama's proposed health overhaul, would affect the federal budget. His detailed analyses -- ''scores'' in Washington argot -- are highly educated guesswork but are more or less the final word, making him a combination oracle and judge on many of the biggest issues of the day. 
 Now Congress is awaiting Mr. Elmendorf's judgment on a health bill that the Senate hopes to begin considering soon. He is in the thick of analyzing whether the bill, being drafted by Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, in close consultation with the White House, accomplishes what it promises at its advertised cost. In search of a favorable outcome, Mr. Reid has been submitting variations to Mr. Elmendorf for weeks. 
 A thumbs-up from Mr. Elmendorf could speed the process along, helping Mr. Obama fulfill his hope of signing a bill into law this year. A thumbs-down on any of the critical questions -- how much the bill costs, how many people it covers, whether it reins in the runaway growth of health spending -- could leave the White House and Democrats scrambling.
 Democrats, who have been chafing at his calculations, sound nervous.
 ''He's a good person, you know, but how they evaluate costs and benefits is very frustrating,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat. ''They can tell you how much a treadmill costs, but they're unwilling to calculate what the benefit is if somebody actually uses it, loses weight and therefore reduces premium costs. So you get a kind of one-dimensional view of budgeting.''
 Mr. Elmendorf -- bearded, bespectacled and cautious to a fault -- shuns publicity and almost never appears on television, except for the occasional hearing shown on C-Span. He and his team of number crunchers occupy the cramped fourth floor of a government building that once housed F.B.I. fingerprint files. His own office has a view of the freeway.
 His work has earned him respect on both side of the aisle. Yet he also has critics who complain that he is making it harder for Democrats to pass health legislation by using methods that tend to exaggerate cost and underestimate savings.
 Mr. Elmendorf said he is simply following the agency's time-honored approach to producing ''independent, objective analysis'' and ''letting the chips fall where they may.''
 Yet for a quiet man who thinks carefully about everything -- he courted his future wife by inviting her to a baseball game, after calculating that games offer precisely enough activity to fill in conversation lulls -- Washington's health care cauldron is an uncomfortable place to be. He is a Democrat who left partisan politics to join the budget office in January, and he is irking old friends.
 ''I get e-mail messages and read blog postings that think I'm a brilliant hero, and I also get blog postings and e-mail messages that think I'm a stupid traitor, and I've learned to let that roll off my back,'' he said in a rare interview about himself.
 When Mr. Elmendorf informed Congress in July that its draft bills at the time would not provide ''the sort of fundamental change'' necessary to rein in runaway spending, Republicans were ecstatic. The Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, hailed Mr. Elmendorf as a ''geek with guts.'' 
 Democrats reacted with alarm. Mr. Obama invited Mr. Elmendorf, along with other experts, to the White House to talk about cost containment, a move that prompted Republicans to accuse the president of trying to compromise Mr. Elmendorf's independence. Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director (and Mr. Elmendorf's predecessor) used his blog to take his old agency to task.
 ''Even a very good referee will occasionally make bad calls,'' Mr. Orszag said in an interview, adding, ''I was one of the people who strongly recommended he replace me.''
 Unlike Mr. Orszag, who sought aggressively to raise the agency's profile, Mr. Elmendorf, 47, prefers to remain in the background. The son of a computer programmer and a teacher, he became an economist, he said, because ''it was a rigorous way of looking at social issues.'' He has deep policy experience; in addition to working at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, he had a stint at the budget office, during the Clinton-era health care debates of 1993 and 1994.
 Back then, the agency's director was Robert D. Reischauer, whose analyses of the Clinton-era legislation were so unpopular among Democrats that he was referred to as the ''skunk at the garden party.'' It has since become a budget office tradition for the new director to be presented with a stuffed toy skunk; Mr. Elmendorf keeps his on his office bookshelf. 
 While the agency's analyses carry great weight in Washington, they have at times been off the mark, and not everyone accepts them. Jon R. Gabel, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said the budget office overestimated the cost of health reform on three occasions: in the 1980s, when Congress changed the way Medicare paid hospitals; in 1997, when Congress passed a balanced budget act; and in 2003, when Congress passed a Medicare prescription drug bill. 
 ''The budget office's cautious methods may have unintended consequences,'' Mr. Gabel has written, by leading ''Congress to think that politically unpopular cost-cutting initiatives will have, at best, only modest effects.''
 David Cutler, an economist at Harvard and Mr. Elmendorf's close friend, agrees. He said the budget office was ''doing a great disservice'' by ignoring evidence about how to reduce cost savings. He and Mr. Elmendorf have known each other since their student days; Mr. Cutler said the relationship is suffering.
 ''It's a bit painful,'' Mr. Cutler said, ''which is sad.'' 
 Hearing this, Mr. Elmendorf grows quiet, though unapologetic. ''Obviously,'' he said, ''I can't lead C.B.O. to reach conclusions to make particular friends of mine happy.'' 
 Mr. Elmendorf said he wished there was not so much ''personalization of what C.B.O. does around me.'' 
 To relax, he coaches his twin daughters' soccer team on weekends; the girls, Caroline and Laura, 14, say that when things get really rough, their father spends more time than usual with the family dog, a black Labrador retriever named Hobie. Perhaps tellingly, Mr. Elmendorf showed up for his interview with a Band-Aid on his left forefinger -- a result, the very careful budget director confessed, of an overly enthusiastic dog-human interaction.

HEADLINE: Acting Your Age: Considering the Age of Responsibility

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER ACETO and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Holding a "fishbowl" discussion on the age of responsibility. 

 BODY:
Overview | What standard(s) should society use to determine when a person should be treated as an adult? In this lesson, students participate in a fishbowl discussion about various legal situations related to the "age of responsibility" and contribute their ideas and arguments on the matter to a Learning Network Student Opinion blog post. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access (if available)
Warm-up | Students respond to the following prompt in their journals: Think of a time when you were told that you were not old enough to do something. How did you feel? Did you feel you had any power, control or say in that decision? Did you agree or disagree with the decision and the reasoning behind it? Why? 
After a few minutes, ask them to share their responses with a partner and/or invite volunteers to share their experiences with the class, and lead a brief discussion. Suggested questions: What, if any, themes are emerging from the class' experiences? Did similar situations come up repeatedly? What reasons are often given for age-based restrictions? Do these explanations seem reasonable and sound? 
Next, give each student a copy of the handout Acting Your Age (PDF), and direct them to fill out the first blank column to the best of their ability. When they are finished, reveal the correct answers (see below), and then give them a few more minutes to jot down their ideas about whether these seem to be the appropriate ages.
Here are the answers for the handout: 

        
Drink alcohol - 21
        
Drive a car (with a license) - 16 in most states
        
Serve in the military - 18
        
Attend school (upper required limit) - 16
        
See R-rated movies - 17
        
Consent to sex - 16 in most states
        
Get married (without parental consent) - 18 in most states
        
Get an abortion (without parental consent) - 18 in many states
        
Make personal finance decisions - 18
        
Rent a car - 25
Note: Laws for driving, consensual sex, marriage and abortion vary from state to state; you may want to find your state's laws ahead of time to share with your students. One resource is the article "What is the Age of Responsibility?" in the publication Governing. Depending on student interest, you may wish to add other age-restricted activities to the chart, such as gambling, purchasing a handgun or working. 
Solicit student perspectives on the various legal ages for different actions. Did most students know the correct ages? Did any of the legal ages surprise them? If so, which ones, and why? Did multiple students seem to feel that any of the legal ages was particularly unfair? Which ones, and why? 
To end the discussion, inform students that what they have been thinking about is the concept of the legal "age of responsibility," which generally means the age when a person is responsible for his or her own actions, which they will now consider further by reading a New York Times article on the topic.
Related | In recent years, neuroscience research has been cited to support changes in the way the law views the actions of teenagers. New York Times reporter Catherine Rampell examines this trend toward a rational determination of the age of responsibility in her piece "How Old is Old Enough?":
This past week the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether children should ever be sentenced to life without parole for crimes that don't involve murder.
At the heart of the argument lies a vexing question: When should a person be treated as an adult?
The answer, generally, is 18 - the age when the United States, and the rest of the world, considers young people capable of accepting responsibility for their actions. But there are countless deviations from this benchmark, both around the world (the bar mitzvah, for instance), and within the United States.
For drinking, driving, fighting in the military, compulsory schooling, watching an R-rated movie, consenting to sex, getting married, having an abortion or even being responsible for your own finances, the dawn of adulthood in America is all over the place.
And if you think separating the men from the boys (or the women from the girls) is difficult today, tracing the history of America's conception of childhood just complicates things further.
In the 19th century, teenagers were expected to raise their own children and work in the fields. This was true even though 19th-century teenagers were physically and intellectually less advanced than teenagers today. Thanks to better nutrition and more formal schooling, today's children generally reach puberty earlier and are, at least in theory, more informed about the world around them.
Read the entire article with your class using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
What is the age of responsibility generally around the world?
        
Is this age standard consistently applied throughout our country? Explain.
        
How did the Vietnam War effect the voting age?
        
What is the "very bad combination" that Professor Steinberg has found about teenagers in his experiments? What else does his research show about levels of maturity?
        
What did the Supreme Court rule in 2005? What type of evidence was used to help decide that case?
Activity | Explain to students that they will be discussing the age of responsibility for some of the topics they looked at earlier. Survey the class to determine the three areas of responsibility that are most important to them.
Next, tell the class that they will be using a "fishbowl" format for discussion, and provide the following explanation of how the fishbowl format works:
Once the students are seated in the initial configuration, ask the first question, and proceed from there. Use this format for the discussion questions: "What standard(s) should society use to determine how old people should be to __________________?" Fill in the blank with each area of responsibility voted on by the class. Possible follow-up questions include the following: 

        
What do you think will happen if society follows or does not follow your opinion?
        
Is your stance on this issue meant to protect the individual or the society?
        
To what extent, and how, are various factors relevant here: law, local culture, international laws, perceived hypocrisies, cognitive development, history, safety, etc.? Why?
After all rounds are complete, ask students to mark on their sheets whether their opinions have changed or not about when to treat people as adults. Invite students to share whether they changed their minds from the beginning of class, and why or why not. 
To conclude (or for homework), have each student post a comment on The Learning Network's Student Opinion post "When Should a Person Be Considered an Adult?", expressing her or his perspective on one of the issues discussed today. 
Direct students to the Commenting FAQ and remind them of good Web citizenship practices. Invite students to workshop their drafts with a partner before posting them on The Learning Network. 
To close, "whip" around and have all students share at least one sentence from their blog responses. 
Going further | Have students take the "age of responsibility" issue further by investigating the legal ages for the same activities they looked at today in other countries. Where in other countries are young people freer in some ways, and more restricted in others? Why do these differences exist?
Assign pairs or small groups to investigate one area, such as alcohol consumption or marriage, and the associated legal ages around the world. Assemble all findings into one class chart. To wrap up, lead a discussion about why differences exist around the world with respect to how children and responsibility.
Alternatively, assign small groups to research U.S. laws establishing legal ages that have changed over the years (such as the voting age), and why. Assemble the groups' research into a class timeline. Then ask students to try to predict which of these laws might change again, how and why. 
Teachers: How do students feel about their legal rights and responsibilities, and about the legal restrictions on their behavior?

HEADLINE: Trying Tenderness in Las Vegas

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
PERHAPS the most curious thing about Twist by Pierre Gagnaire in Las Vegas -- the American beachhead soon to be established by a legendary seigneur of Parisian cooking -- is its intended humility. 
 ''The idea is not to make a big show,'' the 59-year-old chef said on a recent afternoon. ''I hope it will be an experimental experience, in a humble way.'' He paused and shook his grayish mane. ''I don't want to be the French chef saying, 'I'll show you how to cook.' '' 
 He smiled. ''I will be quiet.''
 His cooking, however, will soon speak for itself. And when it opens Dec. 4, his restaurant will have grandeur enough: a cost of $7 million, a 72-seat design by Adam Tihany, and prominence in the 23rd-floor lobby of the luxe, non-gambling 47-story Mandarin Oriental Hotel in the $8.5 billion CityCenter. 
 Mr. Gagnaire has seven restaurants, in Paris, London, Tokyo, Seoul, Dubai and Hong Kong, but his entrance is belated among the three-Michelin-star Parisian sachems in Las Vegas -- Alain Ducasse, Joel Robuchon and Guy Savoy. 
 Still, in a city that remains scoured by recession, the arrival of a chef who has attracted a cult of devotees, and influenced a generation of high-profile French kitchens, has drawn more than a little anticipation. 
 The chef, who first won three Michelin stars in 1993, has been variously perceived by critics as an enfant terrible, a conjurer and a master of suspense and, well, humor. Those who have been observing his high-wire act for years wonder how he will wed his audience and his art. 
 ''When you're going to Gagnaire,'' Patricia Wells, the author who runs a Paris cooking school, said of his previous restaurants, ''you fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night.''
 His cooking has been noted for occasionally iconoclastic -- and usually playful and unpredictable -- experiments in taste, color, texture and ingredient selection.
 There have been thyme tartlets. Edible toothpicks. Tamarillo souffles. Fish liver with crunchy spaghetti. Mr. Gagnaire's menus have featured rare epine-vinette cranberries as well as overlooked sea cucumbers called espardeigne. He has even paid homage to the gastronomically shunned (including black radishes and the humble peanut). And he has not been above perpetrating a cuttlefish-ink croque-monsieur -- a restructuring of the classic cafe ham-and-cheese sandwich. ''God put all those ingredients on Earth,'' the chef once said, ''and it is our job to deal with them.''
 Ruth Reichl termed him a ''wizard'' in The New York Times in 1997, and he has been described as an alchemist of ingredients and spices. The Las Vegas restaurant ''is about surprise -- magic,'' said Mr. Tihany, who also designed the Mandarin rooms and public spaces. The dominant Twist colors? Silver, gray, purple and touches of white, in a configuration that ''seduces you but doesn't take you over,'' he said. 
 When the chef arrived to sniff his new terroir, he was ''astonished -- no, terrified,'' he recalled. ''The faux city in the desert. Didn't know what to make of it. Then, on the second day? I realized I loved it.'' He said he relished the challenge. 
 ''People throw so much money at them, they have to come,'' Ms. Wells said. The three-star chefs ''have worked so hard since childhood,'' she added, ''why shouldn't they be able to get rich?'' Mr. Gagnaire would not discuss his deal, but the pricey restaurant build-out is being paid for by CityCenter.
 Mr. Gagnaire's global domain already employs 300, but unlike some of his bestarred Parisian peers he professes a lack of calculation about the mushrooming of his brand. ''I had no business plan, it was all about chance meetings with people who want to be your partner -- and we happened to hit it off,'' said Mr. Gagnaire, pronounced gon-YAIR. (''It is impossible, I should have changed it long ago,'' he said. ''My name? It means goat keeper.'') 
 Though he has worked on the new restaurant for three years, he has difficulty articulating its essence. ''It will not be a brasserie, and not be a gastronomic restaurant,'' he said. ''My way of cooking is very poetic and emotional. I would like this to be a place of tenderness -- a word not often used in Las Vegas. After all, my only way of expressing myself is through my cooking.'' 
 He thinks his new menu ''will evolve quickly, according to the measure of the rhythm of the city. And the clientele.'' He will be doing due diligence as he inhabits the kitchen for a month. ''I am going to listen,'' he said, ''to try to understand the psychological profile, and the gourmet profile, of people coming to dinner.''
 Though Twist offers competition for all the city's restaurants in its price range ($135 with wine per person, on average), Mr. Gagnaire ''is a serious and artistic chef with great panache and an edgy food style, so how can any of that be bad news for Las Vegas?'' said Paul Bartolotta, 48, proprietor of the high-end 230-seat Bartolotta Ristorante di Mare in the Wynn Hotel. ''I hope that he will elevate everyone's game.''
 Of his calling, Mr. Gagnaire said, ''I never had any choice, I just had to be a chef,'' since his father, Jean-Claude, was a restaurateur. Born near St.-Etienne, not far from Lyon, Gagnaire fils was the oldest of four. ''I put my foot inside the system -- and couldn't get out of it.'' 
 By age 14 he was working in a patisserie, and a year later did a summer internship with the chef Paul Bocuse. ''I was frightened by him,'' he recalled. ''I was too impressed by him to ever work for him.'' After Mr. Gagnaire honed his skills elsewhere, ''my father turned his restaurant over to me, and I ran it for six years. It was a bad experience.''
 He started his own, more ambitious, St.-Etienne restaurant in 1981; 12 years later he landed his three Michelin stars, but the establishment was a financial failure. ''I lost absolutely everything in one day, all I'd worked for, and built,'' he said of his bankruptcy. ''But I would have lost my soul if I'd stayed there and adapted to the taste of the bourgeoisie.'' 
 SIX months later, in 1996, he opened the restaurant that bears his name in the Hotel Balzac in Paris. ''It was a rebirth,'' Mr. Gagnaire recalled. ''Perhaps for some, part of the attraction of my cuisine was that they knew I'd fallen, and had come back.'' 
 Initially he was viewed as an enfant terrible, said Helene Samuel, the proprietor of the Cafe Salle Pleyel in the venerable Parisian concert hall. ''He was very inspired,'' she said, ''he was tortured, a seeker -- and he never changed. Dining chez Gagnaire is to see inside an artist's brain.'' 
 He was respected for his work in St.-Etienne and there was also a bit of: ''you know, 'we Parisians offer sympathy' -- as opposed to the country clods,'' said Michael Batterberry, editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine. 
 And so, three Michelin stars arrived the following year. 
 Ms. Samuel said that by his example, Mr. Gagnaire ''opened things up for a new generation, saying that you can be successful -- and be yourself.'' 
 Some critics in Paris and London have taken Mr. Gagnaire to task for his heart-stopping check costs, and an artist's disdain-for-the-proles mentality that can impart a froideur -- a coldness -- to his establishments. He has also been mocked for a chemistry-class approach to cooking, given his long collaboration with his friend, the molecular gastronomist Herve This. But Mr. Gagnaire said that ''for me it is more like an intellectual game.'' 
 Even critics who have praised Mr. Gagnaire are sometimes overwhelmed by the chef's penchant for overwhelmingness. Francois Simon of Le Figaro, torpid from a Gagnaire meal, described feeling ''like a displaced whale stranded on some tepid seashore.''
 The very name of the Las Vegas restaurant would seem to describe what Mr. Gagnaire has always done in the kitchen. But the Twist rubric actually derives ''from the dance about which I have such happy memories,'' he said, referring to the Chubby Checker warhorse. ''It was my favorite rock 'n' roll song. It is the meaning of America for me. Big cars. Violent colors.'' 
 Ultimately, of course, he will turn over Twist and its staff of 13 to his 40-year-old chef de cuisine, Pascal Sanchez, who headed his London restaurant, Sketch. 
 Managing from afar is ever a concern of the multiply starred absentees, but Mr. Gagnaire's team ''is devoted to him,'' Ms. Samuel said. ''In the kitchen, they know him so well that they don't need to speak to one another.'' 
 Gagnaire presentations can almost veer beyond the edge, ''but the good ones always work,'' Ms. Wells said. At Twist, a signature dish of the $145, seven-main-dish-plus-dessert tasting menu is to be a five-way preparation of langoustine -- seared, grilled, tartared, mousselined and geleed. 
 A la carte menu items include a $22 foie gras appetizer degustation served shaved, grilled and as a custard; a $60 entree will offer lobster three ways -- the body slowly roasted in consomme, the claw tempura-style, and the remainder in a ravioli cooked in Sauternes.
 But, Mr. Gagnaire said derisively: ''There will be no hamburger.'' 
 Mr. Gagnaire, who speaks some English, relies on his wife, Sylvie Le Bihan, 44, as a translator. They met at Sketch, where she was a customer, and married in 2007. They have five children -- two from his first marriage, three from her first marriage. His first wife, Chantal, manages his company's finances. 
 Twinkly eyed and often seeming to be enjoying a joke he prefers not to share, the reedlike chef, a touch over 6 feet tall, frequently gesticulates during passionate monologues with definitive chopping motions. Given his height, his Rhone-blue eyes and his proud Mont Blanc of a proboscis, he is often mistaken for a celebrity other than himself. 
 Earlier this year he was in a Parisian bakery and the proprietor said with surprise: ''You're not at the Cannes festival!'' the chef recalled. ''So he was thinking I was a star -- or director. And I went with it.'' 
 He sighed. ''You must not take yourself seriously.''

HEADLINE: Grandpa Loved Horses, or How a Filly Got Her Name

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Grandpa loved the horses.
 Loved them so much that he visited them regularly. The family lived in the Rosedale section of southeast Queens, conveniently located between Aqueduct and Belmont. 
 Sometimes Grandpa, Peter Ruocco, would take his grandson, Randy Vogt, to the track, when the boy was 5 or 6.
 ''Grandpa seemed to know everybody -- even if he didn't,'' the grandson recalls. 
 Some grandparents take children to the zoo or to the museum. Grandpa drove the boy into the adjacent hamlet of Elmont to show him the house belonging to jockey Ron Turcotte, who in 1973 rode Secretariat to the Triple Crown. At home, Grandpa had a statue of a jockey in the garden, much like the statuary outside the ''21'' Club in Manhattan.
 In addition to his love of horses and jockeys, Grandpa had an interest in the betting windows, but the grandson is quite positive that Grandpa did no grievous harm to the family's finances.
 ''He didn't win a million, he didn't lose a million,'' the grandson puts it.
 Grandpa died in 1988, leaving a huge hole in Vogt's life. Gone was the gregarious gent who was sometimes a Good Humor Man and sometimes a chimney cleaner and once had his own boiler-repair company. Vogt remembers Grandpa for his optimism, not only about thoroughbreds but also about that even more finicky species, homo sapiens.
 Vogt remembers Grandpa saying things like ''It's nice to be nice'' and ''Be kind to everyone, especially since you'll never know when you'll need them in the future'' and ''There is no such word as can't.''
 On the first Saturday in May 1989, Vogt was watching the Kentucky Derby on television, listening to how Sunday Silence had been named. Vogt got to thinking, there ought to be a horse named for Grandpa. 
 It took nearly two decades, but now there is. A filly, One for Grandpa, placed in her second race Nov. 9 at Finger Lakes in upstate New York. The filly is handled by Mary Pipolo, who is back working at the track despite sustaining a crushed pelvis last spring.
 All this energy, all this affection, is part of the enduring appeal of this diminished sport. Despite the incursions by casinos and other forms of gambling, despite the wretched economy, despite the ghastly injuries on the track and the wretched scandals with unscrupulous trainers, there is still some small swath of the population that loves the horses, just as Grandpa did.
 Vogt's quest to honor Grandpa began with letters to stables suggesting the name. He is a persistent cuss, a marketing director for a financial services company, LifeVentures Corporation, and also a college soccer referee and able publicist for the Long Island Junior Soccer League, which is how I know him. 
 In the age of the Internet, Vogt began to make some contacts. In 2006, the New York Thoroughbred Breeders ran a contest to name a filly, which had been born on April 15, 2006, at Mill Creek Farm in Stillwater, N.Y., near Saratoga. Vogt sent off his proposal, and won. 
 Before the filly was ever raced, she was put up for auction in October 2008. At the sale, she reacted to a loud noise and banged her right foreleg, which had to be bandaged. Her price immediately dropped, and she was available for only $1,000 for Pipolo, an aspiring trainer from around Rochester.
 ''She had a good conformation, and a good pedigree,'' Pipolo said, referring to the filly's sire, Mayakovsky. 
 Pipolo is 25, sounds younger on the telephone and has loved horses since she took her first ride at 6. Her family had no connection to horses. She went to college at the State University of New York at Morrisville, which has a program in handling horses. After graduation, she worked around tracks and saved her pennies. 
 Vogt has met Pipolo and the filly once, at a farm in Port Deposit, Md., where One for Grandpa was being trained. Because they both have Italian ancestry, Vogt suggested the silks, a combination of green, white and red, the colors of the Italian flag. But he has no responsibility for the filly.
 Pipolo took One for Grandpa up to Finger Lakes last spring and was schooling her in the starting gate for the first time. 
 ''She's good-natured, doesn't spook, but when she went to back up, she stumbled badly and just sat down, and I got pinned underneath,'' Pipolo said.
 Pipolo was in the hospital for two weeks. At first, they didn't think she would work at the track again, but she has bounced back to where she can do just about everything but ride her filly. 
 Pipolo could not afford the $800 for the trainer's license, so the filly is listed under the name of the trainer Sal Iorio Jr., but Pipolo is the main caretaker.
 She has been patient. This was no Rachel Alexandra, no Zenyatta, the two female superstars of 2009. But after finishing fifth in her first start, One for Grandpa, with Jose David Osorio up, got a lead in the six-furlong third race on Nov. 9 and was passed in the stretch.
 ''She's still pretty green,'' Pipolo said. ''But she reacted well when she got passed. She might be more of a sprinter.''
 Downstate, Vogt lit a candle in church for the health of everybody in the race. Then he deputized his father to place a small wager, just as Grandpa would have done, this time negotiating the shabby mysteries of the nearby OTB.
 ''We bet $15 to win and $15 to show, so she placed,'' Vogt said. ''We won 75 cents on $30.'' 
 But he was betting from his heart. And he felt close to Grandpa.

HEADLINE: Gratitude's Grace Can Be Itself a Gift

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
THE GIFT OF THANKS 
 The Roots and Rituals of Gratitude 
 By Margaret Visser 
 458 pages. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27. 
 ''It is a fact of life that people give dinner parties, and when they invite you, you have to turn around and invite them back,'' Laurie Colwin wrote in her bite-size masterpiece, ''Home Cooking,'' published in 1988. ''Often they retaliate by inviting you again, and you must then extend another invitation. Back and forth you go, like Ping-Pong balls, and what you end up with is called social life.''
 Colwin wasn't complaining, exactly. She liked dinner parties. But she would also have liked Margaret Visser's observation, in her new book, ''The Gift of Thanks,'' that the word ''host'' is related through Indo-European roots to the words ''hostile'' and ''hostage.'' Dinner parties are complicated things, where obligation and gratitude collide and overlap -- and sometimes crash and burn. 
 Ms. Visser writes with as much scholarly wit about dinner and dinner parties -- what we put in our mouths, and why and with whom -- as any writer alive. She was a foodie before everyone was, and the author of the authoritative books ''Much Depends on Dinner'' (1988) and ''The Rituals of Dinner'' (1991), each of which is as crisp and tasty as the day it was published.
 The not-very-promising title of Ms. Visser's new book, ''The Gift of Thanks: The Roots and Rituals of Gratitude,'' and the fact that it is being issued in November, will make some readers think it's another snoozy, belt-loosening tour of America's Thanksgiving traditions, from the Pilgrims to whether it's the L-tryptophan in turkey that makes you want to crawl under the table and take a nap on the carpet after eating. 
 It's not that at all. Instead ''The Gift of Thanks'' is a scholarly, many-angled examination of what gratitude is and how it functions in our lives. Gratitude is a moral emotion of sorts, Ms. Visser writes, one that is more complicated and more vital than we think.
 English speakers are obsessed with the terms ''thanks'' or ''thank you.'' We often say these words more than 100 times a day, she writes, in a flurry that many other cultures find baffling. 
 The notion that we should thank others is not hard-wired into our brains, but learned from our parents. For a child, she writes, ''the first unprompted 'thank you' is momentous enough to count as a kind of initiation into a new level of human consciousness.'' In people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, little words like ''thanks,'' she notes, ''often survive the shipwreck of all other memories.'' 
 Ms. Visser is deft and funny about how, in our afraid-to-offend-anyone society, thanking has taken the place of commanding, as in: ''Thank you for not smoking.'' She's good on how a series of ''thanks'' and ''thank yous'' are signals that a telephone conversation is coming to an end. 
 Ms. Visser acknowledges that simple politeness is the grease that keeps society running and, conversely, how much hostility can build up among people when words like ''thanks'' are not spoken.
 In Dante's ''Inferno,'' she observes, ''at the bottommost circle of hell, the ungrateful are punished by being eternally frozen in the postures of deference they had failed to perform during their lifetimes: trapped rigid in enveloping ice, they stand erect or upside down, lie prone, or bow face to feet.'' 
 In ''The Gift of Thanks,'' however, Ms. Visser is most interested in the kind of gratitude that is not compulsory or self-interested. She writes about the humility required to be genuinely grateful, and the essential ability to climb out of one's own head. 
 ''Gratitude is always a matter of paying attention,'' she writes, of ''deliberately beholding and appreciating the other.'' 
 Gratitude is, fundamentally, about not taking things for granted, a kind of worldview. ''Gratitude arises from a specific circumstance -- being given a gift or done a favor -- but depends less upon that,'' Ms. Visser writes, ''than on the receiver's whole life, her character, upbringing, maturity, experience, relationships with others, and also on her ideals, including her idea of the sort of person she is or would like to be.'' 
 Giving and receiving create ''alternating superiors and inferiors,'' she notes, and it's a fluid and shifting way of being that not everyone is comfortable with. As Ralph Waldo Emerson put it: ''We wish to be self-sustained. We do not quite forgive a giver. The hand that feeds us is in some danger of being bitten.'' 
 Margaret Visser being Margaret Visser, she does swing back around, in ''The Gift of Thanks,'' to food. ''Children in our culture learn manners at the dining table, and not manners only,'' she writes. Our ability to feel and express gratitude gets its start there.
 She has a few tart things to say about dinner parties. Failing to respond to an invitation is itself a response, she points out, ''and a hostile one.'' She adds: ''Invitations should be extended to hosts fairly soon after dinner parties have taken place, and people invited must come unless they offer excellent excuses.'' 
 On the other hand, you can't invite someone back too quickly. ''Instant return has a whiff of payment about it, of reluctance to accept a moral debt,'' she writes, adding, ''One is supposed to savor the gift, think about it, spend time remembering the person who gave it.'' 
 At 393 dense pages of text, ''The Gift of Thanks'' is too much of a good thing, a bit more of a gift than you desire. Ms. Visser has not brought a shapely cake to our door; she has brought the contents of a bakery. She writes clearly, yet her paragraphs bog down; she tends to give two or three examples to illuminate her points when one would do. She also manages to avoid entirely the debate, a lively one during a recession, over the devilish moral quandry of re-gifting.
 I'm not sorry to have spent a few hours with Ms. Visser's new book. But will I wrap up copies for friends, or want to read it again? To that, at least -- thanks, but no thanks.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Gives Struggling Homeowners a Chance to Stay Put

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Christopher Hall stepped tentatively through the entranceway of City Hall Courtroom 676 and took his place among dozens of others confronting foreclosure purgatory. His hopes all but extinguished, he fully expected the morning to end with a final indignity: He would sign over the deed to his house -- his grandfather's two-story row house; the only house in which he had ever lived; the house where he had raised three children.
 ''This is devastating,'' he said last month as he sat in the gallery awaiting his hearing. ''This is my childhood home. I grew up there. My mother passed away there. My grandfather passed away there. All of my memories are there.''
 A union roofer, Mr. Hall, 42, had not worked since August 2008, when the contractor that employed him as a foreman went broke and laid off more than 40 people. He had not made a mortgage payment in more than a year, and his lender, Bank of America, was threatening to auction off his house through the sheriff's office. 
 In most American cities, that probably would have been the end of the story: another home turned into distressed bank inventory by the national foreclosure crisis. But in Philadelphia, under a program begun last year to try to keep people in their homes, Mr. Hall entered the courtroom with a reasonable chance of hanging on. 
 Under the rules adopted by Philadelphia's primary civil court, no owner-occupied house may be foreclosed on and sold by the sheriff's office before a ''conciliation conference,'' a face-to-face meeting between the homeowner and the lender aimed at striking a workable compromise. Every homeowner facing a default filing is furnished with counseling, and sometimes legal representation.
 So, as Mr. Hall stepped into the ornate courtroom just after 9 o'clock, he was swiftly provided with a volunteer lawyer, Kristine A. Phillips. She huddled briefly with a lawyer for Bank of America and returned with a useful promise. The bank would leave him alone for six more weeks while his housing counselor pursued further negotiations in an attempt to lower his payments permanently.
 ''You've got more time,'' Ms. Phillips told him. ''We'll get this all worked out,'' she said. 
 ''Thank you so much,'' Mr. Hall said softly, his body shaking with pent-up anxiety now tinged with relief. ''It's a lot of weight off of my shoulders.'' 
 In a nation confronting a still-gathering crisis of foreclosure, Philadelphia's program has emerged as a model that has enabled hundreds of troubled borrowers to retain their homes. Other cities, from Pittsburgh to Chicago to Louisville, have examined the program and adopted similar efforts.
 ''It brings the mortgage holder and the lender to the table,'' said City Councilor John M. Tobin Jr. of Boston, who is planning to introduce legislation to enact a program in his city modeled on Philadelphia's. ''When people are face to face, it can be pretty disarming.''
 When homeowners in Philadelphia receive legal default notices from their mortgage companies, the court system schedules a conciliation hearing. Canvassers working for local nonprofit agencies visit foreclosed homeowners, distributing fliers that inform them of their rights to a conference, and urging them to call a hot line that can direct them to free housing counselors.
 ''You can feel a certain sense of relief from their just being able to speak to someone about the program,'' said Anna Hargrove, who works as a canvasser in West Philadelphia.
 Every Thursday morning, the courtroom on the sixth floor of the regal City Hall here is given over to the conciliation conferences. It fills up with volunteer lawyers in jogging shoes, who are representing homeowners; gray-suited corporate lawyers working for mortgage companies; and all variety of delinquent borrowers -- elderly citizens leaning on canes, construction workers in coveralls, parents with bored children in tow. The lawyers exchange preliminary settlement terms, while the homeowners fill out papers and wait.
 In some cases, deals are struck that lower monthly payments for borrowers and allow them to retain their homes. When a homeowner cannot afford the home even at modified terms, the program helps to create a graceful exit, in which the borrower accepts cash for vacating the property or signs over the deed in lieu of further payment.
 Those outcomes are similar to the ones produced by the Obama administration's $75 billion program aimed at stemming foreclosures, which gives cash subsidies to mortgage companies as an inducement to accept lower payments. But in Philadelphia there is one crucial difference: the mortgage companies have no choice but to participate. They have to attend the conferences and negotiate in good faith or they cannot proceed with a sheriff's sale. 
 Since the administration's program was begun in March, it has been plagued by complaints of bureaucratic confusion and the indifference of mortgage companies. Many homeowners who have applied for loan modifications complain that their documents have been lost repeatedly or that they have been rejected without explanation.
 Right to Mediation
 The Philadelphia program forces an outcome by bringing together all the principals in one room. If the mortgage company proves intractable, the homeowner has the right to request mediation in front of a volunteer lawyer serving as a provisional judge, who relays recommendations to the program's supervising judge. If the judge finds that the mortgage company is not acting in good faith, she can hold the house in limbo by denying permission for a sheriff's sale.
 While data is scant, a legal aid group, Philadelphia Volunteers for the Indigent Program, has complete information on 61 of the 309 cases it has resolved since October 2008 through the anti-foreclosure program. Only five resulted in sheriff's sales, while 35 ended with loan modifications that lowered payments, the group says. The remaining 21 cases were divided among bankruptcies, loan forbearance and repayment arrangements, graceful exits and straightforward sales.
 Some suggest the city's program is plagued by the same basic defect as the Obama rescue plan: Nearly all the loans that have been modified have been altered on a trial basis, requiring homeowners to reapply for an extension of the terms after only a few months -- a process that appears rife with obstacles, according to participants. 
 ''There's no teeth to the conciliation program,'' said Matthew B. Weisberg, a Philadelphia lawyer who represents homeowners in cases involving alleged mortgage fraud. ''It's a largely ineffective stopgap prolonging what appears to be the inevitable, which is the loss of homes.''
 Still, Mr. Weisberg grudgingly praised the plan.
 ''It's arbitrary and unpredictable,'' he said, ''but it's better than what anybody else is doing.''
 Sheriff Delays Auction
 Philadelphia's Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion Pilot Program began with a resolution passed by the City Council in March 2008, calling on Sheriff John D. Green to scrap the sheriff's sale scheduled for April. Low-income neighborhoods were already experiencing a surge of foreclosures involving subprime loans given to people with tainted credit. With unemployment growing, lost paychecks were now pushing people into delinquency, reaching into middle-class and even wealthy neighborhoods. In early 2008, nearly 200 homes a month were being auctioned by the sheriff's office, about one-third more than in 2006.
 In West Philadelphia, Councilman Curtis Jones Jr., one of the sponsors of the resolution, watched his childhood neighborhood consumed by foreclosure, as the homes of working families -- their porches once lined with flower pots -- were boarded up with plywood.
 ''It becomes a blight on your entire community,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It creates an environment that fosters everything bad, from prostitution to drug dealing to wildlife, like raccoons taking over whole houses. One house becomes 10, and 10 becomes the whole block.''
 In response to the resolution, Sheriff Green canceled the April sale. Meanwhile, Judge Annette M. Rizzo, who oversaw a local task force on stemming foreclosures, joined with the president judge of Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas to develop the program.
 For Judge Rizzo, a high-energy woman who has long taken an interest in housing policy, the moratorium presented both a crisis and an opportunity. The sheriff was effectively refusing to fulfill his mandated responsibilities, leaving his office vulnerable to legal challenge. But if the mortgage companies could be persuaded to participate in an alternative way of addressing foreclosures, more people could stay in their homes.
 ''I realized we're either going to go down in flames or we're going to be a national model,'' Judge Rizzo said. ''We're going to look at these cases and see what we can work out.''
 Mr. Hall knew none of this. What he knew was that his life seemed to be unraveling.
 Home to Four Generations
 Ever since he was a teenager, he had earned a middle-class living with his hands. He had been raised by his grandfather in his three-bedroom house on Akron Street, in a predominantly Irish Catholic working-class neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. 
 He had attended St. Martin's, the Catholic school around the corner, married his childhood sweetheart and still remained in his grandfather's house, sending his own children -- two boys (now in their 20s) and a 12-year-old girl -- to the same school.
 Mr. Hall, a soft-spoken yet intense man with a silver-tinged goatee, had worked seven days a week for much of this decade, bringing home weekly pay of about $1,000 -- enough to build a deck in his backyard; enough to obtain a fixed-rate mortgage and buy the house for $44,000 when his grandfather succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in the mid-1990s; enough for a motorcycle and a boat.
 But three years ago, Mr. Hall committed the sort of mistake that has upended millions of households. At the recommendation of a for-profit credit counselor, he took out a new mortgage -- a variable-rate loan from Countrywide Financial, which is now owned by Bank of America. He paid off some credit card debt, and he borrowed an extra $15,000 to renovate his home, expanding his mortgage balance to $63,000.
 The loan began with manageable payments of about $500 a month. But Mr. Hall's interest rate soon soared -- something he says was never explained to him -- lifting his payments to $950 a month.
 ''When I got the mortgage, I didn't really understand it,'' he said. ''They told me this would improve my credit and that was it. It was just, 'sign here,' and 'initial here.' ''
 No More Construction Work
 He might still have managed had construction not come to a halt. By 2007, Mr. Hall's employer was cutting work hours. In August 2008, it shut down, turning his $1,000 weekly paycheck into an $800 monthly unemployment check.
 Every day, he set the alarm clock and headed to the union hall at 5 a.m., waiting and hoping for work. Every day, he went home, still jobless and discouraged, now confronting the displeasure of his wife, who worked as a nurse, and who he said never came to terms with their diminished spending power. After months of bickering, she left him last December, taking their daughter.
 ''She was saying, 'How are we going to have Christmas? How are we going to go on vacation?' '' he recalled. ''She just seen it getting worse instead of better, and she got depressed.''
 In January, his truck was repossessed, leaving him to walk through the winter dawn to the union hall for his daily ritual of defeat.
 He watched the For Sale signs proliferating on his block, as mostly elderly neighbors found themselves unable to make their mortgage payments. He saw their belongings piled up on their front lawns as they abandoned their homes to foreclosure.
 In September, the envelope finally landed with his default notice. A canvasser knocked on his door, proffering a flier urging him to call the city hot line. When he called, a housing counselor helped him assemble the paperwork for a loan modification and prepare for his conciliation conference.
 When he arrived inside courtroom 676 in October, Mr. Hall carried a sheaf of wrinkled papers in a white plastic grocery bag. He occupied a solid wooden chair as an announcer called off cases for hearing. ''Number 27, Wachovia Mortgage versus ... .'' A girl no older than 6, with flower-shaped plastic barrettes in her hair, fidgeted as her mother applied for legal representation.
 Mr. Hall was struggling to come to terms with what he assumed was the end. 
 ''I put my whole life into this house,'' he said. ''After I do all this work, they want to take it from me. You've got to regroup and move, but where? If I can't pay my mortgage, how am I going to pay rent? And I have a whole house full of furniture.''
 When he got the news that he had a few weeks' reprieve, relief quickly gave way to the worry that had dominated his thoughts for months.
 ''It's postponing the inevitable,'' he said.
 ''I'm a man,'' he kept saying, trying to make sense of how a lifetime of working on other people's homes had put him here, staring at the potential loss of his own home; still hoping for relief. 
 ''I don't want no handouts,'' he said. ''I just want a reasonable loan that I can afford to pay so I can get on with my life.''

HEADLINE: Sacramento Utility Accuses Banks of Rigging Sales of Municipal Derivatives

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
A California utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, has accused more than a dozen banks of rigging the sales of municipal derivatives and sharing illegal profits.
 In a lawsuit based on federal and state antitrust claims, the utility claims that the financial firms, including Bank of America, UBS and JPMorgan Chase & Company, conspired to pre-select winners of municipal derivative auctions, coordinated their pricing and accepted kickbacks disguised as fees from co-conspirators. 
 The accusations are similar to those made by a federal grand jury last month in New York, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Nov. 12 in federal court in Sacramento. In that case, the founder of CDR Financial Products, David R. Rubin, and two employees were indicted and charged with accepting kickbacks on investments sold to local governments. CDR, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is also named as a defendant in the Sacramento case.
 The banks engaged in ''allocating customers and markets for municipal derivatives, rigging the bidding process by which municipal bond issuers acquire municipal derivatives and conspiring to manipulate the terms that issuers received,'' according to the suit.
 Derivatives are unregulated financial instruments linked to stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific events like changes in interest rates or weather.
 Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, adding that the bank was cooperating with federal investigations of the derivatives industry.
 ''In January 2007 we were granted leniency by the D.O.J. for voluntarily providing information before the beginning of their investigation,'' Ms. Norton said in an e-mailed statement.
 Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment immediately. A spokesman for UBS, Doug Morris, also declined to comment.
 The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which provides electricity to Sacramento County and part of Placer County, is the sixth-biggest publicly owned utility in the United States by customers served, according to its Web site.

HEADLINE: Helping Landlords Save on Energy and Water Costs

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM

 BODY:
The Community Preservation Corporation, a 35-year-old nonprofit lender that specializes in issuing mortgages to landlords of small buildings and properties receiving public subsidies, is offering $1 billion in credit to New York State apartment building owners. 
 The group's new ''green financing initiative'' offers mortgages or refinancing to landlords who fix wasteful energy and water systems in their buildings. 
 The initiative presumes that savings from such retrofitting will be large enough for an owner to cover a loan with profit to spare, said Sadie McKeown, a senior vice president with the organization. As Ms. McKeown told an online seminar of 70 potential borrowers on Nov. 10, ''we want to empirically show upside after a retrofit.''
 The backers of the initiative include the government-controlled mortgage agency Freddie Mac, New York City and State public employee pension funds and a consortium of banks. These investors have worked with the corporation over the decades to assemble financing for buildings with low-income tenants, and now some of these buildings need retrofits to become profitable or saleable.
 Michael D. Lappin, the Community Preservation Corporation's chief executive, said the new fund was an effort to induce owners and lenders -- including his organization -- to reap value from fixing buildings as they age. Mr. Lappin said the idea for the initiative came to him last summer, when he commissioned a study of the energy costs in the corporation's portfolio and found extreme variations. Some buildings were spending seven times as much for heat and hot water as other comparable buildings, he said. 
 Andrew Padian, an energy expert who joined the Community Preservation Corporation's senior staff in March, said common building flaws wasted many thousands of dollars a year. These problems are as simple as boilers that send constant heat to apartments, stairwells with lights on when nobody needs them and landlords who refuse to install dishwashers, letting water costs run wild. 
 Proposed regulations in New York City would require landlords of older buildings to conduct annual energy audits and meet benchmarks for energy efficiency, or pay fines. The corporation's initiative could give owners of buildings with low-income tenants a head start in finding fuel savings. The organization's loans carry an interest rate of about 6 percent. 
 Since the program began last month, owners of 10 buildings have received $18 million in financing to fix up 725 apartments. The buildings include a 375-unit complex on West 110th Street, a 17-unit walk-up co-op on East First Street and a low-income garden apartment complex in Bedford Hills in Westchester County.
 Some owners are refinancing existing mortgages with the corporation, while others are creating new ones. Mr. Lappin said he expected the fund to commit the full $1 billion, across the state's cities and inner suburbs, by 2013. 
 All of the landlords that have received financing began by showing two years' worth of fuel cost records and authorizing the organization to monitor their energy use. After analyzing where landlords are wasting energy, the corporation conducts a walk-through with a mortgage officer and Mr. Padian, and a list of recommended fixes is created.
 The corporation then finds public incentives, like federal weatherization grants, to help lower the costs of the repairs. The landlord hires relevant consultants and contractors. 
 Mr. Lappin said that because many problems reflected poor design throughout buildings, retrofits should cost an average of $3,000 to $4,000 per apartment, whether the building was large or small, old or new. A first step involves measuring how much fuel and water a building uses, rather than how much a landlord pays in fuel and water bills. ''That means looking at air shafts, faucets, shower heads,'' he said. 
 One fundamental problem is that many property managers are poorly trained in energy management. Some owners, for instance, have neglected to remove obsolete dumbwaiter shafts, which suck up heat from inefficient boilers, Mr. Padian said. ''An architect told us that it was against the building code to remove dumbwaiter shafts,'' he told the seminar. ''We had to show him a memo from the buildings department -- from 1950 -- that said it was allowed.''
 Electricity waste is also common, Mr. Padian added. ''The cost per square foot of lighting common areas ranges from 20 cents to more than $3,'' he said. ''Even though elevator buildings cost more, it's not because of the elevator. It's because those buildings have two stairwells with lights on 24 hours a day.'' 
 The green financing initiative is aimed at correcting basic existing flaws rather than installing more advanced green technology like alternative fuels, solar panels and green roofs. 
 The 54 East First Street co-op, for example, is refinancing a $470,000 mortgage with a new $600,000 mortgage. Steve Miller, president of Plymouth Management Group, which manages the building, said that the desire to refinance led the company to approach Mr. Padian, who offered a higher credit line if the board approved energy-related improvements.
 ''It needs new boilers,'' said Gregory Sherman, who oversees work on existing buildings for a consulting firm called Bright Power, which reviewed 54 East First Street. ''They had an antiquated heat timer and a dumbwaiter shaft, and in the basement they had windows that are sources of heat loss.'' 
 Mr. Sherman said that like many older buildings, this one had longstanding flaws. ''They have a lot of uninsulated pipe in the basement, which was heating the empty basement to a pretty comfortable temperature, and the domestic hot water boiler's current was moving up the flue continuously.''
 The repairs include a ''motorized redamper,'' he explained. ''This ties in the boiler and burner so that when the boiler fires, the flue damper allows the gas to escape up to the apartments. But at all other times, which is probably 80 percent of the time, you want that damper closed.''
 Mr. Padian said the investments were likely to pay for themselves well in advance of loans coming due. ''The payback is four to five years,'' he said.
 As the program makes more loans, Mr. Lappin said, it could create business lines for his organization and for other companies. For banks that have inherited a host of insolvent buildings, he explained, ''contracting to do retrofits may become a significant part of what we do.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about an initiative to offer mortgages to landlords who fix wasteful energy and water systems misstated the frequency of energy audits for older apartment buildings under proposed New York City regulations. They would be conducted every 10 years, not annually.

HEADLINE: What They Really Believe

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
If you follow the debate around the energy/climate bills working through Congress you will notice that the drill-baby-drill opponents of this legislation are now making two claims. One is that the globe has been cooling lately, not warming, and the other is that America simply can't afford any kind of cap-and-trade/carbon tax. 
 But here is what they also surely believe, but are not saying: They believe the world is going to face a mass plague, like the Black Death, that will wipe out 2.5 billion people sometime between now and 2050. They believe it is much better for America that the world be dependent on oil for energy -- a commodity largely controlled by countries that hate us and can only go up in price as demand increases -- rather than on clean power technologies that are controlled by us and only go down in price as demand increases. And, finally, they believe that people in the developing world are very happy being poor -- just give them a little running water and electricity and they'll be fine. They'll never want to live like us. 
 Yes, the opponents of any tax on carbon to stimulate alternatives to oil must believe all these things because that is the only way their arguments make any sense. Let me explain why by first explaining how I look at this issue.
 I am a clean-energy hawk. Green for me is not just about recycling garbage but about renewing America. That is why I have been saying ''green is the new red, white and blue.'' 
 My argument is simple: I think climate change is real. You don't? That's your business. But there are two other huge trends barreling down on us with energy implications that you simply can't deny. And the way to renew America is for us to take the lead and invent the technologies to address these problems.
 The first is that the world is getting crowded. According to the 2006 U.N. population report, ''The world population will likely increase by 2.5 billion ... passing from the current 6.7 billion to 9.2 billion in 2050. This increase is equivalent to the total size of the world population in 1950, and it will be absorbed mostly by the less developed regions, whose population is projected to rise from 5.4 billion in 2007 to 7.9 billion in 2050.''
 The energy, climate, water and pollution implications of adding another 2.5 billion mouths to feed, clothe, house and transport will be staggering. And this is coming, unless, as the deniers apparently believe, a global pandemic or a mass outbreak of abstinence will freeze world population -- forever.
 Now, add one more thing. The world keeps getting flatter -- more and more people can now see how we live, aspire to our lifestyle and even take our jobs so they can live how we live. So not only are we adding 2.5 billion people by 2050, but many more will live like ''Americans'' -- with American-size homes, American-size cars, eating American-size Big Macs.
 ''What happens when developing nations with soaring vehicle populations get tens of millions of petroleum-powered cars at the same time as the global economy recovers and there's no large global oil supply overhang?'' asks Felix Kramer, the electric car expert who advocates electrifying the U.S. auto fleet and increasingly powering it with renewable energy sources. What happens, of course, is that the price of oil goes through the roof -- unless we develop alternatives. The petro-dictators in Iran, Venezuela and Russia hope we don't. They would only get richer. 
 So either the opponents of a serious energy/climate bill with a price on carbon don't care about our being addicted to oil and dependent on petro-dictators forever or they really believe that we will not be adding 2.5 billion more people who want to live like us, so the price of oil won't go up very far and, therefore, we shouldn't raise taxes to stimulate clean, renewable alternatives and energy efficiency.
 Green hawks believe otherwise. We believe that in a world getting warmer and more crowded with more ''Americans,'' the next great global industry is going to be E.T., or energy technology based on clean power and energy efficiency. It has to be. And we believe that the country that invents and deploys the most E.T. will enjoy the most economic security, energy security, national security, innovative companies and global respect. And we believe that country must be America. If not, our children will never enjoy the standard of living we did. And we believe the best way to launch E.T. is to set a fixed, long-term price on carbon -- combine it with the Obama team's impressive stimulus for green-tech -- and then let the free market and innovation do the rest.
 So, as I said, you don't believe in global warming? You're wrong, but I'll let you enjoy it until your beach house gets washed away. But if you also don't believe the world is getting more crowded with more aspiring Americans -- and that ignoring that will play to the strength of our worst enemies, while responding to it with clean energy will play to the strength of our best technologies -- then you're willfully blind, and you're hurting America's future to boot.

HEADLINE: Labor Fight Ends in Win For Students

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The anti-sweatshop movement at dozens of American universities, from Georgetown to U.C.L.A., has had plenty of idealism and energy, but not many victories.
 Until now. 
 The often raucous student movement announced on Tuesday that it had achieved its biggest victory by far. Its pressure tactics persuaded one of the nation's leading sportswear companies, Russell Athletic, to agree to rehire 1,200 workers in Honduras who lost their jobs when Russell closed their factory soon after the workers had unionized.
 From the time Russell shut the factory last January, the anti-sweatshop coalition orchestrated a nationwide campaign against the company. Most important, the coalition, United Students Against Sweatshops, persuaded the administrations of Boston College, Columbia, Harvard, New York University, Stanford, Michigan, North Carolina and 89 other colleges and universities to sever or suspend their licensing agreements with Russell. The agreements -- some yielding more than $1 million in sales -- allowed Russell to put university logos on T-shirts, sweatshirts and fleeces. 
 Going beyond their campuses, student activists picketed the N.B.A. finals in Orlando and Los Angeles this year to protest the league's licensing agreement with Russell. They distributed fliers inside Sports Authority sporting goods stores and sent Twitter messages to customers of Dick's Sporting Goods to urge them to boycott Russell products. 
 The students even sent activists to knock on Warren Buffett's door in Omaha because his company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns Fruit of the Loom, Russell's parent company.
 ''It's a very important breakthrough,'' said Mel Tenen, who oversees licensing agreements for the University of Miami, the first school to sever ties with Russell. ''It's not often that a major licensee will take such a necessary and drastic step to correct the injustices that affected its workers. This paves the way for us to seriously consider reopening our agreement with Russell.''
 Other colleges are expected to do the same. Analysts say the college market occupies a significant part of Russell's business. Because Fruit of the Loom does not detail Russell's sales, it is not known how large a part. 
 In its agreement, not only did Russell agree to reinstate the dismissed workers and open a new plant in Honduras as a unionized factory, it also pledged not to fight unionization at its seven existing factories there.
 Mike Powers, a Cornell official who is on the board of the Worker Rights Consortium, said Cornell had canceled its licensing agreement because it viewed Russell's closing of the Honduras factory as a flagrant violation of the university's code of conduct, which calls for honoring workers' freedom of association. He applauded Russell's agreement, which was reached with the consortium and union leaders in Honduras over the weekend.
 ''This is a landmark event in the history of workers' rights and the codes of conduct that we expect our licensees to follow,'' Mr. Powers said. ''My hat is off to Russell.''
 John Shivel, a spokesman for Russell and Fruit of the Loom, said, ''We are very pleased with the agreement between Russell Athletic and the Workers Rights Consortium, and look forward to its implementation.''
 He declined to discuss why Russell had adopted a friendlier attitude toward unionization after years of aggressively fighting unions. 
 In a statement Russell released jointly with the apparel workers' union in Honduras, the company said the agreement was ''intended to foster workers' rights in Honduras and establish a harmonious'' relationship.
 ''This agreement represents a significant achievement in the history of the apparel sector in Honduras and Central America,'' the joint statement said.
 In the past, the Honduran workers condemned Russell's behavior, saying that it had fired 145 workers in 2007 for supporting a union. The union's vice president, Norma Mejia, said at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholders' meeting last May that she had received death threats for helping lead the union. Russell denied the assertion.
 Union leaders in Honduras hailed the agreement, which would put hundreds of laid-off employees back to work in a country whose economy has been hit by a political crisis over who will lead it.
 ''For us, it was very important to receive the support of the universities,'' Moises Alvarado, president of the union at the closed plant in Choloma, said by telephone on Tuesday. ''We are impressed by the social conscience of the students in the United States.'' 
 This was in no way an overnight victory -- it came after 10 years of building a movement that persuaded scores of universities to adopt detailed codes of conduct for the factories used by licensees like Russell. In addition, the students, sometimes through lengthy sit-ins, pressured their officials to create and finance an independent monitoring group, the Worker Rights Consortium, that inspected factories to make sure they complied with the universities' codes.
 When the consortium issued a detailed report accusing Russell of violating workers' rights, United Students Against Sweatshops began its nationwide campaign.
 Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, which has more than 170 universities as members, said: ''This represents the maturation of the universities' codes of conduct. There's a recognition by the universities of their ability to influence the actions of important brands and change outcomes for the better.''
 He said the agreement was ''unprecedented'' in terms of scope and size and in ''the transformative impact it can have in one of the hardest regions of the world to win respect for workers' rights.''
 Mr. Nova also praised Russell for changing course. ''I think the executives at Russell recognized it was time for a new approach,'' he said. ''They decided it was important for the success of their company.'' 
 As part of its campaign, United Students Against Sweatshops contacted students at more than 100 campuses where it did not have chapters, getting them involved, including at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, where Fruit of the Loom has its headquarters. The group helped arrange a letter signed by 65 members of Congress, who voiced ''grave concern about reports of severe violations'' of labor rights at Russell.
 This time around, the students did not feel the need to resort to sit-ins to persuade university administrators.
 ''The schools remember our sit-ins of the past,'' said Dida El-Sourady, a senior at the University of North Carolina. ''There's an institutional memory that students will escalate their tactics, and this could become a very big deal, a lot bigger than people holding signs.''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Show Few Inflation Pressures

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wholesale prices in the United States increased only slightly in October, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing concerns that inflation might soon emerge as a threat to the economic recovery in a period of extraordinarily low interest rates.
 A separate report on industrial production showed weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, which is grappling with tepid consumer demand. The stock markets, meanwhile, rose slightly. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, and trading volume remained light.
 David M. Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said investors took the mixed signals on the economic data in stride. 
 ''It's a two-steps-forward, one-step-back type of environment,'' he said. ''Many people have worried inflation will snap back with a vengeance, but there still seems to be so much global overcapacity that in the short term we can focus on the play at hand.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.
 The Labor Department's wholesale prices report said that higher food and energy costs contributed to a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent rise in the producer price index, which measures the cost of goods to companies. That fell short of the 0.5 percent jump economists had forecast.
 The index factors in the cost of items like gasoline, food and construction materials to businesses. It is often considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation because it monitors changes in prices before products reach store shelves. 
 The data showed a 1.6 percent increase in energy prices in October, driven by higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Food prices, particularly fresh and dried vegetables, also increased 1.6 percent.
 Excluding food and energy costs, which tend to be volatile, the price of goods to businesses fell 0.6 percent in October. 
 Inflation has been a chief concern of policy makers as the government tries to revive the economy by keeping interest rates extremely low and pumping billions of dollars into the economy. At the same time, the dollar has fallen to 15-month lows, stoking fears about inflation arising from higher prices for imports. 
 Even as the Labor Department's numbers suggested inflation was under control, some economists said that was only because high unemployment and unused factory capacity had kept inflationary pressures in check.
 While the price of finished goods remained steady, Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, said that the price of crude goods, those in the earliest stages of production, increased in an indication that some inflation might be in the pipeline. 
 ''There is little doubt that over the last few months, inflation has picked up in the economy,'' Mr. Greenhaus said. ''But we're nowhere near concerns about a crazy outbreak.''
 Many analysts say they expect the Fed to keep interest rates low for much of next year. A report on the state of manufacturing released Tuesday by the Fed said industrial production rose 0.1 percent in October, falling short of the 0.4 increase projected by Wall Street analysts. Manufacturing output fell 0.1 percent, the first decline in four months. 
 In September, industrial production increased 0.6 percent.
 Gold climbed $2.10 to $1,141.30. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 14/32. The yield fell to 3.32 percent from 3.33 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week and 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: A Flood of Applicants to a Shrinking Police Dept.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
After years of struggling to lure top-quality recruits, the New York Police Department has found that the prolonged recession -- coupled with a significant increase in first-year salaries -- has generated new interest in police careers.
 Applications to the Police Academy rose 54 percent in 2008 from 2007, when there were 17,212 applicants. The wider pool of candidates has enabled the department to become more diverse by the year; the percentage of black, Hispanic and Asian officers has steadily risen since 2000, as has the percentage of female officers.
 The department is also better educated than in the past: in 1999, 17 percent of the force had four-year college degrees; this year, the figure rose to 24 percent.
 However, the department has been unable to fully take advantage of the surplus of talented applicants because of hiring restrictions tied to the city's budget crisis. Over the next year, the department will continue to shrink through attrition to 34,304 members, about 6,000 fewer than in 2001. 
 ''When we had the money, we didn't have the people,'' the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said in an interview. ''Now we have the people and we don't have the money. We have people knocking on our door and we can't do anything.''
 In interviews, rookie officers said that two economic factors -- the poor job market and a competitive police salary -- played a large role in their decision to join the force. The base salary for first-year officers, which fell to $25,100 from nearly $40,000 in 2005, has risen to $41,975; after five and a half years, the total compensation -- including holiday pay, uniform allowance and night differential and longevity pay -- rises to $90,829. After 20 years, officers may retire with a pension equal to half their salary. 
 Officer Ricardo Montilla, who had been a financial adviser for Washington Mutual in Brooklyn, said he had hit a wall in his civilian pay, and joined the force in December. 
 ''I was making a lot of money, and then not making money,'' he said. ''As the economy got worse, the investments dried up and I needed more stability. The police offer a pension that's unheard of.''
 In the current first-year class of rookies, Officer Montilla, 31, is one of several refugees from the financial industry, an uncommon breeding ground for police officers. He and two academy classmates who had also worked in finance said they had been willing to give up larger salaries partly because they were afraid they would not be able to support their families if the economy continued to slow.
 A year and a half ago, Henry Chung was an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch, monitoring billions of dollars the firm traded on a daily basis.
 Last week, he found himself, in his capacity as a patrol officer in Jackson Heights, Queens, chasing after a man who had slashed another man's neck with a razor blade. He grabbed the man from behind, pushed him up against a wall and handcuffed him.
 ''It's a little different than looking at a computer monitor trying to figure out why there's a million bucks missing in the firm's accounts,'' Officer Chung, 34, said in a telephone interview. 
 The current group of first-year officers has another distinction: the highest percentage of four-year college graduates in the department's history. A bachelor's degree is not required, although applicants are required to have 60 college credits or two years of full-time active service with the military.
 In the Police Academy class that graduated in December 2008, 281 of the 1,126 graduates had four-year degrees (about 25 percent). In the class that graduated in July, 113 of 256 officers had four-year degrees (about 44 percent). In the current class studying in the academy, 144 of the 261 potential officers have four-year degrees (about 55 percent).
 From 2005 to 2007, when the economy was stronger, the city could hire more officers, but it was hampered by the lower starting salary.
 One advantage the department has is that it can be more selective about recruits as interest has increased. Two former Police Academy officials said in interviews that they could not recall anyone during their tenure who had worked on Wall Street and become a police officer.
 ''There were teachers, security guards, painters, military, almost everything, even sales, but I don't remember anyone from Wall Street,'' said John Cerar, who spent 15 of his 26 years on the force working at the Police Academy as a supervisor, officer and administrator and retired in 1999.
 Although police officials characterized the trend in glowing terms, Vincent E. Henry, a former commanding officer at the Police Academy and the author of two books about police work, said the department might have to adjust to having more highly skilled officers. 
 ''Many Ivy League graduates joined the force and different forces around the country in the 1970s,'' said Dr. Henry, who retired from the force in 2002 and is now the director of the Homeland Security Management Institute at Long Island University. ''A good number didn't stay on because the organizations were not able to keep them interested, and there was resentment from others of their degrees.''
 Dr. Henry said, however, that the economy and the increased interest in the force presented the department with ''a tremendous opportunity'' to attract officers with significant life experiences.
 For Officer Gerard Salvia, the Police Department provided an opportunity to break away from what he said was the hierarchical nature of Wall Street, where, he said, he thought he would not advance. Unlike many of his classmates in the academy, Officer Salvia, who worked as a trader's assistant at LaBranche & Company, did not have a four-year degree.
 ''Guys like me don't make managing director or partner; that was how it was 30 years ago,'' Officer Salvia said. ''Now, at least at the Police Department, I have the same opportunity as every police officer. If you want to go to all the special units, you need to do something to earn it. It's not so much that you are part of a club.''
 When Officer Chung is around colleagues at his station house in Jackson Heights, he said, he is often chided for leaving his lucrative profession.
 ''They ask me if my secretary is still working for me,'' Officer Chung said. ''They ask me if I have any stories how we high rollers used to do it. They ask me where they can find a fancy steak. And how much were you making and why were you doing this.''
 Last week, Officer Montilla said he arrested a 400-pound man in a housing project in Harlem who had 10 bags of crack cocaine. 
 ''The man was saying he was going to kill my mother, and kill my family,'' Officer Montilla said. He said the angriest person he dealt with before was someone who wanted a better rate on municipal bonds. 
 He added: ''Most days you would just get in at 9 a.m., get your coffee, read the newspapers and start making calls. Every day was the same.''

HEADLINE: A Local Push, Timed to Holidays, to Loosen Wallets

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THROUGH the decades, marketers have veered between ''Think global, act local'' and ''Think local, act global.'' At one point, someone even coined a portmanteau word, ''glocal,'' which sounded like a variety of the Glo-Coat brand of floor wax sold by S.C. Johnson.
 Now, the pendulum seems to be veering toward marketing that is focused locally. It is particularly true as new technologies like local search make it easier to concentrate on the grass roots in a hyperlocal way. An example of the trend is a campaign being introduced for the Christmas shopping season by NYC & Company, the city's tourism organization. 
 The intent of the campaign, created internally by NYC & Company, is made clear by its theme: ''NYC extreme local.'' How extremely local are the promotions being advertised? They last 24 days; cover 15 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan; involve two sponsors, American Express and AT&T; and include more than 650 stores, shops, restaurants, cultural attractions and other places where residents of and visitors to New York City can spend time -- and money.
 Ah, money. The campaign is another example of the efforts being made to persuade nervous consumers to open their wallets during the important holiday shopping period.
 There are indications that retail sales may not be as dire as had been feared, among them a statement on Tuesday by Home Depot that it was seeing ''some positive signs of stabilization.'' Still, the concerns over high unemployment are leading many retailers to make unusual pump-priming moves.
 For instance, Wal-Mart Stores announced, also on Tuesday, that it would cut prices this weekend on some items to levels similar to the specials typically offered on the day after Thanksgiving.
 ''It's been a tough year,'' said Jane Reiss, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at NYC & Company, so ''we know it's going to be tough'' to woo shoppers, diners and sightseers for the next five weeks.
 That is why the goal is to offer ''something that's a little special at holiday time,'' she added, in the form of the campaign, which she described as the first for Christmas of its scope and scale.
 The campaign includes print and outdoor advertising, ads online, social media like Facebook and Twitter and content on a microsite, or special Web site (nycgo.com). There will also be an offer from American Express to visit a Web site (amexnetwork.com/extremelocal) and register an American Express card; if that card is used at three or more participating businesses between Nov. 27 and Dec. 20 to make at least $300 in purchases, the card holder will receive a $50 credit from American Express on a forthcoming statement.
 The campaign ''really dovetailed nicely with some of the things we were thinking about in this economic climate as we approach Christmas and the holiday season,'' said Lisa Skiptunis, vice president of client management for merchant services in the Americas at American Express in New York.
 Although American Express has taken part in other promotions with NYC & Company like the annual Restaurant Weeks each summer and winter, ''I don't think we've done anything like this close to the holidays,'' she added. And the ''extreme local'' campaign covers more than twice as many businesses that accept American Express cards than a typical Restaurant Week promotion. 
 American Express is devoting more time and attention to localized campaigns, some of which can be found on a Web site (amexnetwork.com/travel). There are deals for cardholders in markets like Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, offering discounts on hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and other attractions. For AT&T, the partnership with NYC & Company represents its first such locally focused campaign, said Chris Schembri, vice president for media services at AT&T in Dallas.
 ''What I'm trying to do right now,'' he said, ''is figure out how to crack the code'' on similar campaigns in major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, so AT&T could demonstrate the benefits of its localized interactive products like yellowpages.com and yp.com online as well as YPmobile (m.yp.com) on mobile devices and a Yellow Pages application for the iPhone.
 AT&T is also bringing to the ''NYC extreme local'' campaign elements of a national campaign it is sponsoring to help promote the coming film from Summit Entertainment, ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon.''
 The media spending for the campaign by NYC & Company is valued at $2 million. That is an estimate because it includes donated and discounted media like the free space on bus shelters that the organization receives as part of the city's agreement with Cemusa, the outdoor-advertising company.
 ''This will be a robust program,'' Ms. Reiss said, ''because we wanted it to be felt at a crowded time, when there is a lot of retail advertising out there.''

HEADLINE: Period Piece, Modern Issues: Dealing With Financial Woes

BYLINE: By KEN JAWOROWSKI

 BODY:
The treasure hunters at the Actors Company Theater have unearthed another jewel with ''The Late Christopher Bean,'' a comedy seldom seen in New York since its Broadway premiere in 1932. It's a play that has remained fresh and funny, proving once again that a strong script is rarely tarnished by time. 
 ''Bean'' is set outside Boston in the Haggett household, where worries over money are persistent. Visitors soon arrive from New York, seeking paintings by Christopher Bean, a boarder who once lived with the Haggetts and died 10 years earlier. Bean has recently been decreed ''not merely the greatest American painter, but one of the great masters of all times.'' 
 Prices for his works have skyrocketed, and paintings the Haggetts may or may not own could make them rich. In a twisty plot that is wholly charming, almost everyone is soon scheming to profit.
 Along with its commendable mission to restage forgotten plays, the Actors Company has put an impressive amount of work into its production. The set, by Charlie Corcoran, shows a sharp eye for detail, as do Martha Hally's costumes and Ben Stanton's lighting. 
 The cast of nine is often as skilled. Though the actors' timing occasionally misfires -- a number of the jokes elicit wide smiles rather than the big laughs that such writing deserves -- the ensemble, directed by Jenn Thompson, is nevertheless engaging. James Murtaugh as Dr. Haggett and Jessiee Datino as his daughter Susan are particularly effective.
 While ''Bean'' has some quaint features of the period -- telegrams arrive and are read aloud; young lovers gaze at each other longingly -- such moments hardly feel stuffy. And with all its talk of greed, a weak economy and a fickle art market, the topics could have come from this morning's newspaper. Written by Sidney Howard (who would later win an Oscar for his screenplay for ''Gone With the Wind'') and based on a French comedy, ''The Late Christopher Bean'' is a happy rediscovery. It's a play that passes the test of time with the highest of marks. 
 ''The Late Christopher Bean'' continues through Dec. 5 at the Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200.

HEADLINE: Once Wary of the Web, Luxury Brands Embrace It

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
THE luxury goods industry, struggling through a recession that has threatened some well-known names with extinction, is trying to use technology to its advantage.
Many in the fashion business remain wary of the Internet, partly because of continuing legal battles over online sales of counterfeit goods and concerns about diluting carefully honed brand images. Many companies also have failed to execute online storefronts successfully. But executives say that attitudes are softening as brands realize that the Web provides one of the last untapped sources of potential growth.
 Federico Marchetti, the founder of Yoox, a company in Milan that runs retailing sites for luxury brands like Valentino, Emilio Pucci and Jil Sander, said many labels were skeptical not long ago. 
 ''Now,'' he said, ''it is the opposite.''
 The move to capitalize on the Web has become a financial imperative. Analysts at Bain & Company estimate that the sales of luxury goods will fall to 154 billion euros this year ($229 billion), from 170 billion euros in 2008. It is unlikely that online revenue -- still only a tiny fraction of the total -- will make up the difference soon.
 One of the most successful ventures on the Web has been Net-a-Porter, a site based in London that sells high-end fashion and accessories, delivering them to homes or offices in black boxes. Though sales in the United States slowed during the depth of the recession, they have since recovered and have continued to rise at double-digit rates in other markets, the company said. It expects sales this year to top $:100 million ($168 million), up from $:82 million last year.
 ''It just made a lot of sense to allow women to shop when they wanted to shop, how they wanted to shop -- at work, at home, in bedroom,'' said Natalie Massenet, the company's founder.
 At a time when trundling along high-end strips like Bond Street in London or Avenue Montaigne in Paris with an armful of shopping bags seems out of touch with reality, Net-a-Porter may have benefited from the greater discretion that its service offers. Last year, to cloak purchases even more, the company added a brown-bag delivery option. This year, in another bit of good timing that Ms. Massenet attributed to luck rather than foresight, the company added a new site selling fashions from previous seasons at reduced prices.
 Customer overlap between the sites is only 6 percent, Ms. Massenet said, with fashionistas frequenting the original Net-a-Porter and bargain hunters turning to the new site, outnet.com. 
 That ought to comfort luxury executives worried that selling online might undermine the high-end appeal of their wares -- and the high prices that come with such exclusivity.
 Some individual brands that previously refrained from selling online have recently embraced the Internet. Hugo Boss, the German clothier, started introducing Internet shops in Europe last year. Now it is accelerating its online efforts, planning to open similar stores in the United States early next year and in Asia the year after, said Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, the chief executive.
 Mr. Lahrs said Hugo Boss expected to sell more than 50 million euros of goods online within two years, up from a little more than 10 million euros this year.
 While some labels are now trying to make up for lost time, others remain cautious about the pitfalls of the Internet.
 Led by the largest company in the business, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, luxury brand owners have fought a series of legal battles across several continents with Internet companies like Google and eBay, contending that they aided in the online sale of counterfeit goods. Courts have issued mixed rulings, sometimes siding with the brand owners and fining the technology companies, and in other cases agreeing that sufficient steps were being taken to root out fakes.
 Some executives also remain reluctant to invest heavily in digital initiatives because of costly failures in the past. Uche Okonkwo, a Paris-based consultant, said that brand owners are ''many steps behind the clients, when they should be several steps ahead of them.''
 One brand that has won plaudits from analysts for its efforts is Burberry. This month, it created a social networking site that allows owners of Burberry's trench coats to exchange stories about them.
 Christopher Bailey, Burberry's chief creative officer, said high-end brands should go further in trying to give Web stores the rich texture of physical stores. 
 ''Whether they are walking into our store on Bond Street or tapping in from India or China, it's about making sure the consumer is getting the same experience,'' he said.

Ten months ago, President Obama said a time would come for Wall Street to make profits and pay bonuses, but ''now's not that time.'' But it appears that was exactly when Wall Street began to return to profitability. 
 In a report released Tuesday by Thomas P. DiNapoli, the comptroller of New York State, Wall Street profits in 2009 are on track to exceed the record set three years ago, at the height of the credit bubble. The report noted that the four largest investment firms in Manhattan -- Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase -- earned $22.5 billion in the first nine months, in contrast to losses of more than $40.3 billion in 2008, primarily at Merrill. 
 ''The national economy is slowly improving, but Wall Street has recovered much faster than anyone had envisioned,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement. 
 Net revenue at the four firms, which excludes interest expenses, reached a high of $57.7 billion in the second quarter, Mr. DiNapoli said. Though total revenue has been higher in previous quarters, the banks benefited from a sharp decline in interest payments, $5 billion in the second quarter from a high of $76.3 billion in the last quarter of 2007.
 Fueling the gains were extraordinary profits from the firms' own securities trading accounts as they borrowed at near-zero interest rates and put the money to work in the securities markets. Member firms on the New York Stock Exchange earned a record $35.7 billion for their broker-dealer operations in the first six months, $8.9 billion more that the previous high in 2000, the state comptroller said.
 In turn, the profits are contributing to a resurgence of bonuses on Wall Street. Six of the top American bank holding companies set aside $112 billion for salaries and bonuses, including deferred payments, in the first nine months, Mr. DiNapoli reported. The six banks are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.
 If the profits continue, bonuses at the six banks could exceed the $162 billion paid 2007 -- the year before the financial crisis hit stock markets. Though compensation has rebounded at the four largest banks, Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley reported a decline in overall compensation.
 Employment in the securities industry in New York City fell by 28,300 jobs since its peak in November 2007, the comptroller said. The report predicts, however, that job losses in the sector are unlikely to exceed 35,000 by the end of the year, a much smaller number than previously forecast.
 The gains in compensation will not necessarily be reflected in New York's tax collections because the compensation overhaul could cause firms to sharply restrict cash bonuses.
 The amount of business tax credits accumulated by Wall Street firms from last year's record losses could also restrain tax receipts, Mr. DiNapoli said.
 He estimated the decline in tax collections from Wall Street-related activities next year could be 5 to 20 percent. 
 ''Wall Street remains the engine that drives New York's economy,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement. ''It's encouraging that the industry is recovering faster than forecast.''

HEADLINE: Training of Afghan Police By Europe Is Found Lacking

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Two and a half years after it was started, the European Union's police training mission in Afghanistan is understaffed, lacks adequate security and transportation, and has yet to develop a uniform training program, according to diplomats and security experts involved in the mission. 
 ''The E.U. mission is a logistical nightmare,'' said Piotr Krawczyk, a security expert at the Polish Institute of International Affairs and former deputy head of the Polish Embassy in Kabul. ''There is complete lack of coordination between the E.U. institutions in Afghanistan and between the other big players, including the United Nations and NATO.''
 Training of the Afghan Army and police is considered crucial to the ability of foreign troops to eventually leave Afghanistan, where a resurgent Taliban is trying to topple the Western-backed government.
 In the coming weeks, NATO will start its own police training program that will be financed by the United States. 
 Javier Solana, the union's foreign policy chief, agreed in 2007 that the 27-member bloc would take over police training from Germany after the bloc had come under pressure from NATO to play a greater role in building up Afghan security forces.
 Now, Mr. Solana is calling on member states ''to provide the mission with the personnel and logistical resources necessary to implement its mandate.'' 
 ''The bottom line is that there is a lack of political will among the member states and a lack of security on the ground for the E.U. to do the job properly,'' said Kees Homan, an Afghanistan expert at Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations.
 This sense of frustration was expressed in an unusually blunt letter written three weeks ago by Mr. Solana and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency. The letter, sent to all of the bloc's foreign, defense and interior ministers, criticized member states for failing to provide the necessary personnel.
 ''The mission is long overdue. It remains significantly short of staff,'' they wrote. They added that ''an additional 130 well-trained men and women, mainly police officers, and more logistical support to deploy outside Kabul across the country'' were needed. ''Now more than ever, it is essential that we redress this. All member states can do more,'' they added.
 ''Delivering on our political commitments is a matter of E.U. credibility vis-a-vis the Afghan government and the entire international community,'' they wrote.
 European diplomats say member states have been reluctant to send personnel because of the danger, low salaries and the lack of clear guidelines over training a police force that was initially supposed to total 96,000 but is expected to rise to 160,000 by 2011.

HEADLINE: $500 Million And Apology From a Bank

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

DATELINE: How much good will can an apology 

 BODY:
and half a billion dollars -- buy? A lot, Goldman Sachs is hoping. 
 After first staunchly defending its outsize profits and pay, and then bristling at calls for restraint in these tough economic times, Goldman is trying a new tack: It is apologizing for past mistakes that led to the financial crisis -- and sharing at least some of its riches. 
 A little more than a week after Goldman's chairman and chief executive drew fire for saying the Wall Street giant was ''doing God's work,'' the bank said Tuesday that it would spend $500 million -- or about 3 percent of the $16.7 billion it has so far set aside to pay its employees this year -- to help thousands of small businesses recover from the recession. 
 At the same time, the executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, also showed a bit of humility, acknowledging at a conference in New York that Goldman had made mistakes, and that it was sorry. ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret,'' he said. ''We apologize.''
 It was the clearest public statement of regret yet from Goldman, and a few hours later, as if to underscore that apology, the bank said that it was working with its largest shareholder, the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, to help 10,000 small businesses. The bank will offer them business and management education, mentoring and access to capital.
 Across Wall Street, banks have regained their profitability -- but not their public standing. With big banks minting money while many ordinary Americans are struggling, the financial industry has become the object of derision on ''Saturday Night Live'' and in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine, which branded Goldman ''the great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.'' 
 Goldman insisted Tuesday that its new charitable initiative, the largest in its history, was not motivated by its current public relations headache. 
 The program, which Bloomberg News first reported a few hours before the announcement, will be guided by an advisory council led by Mr. Blankfein; Mr. Buffett; and Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard University, and also includes other big name backers like R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School. 
 Goldman Sachs has bounced back spectacularly from the financial crisis and is planning to pay out billions of dollars in bonuses for the year. Goldman says it has to pay its employees well to retain top talent.
 But while its fortunes have soared, its reputation has sunk. 
 The reputation problems of banks have thrust Wall Street's public relations professionals to the forefront. The main securities industry trade group has taken steps to bolster its image by hiring Brunswick, a top public relations firm, whose partners include the former head of public affairs and the chief of staff to Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary. 
 But Goldman's image problems have been the most acute on Wall Street, and it has become a punching bag for an industry that is seen by many to have benefited unfairly from billions in taxpayer dollars. Goldman has tried a gamut of different strategies to fix its blemished image.
 Mr. Blankfein has assumed a higher profile, giving speeches in which he has set out Goldman's position on financial reform. In October, Goldman announced it was doubling the size of its charitable foundation, which focuses on education, by $200 million -- a step that backfired when it was interpreted as a move to silence public criticism. Its effort to court the press by inviting journalists into its Manhattan headquarters to explain how exactly it makes its billions also fell apart when Mr. Blankfein made his remark about ''doing God's work,'' and the public anger has not died down.
 On Monday, 200 protesters marched to Goldman's offices to protest its bonuses, according to Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, who led the protesters.
 He cautiously welcomed Goldman's step on Tuesday.
 ''It's a down payment, a step forward and hopefully a precursor of a different discussion -- in the long run, how do we build an economy where everyone can share in the success?'' he said. ''But if this is an isolated public relations activity, it's insufficient.''
 Goldman said it had been working on the small-business project for nearly a year, and first considered committing the $500 million four months ago -- long before its latest public relations woes. But, coincidence or not, the program usefully allies Goldman with Mr. Buffett, a man whose reputation as one of America's wisest and most straightforward investors remains intact, and who rode to Goldman's rescue last year in the darkest days of the financial crisis with billions of dollars of new investment. 
 In an interview, Mr. Buffett said he was approached by Goldman to take part in the effort ''last month or so.'' He said he was not committing any money of his own but would provide ''advice from the 35,000-foot level.''
 ''I would not be doing this if I didn't think there was going to be a significant net benefit to small-business owners in this country,'' Mr. Buffett said, adding that he was not disturbed by Goldman's image problems and defended its hefty profits. ''They are making a lot of money now,'' he said. ''I am all for it and this program is a beneficiary.''
 Under the plan, Goldman will provide $200 million to pay for small-business owners to get business and management education at local community colleges and other places -- the first program will be at La Guardia Community College in Queens, New York. 
 The plan will also provide mentoring and networking services. Goldman said it had a long line of its own staff willing to take part. 
 And in a third prong of the program, Goldman is giving $300 million in loans and grants to small businesses. Some of the $500 million will come from $400 million in its foundation.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 18 about Goldman Sachs's response to criticism of its high pay and its role in the financial crisis, using information from a Bloomberg News article, quoted imprecisely from remarks by its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, at a conference in New York. Mr. Blankfein said, ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and we have reasons to regret and apologize for.'' He did not say: ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret. We apologize.'' The imprecise quotation was repeated in an article in Week in Review on Sunday. (The quotation appeared correctly in an editorial on Sunday.)

HEADLINE: Village Split On Detainees As Neighbors

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago.

DATELINE: THOMSON, Ill. 

 BODY:
Once federal officials said they might move terrorism suspects from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a nearly empty prison here, residents of this faded rural village began debating what they should fear most -- the suspects or the downward spiral of the economy here. 
 ''It's the terrorist-type thing that gets me,'' said Donald L. Pauley, 64, who added that he felt queasy at the notion of keeping such prisoners here, 150 miles west of Chicago, a place where everyone says the signs describing the population as 600 are overestimates by now. 
 Not even talk of added security measures, of a second fence around the prison or of increased law enforcement along the Mississippi River, which is less than a mile away, was enough to assure him, Mr. Pauley said. 
 But in one example of the split that is playing out all over this village, even within houses, Mr. Pauley's wife, Merrie Jo, said she was firmly behind turning over the prison, the Thomson Correctional Center, to federal authorities. 
 ''We need the jobs,'' Ms. Pauley, 64, who was village president here for 27 years, said as she and Mr. Pauley dined at the Sunrise Restaurant, one of the few still open in this part of Carroll County, where unemployment was 10.5 percent in September. ''This place has been changing, and we've been going in the wrong direction.'' 
 The notion that a terrorism suspect could slip away into Thomson without being noticed was unimaginable to Ms. Pauley, who added, ''If a stranger comes around here, everyone knows within 20 minutes, believe me.''
 Most people here learned over the weekend that the Obama administration considered Thomson a leading option in its plan to close the military detention facility in Cuba. Federal officials toured the prison on Monday.
 Afterward, they offered no timeline for making a highly sensitive decision that has already raised concerns among residents in other towns whose prisons are also being considered, and has stirred a fierce, partisan debate among state political leaders.
 The rhetoric has intensified. Representative Donald Manzullo, a Republican whose district includes the prison and who opposes the Cuba proposal, described the terror suspects in a local television interview Monday as ''really, really mean people whose job it is to kill people, driven by some savage religion.'' (On Tuesday, his spokesman said Mr. Manzullo was not referring to Islam itself, but to the suspects' particular beliefs, which he said had perverted the peaceful nature of the religion.)
 Leaders in Illinois have said that moving the prisoners here could bring as many as 3,200 jobs to the area. They also say they believe that federal officials are looking at prisons in Colorado and Montana; and in August, federal officials toured a state prison in Michigan that closed this fall because of budget cuts. 
 The prospect of housing terror suspects has reopened a battle over the prison that began years ago. 
 In the 1990s, residents were divided over whether a state prison should be put here in the first place. Some said it would disrupt the quiet village once known for its watermelons. Others said jobs were desperately needed, particularly given the closings of several industrial plants and so many businesses -- two grocery stores, the five-and-dime, a barber, a pool hall. 
 ''Like most rural places, people just went away,'' said Lee Schmidt, 92, who called the Cuba proposal ''lousy.''
 The original prison debate was intense, sometimes personal, residents say; Ms. Pauley, who was village president then and supported the idea, said some people boycotted the ice cream shop she owned. Some business owners on Main Street still will not talk about the prison, saying they fear losing business.
 By 2001, the prison -- beige, pristine, surrounded by electrified fence and able to hold at least 1,600 prisoners -- was built, at a cost to the state of $128 million. But then it sat. No prisoners came. Year after year, local leaders here said, the state said it could not pay to operate it. In 2006, about 200 minimum-security inmates were finally moved here, but that created only about 70 jobs. 
 Over the years, new hopes have been raised, then dashed. Not long ago, local leaders said, an older state prison was rumored to be closing, and there was talk that its inmates would come here. Some residents even trained to be guards. But the move never happened.
 And so some here view the Guantanamo proposal as just another flirtation.
 ''We've been told so many things,'' said Colleen McGinnis, who works at Kyle's, a tavern her husband owns on Main Street. ''They say this could happen, but they said that before. When I see a prisoner walk in, I'll believe.''
 On both sides of the issue, there are questions. Some opponents of moving Guantanamo inmates here wondered aloud: How would they be transported safely? Might they target Chicago, for its tall buildings? Would they draw family and friends to the area? 
 Supporters wondered: How many jobs will this really mean? How many businesses will move in to serve that many prison workers? How much will the federal authorities pay the state?
 Others, like Elmer Monshower, 61, vacillated. ''So long as the terrorists leave our duck stands alone and our deer stands alone, we're tickled to have them -- everyone needs jobs,'' he said. 
 But later he added: ''I still don't understand, though. Why bring them here? Why not leave them where they are now?''
 Still, Jerry Hebeler, the village president who suggested the idea to Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, said he believed that people were mainly in agreement. 
 ''We're hurting here, hurting bad,'' he said Tuesday, after touring the prison Monday with federal officials.
 ''When you hear the word 'terrorist,' even I flare up a bit, but after I heard what they had to say about security, I really feel like I can rest easy,'' Mr. Hebeler said. ''I am not going to chase jobs that put in jeopardy the safety and security of my friends.''

HEADLINE: A Stimulus That Could Save Money

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The one highly visible success of the stimulus bill has been the cash-for-clunkers program. It induced a boom in vehicle sales this summer that clearly would not have happened otherwise.
 The rest of the stimulus bill has created a lot of jobs -- 700,000 to 1.5 million, according to economists' estimates. But it has done so in thousands of little ways: scattered construction projects, plugged-up school budgets and the like. Politically, these measures are not popular enough to create a groundswell for more of them.
 And the economy still needs help. So White House officials are looking at creating a new version of cash for clunkers -- this time for home weatherization. 
 John Doerr, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, and former President Bill Clinton have separately suggested versions of the idea to the White House. Mr. Doerr calls his proposal, which would give households money to pay for weatherization projects, ''cash for caulkers.'' Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's chief of staff, told me, ''It's one of the top things he's looking at.'' 
 The idea has a lot to recommend it. The housing bust has idled contractors and construction workers, who could be put to work insulating homes and caulking air leaks. Many households, meanwhile, would save substantial money -- not to mention help the climate -- by weatherizing their homes, research by McKinsey & Company has shown. All in all, a cash-for-caulkers program seems like a promising part of the jobs program for 2010 that Mr. Obama has suggested he is planning. 
 But I would also mention one point of caution: the details of any caulkers plan will matter enormously. Weatherizing a home, as I recently discovered, turns out to be a lot more complicated than buying a car. 
 This year, my wife and I had an energy audit done on our home. We were interested in finding out if we could save money and, given the attention that weatherizing was starting to get, I figured it could also make for good column fodder. For $400, an auditor spent hours scouring our house, with the help of a big fan he set up in our front door and an infrared camera. He produced a full-color, 13-page detailed report, informing us of the leaks in our house, and he was also willing to tell us which changes were usually a waste of money (new windows). 
 Even so, we are still trying to figure out which weatherization projects we should do. The whole package would probably cost $4,500 and save us something like $400 a year. We may not stay in the house nearly long enough to justify the investment.
 Such concerns are typical. How do you find an auditor? How do you know whether you should seal a few ducts or pay $2,000 for new insulation? Which of the existing subsidies -- state and federal -- might you qualify for? 
 Mr. Doerr and Mr. Clinton are well aware of these problems. Mr. Clinton has sent the White House a memorandum written by his foundation staff that lays out the reasons people don't weatherize their homes. Mr. Doerr, who sits on a board of outside economic advisers to Mr. Obama that is working on a formal cash-for-caulkers proposal, told me that his goal was to ''keep it really simple so we can do it really fast.'' 
 The Doerr plan would cost $23 billion over two years. Most of the money would go for incentive payments, generally $2,000 to $4,000, for weatherization projects. The homeowner would always have to pay at least 50 percent of the project's total cost. About $3 billion would be set aside for retailers and contractors in the hope that they would promote the program, much as car dealerships promoted cash for clunkers. (Mr. Doerr says he owns no stake in any weatherization companies.)
 The Clinton plan depends on the reallocation of clean energy money from the stimulus bill that has not yet been spent. It covers not just houses and apartments but also commercial and industrial buildings. 
 Perhaps most intriguing is its proposal to help homeowners and building owners who are nervous they will end up selling their property before a weatherization project has paid for itself. Under the Clinton plan, they could add the project's cost to their long-term property tax bill, effectively splitting the cost with the next owner. The New York State Legislature approved such a program on Monday.
 All these efforts would lead to more weatherization. But I would be surprised if they were enough to create a program as successful as cash for clunkers. Remember: Many homeowners could already save money by weatherizing their homes. And they are not doing so.
 That's in large part because the projects can seem so daunting. To date, energy experts, in the government and the private sector, have not done a good job of distributing useful information. What does exist tends to be either too complicated or too general. I recently asked various experts what percentage of homes should get new insulation, for example, and several replied that it varied by region -- which is both true and unhelpful. 
 Imagine, though, if the Energy Department put together a weatherization-for-dummies fact sheet and Mr. Obama began promoting it. 
 It could start by noting that almost all homes should have a programmable thermostat (about $100) to turn down the heat or the air-conditioning when nobody is home. Other simple steps can include wrapping a water heater with an insulation blanket and replacing heating and cooling filters. Next on the list would be sealing easily accessible holes in air ducts, which can cost just a few hundred dollars and pay for itself in a few years. In California, the average duct system loses 30 percent of its heating or cooling to leaks.
 Finally would come the more complicated categories, including insulation and heating equipment. Yet some basic information could still help enormously here. What share, say, of Midwestern homes built before 1950 could use more attic insulation? How quickly would the insulation pay for itself on average? Every home is different, obviously. But without any reference point, many people won't be confident enough to plunge into a project. 
 The shining example that Mr. Clinton cites is a Houston program in which the local government pays about $1,000 to weatherize any home in a given neighborhood. It works in part because the houses need similar improvements, which makes the program easy for residents to understand. 
 ''Unlike traditional programs that provide an audit and a customized package of solutions for each home,'' the Clinton memorandum notes, Houston ''offers a fixed set of interventions that include climate-appropriate 'low hanging fruit.' '' 
 The bottom line is that cash for caulkers would be trickier than cash for clunkers -- yet would have the potential to do far more good. McKinsey, the consulting firm, estimates that households could reduce their energy use by 28 percent over the next decade. In terms of greenhouse gases, that would be the equivalent of taking half of all vehicles in this country off the road. 
 And unlike many other climate-friendly policies, it would not cost money over the long term. Done right, cash for caulkers would be precisely the kind of stimulus that makes the most sense: spending money now to save money later.

HEADLINE: Paterson Prepares Wage Bill for Construction Sites

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
In a bid to shore up his relations with labor unions, Gov. David A. Paterson is readying legislation that would require developers to pay prevailing wages on many construction projects that receive public financing, meaning that construction workers would have to be paid significantly more than minimum wage. 
 The legislation, which has the business community alarmed, would also impose wage requirements on large businesses that use space created by developments financed with public money, according to a draft of the bill. In New York City, those requirements would be $19.20 an hour -- nearly three times the minimum wage -- for a wide variety of workers. 
 The bill would exempt some projects, though it would cover a great many developments involving both private business and civic institutions. The governor's proposal comes after labor unions and business leaders were unable to negotiate their own compromise earlier this year.
 Labor advocates said the bill would ensure that fair wages are paid on projects financed with public money through industrial development agencies, which provide below-market-rate financing throughout the state, particularly in New York City, for hospitals, private schools, malls and any number of other development projects. But the business community said the changes would render the development agencies useless, effectively killing an important economic development tool amid a recession. 
 The importance of industrial development agencies has grown as the state phases out its Empire Zone program, another incentive for development. 
 ''Why -- in the middle of the worst crisis since the Great Depression -- would the governor want to kill an economic development program that has created over 200,000 new jobs?'' said Kenneth Adams, the president of the Business Council of New York State. ''It's a proposal that destroys hope for economic recovery in New York.''
 But Stuart Appelbaum, president of the national Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said, ''If public resources are being used to finance development of any kind, there should be a notion that the community gets something back in return, and that notion is that we are creating good jobs.''
 Mr. Appelbaum said of the governor: ''Our group has been working with him and negotiating with him, but we haven't seen final language.''
 Mr. Paterson could introduce the legislation in the coming days, but little is certain as the governor's office and the Legislature are consumed primarily by negotiations over how to close a budget deficit of more than $3 billion. The bill would need approval of the full Legislature, where labor interests have considerable clout. 
 ''Governor Paterson is working to achieve I.D.A. reform that will create jobs, stimulate the economy and allow long-stalled civic facility projects to move forward,'' said Peter E. Kauffmann, the governor's communications director. 
 The issues at stake in the legislation are already being played out in the Bronx, where a $310 million development project would bring a new shopping mall to the Kingsbridge Armory. A coalition of community leaders has pushed for requirements that jobs at the mall pay a wage of $11.50 an hour, or $10 with benefits, as opposed to the $7.25 minimum wage. The governor is proposing a far higher wage rate. The developer of the Bronx project, the Related Companies, has said that it would give up the project if it faced such requirements.
 The administration's proposal would likely require the majority of for-profit projects in New York City financed through development agencies to pay prevailing wages to construction workers. The bill is particularly aimed at big-box stores. Under the plan, businesses that employ more than 100 workers and use publicly financed developments would also have to pay more than the minimum wage, though only for certain classes of workers -- retail workers, janitors, elevator operators and cleaning people among them. 
 Nonprofit projects at institutions like colleges, hospitals or cultural organizations that have 500 or more employees would be required to pay the higher wage on projects above $10 million.
 The pay scale would also vary depending on three regions laid out in the legislation -- New York City, its suburbs and upstate. The Legislature's ultimate support will depend on the fine print of the bill that the governor's office produces. 
 A similar measure has been passed twice in the Assembly in recent years, but it will face a more uncertain path in the narrowly divided State Senate, which has had a hard time passing controversial legislation of any kind.

HEADLINE: As Weight of a Relationship Tilts East, Obama Opts for Nuance and Deference

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and SHARON LaFRANIERE; Edward Wong, Jonathan Ansfield and Xiyun Yang contributed reporting, and Li Bibo and Zhang Jing contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Whether by White House design or Chinese insistence, President Obama has steered clear of public meetings with Chinese liberals, free press advocates and even average Chinese during his first visit to China, showing a deference to the Chinese leadership's aversions to such interactions that is unusual for a visiting American president.
 Mr. Obama held a ''town hall'' meeting with students on Monday. But the students were carefully vetted and prepped for the event by the government, participants said. And the Chinese authorities, wielding a practiced mix of censorship and diplomatic pressure, succeeded in limiting Mr. Obama's exposure to a point where a third of some 40 Beijing university students interviewed Tuesday were unaware that he had just met in Shanghai with their peers. 
 Some students who were aware cast him in terms rarely applied to American leaders, like ''rather humble'' and ''bland.''
 ''Is America being capricious because their economic difficulties force them to be nicer to China and other countries, or is this a genuine change?'' asked Liu Ziqi, 18, a freshman at the University of International Business and Economics. ''I don't know.''
 This is no longer the United States-China relationship of old but an encounter between a weakened giant and a comer with a bit of its own swagger. Washington's comparative advantage in past meetings is now diminished, a fact clearly not lost on the Chinese.
 Human rights is the prime example. In 1998, President Bill Clinton staged a nationally broadcast discussion with the president at the time, Jiang Zemin, about human rights, the Dalai Lama and perhaps China's most taboo topic, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In 2002, President George W. Bush stressed liberty, the rule of law and faith in a speech to university students broadcast across China.
 When Mr. Obama visited Moscow in July, he met with opposition political activists and journalists, and he publicly questioned the prosecution of an anti-Kremlin businessman.
 In China, by contrast, Mr. Obama, in nuanced references to human rights, has shied away from citing China's spotty record, even when offered the chance. Asked Monday in Shanghai to discuss China's censorship of the Internet, the president replied by talking about America's robust political debates. 
 American scholars and activists, who requested anonymity for fear of damaging relations with the White House, said the administration rejected proposals for brief meetings in Beijing with Chinese political activists, and then with lawyers.
 American officials did consider organizing meetings between Mr. Obama and Chinese lawyers, university students in Beijing and Hu Shuli, a well-known Chinese journalist who recently ceded control of Caijing, one of the nation's most respected and independent magazines. But officials say time constraints, not political considerations, sidelined those options, although the sightseeing agenda remained intact.
 One prominent defense lawyer, Mo Shaoping, said Tuesday that an American official called this month to ask if he would meet with Mr. Obama but never called back. ''The U.S. should be the safeguard of universal values,'' Mr. Mo said, but Mr. Obama ''actually didn't make it a very high priority.''
 For its part, the Chinese government made sure Mr. Obama did not bump into protesters by placing well-known activists under tighter security. Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a local organization, said 20 people were detained, placed under house arrest or prohibited from traveling before Mr. Obama's visit.
 Zhang Zuhua, once a Communist Party official and now among China's most influential civil rights activists, said that additional police officers were watching his apartment and that he had been warned to avoid political activity.
 Mr. Zhang expressed concern over what he called America's growing reluctance to criticize China on human rights, saying ''the Communist Party can pay even less regard to it and tighten up.''
 But an alternative explanation for Mr. Obama's comparatively low profile here, curiously, is the very insecurity of China's autocratic government. 
 In contrast to Mr. Jiang, who sparred openly with President Clinton over human rights, President Hu Jintao is a cautious politician whose tenure has been marked by an obsession with stability. In Mr. Obama's case, for example, Chinese officials hamstrung negotiations over items like the national broadcast of Shanghai's town hall meeting until they achieved most of their objectives to limit its exposure. 
 In China, Mr. Obama does not enjoy the matinee-idol status that has followed him elsewhere. But the Chinese are curious about the young president, and in some cases, they clearly find him a refreshing contrast to their own retirement-age, shoe-black-haired leadership.
 A topic of awe on Chinese chat sites this week was the image of Mr. Obama descending from Air Force One into rainy Shanghai, holding his own umbrella, without an aide's assistance. 
 In a Nov. 11 Internet poll, people were asked to say what was most memorable about Mr. Obama. A majority noted his Nobel Peace Prize. No. 2, improbable to foreigners, was a Chinese report that the president had insisted on paying for his own hamburger at a Washington restaurant. 
 In this basketball-crazy nation, Mr. Obama might single-handedly have remade America's image by showing up on one of the city's many outdoor courts for a few rounds of hoops. Instead, he tiptoed around fractious issues like human rights, as Chinese authorities took extra steps to ensure that the state media not project any hint of disharmony. 
 One state newspaper editor said his newsroom now was more tense even than in June, when China passed the 20th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.
 Late Monday, he said, after a Foreign Ministry official combed over the paper, editors scrapped two articles scheduled for publication on Tuesday, including one straightforward news article on the value of China's currency.
 Mr. Obama's trip, journalists at the paper joked, ''had driven the homeless from Beijing and brought more censorship to China.''
 ''It's as if they think he'd read the paper and it would offend him and trigger an international uproar,'' the editor said. ''As it is now, it would only trigger a snore.''

HEADLINE: Hunger in the United States

 BODY:
Congress should make a priority of expanding federal nutrition programs that are aimed at helping millions of struggling families feed their children. The need to bolster these programs was underscored again this week in a dismaying Department of Agriculture study showing that a record number of households had trouble getting sufficient food at one time or another last year. 
 These facts are troubling enough, but a separate federal study showed that even before the recession began, more than two-thirds of families with children who were defined as ''food insecure'' under federal guidelines contained one or more full-time worker. This suggests that millions of Americans were trapped in low-wage jobs before the downturn that made it more difficult for them to provide children with adequate nutrition.
 Families were categorized as ''food secure'' or ''food insecure'' based how they answered several questions on their eating habits during the previous 12 months. Among other things, adults were asked whether they or any of their children had ever forgone eating for an entire day because the family lacked money for food. 
 According to the new federal data, the number of people in households that lacked consistent access to adequate nutrition rose to 49 million in 2008, 13 million more than in the previous year and the most since the federal government began keeping the data 14 years ago.
 About a third of struggling households had what the researchers called ''very low food security,'' meaning that members of the household skipped meals, cut portions or passed on food at some point during the year because they lacked money. The other two-thirds managed to feed themselves by eating cheaper or less varied foods, relying on government aid like food stamps or resorting to food pantries and soup kitchens, which have been seeing heavier and heavier traffic in recent years.
 Families with inadequate resources typically feed the children first, shielding them from hardship as much as possible. But the new data showed that the number of households in which children were exposed to ''very low food security'' rose to 506,000 from 323,000 in 2007.
 The Bush administration tried to deep-six this annual survey. But President Obama has dealt with it openly and called the danger to children especially troubling. 
 Mr. Obama, who is traveling in Asia, has set himself the task of wiping out child hunger by 2015. To do that, Congress needs to get busy on a broad plan to expand and fully pay for a whole range of nutritional programs aimed at school-age children and their families. Only then will vulnerable children across the country get the nutrition they need.

HEADLINE: China Holds Firm on Major Issues in Obama's Visit

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Reporting was contributed by Sharon LaFraniere, Edward Wong, Michael Wines and Mark Landler.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
In six hours of meetings, at two dinners and during a stilted 30-minute news conference in which President Hu Jintao did not allow questions, President Obama was confronted, on his first visit, with a fast-rising China more willing to say no to the United States.
 On topics like Iran (Mr. Hu did not publicly discuss the possibility of sanctions), China's currency (he made no nod toward changing its value) and human rights (a joint statement bluntly acknowledged that the two countries ''have differences''), China held firm against most American demands.
 With China's micro-management of Mr. Obama's appearances in the country, the trip did more to showcase China's ability to push back against outside pressure than it did to advance the main issues on Mr. Obama's agenda, analysts said. 
 ''China effectively stage-managed President Obama's public appearances, got him to make statements endorsing Chinese positions of political importance to them and effectively squelched discussions of contentious issues such as human rights and China's currency policy,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a China specialist at Cornell University. ''In a masterstroke, they shifted the public discussion from the global risks posed by Chinese currency policy to the dangers of loose monetary policy and protectionist tendencies in the U.S.''
 White House officials maintained they got what they came for -- the beginning of a needed give-and-take with a surging economic giant. With a civilization as ancient as China's, they argued, it would be counterproductive -- and reminiscent of President George W. Bush's style -- for Mr. Obama to confront Beijing with loud chest-beating that might alienate the Chinese. Mr. Obama, the officials insisted, had made his points during private meetings and one-on-one sessions.
 ''I do not expect, and I can speak authoritatively for the president on this, that we thought the waters would part and everything would change over the course of our almost two-and-a-half-day trip to China,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. ''We understand there's a lot of work to do and that we'll continue to work hard at making more progress.''
 Several China experts noted that Mr. Obama was not leaving Beijing empty-handed. The two countries put out a five-point joint statement pledging to work together on a variety of issues. The statement calls for regular exchanges between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu, and asks that each side pay more attention to the strategic concerns of the other. The statement also pledges that they will work as partners on economic issues, Iran and climate change.
 But despite a conciliatory tone that began weeks ago when Mr. Obama declined to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, before visiting China to avoid offending China's leaders, it remains unclear whether Mr. Obama made progress on the most pressing policy matters on the American agenda in China or elsewhere in Asia. 
 The president has had to fend off criticism from American conservatives that he appeared to soften the American stance on the positioning of troops on the Japanese island of Okinawa, and for bowing to Japan's emperor.
 At a regional conference in Singapore, Mr. Obama announced a setback on another top foreign policy priority, climate change, acknowledging that comprehensive agreement to fight global warming was no longer within reach this year.
 Past American presidents have usually insisted in advance on some concrete achievements from their trips overseas. President Bush received vigorous endorsements of his top foreign policy priority, the global war on terrorism, during his visits to Beijing, and President Bill Clinton guided China toward joining the World Trade Organization after prolonged negotiations. When either of those presidents visited the country, China often made a modest concession on human rights as well.
 This time, Mr. Hu declined to follow the lead of President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who, after months of massaging by the Obama administration, now says that he is open to tougher sanctions against Iran if negotiations fail to curb Iran's nuclear program. The administration needs China's support if tougher sanctions are to be approved by the United Nations Security Council. But during the joint appearance in Beijing on Tuesday, Mr. Hu made no mention of sanctions.
 Rather, he said, it was ''very important'' to ''appropriately resolve the Iranian nuclear regime through dialogue and negotiations.'' And then, as if to drive home that point, Mr. Hu added, ''During the talks, I underlined to President Obama that given our differences in national conditions, it is only normal that our two sides may disagree on some issues.''
 White House officials acknowledged that they did not get what they wanted from Mr. Hu on Iran but said that Mr. Obama's method would yield more in the long term. ''We're not looking for them to lead or change course, we're looking for them to not be obstructionist,'' one administration official said.
 In a meeting in Beijing with a senior Chinese official on Wednesday morning, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton again pressed China on Iran. She told the official, Dai Bingguo, that even if China had not decided what sanctions on Iran it would accept, ''you need to send a signal,'' said a senior American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could describe the exchange.
 Mr. Obama did not appear to move the Chinese on currency issues, either. China has come under heavy pressure, not only from the United States but also from Europe and several Asian countries, to revise its policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi, pegged at an artificially low value against the dollar to help promote its exports. Some economists say China must take that step to prevent the return of large trade and financial imbalances that may have contributed to the recent financial crisis.
 Mr. Obama on Tuesday could only cite China's ''past statements'' in support of shifting toward market-oriented exchange rates, implying that he had not extracted a fresh commitment from Beijing to move in that direction soon.
 There are many reasons the White House may have heeded China's clear desire for a visit free of the polemics that often accompany meetings between leaders of the two countries. Mr. Obama's foreign policy is rooted in recasting the United States as a thoughtful listener to friends and rivals alike. ''No we haven't made China a democracy in three days -- maybe if we pounded our chest a lot that would work,'' Mr. Gibbs said in an e-mail message on Tuesday night. ''But it hasn't in the last 16 years.''
 Kenneth Lieberthal, a Brookings Institution scholar who oversaw China issues in President Clinton's White House, agreed. ''The United States actually has enormous influence on popular thinking in China, but it is primarily by example,'' he said. ''If you go to the next step and say, 'You guys ought to be like us,' you lose the impact of who you are.'' 
 The National Security Council's spokesman, Michael A. Hammer, added, ''What we did come to do is speak bluntly about the issues which are important to us, not in an unnecessarily offensive manner, but rather in the Obama style of showing respect.''
 Mr. Obama, even as he projected a softer image, did nudge the Chinese on some delicate issues.
 On Tuesday, standing next to Mr. Hu, Mr. Obama brought up Tibet, where Beijing-backed authorities have clamped down on religious freedom. ''While we recognize that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China, the United States supports the early resumption of dialogue between the Chinese government and representatives of the Dalai Lama to resolve any concerns and differences that the two sides may have,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Trump Settles for 10% of Casino Company

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump ended his war with bondholders of the casino company that bears his name, settling Tuesday for 10 percent of Trump Entertainment Resorts once it emerges from bankruptcy. 
 Mr. Trump announced that he and his daughter Ivanka were abandoning their battle over control of the company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February. It was the third such filing for the company or its corporate predecessors.
 The company had been struggling with crushing debt that became even more painful when the economy soured and competition from casinos in Pennsylvania and New York increased.
 The deal reached with 61 percent of the bondholders would give Mr. Trump common stock and warrants worth 10 percent of the reorganized company.
 The three Atlantic City casinos -- Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Marina Hotel Casino -- will continue to use the Trump name. Mr. Trump will be permitted to use his name on other gambling ventures in states that do not compete directly with the New Jersey properties.
 ''I have always felt a tremendous responsibility to New Jersey, and especially to Atlantic City,'' Mr. Trump said. ''Therefore, I am motivated to give the properties the best chance to succeed on a reorganized basis. Had circumstances not changed, I would have aggressively continued to pursue the debtors' plan with the objective of acquiring control of and revitalizing a company that I have not run for many years.''
 But he said the company's reorganization plan ''has become mired in highly expensive and distracting litigation that threatens the entire enterprise. This prolonged and continued litigation and the associated cost to the estate would mean that whoever won under their plan would ultimately lose.''
 The deal also would end the litigation by the Trumps against the bondholders, and release them from more than $100 million of claims against them.
 Marc Lasry, chairman and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, a member of the Ad Hoc Committee of creditors, said he was pleased with the agreement.
 Kristopher M. Hansen, the lawyer for the bondholders, said the pact should bring a speedy end to a costly legal battle that had been set for a January showdown in federal bankruptcy court.

HEADLINE: Storm Over the Chamber

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 BACK in the 1990s when Thomas J. Donohue was president of the American Trucking Associations, a subordinate raised a question at a staff meeting.
 Some of the association's members, the aide said, wondered whether it was really necessary for the group's president to fly on a private jet.
 Mr. Donohue, a scrappy Irish-American born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, turned to his chief of staff and asked how many seats his jet had. ''Well, eight, sir,'' the aide said. ''Tomorrow morning I want you to call and get a 12-seater,'' Mr. Donohue shot back. The subject never came up again.
 Mr. Donohue, 71, now the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, still flies on private jets and enjoys a chauffeur-driven car in addition to his $3 million annual salary. 
 And his legendary pugnacity has not faded. It was on display again this fall as he and the chamber found themselves in a maelstrom over climate change policy after a number of member companies noisily resigned in protest over the chamber's hostile stance on climate legislation. A wave of criticism arose from Congress, the White House, environmental organizations and some businesses that accused the chamber and its president of a reactionary pursuit of anti-environmental policies.
 Mr. Donohue was not cowed. ''Bring 'em on,'' he growled at a briefing for reporters last month. 
 As president of the nation's largest and oldest business association, Mr. Donohue is no stranger to sharp policy debates. During his 12-year tenure, the chamber has been outspoken on trade, tort reform, union organizing rights, financial regulation and health care. Mr. Donohue has hired an army of lobbyists and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, advocacy and political campaigns to make sure its voice is heard. The chamber represents its generally conservative membership of 300,000 companies and local business groups on these issues without much public protest.
 But climate change poses a different sort of challenge for Mr. Donohue. Many of the chamber's big-business members are deeply split on the issue, with some standing to profit from an economy moving away from reliance on fossil fuels, while others could see devastating increases in costs.
 The companies that resigned this fall -- Apple, Levi Strauss & Company, Mohawk Paper and the utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Exelon and PNM Resources -- cited the chamber's climate policy as counterproductive. All said that some form of greenhouse gas regulation or legislation was coming and that they did not want to pay dues to an organization that appeared to be standing in its way.
 R. Bruce Josten, the chamber's chief lobbyist, dismissed the defectors as self-interested publicity seekers. He said some wanted to save their chamber dues money (as much as $50,000 a year in some cases) and planned to cut their own deals with lawmakers to benefit their bottom lines.
 ''We try to work with them and they vilify us. Fine,'' Mr. Josten said. ''It doesn't faze Tom. It doesn't faze me, either.''
 Mr. Donohue's challenge is to try to placate the diverse membership of the chamber while working with Congress to blunt the impact of any carbon-control regime. The chamber didn't help its cause this summer when one of its senior policy analysts, William L. Kovacs, called for the Environmental Protection Agency to hold a new ''Scopes monkey trial'' on the science of global warming, reprising the famous 1925 confrontation over the scientific basis of evolution.
 Mr. Donohue disavowed the comment and had strong words for Mr. Kovacs in private. But he has not relented in his opposition to E.P.A. regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases that are contributing to global warming. And he is wary of any climate change legislation that he says will ''eliminate jobs and badly damage the economy.''
 Mr. Donohue would not agree to an interview for this article but provided written answers by e-mail to a number of questions about the chamber's climate change position. He said that he did not set out to pick a fight with the Obama administration over climate-altering emissions (''Absolutely not!''), and that he was trying to work with the administration to focus on the long-term challenge of climate change.
 The chamber strongly opposed the global warming bill sponsored by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, that narrowly passed the House in June. The chamber said the bill was a job-killer and a regulatory nightmare and classified the vote as a crucial issue in determining whom it would support or oppose in Congressional elections next year.
 Mr. Donohue said that the chamber had a series of basic principles by which it would judge any legislation on climate change. It supports new nuclear plants, increased domestic oil and gas exploration, research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions, new efficiency measures and provisions to control cost increases associated with emissions reductions. It has not expressed support for any proposals to impose a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions.
 ''The business community, as well as a growing number of legislators from both parties, has serious problems with current legislative proposals,'' Mr. Donohue wrote in his e-mail message. ''In the last analysis, probably at the end of the process, we hope to find a bill that achieves the objectives of dealing with carbon emissions, without extraneous and expensive add-ons such as a trade war with the developing world or the creation of thousands of new regulations, mandates and bureaucracies.''
 His opponents say that his words and actions are self-defeating and have served only to marginalize the chamber in one of the most important environmental and economic debates of the time.
 ''Mr. Donohue's chamber has damaged its credibility, reputation and influence with self-inflicted wounds caused by its extremist stance on climate policy, its obfuscating double-talk and Mr. Donohue's own attacks on corporate members that have distanced themselves from the chamber's position,'' said Peter Altman, climate campaign director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The chamber appears to have realized it must express support for federal climate legislation in order to remain politically relevant, but it has yet to demonstrate a real commitment to the goal of making serious policy that would result in aggressive reductions in global warming pollution.''
 It may be premature, however, to declare the chamber irrelevant to the debate. Since arriving at the chamber in 1997, Mr. Donohue has added more than 100,000 members and quadrupled the group's annual budget to $200 million.
 Its spending on lobbying has exploded to more than $90 million last year, from less than $20 million a year. The chamber has spent $65 million on lobbying so far this year, including some $35 million in the third quarter alone.
 In 1997, the chamber had 2 lobbyists working full-time on Capitol Hill; it now has 18. In its most recent lobbying disclosure filing, the chamber named 98 inside lobbyists and 90 others working on its behalf from outside firms.
 Mr. Donohue alluded to the firepower that his battalions of lobbyists and big budgets bring at a meeting at the chamber's headquarters on Nov. 9. Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, had just spoken of the administration's Race to the Top education competition, which will distribute more than $4 billion to school districts around the country.
 Mr. Donohue nodded appreciatively. 
 ''People seem to listen to you more,'' he said, ''when you've got a bagful of cash.''
 WHILE a relative handful of members have left the chamber and some have taken issue with the group's climate change policies, many remain loyal to the chamber and to its leader.
 Gene Barr, the vice president for government affairs at the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, a member of the national chamber, said that Mr. Donohue had been successful in increasing the size and influence of the national organization. In the process, he may have broken a few eggs, Mr. Barr added.
 ''Look, Tom's a very interesting guy, a feisty Irishman, and he comes across that way,'' he said. 
 John Podesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House and now head of the liberal Center for American Progress, has tangled with Mr. Donohue on a number of issues and has found common cause with him on others, like education and worker training.
 ''It's fair to say that we disagree on most things,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''But he took a kind of sleepy organization and turned it into one of the most aggressive lobbying groups in town.''
 On climate change, however, Mr. Podesta said that Mr. Donohue's views put him at odds with some important members. 
 ''When you run out on the battlefield and your troops are turning their horses in a different direction, you quickly find yourself in pretty big trouble,'' Mr. Podesta said.
 Mr. Donohue said that his recent notoriety had been challenging, but not as difficult as his early years at the chamber when he was trying to rebuild its membership and finances.
 And, no, he has given no thought to stepping down.
 ''I recently told my wife,'' he wrote in his e-mail message, ''that if you see me lying in a box with flowers all around, that means I'm only thinking about retiring.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about turmoil within the United States Chamber of Commerce over its opposition to climate change legislation erroneously included one company among those that have resigned from the chamber over the climate policy. A spokeswoman for Levi Strauss & Company said that although the company had differed with the chamber over labor and the environment, the main issue over which the company resigned was trade, not climate policy. The article also misstated the year the company resigned. It was in 2001, not this fall.

HEADLINE: In New World Of Military Spending, Small Is Beautiful

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
AT one time, it may have been true that ''an army marches on its stomach.'' But with food supplies generally not a problem for modern armies, the proverb should probably be updated to something like this: an army marches on its laptops and the information flowing through them. 
 And that means opportunity for small military contractors, even in a time of constrained budgets. 
 Jon B. Kutler, founder and chairman of Admiralty Partners in Los Angeles, who has invested about $70 million in several small military contractors in the last seven years, said he thought financing for crucial technologies like communications would ''fare very well in the next three to five years.'' He said military spending was at a turning point ''in that it is not in vast programs for aircraft or mammoth undertakings that take 10 years to complete, but smaller companies in fields like cybersecurity.'' 
 Mr. Kutler, a onetime naval officer, said that American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan were fighting dispersed smaller groups. ''That demands communications and sensors and all manner of technology,'' he said. ''Communications needs to be at the level of individual soldiers. And it must be secure from the enemy, too. So we need surveillance and security of information and reconnaissance to see the enemy.
 ''All of this will see increased spending,'' he said, ''but that can come in small companies and programs.'' 
 Loren B. Thompson, a longtime defense analyst and chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va., predicted that ''the Pentagon will be the biggest consumer of information systems and software in the world for the foreseeable future.''
 That trend is likely to favor companies like Trident Space and Defense of Torrance, Calif., which is owned by Admiralty Partners. Trident ''had its best year ever in 2008, is doing well this year and we look for growth next year,'' said Gerald Smith, vice president and general manager. 
 Trident makes components for satellites that are in demand as surveillance increases. It also provides ground systems and tracking services for satellite programs of countries around the world. The company, which has 70 employees and about $45 million in annual revenue, also makes solid-state drives for laptop computers that are intended to withstand battlefield conditions.
 Trident, a 33-year old company, started out selling components internationally as a division of TRW, an early defense firm acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002. In 2007, Admiralty Partners bought the operation that is now Trident and expanded its operations, in domestic markets and internationally. 
 Other investments by Mr. Kutler's firm include AmSafe Aviation in Phoenix, which makes seat belts and harnesses for the airline industry, and Pankl Aerospace Systems, of Cerritos, Calif., which supplies helicopter drive shafts and other equipment. 
 For Trident, Mr. Smith said, the solid-state drives and other systems might become the largest part of the business in the next few years. The attraction, said Roydn Jones, the company's chief technology officer, was that computers with solid-state drives, as opposed to more common rotating drives, could operate in desert heat or other adverse conditions ''and they can be dropped from the back of a Humvee and continue to work.'' 
 Until recently, solid-state drives were less common because they were more expensive. But prices have come down, Mr. Jones said, because solid-state electronics in MP3 music players and similar devices turned them from a niche to a mass-market product. 
 The mingling of commercial and military technology is characteristic of military programs these days, said Eric M. DeMarco, chief executive of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. He cited a product made by his company, NeuralStar, which helps make computer systems more secure from tampering by hackers, spies and other attackers. The NeuralStar system ''has a contract to manage the whole flow of information across many levels of a government department,'' he said. ''That product originated in commercial telecommunications.''
 In the future, Mr. DeMarco said, he expected to see more use of unmanned systems. ''Not only aircraft but robots and 'Terminator' type warfare.'' 
 At the same time, he predicted, those products would also be used in civilian and commercial programs. ''I would see unmanned systems used in crop dusting and surveillance and fighting of forest fires,'' he said. And communications will be critical, he said. ''With all unmanned systems, command and control must be maintained and protected, down to the individual war fighter. It's not top-down information but distributed throughout the command.'' 
 Kratos, based in San Diego, grew in recent years by acquiring small defense and technology companies. It has just refinanced with a $19 million sale of stock through B. Riley & Company, a Los Angeles investment bank. Mr. DeMarco said the money would be used to pay down debt and perhaps to make an acquisition of a small company in electronics and optical technology. ''The recession opens opportunities,'' Mr. DeMarco said. 
 John Keating, chief executive of Com Dev International, a Canadian company that recently invested in the United States, said he also expected a sharing of technology for commercial and military uses. ''Rather than building a separate satellite program, military payloads will share space on commercial communications satellites,'' said Mr. Keating, whose company has been a supplier for the last 40 years of electronics and optical subsystems to the former Hughes Aircraft and Boeing Company and other makers of communications satellites.
 In 2006, the company, based in Cambridge, Ontario, invested $25 million to create Com Dev USA in El Segundo, Calif., to bid for military and civil government satellite business in the United States. Mr. Keating said he saw a special area of business growth. ''The world satellite business will grow only moderately in the coming years,'' he suggested, ''but we have technology and many other products and services we can bring into U.S. markets.''
 What those investment patterns suggest, said Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute, is that overall military spending -- currently at $680 billion in the fiscal 2010 budget -- ''will probably decline in years ahead.'' But, he added, ''second-tier defense contractors focused in information technology and intelligence applications will probably do well in the emerging military market.''

HEADLINE: Pathology Of a Crisis

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The coroner's report left no doubt as to the cause of death: toxic loans. 
 That was the conclusion of a financial autopsy that federal officials performed on Haven Trust Bank, a small bank in Duluth, Ga., that collapsed last December. 
 In what sounds like an episode of ''CSI: Wall Street,'' dozens of government investigators -- the coroners of the financial crisis -- are conducting post-mortems on failed lenders across the nation. Their findings paint a striking portrait of management missteps and regulatory lapses. 
 At bank after bank, the examiners are discovering that state and federal regulators knew lenders were engaging in hazardous business practices but failed to act until it was too late. At Haven Trust, for instance, regulators raised alarms about lax lending standards, poor risk controls and a buildup of potentially dangerous loans to the boom-and-bust building industry. Despite the warnings -- made as far back as 2002 -- neither the bank's management nor the regulators took action. Similar stories played out at small and midsize lenders from Maryland to California. 
 What went wrong? In many instances, the financial overseers failed to act quickly and forcefully to rein in runaway banks, according to reports compiled by the inspectors general of the four major federal banking regulators. Together, they have completed 41 inquests and have 75 more in the works. 
 Current and former banking regulators acknowledge that they should have been more vigilant. 
 ''We all could have done a better job,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 The reports, known as material loss reviews, delve into the past, but their significance lies in how they might shape the future. As another wave of bank failures looms, policy makers are considering a variety of measures that would generally strengthen banks' finances and limit their ability to lend money aggressively in risky areas like construction. Bankers contend that such steps would not only hurt their businesses but also the broader economy, because they would throttle the flow of credit just as growth is resuming. 
 But while the worst seems to be over for the banking industry as a whole, many lenders are still in danger. The havoc caused by the collapse of the housing market is now being exacerbated by the deepening problems in commercial real estate, which many analysts see as the next flashpoint for the industry. 
 Given the past lapses, some wonder whether examiners will spot new troubles in time. Of the nation's 8,100 banks, about 2,200 -- ranging from community lenders in the Rust Belt to midsize regional players -- far exceed the risk thresholds that would ordinarily call for greater scrutiny from management and regulators, according to Foresight Analytics, a banking research firm. 
 About 600 small banks are in danger of collapsing because of troubled real estate loans if they do not shore up their finances soon, according to the firm. About 150 lenders have failed since the crisis erupted in mid-2007. 
 Many bank examiners acknowledge they were lulled into believing the good times for banks would last. They also concede that they were sometimes reluctant to act when troubles surfaced, for fear of unsettling the housing market and the economy. 
 Then as now, banking lobbyists vigorously opposed attempts to rein in the banks, like the 2006 guidelines that discouraged banks from holding big commercial real estate positions.
 ''Hindsight is a wonderful thing,'' said Timothy W. Long, the chief bank examiner for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ''At the height of the economic boom, to take an aggressive supervisory approach and tell people to stop lending is hard to do.'' 
 Haven Trust, founded in 2000, enjoyed a light touch from its regulators, according to its autopsy, which was completed in August. 
 Almost from the start, examiners with the F.D.I.C and the state of Georgia raised red flags. In 2002, F.D.I.C. officials found problems with the bank's underwriting practices. Over the next few years, Haven's portfolio of risky commercial real estate loans grew so quickly -- by an astounding 40 percent annually -- that the regulators raised questions about the dangers. 
 But not until August 2008 did examiners step up their scrutiny by telling Haven to raise its capital cushion. A month later, the regulators issued a memorandum of understanding, known as an M.O.U., ordering the bank to limit its concentration of risky loans. 
 Haven's examiners ''did not always follow up on the red flags,'' says the report, which runs 29 pages. ''By the time the M.O.U. was issued in September 2008, Haven's failure was all but inevitable,'' it concluded. 
 But the fiasco at Haven Trust was not all that unusual. At the fast-growing Ocala National Bank in Florida, for example, examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found loose lending standards and a high concentration of construction loans. 
 But regulators ''took no forceful action to achieve corrections,'' according a review after the failure. The bank collapsed in late January. 
 At County Bank in California, a potential powder keg of construction and land loans warranted ''early, direct and forceful'' action from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, according to a review of the failed lender, which collapsed in early February. 
 Regulators have begun to act on some of the lessons learned. Federal officials are discussing whether to impose hard limits, not just soft guidelines, on the portion of bank balance sheets that can be made up of commercial real estate loans. That would automatically prevent the buildup of risky assets and take more discretion out of the examiners' hands. 
 Other ideas include requiring all lenders to hold more capital if they report big concentrations of risky assets or rapid loan growth -- an approach that is the centerpiece of the Obama administration's policy for too-big-to-fail banks. 
 Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor overseeing bank supervision, recently proposed to impose new rules that would require banks to raise capital in the event they breach certain financial thresholds in areas like loan delinquencies or defaults. 
 At the F.D.I.C., Ms. Bair has been increasing the hiring of experienced examiners in the last few years, and recently empowered its on-site supervisors to impose restrictions on dividends, brokered deposits and loan growth. Every major regulator has urged examiners to take swifter action and issue more formal enforcement orders. 
 Still, banking executives and some regulators worry that after the long period of lax oversight chronicled by the reports, regulators will crack down too hard. The challenge, these people say, is to strike a balance between rigorous oversight and oppressive regulation. A heavy hand might discourage banks from lending. 
 ''Right now, bankers don't need to be told it is a dangerous world,'' said William M. Isaac, the former F.D.I.C. chairman and now a regulatory consultant. ''Right now, they need to be told there will be a tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: A Surplus of Energy That Might Even Last

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
AFTER years of widespread concern over how to refine enough gasoline, how to deliver enough megawatts of electricity and how to keep from drowning in carbon dioxide, the United States suddenly has fuel and energy in surplus, and the country is looking greener. 
 Can it last? And would that be a good thing? 
 The recession was hardly anybody's idea of a good way to put the country on a sensible energy diet. But it may have done just that. Many coal plants whose emissions were spreading acid rain, mercury and the ingredients of global warming have not been running as much lately, and the price of coal was down by half in the last year -- like the price of oil. Demand for electricity was down 1 percent last year and another 4 percent in the first half of 2009; ordinarily, electric use would be expected to grow 5 percent in three to four years. Industrial demand was down to levels not seen since the 1990s. 
 ''We're probably down 7 to 8 percent this year,'' said Anthony F. Earley, chief executive of DTE, the parent of Detroit Edison. ''Traditionally, we would expect to recover that in a year or two, but I don't think anyone here believes this is going to be a traditional recovery.'' Other electric systems as diverse as the Tennessee Valley Authority and Florida Power and Light have also seen demand drop. Many utilities, said Amory B. Lovins, an expert on energy efficiency, are ''unexpectedly finding patterns of declining demand in previously robust sectors that they think may represent a basic change in previous trends.'' 
 This might be an ''inflection point'' in the American economy, said Mark Cooper, a research fellow and energy expert at the Vermont Law School, when new houses stop getting bigger (or getting built), and appliances and other devices using electricity do more work with less power. 
 Improvements in efficiency are likely to continue. Congress has mandated lots of them, including that the general purpose incandescent lightbulb be phased out, beginning in 2012. 
 In fact, if this recession is an inflection point, it is not the first. Jay Apt, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and executive director of its Electricity Industry Center, said that growth in use of electricity had been exponential from the 1950s until about 1973, and linear since then. Part of the reason was that by 1973, ''We'd just about finished air-conditioning the country,'' he said.
 And part was a de-industrializing economy. Industrial use of electricity in 2008 was about the same as in 1994, he said. That is partly because industries are more efficient, and partly because industrial growth has moved abroad, where electricity is cheaper.
 ''There is really profound uncertainty'' about the future level of demand for electricity. On one hand is industrial stagnation, growing efficiency and price increases brought on by carbon controls and population growth, and on the other, proliferation of new devices that use electricity, including plug-in cars, Professor Apt said.
 A carbon cost, if Congress agrees on a climate bill, could further retard demand. For example, if consumers had to pay $30 for each ton of carbon emitted by the electric system, rates would increase by 15 to 20 percent. That might stunt growth, as rate increases did in the 1970s when there were higher oil and natural gas prices and expensive nuclear plants were being completed.
 In the transportation fuel market, demand for gasoline in the United States has probably peaked, because miles traveled are down. Explanations vary. One is that the population is aging and older people drive less. Lester R. Brown, a natural resources expert, said another is that young people who once went cruising in their cars now socialize with Facebook and Twitter. Stricter fuel-economy standards are also about to kick in. Their effect depends on how quickly the current car fleet is replaced, but with a new fuel-economy average of 35.5 miles a gallon -- a 40 percent increase to be phased in by 2016 -- gasoline demand and prices seem poised to decline. Corn ethanol is already cutting demand for crude oil and for products from refineries. If the government mandate for ethanol from nonfood sources like wood or plant wastes is realized, gasoline demand could drop further. 
 And if there is slow growth or no growth in liquid fuels or electricity, any greener substitutes -- electricity from wind, ethanol from wood chips -- could displace a dirtier incumbent fuel. 
 STILL, the consensus in the power industry is that demand will come back, but slowly. David K. Owens, vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the investor-owned utilities, said the average residential customer had 26 devices in the home running on electricity. Yes, many devices will do more with less power in the future, he said, so ''you are a more efficient user of electricity, but you just have more stuff.''
 The growth in use of electronic devices -- cellphones, televisions, computers and other devices that use electricity to handle information -- is huge, 9 to 12 percent of energy consumption, by some estimates, in a category that hardly existed 20 years ago. Then, add in the plug-in car, either hybrid or pure electric. A residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt-hours a month of electricity might use another 100 for a plug-in car, said Mr. Owens. (Depending on the car, that would be enough to travel 300 or 400 miles.) That would create demand for energy, but probably not for new generating stations, because the cars could be charged at night when other demand was light. 
 In April, Jon Wellinghoff, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said that because of the combination of renewable energy and energy conservation, the United States might not need to build any coal or nuclear plants to meet the base-load capacity that runs around the clock and is supplemented by natural gas and other sources at peak periods.
 ''We may not need any, ever,'' he said. 
 But flat demand would not mean the end of power plant construction, because old plants wear out. ''By 2050, 70 percent of existing capacity will be gone,'' said Bill Johnson, a planning executive at Florida Power and Light. Nearly all the nuclear reactors will be at least 50 years old by then, he said. And renewables, efficiency or policies that discourage use will not replace all the retiring plants, he said. 
 ''We need to think about how we're going to replace that,'' he said. ''We're going to be building a lot of something.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a national surplus of energy misidentified the position and company affiliation of Bill Johnson, a utility executive who said that utilities would have to build new generating stations to replace old ones that were wearing out. Mr. Johnson is president and chief executive of Progress Energy in Raleigh, N.C. -- not a planning executive at Florida Power and Light.

HEADLINE: Unveiling the Hanging Gardens of Armenia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia 

 BODY:
Some 20,000 Armenians turned up for the opening of the Cafesjian Center for the Arts last week. They jammed the new sculpture park and the terraced gardens and galleries, including the first exhibition ever in Armenia of the Armenian-born American great, Arshile Gorky. 
 The center, a mad work of architectural megalomania and historical recovery, is one of the strangest but most memorable museum buildings to open in ages. Imagine an Art Deco version of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon stretching nearly the height of the Empire State Building, its decorations coded with Armenian symbolism. 
 Did I mention the artificial waterfalls?
 Built into a gigantic hill in the commercial heart of this capital city, with a staircase that climbs the outside linking the gardens, the place was originally conceived in Soviet times to be topped by a monument to the Soviet revolution. That it has been turned into a contemporary-art center by a rich American is a twist of history whose symbolism is lost on no one here. 
 There's no endowment, no professional board, so it may very well soon fall flat on its face, as so much has in this country where widespread corruption, lethargy and years of isolation have led to an unemployment rate around 40 percent, a crumbling infrastructure and almost no middle class. 
 But for the time being, at least, it is doing what precious few museums, and even fewer vanity enterprises like it can dream of doing -- namely, offering a whole nation a kind of uplift. 
 From morning to evening, as if out on prom night, young Armenians at the opening rode the center's escalator, in many ways the main attraction, which rises via several grand, plaza-size landings inside to, of all things, a little jazz lounge, where a view of the city unfolds beyond tall windows behind the stage. 
 Armenia's president, Serge Sargsyan, surrounded by swarms of security guards (politicians can't be too careful here) took time out from the debate over opening the border with Turkey. He joined Gerard L. Cafesjian, the 84-year-old Brooklyn-born Armenian-American patron of the center, and the center's director, Michael De Marsche, among others, to hear the inaugural set.
 These days Armenian newspaper headlines dwell on the Turkish border opening, which the United States quietly presses for to gain an oil pipeline that can sidestep Russia and Iran. In return Turkey wants to table once and for all any talk about having committed genocide in the killing of more than a million Armenians nearly a century ago. Admitting to genocide has legal ramifications in terms of restitution. So President Obama has lately stopped using the G word, leaving Armenians to choose between desperately needed economic improvement and justice in the defining calamity of their history. 
 Paralyzed for decades by that event, turned in on itself, landlocked and surrounded by mostly hostile neighbors, Armenia has had until now almost no place to see modern and contemporary art from outside the country. When a perfectly anodyne fat Botero sculpture of a cat was installed in the new center's sculpture park a few years ago, it caused a scandal. Then, resistance melted. As the center's opening proved, thousands of young Armenians are hungry for what's beyond their borders and are open to change. 
 I arrived, having been invited to lecture at the opening, dimly aware of the center's history, which began during the 1930s, when a prominent local architect, Alexander Tamanyan, conceived the Cascade, as it's called, a towering, white travertine ziggurat of artificial waterfalls and gardens tumbling down a promontory that links the historic residential and business centers of the city. Banquet-hall-size meeting rooms were devised for Soviet apparatchiks. 
 The plan was largely forgotten until the late 1970s, after which construction began. Then came the earthquake in 1988 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Like much of the city during the post-Soviet years of transition, the Cascade was left in the lurch. 
 Enter Mr. Cafesjian, from Minnesota. Armenian officials agreed he could erect a building on top of the Cascade in which to show his collection if he would complete the Cascade. Work started in 2002, but costs spiraled swiftly out of control. What had been imagined as a $20 million undertaking soon topped $40 million, with no end in sight. 
 Mr. Cafesjian regrouped. Two years ago he hired Mr. De Marsche, then president of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. The building on top was put on hold, the focus instead turned toward completing the Cascade and the sculpture park at the foot of it. Tamanyan's original meeting rooms became art galleries, a gift shop and the jazz lounge. 
 Peculiar doesn't begin to describe the results. The galleries are irregular and spaced far apart, some of them reachable only outdoors across the gardens, which in winter will be frigid and covered with snow. 
 The collection is also a mixed bag. Mr. De Marsche wisely pushed for displaying only a few works from it, with the emphasis on glass. 
 It's a world away from other museums here. I stopped several times into the National Gallery, an aging palace of marble, worn carpets, bare light bulbs and creaky floorboards in the middle of the city. You wouldn't necessarily know it was a gallery from outside. The facade is covered by billboards for a bank. An unmarked entrance is shuttered by Venetian blinds. Even on Saturday and Sunday afternoons I was the only visitor in the entire place. Elderly female guards in starched white shirts, startled, glumly rose to watch me pass. 
 Through the gallery's windows, bossa nova music wafted incongruously from an empty Soviet-era amusement park nearby. A panorama of half-finished apartment blocks, Hummers and luxury shops for the oligarchs, and bulky statues of Armenian heroes on horseback spread out below. 
 According to Raffi Hovannisian, Armenia's former foreign minister, the country now depends for some one-third of its economy on money sent by Armenians abroad. The global collapse has been devastating. Several years of double-digit economic growth during the early 2000s have largely evaporated. 
 Even Dennis Doyle, who sits on the board of Mr. Cafesjian's family foundation, wondered aloud about the center's future. Mr. Cafesjian promises to pay for it. But that means it all depends on him in the end. The Armenian government is no safety net. 
 Karen De Marsche, Mr. De Marsche's wife, said she was sitting in a restaurant here with a friend one recent afternoon when a man rushed in, agitated, and begged for something from the manager, who disappeared into the kitchen. The friend, who knew the man, got up from the table to find out what was wrong. She returned, distressed.
 ''What happened?'' Ms. De Marsche asked. 
 The friend explained that the man was canvassing restaurants. His uncle had just died in the hospital, and the man told hospital officials the rest of his family couldn't make it to town for a couple of days. 
 They told him, ''Get ice.''

HEADLINE: No Victories, but Lots of Giveaways

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
Brett Yormark, the chief executive of the Nets, knew something had to be done. Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat had just hit a 3-point shot with a tenth of a second remaining to help send the Nets to their 10th consecutive loss to open the N.B.A. season. Yormark's 5-year-old son, Drake, who traveled with his father to Miami to see Saturday's game, was distraught.
 ''I looked over at him and said 10 is enough,'' Yormark recalled as the Nets played the Indiana Pacers at the Izod Center on Tuesday night.
 On Sunday, Yormark talked with Barry Baum, the Nets' business publicist, and Fred Mangione, who is in charge of season tickets and marketing, to create a promotion to get fans behind the team. By the end of the day they created the 10 Is Enough plan to sell $10 tickets and give season-ticket holders two additional free seats to the game against the Pacers. 
 The team sold 1,000 $10 tickets and gave away 500 seats to season-ticket holders on 48 hours' notice for a Tuesday night contest against a less-than-marquee rival. The promotion did not get the Nets over the hump. They lost, 91-83, and the announced crowd was 11,332, more than 3,000 short of the season average.
 Still, the promotion was vintage Yormark: creative, quick and value-oriented; think the Bill Veeck of basketball. It was also a sign of how far he and the Nets are going to fill their arena, and of the challenges they face.
 Any team that starts the season with 12 losses -- the latest came Wednesday in Milwaukee, 99-85 -- would have a tough time drawing fans, of course. But the Nets have lost several of their best players to injuries; the eight players remaining have often worked hard on the court, only to fade late in several games.
 The recession has hurt teams across the league. But the Nets, who have not made the playoffs the last two seasons and play in the same market as the Knicks, slashed their average ticket prices 19 percent this season, the second-steepest decline in the league. Seeing a Nets game is cheaper than seeing an Oklahoma City Thunder game.
 The biggest hurdle, though, involves the team's future. The club's principal owner, Bruce C. Ratner, has been planning to move the Nets to Brooklyn since he bought the club in 2004. After years of punishing financial losses in New Jersey, he has been jettisoning stars like Jason Kidd and Vince Carter. In September, he announced plans to sell 80 percent of the team to the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov.
 Before they get to Brooklyn -- legal victories, financing and construction must still occur -- the Nets may move to Newark as part of a truce being brokered by the governor's office. Under a plan still being negotiated, the Nets would play a few seasons at the Prudential Center in Newark and would not have to pay the $7.5 million penalty for breaking their current lease, which runs through the 2012-13 season.
 All of the concerts and family entertainment now at the Prudential Center would move to the Izod Center.
 Against all of these headwinds, Yormark has pitched a Nets game as a fan-friendly place to take children, to stretch the entertainment dollar and to see hard-working, up-and-coming players before they leave town.
 ''As a team in transition, it's hard to go after the hard-core fan,'' Yormark said. ''We're the underdog in the market. We accept it and make no excuses for it.''
 At least on Tuesday, Yormark's message to the fans -- that the team is trying hard and that a Nets game was a good value -- seemed to be getting through to some.
 ''It's not the greatest arena to go to, so the Nets should be friendly and accessible,'' said Joe Locatell, 23, who bought $10 tickets with his friend Joe Quezada. ''I don't mind that they are in limbo. As long as they stay in the tristate area and don't move to Kansas City.''
 Yormark is not alone in trying to drum up sales. All but three N.B.A. teams cut ticket prices or kept them unchanged this season. (The three that raised prices -- Atlanta, New Orleans and Portland -- had successful 2008-9 seasons). Many teams have been selling ticket plans that are built around opponents, like those that made the playoffs last season, and players, including the top rookies.
 The Toronto Raptors have a Cocktails and Clipboard plan that includes a wine-and-cheese tasting and an instructional session with the coach before the game. The Raptors also have a Scotch tasting run by a sponsor. The San Antonio Spurs, among others, sell tickets with an all-you-can-eat package. The Milwaukee Bucks sell half-season plans that include a $200 gift card that can be used for concessions.
 ''If there's an upside to the down economy, it's how teams are responding to it,'' said Christopher Granger, the N.B.A.'s senior vice president for team marketing and business operations.
 Granger and other marketing experts agree that Yormark is one of the most creative executives in the league, as his blizzard of promotions shows. Fans who took a baseball ticket stub to a recent game against the Philadelphia 76ers could buy a Nets ticket for half price. On opening night, food and nonalcoholic beverages were half price.
 Nine players bought a total of 600 full season tickets and gave them to youth groups. Some of those players visited the home, office or school of fans who bought season tickets. Others have greeted fans as they entered the Izod Center.
 ''The fans have been great so far, especially with our record,'' said Keyon Dooling, a Nets guard who bought $15,000 worth of season tickets and donated them to a local Boys and Girls Club, which he called his safe haven while growing up in Florida.
 Longtime season-ticket holders were also taken on a dining cruise in May. Fans who bought the Match-Up ticket plan that featured games against the league's top teams received reversible jerseys with a Nets player on one side and a star from another team like LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers on the other.
 Bill Sutton, a former vice president for marketing at the N.B.A., said Yormark might have crossed a line with the reversible jersey promotion because he devalued the Nets at the expense of another team. The $10 tickets seemed like a fire sale, he added.
 ''Some of this reeks of desperation and throw this up and see if it sticks,'' said Sutton, who is now a consultant. ''You're also saying that my product is worth $10, and I'm not sure I want to go there, either.''
 Yormark said value was the name of the game, particularly with the casual fans he aims for. Either way, Sutton and other experts gave him high marks for trying to make the most of a tough situation.
 ''The Nets are doing what they have to do,'' said Jon Greenberg, the editor of the Team Marketing Report. ''They seem small time-ish, especially in their market. But they have to be superaggressive.''

HEADLINE: Companies Call Government Incentives the Key to Green

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
IN less than three weeks, world leaders will gather in Copenhagen to begin hammering out an agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming.
 But many clean-energy companies, which make and use the technologies that in theory will help wean the world off polluting fossil fuels, are reacting with a shrug -- and not merely because expectations for Copenhagen have plunged.
What matters far more in the near term, the companies say, are national governments' efforts to provide incentives for developing technologies like wind and solar power or cellulosic ethanol.
 Copenhagen ''is a very important backdrop,'' said Tom Carnahan, the founder and president of Wind Capital Group, a wind developer in St. Louis. ''But the real battle for what our energy future is going to be is Washington.'' 
 The reality, experts say, is that the clean-energy industry has already begun to find its footing, both in the United States and abroad, without any recent international action on climate -- although concerns about emissions as well as energy security are clearly the driving force. A carbon reduction plan, and hence the creation of markets that put a price on carbon, would have little immediate impact on solar or wind power unless the price on carbon is very high. 
 ''Of course carbon price, whether foreign or domestic, is the critical element in the long-term economics of renewables and efficiency -- but is of relatively little consequence now,'' Seth Kaplan, a vice president at the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental group, wrote in an e-mail message.
 In this country, wind power has become one of the fastest-growing types of electricity generation, aided by a federal tax credit and state policies that require a certain proportion of electricity to be generated by renewable sources. Solar power, particularly the installation of rooftop panels, is largely thriving, too. Together, though, renewables other than hydropower account for only 3 percent of electricity.
 China has also been ramping up its renewable energy, particularly in wind, due partly to concerns about pollution. And it has aggressively pursued manufacturing of wind and solar power, stirring concern in Congress -- where ''green jobs'' has become an almost mandatory talking point -- about the competitiveness of American industry. Sales of wind power components to five Chinese state-owned turbine manufacturers are ''going gangbusters,'' said Gregory J. Yurek, chief executive of American Superconductor, a Devens, Mass., company that makes parts for wind turbines and the electric grid. One of American Superconductor's customers, Sinovel Wind, was not even making wind turbines four years ago, he said, and the company will soon be the largest turbine maker in China.
 Around the world, ''You're going to see growth in the clean-tech industry almost regardless of what happens in Copenhagen,'' Mr. Yurek added.
 THERE is plenty more that China and the United States can do to encourage renewable energy production, company executives say. Because renewable energy, especially solar power, is expensive, it requires substantial subsidies or other incentives. Adding renewable energy to the grid also needs to be managed carefully because the supplies of sufficient wind and sunshine vary. 
 ''Ultimately what matters is mandates at the national level,'' said Tom Amis, who heads up the renewable energy group at Alston & Bird, a law firm.
 In the United States, where tight credit markets caused financing for many projects to dry up early this year, renewable energy developers have praised the government stimulus package. The Treasury and the Department of Energy began handing out grants to wind farm developers a few months ago, with a turnaround of three weeks from application to receipt of money, in some cases.
 But most developers still have a wish list, and at the top is a federal ''renewable electricity standard.'' This tool, modeled on policies already in place in about half the states, would require the country to get a certain percentage of its electricity mix from renewables and energy efficiency. The Waxman-Markey climate bill, which passed the House of Representatives in June, contains this requirement (20 percent by 2020); the Senate is currently considering a slightly weaker version.
 Gains made by the wind industry are ''going to be short-lived if there is not a consistent federal policy,'' said Mr. Carnahan of the Wind Capital Group.
 Verenium, a company based in Cambridge, Mass., that is gearing up to produce cellulosic ethanol from sugarcane bagasse (the fiber left after juice is squeezed out of the cane) and other feedstocks, is focused on policies in the United States in the near term. ''It really is about what happens nationally,'' said Carlos A. Riva, the chief executive. Carbon pricing is important over the longer term, he said, but right now, the drivers for his business include policies from the Departments of Energy and Agriculture, and federal cellulosic ethanol mandates.
 Even if the responsibility for shaping the immediate future of clean energy falls to national governments, Copenhagen can help from the policy debate, argues Mark R. Pinto, the chief technology officer of Applied Materials, in Santa Clara., Calif., which makes equipment for manufacturing solar products.
 By pushing to the fore the quest to reduce emissions and promote clean energy, Copenhagen can spur action by national governments, Mr. Pinto said.
 India, for example, is believed to be about to announce policies to encourage large investments in solar power, perhaps timed to arrive with a splash ahead of the Copenhagen meetings. 
 There are some new industries that do stand to gain more directly from Copenhagen, however. Carbon traders will also be at the meetings, and hungry for the expansion of their business.
 ''For those of us in the carbon industries, the meaning of Copenhagen is probably more clear and direct than for general clean-tech or renewable energy industries,'' Alex Rau, a San Francisco-based principal at the carbon management firm Climate Wedge, said in an e-mail message. ''If you had to pick one industry that is most 'leveraged' to an agreement in Copenhagen, it would be this industry that develops, finances or buys credits from greenhouse gas reduction projects internationally, outside the U.S.'' 
 The way this works, Mr. Rau said, is that companies like Climate Wedge invest in projects in developing countries that offset emissions from European countries participating in carbon trading (such projects would encompass efforts to capture methane gas emitted from landfills, for example). After 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol expires, Mr. Rau said, the value of the investments in developing countries will be uncertain, and if the uncertainty is prolonged, it can hurt investment.
 In fact, if the Senate passes a climate bill compatible with that passed by the House, it may help expand those markets, especially with United States participation in an international agreement. ''If there is an agreement in the near term with the U.S. as a partner, domestic projects and investments to reduce emissions could well be eligible for the international carbon market,'' Mr. Rau said. ''That would spawn a whole industry here.''
 In general, experts say, industries that are moving ahead aggressively are unlikely to pause even if international leaders fail to reach an agreement on combating climate change. Mr. Yurek of American Superconductor noted, by way of example, that Britain is pushing forward with offshore wind; its goal is to install 30,000 megawatts of capacity, much of it offshore, which would be nearly as much as there already is -- on land -- across the entire United States.
 ''If there's no Copenhagen result, I don't think they're going to stop that,'' Mr. Yurek said.

HEADLINE: Shubert Reaches a Deal With Two Stage Producers

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The powerful Shubert Organization, which owns the most theaters on Broadway, has struck a new business deal with two respected theater producers that may lead to greater competition among other producers for the best Broadway houses and spur more entrepreneurial stage ventures.
 Philip J. Smith and Robert E. Wankel, the chairman and president of the Shubert Organization, have struck a three-year development deal with Frederick Zollo and Robert Cole, Tony Award winners for ''Angels in America.'' 
 Under the contract the Shubert Organization could invest in Zollo-Cole shows up to a fixed percentage -- which none of the parties would reveal -- or act as advisers without investing. Jointly produced shows would be guaranteed a Shubert theater, probably the best available. If Mr. Zollo and Mr. Cole pursued a show without Shubert interest, which the four said was unlikely, they would compete for theaters with other producers. 
 Some in the industry, citing the laws of supply and demand, said that more competition for theater space would provide only greater incentive for producers to create plays and musicals that held the widest appeal, perhaps by casting ever-bigger-name stars. Demonstrating that a show could be a commercial hit is essential to securing a booking in one of the 40 total Broadway houses, of which the Shubert group has 17.
 Mr. Smith and Mr. Wankel said in interviews that their new venture also reflected the uncertain economic era, a step taken to help bankroll and mount their productions at a time when some investors may still be skittish about Broadway.
 Mr. Zollo and Mr. Cole are two of the producers of the current Broadway hit ''A Steady Rain.'' (That play is running at the Schoenfeld Theater, a Shubert house, but the deal came about after opening night, the men said.) The four said no fees have been paid up front, though Mr. Zollo and Mr. Cole are working out of Shubert offices.
 Broadway has had somewhat similar deals before. The director and writer James Lapine had a first-look deal with the Shubert group in the 1990s, which generated the musical ''Passion'' and the play ''Dirty Blonde,'' but Mr. Lapine was not a producer. The two other major Broadway theater owners, the Nederlander Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters, have had development deals with other artists, and have staff members who develop shows -- particularly Jujamcyn, which has had deals with producers but is far smaller (with five theaters) than the Shubert group.
 Mr. Smith said the new arrangement was unusual for the Shubert Organization, widely considered the most influential theater owner on Broadway because of the number and quality of its houses. The organization has never had veteran independent producers working in-house on shows in which the company has a right to develop and invest. The deal is one of the most assertive business moves by the organization since the death, in 2008, of its leader Gerald Schoenfeld, who was once actively involved in producing theater.
 ''We've been less hands-on over the last many years, because there was no need to help producers by investing in their shows,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It would have been cruel to take over, say, our two best playhouses and fill them with our own plays. That would not have gone over well with producers.'' 
 Mr. Zollo, whose Broadway credits also include the Tony-winning revival of ''Private Lives,'' said he and Mr. Cole approached the Shubert Organization with the deal this fall. He said that their chief motive was to build a closer relationship with Mr. Smith and Mr. Wankel, whom he credited with running a profitable operation.
 Mr. Zollo, who is also a film producer, compared the deal with some of his Hollywood business arrangements; his movies have included the Academy Award-nominated ''Quiz Show'' and ''Ghosts of Mississippi.''
 ''My close relationships with film studios like Castle Rock played a key part in my work, and the Shuberts also have sharp instincts about quality and key assets -- the best playhouses on Broadway -- that support good theater,'' Mr. Zollo said.
 Mr. Cole said he had reached out to another theater owner this fall to discuss a similar deal but quickly focused on the Shuberts. He and Mr. Zollo declined to identify the other owner. 
 Informed about the deal, some producers said privately that the deal could inspire more ventures in which theater owners and producers share financial risks, as nonprofit theater companies sometimes do with others. (Theater owners sometimes invest in shows, but do not conceive many.) Whether such deals lead to more broadly appealing star attractions remains to be seen.
 The most striking aspect of the deal, producers said, was that Mr. Zollo and Mr. Cole would essentially have first dibs on Shubert houses, which could spark competition and perhaps resentment among producers whose shows have made money for their Shubert landlords. 
 At least one producer who often books plays in Shubert theaters, Jeffrey Richards, did not seem concerned when asked about increased competition from the deal.
 ''I don't know, there is a wonderful premium on playhouses this year, and I expect it will continue,'' he said. ''There are a lot of terrific projects in the pipeline.''

HEADLINE: Iran Will Not Ship Uranium Abroad, Foreign Minister Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Iran's foreign minister said this week that his government would not ship its stockpile of low-enriched uranium out of the country, making him the highest ranking official so far to declare that Iran would renege on a deal aimed at defusing a confrontation with the West over its nuclear program.
 ''We will definitely not send our 3.5-percent-enriched uranium out of the country,'' Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minister, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency in remarks reported Wednesday. 
 But Iran has repeatedly sent mixed signals on the nuclear issue, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Mottaki was staking out a negotiating position or issuing a final rejection of the deal that Iran's negotiating team agreed to last month in Vienna.
 While he said that enriched uranium would not be sent abroad, he also said Iran would consider ''a simultaneous swap'' in which it would give up some of its stockpile after it received more highly enriched fuel. The swap would have to take place on Iranian soil, he said.
 In an interview with ISNA published Wednesday, Mr. Mottaki emphasized the rejection. But in an interview with an Indian newspaper, The Hindu, earlier this week, he seemed to emphasize Iran's willingness to find a compromise.
 ''We believe that with the continuation of the diplomacy going on now, it is possible to reach an agreement and compromise,'' he said in comments published in Monday's edition of The Hindu and reprinted in the English-language Tehran Times. ''Complementary suggestions and proposals are being sent and received by both sides.''
 In Vienna, a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency was uncertain what to make of the foreign minister's remarks, saying it was unclear if they were a formal response from the Iranians or simply his personal view. 
 Iran appeared to reject the deal late last month, but neither the State Department nor the nuclear agency considered that a formal response. When the agency does get a formal response from Tehran, the atomic energy agency representative added, it will address the issue publicly. 
 The United States and Europe have said that they accepted the initial proposal because it would delay Iran's ability to produce fuel for a nuclear weapon and allow time for further negotiations over its nuclear program. The proposal involved sending about three-quarters of Iran's declared stockpile of low-enriched uranium out of the country to be further enriched, turned into fuel rods and returned to a nuclear reactor in Tehran that makes medical isotopes. The Western nations calculated that it would take about a year for Iran to replace the uranium. 
 But in Tehran, where officials insist their nuclear program is for civilian purposes only, the deal was attacked from across the political spectrum. When President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seemed to suggest it was acceptable, he was criticized from all sides, even by the reformists he long called too soft on the West.
 Mr. Mottaki's statement was one of three recent developments relating to Iran's nuclear program, and Iran experts said they probably were all connected. The first involved a report by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, who examined a recently revealed enrichment laboratory being built inside a mountain on a military base near the city of Qum. The lab is too small to produce the quantity of fuel needed for a commercial reactor, they said, suggesting it was designed more for making fuel for a weapon.
 The second involved President Obama's recent visits to Russia and China. While the Russian president said that Moscow was growing tired of waiting for Iran, he did not commit to joining the United States and Europe in tough new sanctions if Iran continues with its nuclear program. China also did not respond publicly to the president's request to press Iran.
 A scientist who is an Iran expert said, ''I think in the last week the reluctance of Russian and Chinese presidents meeting with Mr. Obama to overtly and unequivocally support Mr. Obama for more sanctions has given them in Iran a boost to toughen up their brinkmanship.'' The scientist commented on the condition that he not be identified because he at times travels to Iran for work.
 Mr. Mottaki's dueling messages left unclear if Iran's leaders were looking for a compromise that would satisfy the West and their domestic constituency -- which strongly supports the nuclear program -- or if it was feeling more strongly than ever that it could simply defy the West and keep its enrichment program running. 
 Rasool Nafisi, an Iran expert who has written extensively about Iran's Revolutionary Guards, an elite military force that is exerting increasing influence over the government and the economy, said that it looked as though the leadership was looking for a way to settle with the West while not losing political ground at home.
 In trying to divine Iran's intentions, experts have tried to discern the position taken by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader. In his public comments he has insisted there will be no compromise with the West.
 But the negotiating team that accepted the deal last month was led by Saeed Jalili, a hard-liner and Khamenei loyalist, making it highly unlikely the team had agreed without Ayatollah Khamenei's approval. At the same time, Iranian critics of the deal, also considered Khamenei loyalists, were not likely to attack it without his approval, all of which has left competing views of Iran's ultimate goal. 
 But the scientist who at times works in Iran said if there was one conclusion to be drawn from Mr. Mottaki's remarks, it was that Washington's strategy of negotiations without preconditions, but with pressure and threats, had not worked.

HEADLINE: Can Crispy Green Go National?

BYLINE: By LORA KOLODNY

 BODY:
The Company:Crispy Green of Fairfield, N.J., a maker of freeze-dried fruit snacks sold in silver packages that has seven employees and had 2008 revenue of $2.2 million. The snacks are a gluten-, dairy- and nut-free alternative to chips.
 The Challenge: To increase sales aggressively. Crispy Green wanted to get its snacks on the shelves of major national food chains. But it didn't want to sacrifice profitability by doing what chains generally require: discounting products steeply and paying expensive fees in exchange for shelf space. The company lacked the cash to ''pay for play'' the way Kraft or General Mills might. And it feared that discounting its product would undercut its premium image and hurt relationships with its existing customers. 
 The Background: Since 2005, when Crispy Green introduced its freeze-dried slices of apples and pears, the company has stuck to a ''transparent'' pricing policy, giving wholesale customers, large or small, the same rates. Among other things, Angela Liu, the company's chief executive and founder, feared that choosing to discount or to pay fees might represent a slippery slope that would undermine the company's long-term prospects. A first-time entrepreneur who had left a chemical engineering career in pharmaceuticals to start Crispy Green, Ms. Liu knew she was going against the grain. 
 Early buyers included mom-and-pop stores and gourmet grocers like Central Market in Houston and Balducci's in New York. By the start of 2008, having built relationships with some 200 independent groceries and small chains across the United States, Crispy Green was growing at a year-over-year clip of 80 percent. But as Ms. Liu prepared to approach buyers and distributors at bigger chains, a Crispy Green consultant, Alan Levitan, a 30-year veteran of the grocery industry, warned that her pricing policy could become an impediment. 
 She remained optimistic -- until a meeting in late October 2008 between her sales staff and UNFI, a specialty foods distributor that works with Hannaford Supermarkets, a grocery chain with more than 150 stores in the northeastern United States. UNFI seemed to view Crispy Green favorably but said Hannaford's corporate policy required discount terms -- 10 to 15 percent lower prices than the Crispy Green would offer other wholesale customers -- to fuel special sales throughout the year. UNFI wouldn't even show Crispy Green products to Hannaford buyers unless Ms. Liu agreed to the discounts. 
 Ms. Liu responded that selling Crispy Green at 15 percent off one week and at the suggested retail price the rest of the season could actually drive shoppers to buy less often, encouraging them to wait for specials and thereby hurting sales volume for Crispy Green as well as for Hannaford. She concluded that offering ''high-low'' pricing to please a distributor was too much of a sacrifice -- no matter how desirable the relationship. 
 As it happened, however, sales at Crispy Green's largest retail partner to date, the Northeast division of 7-Eleven, were slowing. Ms. Liu's buyer contact there suggested the fruit snacks were getting lost among a huge variety of items. He believed that, after a great debut, the snacks needed to be ''refreshed.'' Maybe special sales could do that. 
 Ms. Liu began to wonder: Was it time for a new pricing strategy? Or was it time to abandon the hope of growing through major chains?
 The Options: Ms. Liu and Mr. Levitan deliberated over the pricing strategy for weeks, but she continued to follow her instincts. ''I think like a shopper,'' she said. ''What I don't want in the middle of a recession is for prices to go up on a favorite snack.'' Whatever she did, she didn't want to give major chains a huge advantage over the smaller outlets whose loyalty had helped her establish the business. 
 They settled on two options: 
 One was to cut operating expenses enough to create a new layer of lower, bulk wholesale prices that could be extended across the board. This would be intended to satisfy the major national groceries -- but not to favor any one chain. To cut expenses, Mr. Levitan suggested scaling back plans to refresh the brand's packaging and Web site.
 The second option was to forget the big chains entirely and try to expand within existing channels. To sell a higher volume of Crispy Green where it was already known, Ms. Liu thought, she'd probably have to introduce and market new flavors and pack sizes to stimulate shopper interest. This could get expensive, she feared. Or worse, it could tax Crispy Green's fruit supply chain.
 (To see what other business owners think Crispy Green should do or to share your own thoughts, click here.)
 The Decision: In the end, Crispy Green decided to try to have it both ways: It would offer a new discount that would attract, it hoped, some national chains, but it would also introduce new products that it hoped would increase sales in existing channels. 
 It was risky -- Crispy Green would have to achieve enough operational savings to pay for the initiatives while still preserving profitability. And trying to do both within its established budget could lead to too-slight discounts or too-few new products to make a difference with new prospects and old customers alike.
 But Crispy Green introduced improvements to packaging and Web pages, as well as new snacks -- banana, mango and strawberry. It didn't ramp up spending on advertising as it had once considered. Instead, it focused on garnering positive reviews from blogs and other media outlets.
 To cut costs, Ms. Liu negotiated deals with growers and shippers, and postponed hiring a national sales manager. She dedicated savings to meet national chains and their distributors halfway on pricing, and extended the same type of pricing, under different terms, to smaller accounts. 
 The Results: With her new discount pricing layer and flavors, Ms. Liu won meetings with distributors and buyers for the likes of Target, Giant Eagle (a grocery chain with 223 stores in the eastern United States), and ShopRite. The new pricing and flavors, however, weren't enough for 7-Eleven, which discontinued sale of Crispy Green. 
 Demand online, and in test store locations of ShopRite and Giant Eagle helped offset the blow to the bottom line, Ms. Liu reports. But over all, the company has failed to make a national deal with a major chain in 2009. And it failed to increase its volume of sales greatly within existing, smaller accounts. As a result, it has so far achieved less revenue growth than it had sought for the year. 
 The company set out to increase sales by at least 50 percent but eventually reined in its goal to 33 percent. It expects to meet these diminished expectations and has preserved margins and its premium image in a challenging economy.

HEADLINE: Luxury Stores Trim Inventory And Discounts

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
All around Saks Fifth Avenue, merchandise is sold out. The $2,520 Marni shearling vest? Gone. The $5,295 Brioni leather bomber jacket? Only one left. The $1,995 over-the-knee Christian Louboutin boots? 
 ''All gone, except for this,'' said Nick Passerelli, a Saks employee, dangling a size 11 boot from his fingers.
 After a brutal year in which the nation's luxury retailers were forced to offer their wares at stunning discounts, they are trying to get their magic back. And they may have found a way: deliberately running low on merchandise.
 Saks, the chic Manhattan department store, is a prime example. Its inventory is down by double digits compared with last year. That is partly a response to lower demand, of course, but it is also a business strategy aimed at weaning consumers from deep discounts. By carrying fewer goods and selling them at full price, Saks is essentially telling customers: buy it now or live without it. 
 ''Upscale stores want to train the customer that luxury equals exclusivity and that they cannot assume they can wait and they're able to buy it on sale,'' said William S. Taubman, chief operating officer of Taubman Centers, a mall developer and owner.
 This less-is-more strategy is risky, of course. If retailers sell out of goods too soon, they will lose profits they need. But they think it is even riskier to stock up too much. 
 This time last year, purveyors of high-end goods were drowning in merchandise. Consumers had stopped spending in the economic downturn, forcing stores to cut prices sharply to unload designer goods. At 50 or 70 percent off, once-expensive stilettos and suits flew off the shelves. 
 But the discounts prompted some consumers to wonder what those items were really worth in the first place. And to the distress of retailers, shoppers began to feel entitled to those eye-popping discounts -- not just at big-box stores like Wal-Mart and value-price department stores like Kohl's, but at Saks and Neiman Marcus, too. 
 Now, as the economy stabilizes, luxury retailers are taking measures to stamp out discount fever.
 They have significantly cut their inventories and are trying, with some early success, to sell their wares at full price. Both Saks and Neiman Marcus have gently told customers that there are fewer goods to go around this year. 
 Burton M. Tansky, president and chief executive of the Neiman Marcus Group, says he does not think he is retraining consumers. Rather, he said, he is doing what is best for the health of his company. 
 ''We've told our customers that the availability is less than they're used to seeing in the stores,'' Mr. Tansky said. ''We've suggested that it would be prudent to shop early.''
 If a particular item sells out at Neiman Marcus, the ability to restock the shelves will depend on the merchandise category. In general, though, lead times for manufacturing luxury goods are long. 
 ''As you go up the ladder to European designers, it's virtually impossible,'' Mr. Tansky said. ''But in contemporary apparel, women's shoes, it's possible.''
 Saks, too, has told customers its inventories are lean. 
 ''We're out of stock on a number of hot items people want,'' Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive, said this month as he walked through the sprawling shoe department at Saks in Manhattan. ''Our associates are telling people, 'If you want this item in your size, we only have three of them, we only have two.' ''
 That strategy might be working. ''I've been running out of sizes because I'm selling out,'' said Lera Alexkseyeva, a Saks employee who sells clothing by Brunello Cucinelli. Saks bought 21 gray cashmere and fox fur jackets designed by Mr. Cucinelli in the medieval village of Solomeo, Italy. All but one jacket have sold -- at $2,695 each.
 A big question this Christmas will be how successful retailers are with the strategy. Some surveys have found that, so far, the prospect of lean inventories is not prompting consumers to hasten their holiday shopping. Shoppers could wait out the retailers until late in the season, in the hope that they will panic and put high-grade merchandise on sale.
 ''Bargains seemingly may matter more than selection for the consumer,'' Michael P. Niemira, the director of research and chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said in a news release this month. 
 Regardless of when consumers choose to shop, retailers are glad to have a better handle on customer demand. 
 Speaking about the luxury market, Peter E. Nordstrom, executive vice president and president of merchandising for Nordstrom, said, ''The business might not be exactly where we want it, but it is relatively stable.''
 Nordstrom has always had a wider range of prices than Saks and Neiman Marcus, and so has less need to hit the reset button with shoppers. The chain weathered the downturn better than its competitors. And while it has less inventory than last year, Mr. Nordstrom said when it came to Christmas, ''we think we're going to have enough.'' 
 Saks came in for sharp criticism from designers last year for the magnitude of its discounting. Mr. Sadove is being aggressive this year about managing inventory, and acknowledged the possibility of not having enough merchandise even for customers willing to pay full price. 
 ''I think we in the industry may go too far and cut back too much,'' he said. ''You're going to lose some sales. And that's O.K. versus having too much and having to sell it at these very high markdowns.''
 In fact, chains said they were selling more merchandise at full price today than they were a year ago. And while the stores will not reveal exact numbers, they say a reason their earnings are improving is that they are selling a higher proportion of goods at full price. This month, Saks posted a profit for the first time in months, and Nordstrom said its profit rose as well. Neiman Marcus will report its earnings in December.
 While there will be sales this season, as there are every year, most analysts are predicting they will be less drastic than last year. 
 That is good news for high-end chains that suffered after years of giddy double-digit growth fueled by easy credit. While those days are gone, for now at least, some industry veterans say luxury retailing will thrive again by returning to its roots.
 ''What's luxury retailing about?'' Mr. Sadove said. ''It is about a scarcity of supply.''

HEADLINE: Home Building Surprises Analysts by Slowing Down

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Home construction slowed unexpectedly in October to the lowest level in six months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, resurrecting fears that the housing market may be slow to recover.
 A separate report showed that consumer prices inched upward in October, but not enough to make inflation a concern even with the dollar weakening and interest rates at record lows.
 The data on home construction showed a decline in the rate of single- and multiple-family home building, contributing to an overall decrease of 10.6 percent in housing starts from September. In total, construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 housing units in October, falling short of the 600,000 predicted by analysts. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, declined as well, to an annual rate of 552,000, from 575,000, also falling short of forecasts. 
 Apartment construction slowed to a record low, dipping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 53,000 in October. Analysts attributed the decrease to the reluctance of banks to finance large construction projects and lackluster demand for rentals as vacancies remained abundant.
 Part of the overall decline in housing construction might be explained by the uncertainty in October over whether Congress would extend a tax credit for first-time home buyers. This month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April, but builders might have been reluctant to begin construction in October without assurance that homes would be bought. 
 The revival of the housing market is considered crucial to reviving the economy. Construction adds jobs to the economy, and once a home is sold, consumers typically go on spending sprees as they fill it with appliances and furniture. 
 ''These figures can be pretty volatile from month to month, so it may just be a blip,'' Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. ''Nevertheless, taken at face value it suggests home builders are still uncertain about the sustainability of the rebound in home sales.''
 Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com, said demand for homes would probably remain weak into 2010.
 ''The housing market is still very fragile,'' she said. ''It seems that the market has bottomed in terms of sales and starts, but that stability can be easily broken, even if affordability is very high.''
 The Labor Department's report on consumer prices showed that the Consumer Price Index climbed 0.3 percent, above analysts' estimates of 0.2 percent. The index measures the changes in the cost of a bundle of goods for consumers -- things like cooking oil, airplane tickets and medical care. 
 The increases came because of rising energy and motor vehicle costs, the report said. When the government excluded the cost of food and energy, which can be volatile, prices rose 0.2 percent.
 The prices of cars and trucks showed steep increases. Analysts said that could be a side effect of the government's popular cash-for-clunkers program, which depleted the supply of both cheaper 2009 models and used vehicles, driving up prices.
 The small increase in consumer prices signaled that inflationary pressures, by and large, appear to be in check, restrained by the nation's high unemployment rate and significant unused factory capacity. On Tuesday, a report on wholesale prices showed similar results, though there were signs that higher prices might be on the horizon.
 ''Effectively, this gives the Federal Reserve a checkered flag to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight.

HEADLINE: It's All a Blur to Them

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
''I'VE heard that in Australia, men are wearing tights,'' Chuong Pham said. Tights for men, he acknowledged, may be extreme. But Mr. Pham, 28, an engineer in Manhattan, thought nothing of combining stalk-slim jeans with a sweatshirt pinched from his mom and sexily sheared a la ''Flashdance.'' Raking his fingers through a sheaf of hair that tumbled in waves past his collarbone, Mr. Pham said: ''There is a whole transition of men getting into women's wear. It used to be that the people who did it were just the edgier ones. Now it's much more common.'' 
 Common enough that Mr. Pham and his forward-thinking cohort -- urban Americans, mostly in their 20s -- are revising standard notions of gender-appropriate dressing, tweaking codes, upending conventions and making hash of ancient norms. 
 ''My generation is more outside the box than the generation before me,'' said Brandon Dailey, 26, a hairstylist in Manhattan. ''Our minds are more open to different things, and that sometimes means mixing it up in what we wear.'' He may never put on a skirt, he allowed, but sees nothing amiss in working ''a long drapey shirt with really tight pants.'' 
 Audrey Reynolds, an acquaintance, was engaging in a bit of gender play herself. Ms. Reynolds, 25, who wore a slouchy biker jacket and beat-up clog boots, insisted: ''Every line should be unisex. A good piece of clothing is a good piece of clothing no matter who was meant to wear it in the first place.'' 
 At one time, such artfully calibrated ambiguity might have been the expression of a renegade mind. Today it seems scarcely more subversive than wearing black, just the latest countercultural gesture to be tugged into the mainstream. The look is androgynous, for sure -- but with a difference. 
 During the 1970s, arguably the last time sartorial gender blending was as pervasive in the culture, it grew in part from the kind of feminist thinking that suggested girls play with Lego sets and boys play with dolls. ''Now we have something new,'' said Diane Ehrensaft, a psychologist in Oakland, who writes about gender. That something is not necessarily about one's politics or sexual orientation or, she added pointedly, ''about one's core identity as a male or female.''
 What Dr. Ehrensaft has dubbed ''gender fluidity'' remains in her view a form of rebellion. It suggests, she said, that ''younger people no longer accept the standard boxes. They won't be bound by boys having to wear this or girls wearing that. I think there is a peer culture in which that kind of gender blurring is not only acceptable but cool.'' 
 Women have been incorporating trousers, biker jackets and combat boots into their wardrobes since Amelia Earhart swapped her pearls for a flight suit. But increasingly, it is men who are making unabashed forays into mom's closet, some for fashion's sake, others for fit. A few may be taking their style cues from Pete Wentz, the emo rocker who demonstrates on YouTube how to slick on eyeliner; or Adam Lambert, the ''American Idol'' runner-up, who has made sooty eyes and blue-black nails his fashion insignia. Others fall back on Johnny Depp. 
 ''I came here with an idea,'' Dyllan White said as he inspected his reflection at Mudhoney, a unisex hair salon in the East Village. Mr. White, 22, who is studying art therapy, wanted ''something up and back, something 'Cry-Baby,' '' he said. He settled on a modified pompadour that recalled Mr. Depp in the 1990 John Waters movie of that name. ''I feel fine about it, like a guy,'' he said of his haircut. ''It's universal. It's awesome.'' 
 To Sharon Graubard, a senior executive with Stylesight, a trend forecasting firm in New York, Mr. White's thinking points to a sea change. ''In the streets I see young couples dressing almost alike, wearing slicked hair, peacoats, straight jeans or those longer T-shirts that are almost like a dress,'' she said. Such a willful melding of men's and women's garb represents, she said, ''a kind of evening of the playing field.''
 Mingling men's and women's clothing, others argue, is like waving a flag of neutrality. ''It's a way of breaking down sexualized relationships, of getting people to relax,'' said Piper Marshall, 24, who is an assistant art curator at the Swiss Institute in Manhattan. ''I work with lots of male artists,'' she added. ''It's important to find a common ground.'' 
 Humberto Leon, an owner of Opening Ceremony, the vanguard boutique in Lower Manhattan, is one of a growing number of merchants catering to that mind-set. Lately Mr. Leon has been mingling men's and women's clothing with marked success. Even angora cat-print cardigans, part of a unisex line designed by Chloe Sevigny, ''flew out of the store,'' he said, snapped up by men and women alike. 
 So entrenched are the latest forms of gender blending that mainstream purveyors of hip, including Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, are offering clothing and jewelry meant to be worn by either sex. American Apparel has no fewer than 724 unisex items -- hoodies, cardigans, blazers and bow ties, among them -- on its Web site, simply because, as Marsha Brady, the company's creative director, put it, ''that's the way people wear clothes.''
 At a jazz club in downtown Manhattan last week, Bettina Chin and Michelle Wang drove home the point, wearing severely tailored evening ensembles that perfectly echoed each other. ''I like a mannish look at night,'' Ms. Chin explained as she flicked back her cuffs. 
 Some marketers have been quick to interpret that sort of ambiguity. Fall advertisements for Burberry show a succession of lanky, pallid men and women wearing what seem to be interchangeable coats. A model for Rolex is tricked out in an Earhart-inspired leather jacket, aviator cap and goggles. 
 Gender neutrality has gained traction on the runways as well. Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons and Yohji Yamamoto jettisoned gender codes long ago. More recently, designers as influential as Rick Owens and Alexander Wang have made their mark with draped T-shirts and, in Mr. Owens's case, dresses and high-heeled shoes for men. In London, Christopher Kane lent his spring 2010 collection some swagger by inviting the model Jenny Shimizu, a standard-bearer of female androgyny, to saunter down his runway wearing a man-tailored suit. 
 ''Today the more successful designers are the ones that try to bridge the gap between the sexes rather than drive a wedge between them,'' said Karlo Steel, a partner in Atelier, a progressive men's store in downtown Manhattan that also draws a female clientele. ''Right now fashion's pendulum seems to be swinging in that direction.'' 
 Skeptics argue nonetheless that gender blending is bound to remain a marginal trend.
 ''It's something you need to be young to do well,'' said Harold Koda, the curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''To carry it off, you need the physique of an adolescent boy. As long as the young are the primary audience, it's not going be economically sustained.'' 
 Still, gender-neutral dressing has made sufficiently formidable inroads that some suggest it has a robust future. 
 ''Obviously androgyny may not play in Peoria,'' said Dr. Ehrensaft, the psychologist. ''But norms are shifting.'' In her clinical practice, working mostly with teenagers and elementary school children, Dr. Ehrensaft said she routinely witnesses ''a kind of gender fashion parade.'' 
 ''Kids, even little kids, are experimenting across gender lines. Boys are wearing My Little Pony T-shirts, just because they like them. Sometimes they like to dress in the girls' section because the shirts are cooler.''
 Adults have long dictated the way young people dress, Dr. Ehrensaft said. ''But now the young are giving us a different dictation.''

HEADLINE: Dear Banker, Don't Call Me

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN any marriage, there is a natural division of labor. 
 Around here, we try to play to people's inherent strengths, which is why my gadget-loving husband is responsible for anything that falls under the category of computers. 
 And when I say he ''is responsible,'' what I really mean is that he's the one who is blamed for every technical glitch I don't understand -- from WiFi problems and unforeseen iPhone surcharges to Twitter phishing attacks. 
 ''Someone has hacked my tweets, whatever that means,'' I announced in an accusatory tone just last week. 
 ''It means your Twitter account has started sending strangers messages that say random things like 'lol ... u r on here?' '' he said. 
 ''I don't care what it means,'' I said. ''Just make it stop.'' 
 So he dropped everything (even the football game on TV) to figure it out. 
 In return, I handle the finances. And by ''handle,'' I mean that my husband does not see the bills, has not spoken to our accountant in years and has only the vaguest sense of how much we lost, along with the rest of America, when the economy took its dive. 
 It's a comfort, this divide-and-conquer approach, when everything is running smoothly. In addition to protecting each of us from what we fear most (me: things with cords, him: financial ruin), it also is a daily reminder of one of the major benefits of being married: someone always has your back. 
 But sometimes things don't run smoothly. 
 ''Aaar!'' my husband suddenly shrieked the other day. ''Are they taking away our house?'' 
 ''Who?'' I asked. 
 ''The bad people,'' he said. ''The ones who keep calling me. Bankers.'' I gasped involuntarily at the word ''bankers,'' a reaction I once would have reserved for such threats as flesh-eating zombies, metastatic tumors or a rampaging cyclops from outer space.
 But that was in a more innocent era, before the subprime crisis and the federal bailout and the subsequent bombshell that some of the very bankers responsible for the mess were still paying themselves big bonuses.
 ''Oh, come on, why would bankers call you?'' I asked in what I hoped sounded like a jolly, brave tone. 
 ''I was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge, and my cellphone rang and a recording told me to hold, and then finally someone came on the line and said, 'Where's your mortgage payment, buddy,' just like that,'' he said.
 ''He actually called you 'buddy'?'' I asked. 
 ''I don't care what he called me,'' my husband said. ''Just make it stop.'' 
 I promised to get to the bottom of it. It was the least I could do as the person responsible for the finances.
 Besides, how hard could it be to fix? We send our mortgage payment to Chase Home Finance every month, like clockwork. We've never even been charged a late fee. There must be some mistake.
 The next day, the crisis escalated. 
 ''They called again,'' my husband said. ''They asked if I lost my job. They asked if my salary has been cut. They asked if I'm still getting paid every two weeks.''
 He paused. Then he asked, ''Am I still getting paid every two weeks?''
 Taking a cue from the bankers, I decided to make a phone call and ask a few aggressive, probing questions of my own.
 As soon as I reached Tom Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, I said: ''My husband just found out we have a mortgage, and I think this is your fault. Can you explain how we got on this list?'' 
 Perhaps my tone was what prompted Mr. Kelly to put me on hold to listen to Muzak for a while. Or maybe that's just standard bank policy whenever a phone call is in progress. 
 In any case, after he came back on the line and heard my story, Mr. Kelly said jokingly, ''I don't want to support marriages that aren't truthful and open, but I want to help you in any way I can.''
 I tried to explain the concept of ''division of labor.'' In any case, I added, we pay the mortgage every month.
 Of course we don't pay on the first of the month. As we have been doing ever since we got our first mortgage 21 years ago, we pay during the grace period -- which in our case ends on the 15th of the month -- so we can hold on to our cash for as long as possible without incurring a late fee.
 ''Well, it's due on the first,'' Mr. Kelly pointed out.
 Oh, right. As if a bank wouldn't drag its heels if it were supposed to pay me every month. Remind me again, how many days does it take for a bank to ''process'' my deposits? And by the way, isn't Chase the same bank that recently attempted to slip a credit-card rate increase past me? Nice try, guys.
 ''Nobody ever bothered us before,'' I said. ''But now, people are suddenly calling my husband and asking if he still has a job.''
 ''Does he have a job?'' Mr. Kelly said.
 ''I told him he doesn't have to answer that,'' I said.
 ''Well, he's a journalist, probably they're thinking his place is shutting down,'' said Mr. Kelly, a former journalist himself.
 Very funny. We can't all be smart enough to get jobs working for banks, I guess.
 A few days later, after looking into the situation, Mr. Kelly reported back. It turns out we were put on the list of people who get harangued incessantly because the bank has recently stepped up efforts to identify borrowers at risk of defaulting.
 ''We have expanded our calling when consumers don't pay by the due date,'' he said. ''We want to catch it early.''
 My mortgage, in particular, falls into two risk categories because it's a jumbo-size loan and because I live in California, a state with a high foreclosure rate.
 ''Great,'' I said. ''Other than paying by the first of the month, how do I get off the list?''
 He suggested I write the bank a letter. In many states, including California, debt collectors are prohibited from phoning you if you ask them not to.
 So it's only slightly harder to get banks to stop harassing you for no reason than it is to get Twitter hackers to stop harassing you for no reason.
 And if a letter doesn't work? I guess I could always call the president of JPMorgan Chase and ask if he still has a job. My husband showed me how to find the number on the Internet.

HEADLINE: Altering How We Use and Pay Doctors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Reform and Medical Costs'' (editorial, Nov. 15):
 I was disappointed that in your otherwise thoughtful analysis of health care reform I couldn't find the words ''primary care'' or ''family physician'' mentioned even once. 
 Central to the problems of high cost, overtesting, overtreatment and poor coordination endemic in our current system is the lack of value placed on primary care medicine. 
 Which of the following do you think is more efficient and would lead to better health outcomes: a patient who sees a cardiologist for his high blood pressure, an endocrinologist for his uncomplicated diabetes and an orthopedic surgeon for his osteoarthritis, or a patient who sees a single well-trained family physician or general internist for all three -- a doctor who can also assure that needed screening and preventive care take place? 
 The answer is clear from a range of studies comparing counties, states and countries: places where primary care and generalist physicians are valued have the best health outcomes and lowest costs. We need to reform our system in such a way that the best and brightest students are attracted to careers in primary care.
 Mark Ebell Athens, Ga., Nov. 16, 2009
 The writer, a doctor, is deputy editor of American Family Physician and associate professor in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia.
 To the Editor:
 In your editorial you state, ''Doctors mostly perform high-cost tests because they want to help their patients and get paid handsomely for doing so.'' In most cases a physician's income is unaffected by the costs of the outside diagnostic studies that he orders.
 As for handsome compensation, a physician's income is not what it used to be. Over the last two decades, physicians' earnings have grown more slowly than other workers' earnings. Over the same period the portion of a typical doctor's day during which he works to cover his practice expenses has increased dramatically.
 High-achieving seniors in college must consider the duration and rigor of a medical education, and the debt that they will probably owe at its conclusion. They must also think about the income that they could earn over those seven or eight years if they pursued a less demanding profession.
 I believe that becoming a primary care physician or more recently even a general surgeon is actually now a poor economic decision; if present trends persist it will simply become an untenable one.
 Richard Williams Wenatchee, Wash., Nov. 16, 2009
 The writer is a doctor.
 To the Editor:
 Clinic-model hospitals where attending physicians are paid a straight salary have the illusion of providing good care at a cheap cost because they are bolstered by federal subsidies like research grants and large payments for training resident physicians. But the truth is that without cheap resident-physician labor (often at below-minimum wages if you do the math) and those federal subsidies, these hospitals could not survive.
 Now combine this illusion with the cynical view that most physicians are more interested in a fast buck than taking good care of their patients and you arrive at the misguided ''expert'' view that changing how physicians outside the clinic system are paid will save money while improving patient care.
 Some suggest that we change the fee-for-service method of physician payment to one that pays a single fee per episode of illness regardless of the varying amount of work necessary for each person.
 The private insurance companies already tried this and called it ''episodic care.'' It failed. And if the government were to force this method on the entire health care system it would remove the pay incentive that drives every other sector of our capitalist economy.
 Physicians have families, too, and if they work harder and longer they simply want to be paid for their time -- which is very different from delivering unnecessary care. But if you remove the incentive to work harder by forcing episodic-care payments, what you'll get is less effort and less talent.
 Brian Broker Phoenixville, Pa., Nov. 15, 2009
 The writer is an otolaryngologist.
 To the Editor:
 Discussing proposals to address the problem of rising medical costs, you write: ''Most agree that the solution is to push doctors to accept fixed payments to care for a particular illness or for a patient's needs over a year. No one knows how to make that happen quickly.''
 HealthAccessRI has known for several years how to make this happen immediately. Our model of subscription or membership-based primary care (not concierge medicine) gives people their own doctor with whom to develop a trusting relationship at a cost nearly everyone can afford -- just $25 to $30 per month.
 Primary care provides the majority of people's health care needs. Call up auto insurance agents and ask for a policy that covers tune-ups and oil changes and they'll laugh at you. Diverting dollars that go to primary care through insurance money handlers is equally absurd. Worse, it is the underlying reason that there is a shortage of primary care physicians that will continue indefinitely.
 While others tinker with insurance, we know that fixed payments to care for a patient's primary care needs over a year will make the majority of Americans' health care needs affordable and accessible.

HEADLINE: Library Leader In Era of Change To Step Down

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
After 16 years at the helm of one of the world's largest library systems, Paul LeClerc announced on Wednesday that he would step down as president of the New York Public Library in the summer of 2011 to give the institution plenty of time to search for a replacement. 
 Mr. LeClerc, 68, a scholar of French literature and the former president of Hunter College, has presided over the sprawling library system during a revolutionary period of change, as the world has shifted to the digital era. When he first came to the position in December 1993, the library did not even have a Web site. 
 The advent of search engines like Google and Yahoo rivals ''the impact of Gutenberg,'' the developer of the first printing press, Mr. LeClerc said this week as he sat in his office opposite a portrait of Benjamin Franklin at the library's headquarters, at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue.
 The combination of a vast research collection -- more than 50 million items and the world's largest online catalog -- and an extensive network of lending libraries throughout the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island makes the New York system unique, Mr. LeClerc said. (Queens and Brooklyn have separate library systems.) ''Historically it's a staggering level of ambition and generosity that no other library system in the world has,'' he said.
 Although previous presidents have been scholars, Catherine Marron, chairwoman of the library's board, said that the new leader could come from any number of fields -- academics, technology, the nonprofit sector. ''What Paul has represented is intellectual leadership,'' she said, which is particularly important to the library to maintain its worldwide reputation for scholarship and to provide vision. She and Vice Chairman Joshua L. Steiner will lead a search committee and hire a firm to help them find a successor. Mr. LeClerc made clear that he intended to steer clear of the entire process. 
 In the current economic crisis the library has seen greater use of its resources than ever, at the same time its financial resources have been strained. Visits to branches increased by 11 percent, to 18 million, in the past year, while Internet visits hit 26 million. In the spring Job Search Central opened at the Science, Industry and Business Library at Madison Avenue and 34th Street; a specialist in job searches is stationed at every branch to help visitors write resumes and look for jobs. 
 ''The financial situation has been tough on everybody,'' Ms. Marron said, adding that she nonetheless felt the library was in ''solid financial shape.'' The library's annual budget of $254 million is comprised of money from its endowment, contributions from the city, private donations and earned income.
 During Mr. LeClerc's tenure -- longer than any of his predecessors' -- the library started digitizing its collection, and entered partnerships with companies like Google and Apple to expand access to materials. It also provided free wireless and undertook $500 million in capital projects. The redesigned Web site, nypl.org, using free open-source software will be available in January. The library has also acquired a number of archival collections from Jerome Robbins, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Malcolm X and The New York Times. The Voltaire collection, which is Mr. LeClerc's specialty and is now on display, has also grown. 
 Mr. LeClerc said his basic approach boiled down to a simple formula: ''find out what people want and give it to them.'' Libraries are now open for longer hours than at any time in its history, he added.
 Although long-term questions about print versus digital are unresolved, Mr. LeClerc is confident that for the foreseeable future both print and digital resources will be in demand. Libraries have had the same function for 5,000 years, Mr. LeClerc explained, as ''storehouses of exceptionally important written documents.'' The New York Public Library's fundamental responsibility to acquire materials, keep them and let people look at them, he said, remains the same.

HEADLINE: A Counter Ad Campaign

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The onslaught of television commercials opposing health care legislation has prompted a liberal advocacy group and two labor unions to begin a $1.7 million advertising campaign in favor of the overhaul. 
 The commercials, being shown on both cable and broadcast stations in 13 Congressional districts, try to buck up 12 Democrats and the lone Republican who voted in favor of health care legislation when it passed the House on Nov. 7.
 They will be faced with a second vote after the House bill is merged with the Senate's version.
 These 13 members have been under assault in television advertisements by the United States Chamber of Commerce and affiliated business organizations that contend a health care overhaul would raise taxes, cost jobs and hurt the already weakened economy.
 The new commercials are being paid for by Americans United for Change, the advocacy group; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; and the Service Employees International Union. They say businesses are attacking these members because an overhaul would keep the health insurance industry from raising premiums.
 They also say an overhaul would ''strengthen Medicare,'' and has been endorsed by AARP, which represents older people. The commercials urge viewers to call their Congressional representative and ''tell him not to back down.''

HEADLINE: It Was Some Day in Court for Ampersands

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Two commercial powerhouses regarded in New York as being the best at what they do came to share more than similar-sounding names on Wednesday. Both were slapped with allegations of wrongdoing. 
 Just 30 minutes after a lawyer announced that four women were filing a sex discrimination lawsuit against B & H, the electronics superstore in Midtown, Manhattan prosecutors held a news conference to announce the indictment of the owner of H & H Bagels, the legendary bagel shop on the Upper West Side, on charges of tax fraud.
 The cases are unrelated; their announcement on the same day a coincidence. But they provided bagel lovers and techies -- worse yet, techies who love bagels -- with a shared reason for concern. 
 Might the more than $1 million in penalties that H & H's owner, Helmer Toro, faces if convicted (not to mention the 15 years of prison time) lead to a sharp rise in the price of a dozen poppy seed bagels? Will the $19 million that is being sought from B & H stymie the flow of point-and-shoots from the Far East to Midtown?
 As of Wednesday, it was business as usual at B & H and H & H.
 Each company maintained its innocence, but neither would be specific.
 ''B & H has a policy of not discriminating against employees or applicants, which we strictly follow,'' Leora Davidov, a legal assistant for the company, said in a statement, declining to comment further.
 Mr. Toro, 59, pleaded not guilty before Acting Justice Juan Merchan of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He left without commenting, and his lawyer, Robert Anello, also declined to comment.
 Mr. Toro pocketed nearly $370,000 in payroll withholding taxes owed to state and federal authorities from 2003 to 2009, said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. He also shortchanged the state and federal governments on unemployment insurance tax receipts, according to Mr. Morgenthau.
 Prosecutors allege that Mr. Toro set up a new shell company every year for six consecutive years, closing down the company from the previous year, to maintain a low unemployment insurance tax rate. The longer a company has been around and the more employees it has laid off, the higher its unemployment insurance rate, according to M. Patricia Smith, the state labor commissioner.
 It was not the first time that H & H had been accused of unscrupulous tax practices. In May, state tax officials shuttered the store at Broadway and 80th Street for three hours because its owners had failed to pay tens of thousands of dollars in sales and withholding taxes.
 In the lawsuit against B & H, filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, one current and three former female employees claim that they were denied sales positions because they are women. According to the lawsuit, this was a common practice at B & H.
 Nakisha Cushnie, the lead plaintiff in the case, was ''advised that these positions were not open to her due to 'religious reasons,' '' the lawsuit says.
 Richard B. Ancowitz, the women's lawyer, said there were no religious exemptions in antidiscrimination laws.
 ''It's an upsetting thing, in this day and age especially, to not be able to get a job because of your gender,'' Mr. Ancowitz said in an interview. ''I thought we were beyond that.''
 Although no managers expressly told the women that they were denied promotion because of their sex, Mr. Ancowitz said that the company had no saleswomen and had turned down other female applicants for sales jobs.

HEADLINE: Born in U.S., a Radical Cleric Inspires Terror Against West

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In nearly a dozen recent terrorism cases in the United States, Britain and Canada, investigators discovered the suspects had something in common: a devotion to the messageof Anwar al-Awlaki, an eloquent Muslim cleric who has turned the Web into a tool for extremist indoctrination. 
 Mr. Awlaki, 38, the son of a former agriculture minister and university president in Yemen, has never been accused of planting explosives himself. But experts on terrorism believe his persuasive endorsement of violence as a religious duty, in colloquial, American-accented English, has helped push a series of Western Muslims into terrorism. 
 Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., on Nov. 5, is only the latest suspect accused of perpetrating or plotting violence to be linked to the cleric. 
 In 2006, for example, a group of Canadian Muslims listened to Mr. Awlaki's sermons on a laptop a few months before they were charged with plotting attacks in Ontario to have included bombings, shootings, storming the Parliament Building and beheading the Canadian prime minister. 
 In 2007, one of six men later convicted of plotting to attack Fort Dix in New Jersey was picked up on a surveillance tape raving about Mr. Awlaki's audio clips. ''You gotta hear this lecture,'' said the plotter, Shain Duka. Mr. Duka called the cleric's interpretation of Muslim duties ''the truth, no holds barred, straight how it is!'' 
 Last year, Mr. Awlaki exchanged public letters on the Web with Al Shabaab, a Somali Islamist group that has attracted recruits among young Somali-Americans living in Minnesota. The message from Al Shabaab praised the cleric as ''one of the very few scholars'' who ''defend the honor of the mujahideen.'' 
 ''Allah knows how many of the brothers and sisters have been affected by your work,'' it said. 
 Evan Kohlmann, a counterterrorism researcher who has testified in terrorism trials in the United States and United Kingdom, said Mr. Awlaki's work had also turned up in cases in Chicago and Atlanta and in at least seven in the United Kingdom. 
 ''Al-Awlaki condenses the Al Qaeda philosophy into digestible, well-written treatises,'' Mr. Kohlmann said. ''They may not tell people how to build a bomb or shoot a gun. But he tells them who to kill, and why, and stresses the urgency of the mission.'' 
 For at least a decade, counterterrorism officials have had a wary eye on Mr. Awlaki, an American citizen now living in Yemen. His contacts with three of the Sept. 11 hijackers, at mosques where he served in San Diego and Falls Church, Va., remain a perplexing mystery about the 2001 attacks, said Philip Zelikow, who was executive director of the national 9/11 commission. 
 But in recent years, concerns have focused on Mr. Awlaki's influence via his Web site, his Facebook page and many booklets and CDs carrying his message, including a text called ''44 Ways to Support Jihad.''
 Mr. Awlaki's current site, www.anwar-alawlaki.com, went offline after he was linked to Major Hasan, apparently because a series of Web hosting companies took it down. The home page on Wednesday displayed a Muslim greeting and a promise: ''The Web site will be back to normal with a few days time.'' 
 Starting late last year, Major Hasan sought religious advice from the cleric in e-mail messages intercepted by American intelligence. He had seen Mr. Awlaki preach at the Virginia mosque in 2001. 
 In July, the month Major Hasan was transferred to Fort Hood, Mr. Awlaki posted a blistering attack on his Web site denouncing Muslim soldiers who would fight against other Muslims, a conflict that preoccupied Major Hasan, who was facing deployment to Afghanistan. 
 ''What kind of twisted fight is this?'' Mr. Awlaki wrote on ''Imam Anwar's Blog.'' A Muslim soldier who follows orders to kill Muslims, he wrote, ''is a heartless beast, bent of evil, who sells his religion for a few dollars.''
 After the Fort Hood shootings, Mr. Awlaki called Major Hasan a hero. ''The only way a Muslim could Islamically justify serving as a soldier in the U.S. Army,'' he wrote on his blog, ''is if his intention is to follow the footsteps of men like Nidal.''
 The question of what to do about terror propagandists like Mr. Awlaki is complex. His writings, though they encourage violence, are protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, legal authorities say. 
 Moreover, even as they fuel extremism, Web sites like his can be a valuable counterterrorism tool, because intelligence analysts use them to track those who, like Major Hasan, visit a site, post comments or e-mail its creators.
 ''The debate has gone on for a long time: take these sites down or leave them up to gather information,'' said Brian Fishman, a consultant to several government agencies on terrorism.
 Mr. Awlaki was born in New Mexico in 1971, where his father, Nasser al-Awlaki, was studying agricultural economics. After studying Islam in Yemen, Anwar, too, pursued an American education, earning a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University and a master's in education at San Diego State. While in San Diego, he was arrested for soliciting prostitutes, law enforcement records show.
 At a San Diego mosque where he was an imam, Mr. Awlaki met two future hijackers, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. In early 2001, Mr. Awlaki moved to the Virginia mosque, attended by Mr. Hazmi and a third hijacker, Hani Hanjour. The 9/11 panel described the connection as suspicious. Law enforcement officials say they strongly doubted Mr. Awlaki knew of the plot, though they could not prove it.
 While in the United States, Mr. Awlaki presented a moderate public face. A month after the Sept. 11 attacks, as imam at Dar al-Hijrah mosque in Virginia, he told The New York Times that he would no longer tolerate ''inflammatory'' rhetoric. The article said Mr. Awlaki ''is held up as a new generation of Muslim leader capable of merging East and West.'' 
 Johari Abdul-Malik, imam of the Virginia mosque, said Mr. Awlaki's sermons were accessible, often witty explorations of Koran passages. ''We could have all been duped,'' he said. ''But I think something happened to him, and he changed his views.''
 One thing that happened, after he left the United States in 2002 for London and then Yemen, was eighteen months in a Yemeni prison. He has publicly blamed the United States for pressuring Yemeni authorities to keep him locked up and has said he was questioned by F.B.I. agents there.
 Since his release in December 2007, his message has been even more overtly supportive of violence. In ''44 Ways to Support Jihad,'' he showed a wry awareness of intelligence agencies' interest in him and his writings.
 ''The only ones who are spending the money and time translating Jihad literature are the Western intelligence services,'' he wrote in English, ''and too bad, they would not be willing to share it with you.''

HEADLINE: Prosthetics Gave Runner Unfair Edge, Report Says

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON

 BODY:
Oscar Pistorius, a double-amputee sprinter from South Africa, was cleared to race against able-bodied athletes in the Beijing Olympics a year and a half ago. Now, however, a new study argues that his prosthetic legs may give him an unfair advantage after all.
 In a paper to be published Thursday in The Journal of Applied Physiology, the researchers Peter Weyand and Matthew Bundle say that the prosthetics, known as Cheetahs, allow Pistorius to turn over his strides more quickly and with more power than a runner with biological legs. 
 ''He's got these light legs, and he can reposition them faster than anybody ever measured by a lot,'' Weyand said in a telephone interview from Dallas, where he is an associate professor of applied physiology and biomechanics at Southern Methodist University. 
 He added that Pistorius is ''able to reposition his limbs 15 to 16 percent faster than the last five 100-meter world-record holders.''
 Five other researchers who examined Pistorius last year maintained in a Counterpoint section of the paper that the prosthetics did not confer any advantage. They stressed that with a sample size of one elite double-amputee -- Pistorius -- there was not enough evidence to demonstrate that the Cheetahs offered an advantage. They suggested that Pistorius's abnormally high performance level could be because of his developing an extremely effective technique to run with the prosthetics.
 ''The notion that lightweight prostheses are the only reason for Pistorius' rapid swing times ignores that he has had many years to train and adapt his neuromuscular system to using prostheses,'' the Counterpoint reads.
 The debate over Pistorius's prosthetic blades has raged for more than two years, ever since he began posting times close to the Olympic qualifying benchmark. Unsure that the Cheetahs were legal, the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field's world governing body, initially barred him from able-bodied competition. 
 After a series of tests commissioned by the I.A.A.F. determined that the blades were acting as springs and helping him consume less energy, the ban was upheld. 
 It took a landmark decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an international panel that has authority over legal disputes, to overturn it. The court said that should he have been able to qualify, Pistorius would have been allowed to compete at the Beijing Games. But his best time of 46.25 seconds in the 400 meters ultimately fell short of the 45.95 qualifying standard.
 For Pistorius, the consequences of the new findings are unclear. The I.A.A.F. may not choose to bar him again since the Court of Arbitration's decision remains in effect as long as Pistorius continues to use the Cheetahs.
 Nick Davies, a spokesman for the federation, did not return a phone message. Pistorius, in Namibia, was not available for comment, and his agent, Peet van Zyl, said that they would issue a statement when he returned on Thursday.
 Weyand and Bundle, from the University of Wyoming, first became involved with Pistorius when his team of lawyers approached them while assembling their case for the C.A.S. Along with a team of others at Rice University, Weyand and Bundle examined his performance and debunked the I.A.A.F.'s claim that the Cheetahs made Pistorius a more economical runner. 
 Under their agreement with the lawyers, Weyand and Bundle were allowed to perform any number of other tests, as long as the results were published after the court's decision. And it was in those findings that they discovered an angle that the federation had apparently overlooked.
 Because each of Pistorius's limbs -- which include the stump, the socket and the blade -- are more than six pounds lighter than a biological leg would be for someone his size, it is easier for him to churn them at top speed. 
 Using a high-speed force treadmill, Weyand and Bundle also determined that Pistorius could keep the blade on the track longer than an able-bodied athlete keeps his foot on the track, giving Pistorius a longer push-off with each stride.
 ''As soon as Dr. Bundle and I analyzed those data from a year and a half ago,'' Weyand said, ''we immediately concluded that there was a clear and major advantage.''

HEADLINE: Have Work, Will Travel

BYLINE: By AYDEN FABIEN FERDELINE. 
Ayden Fabien Ferdeline works for the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort.

DATELINE: Whistler, Canada 

 BODY:
 I HAVE always been ambitious and adventurous, someone with a zest for life who more than anything wants to see the world. And because I hold an Australian passport, I've been able to do just that, because I can travel on Working Holiday visas -- a benefit that young Americans should envy. 
 Australia has reciprocal agreements with 26 governments that allow its young citizens (usually those under the age of 30) to work temporarily in each other's countries, almost always without having to arrange employment sponsorship in advance. I've traveled from Asia to Europe to the Americas with these visas, and applying for one for Canada, where I'm now working, took me only a few minutes. 
 Working Holiday programs were created to foster youth mobility, but they also encourage the exchange of cultural values. Participants serve as ambassadors for their home country and gain a greater appreciation for their host. And participants, like any tourists, contribute to the economy; Working Holiday travelers spend about $1.2 billion annually in Australia. 
 The United States, to its detriment, has no similarly accessible working holiday program for its citizens, except some small pilot exchanges with Australia, New Zealand and South Korea that have onerous application processes. Why doesn't it follow Australia's lead, and expand the program? 
 Immigration issues stir strong emotions in the United States, and further opening American borders to temporary labor, especially during a recession, would understandably be met with resistance. But although participants overwhelmingly enjoy their time abroad -- and recommend the experience to family, friends and anyone with time to listen to their adventures -- few seek permanent residency. Most also take jobs in restaurants or hotels, in positions that tend to be occupied by young workers. Since the visas are reciprocal, these Americans are the very people who would be able to travel and land jobs abroad with similar ease. 
 I owe a great many adventures to this program and I've gained an appreciation for the differences that make us human. When I hear the French stereotyped as snobby, for example, I know better. When I worked in France, the people I met were warm and welcoming, despite my mediocre language skills. 
 The United States could gain some similar good will by making it easier for Americans to work abroad, and by opening its doors to the world's young.

HEADLINE: Once Wary of the Web, Luxury Brands Embrace It

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
THE luxury goods industry, struggling through a recession that has threatened some well-known names with extinction, is trying to use technology to its advantage.
Many in the fashion business remain wary of the Internet, partly because of continuing legal battles over online sales of counterfeit goods and concerns about diluting carefully honed brand images. Many companies also have failed to execute online storefronts successfully. But executives say that attitudes are softening as brands realize that the Web provides one of the last untapped sources of potential growth.
 Federico Marchetti, the founder of Yoox, a company in Milan that runs retailing sites for luxury brands like Valentino, Emilio Pucci and Jil Sander, said many labels were skeptical not long ago. 
 ''Now,'' he said, ''it is the opposite.''
 The move to capitalize on the Web has become a financial imperative. Analysts at Bain & Company estimate that the sales of luxury goods will fall to 154 billion euros this year ($229 billion), from 170 billion euros in 2008. It is unlikely that online revenue -- still only a tiny fraction of the total -- will make up the difference soon.
 One of the most successful ventures on the Web has been Net-a-Porter, a site based in London that sells high-end fashion and accessories, delivering them to homes or offices in black boxes. Though sales in the United States slowed during the depth of the recession, they have since recovered and have continued to rise at double-digit rates in other markets, the company said. It expects sales this year to top $:100 million ($168 million), up from $:82 million last year.
 ''It just made a lot of sense to allow women to shop when they wanted to shop, how they wanted to shop -- at work, at home, in bedroom,'' said Natalie Massenet, the company's founder.
 At a time when trundling along high-end strips like Bond Street in London or Avenue Montaigne in Paris with an armful of shopping bags seems out of touch with reality, Net-a-Porter may have benefited from the greater discretion that its service offers. Last year, to cloak purchases even more, the company added a brown-bag delivery option. This year, in another bit of good timing that Ms. Massenet attributed to luck rather than foresight, the company added a new site selling fashions from previous seasons at reduced prices.
 Customer overlap between the sites is only 6 percent, Ms. Massenet said, with fashionistas frequenting the original Net-a-Porter and bargain hunters turning to the new site, outnet.com. 
 That ought to comfort luxury executives worried that selling online might undermine the high-end appeal of their wares -- and the high prices that come with such exclusivity.
 Some individual brands that previously refrained from selling online have recently embraced the Internet. Hugo Boss, the German clothier, started introducing Internet shops in Europe last year. Now it is accelerating its online efforts, planning to open similar stores in the United States early next year and in Asia the year after, said Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, the chief executive.
 Mr. Lahrs said Hugo Boss expected to sell more than 50 million euros of goods online within two years, up from a little more than 10 million euros this year.
 While some labels are now trying to make up for lost time, others remain cautious about the pitfalls of the Internet.
 Led by the largest company in the business, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, luxury brand owners have fought a series of legal battles across several continents with Internet companies like Google and eBay, contending that they aided in the online sale of counterfeit goods. Courts have issued mixed rulings, sometimes siding with the brand owners and fining the technology companies, and in other cases agreeing that sufficient steps were being taken to root out fakes.
 Some executives also remain reluctant to invest heavily in digital initiatives because of costly failures in the past. Uche Okonkwo, a Paris-based consultant, said that brand owners are ''many steps behind the clients, when they should be several steps ahead of them.''
 One brand that has won plaudits from analysts for its efforts is Burberry. This month, it created a social networking site that allows owners of Burberry's trench coats to exchange stories about them.
 Christopher Bailey, Burberry's chief creative officer, said high-end brands should go further in trying to give Web stores the rich texture of physical stores. 
 ''Whether they are walking into our store on Bond Street or tapping in from India or China, it's about making sure the consumer is getting the same experience,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dueling Alliances Make Aid Offers to Japan Airlines

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines and its alliance partners offered $1 billion in aid to Japan Airlines on Wednesday, a proposal that American Airlines quickly said it would top as the world's biggest airlines escalated a war for influence over the ailing Japanese carrier. 
 Though saddled with debt, Japan Airlines is attractive to both American and Delta because of its strong place in the tricky Japanese market and in the rest of Asia. United States airlines have also been looking to shore up their global alliances, both as a growth strategy and as a defensive step after mergers in the industry.
 Delta and American, however, are also engaged in a delicate balancing act. Too aggressive an overture toward JAL, they fear, could give the Japanese government reason to try to rescue its once-proud flagship carrier without foreign assistance.
 At a news conference in Tokyo on Wednesday, the president of Delta, Edward Bastian, said the carrier and other members of the SkyTeam alliance were ready to offer JAL an aid package worth $1 billion if it would defect from a rival alliance, American Airlines' Oneworld.
 ''It is clear that SkyTeam is by far the strongest partner for Japan Airlines,'' Mr. Bastian said. The offer includes $500 million in capital from SkyTeam members, $300 million in guarantees on any revenue loss from the switch and $200 million in asset-backed financing, according to Delta.
 Mr. Bastian spoke after JAL's president, Haruka Nishimatsu, said last week that it would be easier for the debt-ridden company to remain within the Oneworld alliance.
 Sze Hunn Yap, a Japan Airlines spokesman, told The Associated Press that the company was aware of Delta's offer but could not comment.
 In return for the aid package, the winning airline would have Japan Airlines as a member of its alliance and would have a code-sharing agreement with the airline.
 The defection of Japan Airlines to SkyTeam would give that alliance a considerable edge over Oneworld in the number of passengers and daily flights.
 Figures from May show SkyTeam's 11 members carried 384 million passengers annually, compared with the 330 million carried by Oneworld, including 53 million carried by JAL.
 ''We stand ready to make a significant investment in JAL, superior to anything a competitor will offer,'' Theo Panagiotoulias, American Airlines' vice president for Asia and the Pacific, said in Tokyo on Wednesday.
 Mr. Panagiotoulias said American would offer JAL an equity investment on top of the approximately $500 million that the Japanese airline is reaping annually from its participation in the Oneworld alliance. American is the operating unit of the AMR Corporation of Fort Worth, Tex. Delta is based in Atlanta.
 That, he said, would make American's offer more financially attractive to JAL, because some of Delta's proposed aid package would go to pay financial penalties the airline would incur for switching alliances. 
 Finances at JAL, which is the largest Asian carrier by revenue, have been battered by a drop in passenger traffic in the wake of the global economic crisis. Huge pension obligations, an aging fleet and dozens of unprofitable routes have also weighed heavily on JAL's bottom line.
 The airline posted a loss of 32.2 billion yen ($361 million) in the latest quarter and said it was in new talks to suspend loan payments as it awaited formal approval for a government-led bailout.

HEADLINE: Rising Prices Of Drugs Lead to Call For Inquiry

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Democrats in Congress asked for two separate investigations of drug industry pricing Wednesday as they continue working on legislation to overhaul the nation's health care system. 
 Responding to news reports of unusually high wholesale price increases in brand-name prescription drugs, four House leaders and one senator asked for government reviews of the pricing practices. 
 Although drug makers challenge the theory, some experts say the run-up in wholesale prices may be partly related to the industry's concerns about future cost containment under any health care legislation. 
 ''Recent studies have indicated that the industry may be artificially raising prices for certain pharmaceutical products in expectation of new reforms,'' the House Democrats wrote in a letter to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress. ''Any price gouging is unacceptable, but anticipatory price gouging is especially offensive,'' the letter added, asking the G.A.O. to conduct an expedited review of the price increases. 
 The House letter was signed by four representatives who have been active in the health care legislation: Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; Henry A. Waxman of California, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; and Pete Stark of California, and John Lewis of Georgia, chairmen of two Ways and Means subcommittees. 
 Separately, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat who has led efforts in the Senate to seek more concessions from drug makers, wrote to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services asking for ''an immediate and thorough investigation into drug industry pricing and recent increases, and the extent to which these increases may affect the Medicare and Medicaid programs.'' 
 Both letters cited a New York Times article on Monday reporting that wholesale prices of brand-name drugs rose about 9 percent in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the highest increase in years -- even as the Consumer Price Index was declining during the same 12-month period. 
 The Times article cited a Wall Street analyst's calculations; a study sponsored by the AARP, the advocacy group for older Americans; and a report by IMS Health, a consulting firm to the drug industry. 
 The price increases could add more than $10 billion to the nation's drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. 
 At that rate, the increases would more than offset at least the first year of savings that the drug industry has agreed to make under a provision of the health care bill that was approved by the Senate Finance Committee and has been incorporated into the full Senate bill introduced on Wednesday. That measure calls for the industry to come up with discounts and rebates that would save Medicare recipients and the government $8 billion a year for 10 years. 
 ''I want to know if there's a back-door move under way by the drug makers to recover some of the concessions they've promised for health care reform,'' Senator Nelson said in a statement Wednesday. 
 Drug companies do not deny having raised wholesale prices at the highest rate in years. But they say it has nothing to do with the impending health care legislation. They say the price increases are necessary to maintain profits for research and employment in the face of a difficult business environment, which includes a slowdown in sales of many brand-name products, expiring patents and increasing competition from generic drugs. 
 The wholesale prices of brand-name drugs most commonly used by Medicare recipients rose in the latest 12-month period at the fastest rate since at least 1992, according to Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pricing expert working with AARP. 
 Separately, a study by the investment bank Credit Suisse found that prices for all drugs from the eight largest United States pharmaceutical companies had risen, on average, at the highest rate in at least five years. 
 And IMS Health said there were higher-than-expected price increases this year.
 Mr. Schondelmeyer, professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota, and Catherine J. Arnold, a senior drug industry analyst for Credit Suisse, have said they believe that part of the reason for the price increases was to get ahead of possible cost containment measures in health care reform. 
 Professor Schondelmeyer and Joseph P. Newhouse, a Harvard health economist, said there were precedents for drug price increases before government actions affecting the industry. 
 The House Democrats also said the G.A.O. had previously found unusual price increases in some prescription drugs in the year before Congress added drug benefits to Medicare.
 The House letter on Wednesday said that the G.A.O. could build on that work. 
 The House members are also asking the G.A.O. to submit a proposal to continuously monitor prescription drug prices. The House health care bill already includes a provision authorizing Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers -- a proposal hotly opposed by the industry.
 Ken Johnson, an official with the drug industry's trade association, said in a statement that calls for an investigation were ''based on misleading use of statistics and sensationalized media reports.'' 
 Mr. Johnson, senior vice president for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Research Association, did not deny any of the specific findings of AARP, Credit Suisse and IMS Health reports, which were based on data supplied by manufacturers and wholesalers. But he said other measurements of drug price increases show they have risen substantially less than 9 percent. 
 Mr. Johnson accused AARP of ''trying to muddy the waters for its own political gain as we enter the homestretch of the health care reform debate.''
 An AARP executive vice president, John Rother, said in a statement: ''This isn't about politics. It's about affordable health care.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama's Task

 BODY:
There is no doubt that the prospects for success in Afghanistan are so bleak right now because former President George W. Bush failed for seven long years to invest the necessary troops, resources or attention to the war. But it is now President Obama's war, and the American people are waiting for him to explain his goals and his strategy.
 Mr. Obama was right to conduct a sober, systematic review of his options. We all know what happens when a president sends tens of thousands of Americans to war based on flawed information, gut reactions and gauzy notions of success. But the political reality is that the longer Mr. Obama waits, the more indecisive he seems and the more constrained his options appear.
 It has been more than eight months since Mr. Obama first announced his strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, warning Americans that, for them, the border between the two -- where Taliban and Qaeda forces have found safe haven -- is ''the most dangerous place in the world.'' And it has been more than a month since his top general in Afghanistan asked for 40,000 more troops, warning that ''failure to gain the initiative'' over the next year could make it impossible to defeat the Taliban. 
 Americans are deeply anxious about the war. As the debate among his advisers has dragged on, and became increasingly public, many are asking whether the conflict is necessary or already a lost cause. Democratic leaders are among the loudest questioners.
 It has become a cliche in Washington that there are only bad choices in Afghanistan. But it seems clear that this is not the time for a precipitous withdrawal, nor can the United States cling to the status quo while the Taliban gains ever more territory and more power. To move forward, Mr. Obama needs to explain the stakes for this country, the extent of the military commitment, the likely cost in lives and treasure and his definition of success. Mr. Bush failed to do all of that in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 America's allies, many of whom are looking for a way out, also need to hear why their troops should continue to risk their lives. There is no chance in Afghanistan unless President Hamid Karzai separates himself from his corrupt associates and Pakistan's leaders step up their fight against the Taliban and other extremists.
 Mr. Obama said on Wednesday that he would soon provide ''a lot of clarity'' on his Afghanistan strategy. These are some of the things the world needs to hear.
 WHAT ARE THE STAKES? We agreed with the president in August when he described Afghanistan as a war of necessity. In a speech, he warned that if the Taliban insurgency were left unchecked it ''will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people.''
 Since then, some of his top advisers have raised doubts about the urgency and even the necessity of the war. The national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, said in October that there were ''less than 100'' Qaeda members operating in Afghanistan without bases or the ''ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies.'' He said he didn't ''foresee the return of the Taliban'' and that the ''next step in this is the sanctuaries'' in Pakistan.
 Vice President Joseph Biden has been even more insistent that the real front is across the border and that attacking extremists on both sides could be better accomplished with a lighter footprint in Afghanistan and Predator strikes and special operations raids. Other officials argue that the Taliban may have learned a lesson and might be open to a deal that barred Al Qaeda from its territory.
 Mr. Obama needs to address these arguments -- to say whether he still considers fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan to be central to American security and why. Does he still believe a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would mean a ''larger safe haven'' for Al Qaeda? And how does he see the relationship between the war in Afghanistan and efforts to hold off extremists in a nuclear-armed Pakistan? If the Taliban were to win in Afghanistan, would they be less or more likely to threaten Pakistan?
 In March, Mr. Obama warned that, for Afghans, a ''return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy and the denial of basic human rights,'' especially to women and girls. We need to hear whether he still believes Americans have a duty to stop that.
 WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE WAR? In March, President Obama said his goal was to ''disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future.'' He also argued that bullets and bombs would not be enough to drive the Taliban back. In Afghanistan, American forces and a surge of civilian advisers must ''advance security, opportunity and justice'' for the Afghan people, ''not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces.'' 
 Given that, no one in the White House should have been surprised when Mr. Obama's chosen commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, came back with an ambitious counterinsurgency plan, although his request for 40,000 more troops was clearly higher than Mr. Obama and his aides had wanted to hear. 
 If Mr. Obama no longer believes that a counterinsurgency is necessary or feasible, or if he wants to set less-ambitious goals (there has been talk of securing a smaller number of cities while speeding up training of the Afghan Army), then the American people need to hear why he changed his mind and how he intends to move forward. 
 Mr. Obama will also have to address his vice president's proposal. We share Mr. Biden's anxiety that a larger American military presence might alienate more Afghans than it wins over. But we are also skeptical that a war against Al Qaeda can be fought from a distance. Drones and commandos still need bases, and Pakistan is not likely to provide them. They need ''actionable'' intelligence, which could dry up with fewer American troops on the Afghan side of the border. 
 ARE THERE CREDIBLE PARTNERS? There is almost no chance of holding off the Taliban (or plotting an eventual American withdrawal) without a minimally credible Afghan government and security forces.
 The Taliban's medieval ideas and brutality are anathema to most Afghans. We see that in the courage of the Afghan families who defy the Taliban by sending their daughters to school. But the corruption of the Karzai government, and its failure to provide the most basic services and security, have caused many of its citizens to decide that they have no choice but to submit to the Taliban. 
 Even after his supporters were caught trying to steal the election, Mr. Karzai remains shamelessly, insultingly undaunted. Mr. Obama must make clear to both Mr. Karzai and the American people the sweeping changes required to build a credible Afghan government. If there are other, better partners, competent cabinet members or provincial officials, then Americans need to hear how Mr. Obama plans to empower them.
 Mr. Obama should be candid about his administration's halting progress. In March, he pledged to send ''agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers'' across Afghanistan to relieve the burden on American troops and help the government ''serve its people.'' There are disturbing reports that the situation on the ground is so dangerous that many of these advisers cannot leave Kabul. It was chilling to read in The Times last week that when the ambassador in Kabul asked for additional civilian staff, the State Department turned down some of his requests because of budget constraints and a decision to cap the number at 1,000.
 There will never be enough American troops on the ground to defeat the Taliban or provide security for Afghans. Mr. Obama must explain his plans for building a minimally functional Afghan Army and police force. More trainers are needed, but as The Times reported earlier this month, even that is no guarantee of success. According to reviews by American officials, the effort has been hobbled by a high dropout rate for recruits, ''a lack of competent and professional'' Afghan leadership ''at all levels,'' widespread illiteracy and corruption. 
 WHAT WILL IT COST? Mr. Bush cynically tried to cover up the heavy costs of the Iraq and Afghan wars and cooked the financial books with repeated ''supplemental'' financing requests. Mr. Obama has done far better and needs to continue to tell the truth. 
 The human cost will continue to rise if the number of forces rises. Mr. Obama should also acknowledge the cost in military readiness and the stress of repeated deployments on troops and their families. On the financial side, the Pentagon has already spent more than $150 billion on the war. While estimates are difficult, analysts say that for every 10,000 additional troops deployed, the annual cost will rise by at least another $10 billion. Americans need to hear how those costs will be met, even though the choices -- raising taxes, cutting spending or more borrowing -- are unappealing in a time of recession and high deficits.
 IS THERE A WAY OUT? Finally, Mr. Obama promised on Wednesday to outline an ''endgame.'' Given Afghanistan's desperate state, we are skeptical that he can lay out a firm timetable for withdrawal. But there are certainly benchmarks that he can offer. (Mr. Obama promised that in March, but the nation has yet to hear an accounting.)
 There must be a way to measure progress or failure. Americans need to know the war will not go on forever.

HEADLINE: Indulging His Every Indulgence

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
WILLIAM FAULKNER once said: ''The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again, since it is life.'' 
 When it comes to redoubling the reach of his own influence, Giorgio Armani seems to enjoy a tireless libido. 
 Mr. Armani was a child in Mussolini's Italy. From 1961 to 1970, he designed the Hitman label for Nino Cerruti. In 1974, with the support of a partner, Sergio Galeotti, Mr. Armani formed his own company. Sales, in 1975, totaled $14,000. 
 In 1980, Mr. Armani designed Richard Gere's wardrobe for ''American Gigolo.'' Overnight the Armani suit became the Ferrari of men's fashion -- an internationally recognized symbol of success, which, by virtue of superlative engineering, was also the sexiest thing on wheels. His annual sales grew to $100 million by 1985. Money, grace, respect and all the dirty glamour of Hollywood. What more could a designer want? 
 More. 
 Mr. Galeotti died in 1985, but in the next years, the brand exploded into labels to outfit nearly every demographic: Emporio Armani, Armani Jeans, Armani Collezioni, Armani Prive, Armani Casa, Armani Cosmetics. By 2004, the annual sales were close to $2 billion. 
 Mr. Armani now enjoys the kind of papal infallibility that only auteurs like Kurosawa, Bergman or Fellini attain. He is at that gilded point in his career where he has the freedom and the power to indulge his whims and caprices. He can do whatever the hell he wants. 
 And fabulously enough, he did. 
 During the dark night of America's economic soul, he opened Armani/5th Avenue -- a four-floor landmark that is part flagship, part restaurant, part architectural folly -- and a whole family reunion of all the labels related to Armani.
 In 2000, when Mr. Armani had a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum, Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral staircase must have impressed him: he has built a variation of it inside his store that quite possibly improves on the original. The Guggenheim resembles a collapsible camping cup; the Armani staircase looks like a Slinky made by unfurling a giant spiral-cut endive. It's wild, organic and throbbing, a veritable turbine generating the store's giddy atmosphere. 
 I started at the top floor, with the big modern restaurant -- all shiny black floors and ceilings and backlighted white walls embedded with LED's that dance in time to Brazilian casino jazz. Just outside, there's a dolci bar replete with black chocolates and shelves of fragrant, hatbox-size panettone. 
 Outside the food court, this floor houses posh-casual men's wear. All the Armani signatures abound: precise silhouettes in slate, pewter and shiitake; prohibitive cashmeres, leathers with the wet sheen of cake batter. Today's gigolo might enjoy a calf fur jacket, laser-cut into the pattern of a crocodile pelt ($2,795), or perhaps a long mauve shearling ''Super Fly'' coat with a rabbit-fur lining, dyed to resemble chinchilla (no locatable price tag -- a recurring theme). 
 Armani Casa occupies a corner of the second floor. These are unaffordable housewares in black lacquer, leather and chrome, all of which belong in Mickey Rourke's apartment in ''9 1/2 Weeks.'' In that spirit, I hovered around an Art Deco tea set (teapot $1,395; creamer, $910) with the intention of beating up anyone capable of buying it.
 Mr. Armani has always supported feminism in the form of power-mad C.F.O. wardrobes: swank haberdashery, chalk-stripe and pinstripe suits in fabrics generally reserved for the male. This season, the recurring shape is revamped from his own 1980s-redux-of-the-1940s designs: big shoulders, wide lapels, one button at the navel, big pleated skirts tapering at the knees.
 At first, it looked like too direct a quotation from the '80s, but on closer inspection, it was more contoured at the waist and quite slick. I tried on a pinstripe version in silver wool-acetate -- sharp as a bright scalpel; perfect for an economic hit woman. The skirt, apart from an unforgivable little panty-bow at the waist, had excellent geometry and felt very smart. 
 Strangely enough, this suit cut could be found throughout the store in different fabrics, at drastically different prices. The version of the jacket I tried was $1,875. The Emporio version of virtually the same jacket, in a lighter fabric, was $795. In the Giorgio section, the same jacket in blue velvet was $4,150. 
 As usual, the women's accessories are covetable. I lusted after an asymmetric little black beret with a built-in jaunty angle ($315) and some patent leather driving gloves ($595) -- all very gothic Bonnie Parker. Or maybe Bonnie Jessica Parker. Either way, they went with bootleg Champagne and tommy guns.
 I admired a cashmere cardigan in a snakeskin pattern ($2,175), which I assumed, from the price, had been knitted by actual snakes.
 I tried a very small, sparkly black suede motorcycle jacket, which had no price tag. The salesman, one of several adorable Italian boys in cigarette-leg suits with very tall hair, informed me that the jacket was made exclusively for the store and was $1,495. 
 You really have to suffer to find a price for the more expensive items; they are often well hidden or nonexistent. I wrestled open every pocket of a crocodile doctor bag and rummaged elbow-deep under the dust bag as if I had lost my keys before giving up.
 I bought a bright orange lipstick ($30) that promised ''eight hour wear.'' The lighting was so dim I didn't realize how bright it was, but when I woke up the next morning, I was impressed with its longevity. I looked as if I'd spent the night kissing a freeway cone. 
 At the store's opening in February, Mr. Armani told The New York Times: ''I live with my work. I make love to my work. You've seen this store. It is too important. And understand that the investments that I made in this store, I will probably not get back for 20 to 25 years, so how can you think that something can thrill me more than this?'' In 25 years, Mr. Armani will be 100 years old. Profit, one suspects, was not his motive. 
 Unmuddied creative visions are relatively rare in the world. Rarer still is a personal vision so successfully and outlandishly realized. Armani/5th Avenue will likely survive as long as Fifth Avenue does. Like the Pyramids, it was built as an indelible valentine to the invisible worlds ahead. 
 ARMANI/5TH AVENUE
 717 Fifth Avenue (56th Street); (212) 339-5950. 
 ARE MANY A colossal new flagship carrying representative pieces from all the goods bearing the Armani signature, all swirling around a giant fantasy staircase that puts both Vegas and the sun to shame. 
 ARE MOD-Y The store is remarkably free of snooty retail shade: the staff members are as friendly and unintimidating as they are easy on the eyes -- and they all have super-
 fantastic Vespa-ready hairstyles.
 ARE MONEY You can drop several thousand on stylish suits, or fork over $85 in quarters to the kids working in the underwear section downstairs. The full spectrum of Fifth Avenue pedestrians is accounted for, as are their bank accounts.

HEADLINE: Jobless Benefits Set to Expire Unless Congress Acts

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
About one million laid-off workers will see their unemployment benefits end in January unless Congress acts quickly to renew existing federally paid extensions, according to a new survey and legislators and state officials. 
 The record extension of emergency benefits that was signed into law on Nov. 6 was widely praised as a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Americans who had spent a year or more in fruitless searches for jobs. 
 The new law provided up to 14 weeks of federally paid aid to unemployed people who had exhausted existing state and federal limits, benefits that already lasted up to 79 weeks in many states. And for the majority of states with particularly high unemployment, it added six more weeks of payments, bringing the potential total to 99 weeks. 
 But many legislators, state aid officials and struggling workers apparently failed to read the fine print. The added federal benefits were built on a series of previous extensions that are slated to end on Dec. 31, unless Congress renews these programs. People who lost their jobs after July 1 of this year, for example, would receive no federal extensions once their customary six months of state aid ran out. 
 While discussions have started, Congress is not yet considering a specific proposal. And unless it acts before the Christmas break, officials warn, the extensions will end. If Congress, now caught up in the health care overhaul, delays action until next year, millions would face gaps in aid that many thought would be automatic.
 ''There are six people looking for every available job, and these payments are enabling people to pay their mortgages and put food on the table,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, who championed the Nov. 6 law and hopes to light a new fire under Congress. 
 ''It's a horribly complicated system, and most people didn't pay attention,'' Mr. McDermott said. He and Congressional staff members said that while they believed an extension would eventually pass with broad support, action in the next few weeks is by no means certain. Renewing all federally paid extended benefits for 2010 would cost about $80 billion, Mr. McDermott said. 
 Nancy E. Dunphy, deputy commissioner for employment security with the New York State Department of Labor, said that officials in New York and other states ''were taken by surprise by this.'' 
 ''It makes no sense,'' Ms. Dunphy said. ''You had the president and others saying that the intent was to add 20 weeks of benefits, and now we have this glitch.'' 
 For people suffering long-term unemployment, a gap of several weeks in aid -- let alone a premature, permanent end -- can be cataclysmic. Alexandra Jarrin, 48, was laid off in March 2008 from her job in New York as a director of client services. As she searched widely for a job, moving back and forth between New York and Tennessee, she received aid of more than $400 a week that, she said, just barely ''kept my head at the waterline.'' 
 But her extensions ran out early last month and in subsequent weeks, as Congress deliberated, her life fell apart. She has just started receiving what will be 14 extra weeks of aid under the new law, but faces eviction from her apartment in Brentwood, Tenn. ''There's no way I can recover now, I'm too far behind,'' she said. 
 In ordinary times, unemployed workers in most states receive 26 weeks of benefits, averaging just over $300 a week, paid from state insurance funds. Many find jobs before exhausting the aid, but unemployment has been particularly tenacious in the current recession and recovery. Under temporary measures, workers are currently eligible for a series of federally paid extensions, awarded in stages often lasting 13 or 14 weeks at a time. 
 Some nine million people now receive unemployment benefits, five million on the initial state programs and four million through federal extensions. 
 Without renewal of the programs for 2010, at the turn of the year recipients will continue receiving benefits to the end of their current stage but will no longer jump to the next stage. Thus Ms. Jarrin, if she fails to find work, will finish out the new 14-week period but will not receive the additional six weeks that Congress promised. She said she had sent out 2,000 resumes and had only a handful of interviews, without success. 
 According to projections released Wednesday by the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group that worked with state officials to develop the numbers, 474,111 unemployed workers will exhaust their state benefits in January and, in the absence of Congressional action, not receive any extensions. 
 An additional 581,000 workers will see their federal benefits end in January, the study said. 
 Ms. Dunphy of New York said that without a federal renewal, 685,000 New Yorkers would not receive expected benefits in 2010. While economic growth has resumed, economists say that job growth will be sluggish, with high unemployment, now at 10.2 percent, persisting through most of the coming year. 
 In addition to renewing the benefit extension, Congress must decide whether to extend aid for Cobra health insurance payments for the unemployed, a tax break on unemployment payments and a $25 a week increase in benefits, all adopted in the stimulus act in early 2009.

HEADLINE: Peace Talks Hang in Balance Amid Effort to Dissuade Palestinian From Quitting

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Two weeks after the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, vowed not to run for re-election and hinted that he might resign, the Middle East peace process has sunk into a deep crisis amid urgent efforts to revive it. 
 The Israeli security establishment is in a state of alarm over the possible departure of Mr. Abbas, whom it considers a genuine moderate. Some of its top members are urging their government to make far-reaching offers -- ''not just lifting a few roadblocks,'' in the words of one -- that would persuade him to stay in power and resume negotiations with Israel on a solution that involves creating an independent Palestinian state. 
 Palestinian leaders are looking elsewhere for salvation. Aware of their own weakness, but also of rising disillusionment abroad with Israel over West Bank settlement growth and its war in Gaza in January, they are hoping to turn frailty to their advantage by appealing to the international community to come to their rescue. 
 Meanwhile, the Obama administration and European governments are also seeking ways to restart the peace talks and keep Mr. Abbas in place. 
 ''Everyone is running around in circles trying to rebuild this process, to find some way to start it up again,'' a senior Israeli official observed. ''No one knows if it is possible.''
 Mr. Abbas has repeatedly stated that the only way forward is with a complete Israeli freeze on settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has offered to greatly reduce building, but not to stop it -- and added that East Jerusalem would not be included. His government just announced plans to build hundreds of new units in a part of the city captured in 1967.
 Mr. Abbas's threat stems from many causes, but essentially from his belief that Israel is unwilling to accept Palestinian demands on settlements, Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees. Officials on all sides agree that the gaps between the two sides on these issues appear unbridgeable for now. 
 ''He is at a point where he can no longer pretend that this role of presidency will lead him to helping the Palestinians overcome occupation,'' said Nader Said, a sociologist who runs Arab World for Research and Development, in Ramallah. ''It doesn't seem that there is any seriousness on the Israeli side to establish a Palestinian state and no desire on the part of the Americans to deliver the goods.''
 Mr. Abbas has joined his chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, in seeking approval by the United Nations Security Council of the declaration of a Palestinian state without Israel's agreement.
 ''We are now facing a moment of truth,'' Mr. Erekat said recently. ''We will seek to pass this Security Council resolution and the activation of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect the Palestinian people.''
 Washington and the European Union have called such a move premature while Prime Minister Netanyahu warned that it would be met by unilateral Israeli steps. The only way forward, he said, was through renewed talks. 
 American and Israeli officials are contemplating a series of steps to persuade Mr. Abbas to stay. They include a marked intensification of security and economic cooperation, more money, invitations to Western capitals, robust statements of support, prisoner releases and efforts to draw Arab states more fully into the process.
 Over the past year and a half, Palestinian security forces have moved into West Bank cities and taken over responsibilities previously filled by the Israeli military. But about 60 percent of the West Bank remains fully in Israeli hands, and some suggest yielding part of that area to the Palestinians right away and increasing Palestinian responsibilities in the other areas. 
 Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, opposes seeking international recognition of a state. Instead, he has put forth a two-year plan aimed at building institutions and security so that the future state will be strong, transparent and well run. 
 It is far from clear if he can carry it out. The Palestinian Authority is hundreds of millions of dollars short of making its monthly payroll, and major Arab donors, like Saudi Arabia, have refused to make contributions. Moreover, Mr. Fayyad, a political independent, may not have the support in the bureaucracy to make the changes he seeks. 
 The legal status of the Palestinian political system has been in flux since Hamas, the Islamist party, threw the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority out of Gaza in 2007. Hamas had won a legislative election the previous year, but a power-sharing agreement between Hamas and Fatah failed. There are now parallel ministries and security services in the two territories. The official term of Mr. Abbas's presidency has already ended, and the term of the legislative council is scheduled to end in January. 
 Mr. Abbas called elections for January, but they will be delayed because of the split with Gaza. Egypt has been trying to get Fatah and Hamas to agree to a plan of reconciliation, but so far that has not happened. Hamas has said that without the agreement, there will be no election in Gaza. 
 Many believe that even if the two sides sign the document, no real reconciliation will follow because the anger between them runs so deep.
 ''Abbas lost his legitimacy 10 months ago,'' Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas leader, said in an interview in Gaza this week. ''Anyway, he is a tool and property of America.''
 Many Palestinians suspect that Mr. Abbas, 74, a longtime associate of Yasir Arafat, Fatah's founder, will simply stay in his post during the election delay. 
 ''I don't see him leaving for the next year,'' said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, who leads the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs in Jerusalem. 
 The Palestine Liberation Organization, the supreme authority of the Palestinian people, will most likely meet in the coming weeks, declare Mr. Abbas's term extended and paper over other legal conundrums. 
 Mr. Abbas has not groomed a successor. The American and Israeli dream would be Mr. Fayyad, but besides having no political base, he is not a member of Fatah, so Palestinians consider the prospect highly unlikely. More possible, a few say, would be for Mr. Abbas to remain president while allowing Mr. Fayyad to carry out his reform plan. 
 Two former security chiefs, Muhammad Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub, are also possibilities, although there seems to be no groundswell around them and plenty of opposition. Muhammad Ghneim, a founder of both Fatah and the P.L.O. who came to the West Bank this past summer from exile, is considered a possible place holder if the job suddenly becomes vacant. And Nasser al-Kidwa, a nephew of Mr. Arafat and former Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, is also mentioned by some as a possible future candidate. 
 But there is no appetite for a succession struggle as everyone waits to see whether the peace process deadlock can be broken.

HEADLINE: SENATE LEADERS UNVEIL MEASURE ON HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democratic leaders in the Senate on Wednesday unveiled their proposal for overhauling the health care system, outlining legislation that they said would cover most of the uninsured while reducing the federal budget deficit. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said at an evening news conference that the legislation, embodying President Obama's signature domestic initiative, would impose new regulations on insurers, extend coverage to 31 million people who currently do not have any and add new benefits to Medicare.
 Mr. Reid said the bill, despite a price tag of $848 billion over 10 years, would reduce projected budget deficits by $130 billion over a decade because the costs would be more than offset by new taxes and fees and by reductions in the growth of Medicare.
 Democrats expressed confidence that they would have the votes needed to move forward when the legislation hits its first test in the Senate, probably later this week. To get past that first procedural hurdle, Mr. Reid will need the votes of all 58 Democratic senators and the two independents aligned with them. 
 That vote would clear the way for what is sure to be an unpredictable roller-coaster ride of a debate on the Senate floor through much of December. Earlier this month the House passed its version of the health care legislation.
 Republicans have vowed to fight the legislation at every turn, saying it represents a dangerous expansion in the role of government that would increase taxes and insurance costs for millions of people. ''It's going to be a holy war,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.
 Under Mr. Reid's bill, the government would establish a new public insurance plan, which would compete with private insurers. States could opt out of the public plan by passing legislation. 
 In one last touch on Wednesday, Mr. Reid and his aides finally named the bill that he wrote over the last few weeks, selecting parts of bills previously adopted by two Senate committees. It is called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ''This legislation is a tremendous step forward,'' Mr. Reid said. ''It saves lives, saves money and will make Medicare stronger.''
 Though broadly similar to the House bill, Mr. Reid's proposal differs in important ways. It would, for example, increase the Medicare payroll tax on high-income people and impose a new excise tax on high-cost ''Cadillac health plans'' offered by employers to their employees.
 Mr. Reid's bill would not go as far as the House bill in limiting access to abortion. And while he would require most Americans to obtain health insurance, he would impose less stringent penalties on people who did not comply.
 Many provisions of Mr. Reid's bill, including the creation of insurance markets, or exchanges, would take effect in 2014, a year later than similar provisions of the House bill. The delay is intended primarily to reduce the cost of the legislation.
 Both bills would create a voluntary federal program to provide long-term care insurance and cash benefits to people with severe disabilities. 
 Desperately seeking money to pay for the legislation, Mr. Reid came up with a new source of financing: a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures. The tax would be paid by patients, but collected by doctors and clinics and forwarded to the government.
 The tax would be calculated as 5 percent of the amount paid for an elective cosmetic procedure, whether by the patient, insurance or other sources. The tax would not apply to cosmetic surgery for people with congenital abnormalities, disfiguring diseases or traumatic injuries.
 The official cost analysis released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shortly after 11 p.m. showed that Mr. Reid's bill came in under the $900 billion goal suggested by Mr. Obama. But 24 million people would still be uninsured in 2019, the budget office said. About one-third of them would be illegal immigrants.
 The Congressional Budget Office has said the House bill would reduce deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and cover 36 million people, but still leave 18 million uninsured in 2019.
 Republicans and some independent budget analysts said, however, that the savings might not be fully achieved because they were based on unrealistic assumptions about a sustained increase in the productivity of health care providers and much slower growth in Medicare spending.
 Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff said Mr. Reid's bill was impressive. It ''meets the president's objectives, provides protection from insurance companies, contains true cost controls and extends coverage to working families,'' Mr. Emanuel said.
 Senate Democratic leaders were still trying frantically on Wednesday to nail down a few of the 60 votes needed to begin debate on the legislation. 
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, both former senators, were on Capitol Hill, trying to help Mr. Reid round up votes.
 The proposed tax on ''Cadillac health plans'' is among the most contentious provisions of the bill.
 Under the Finance Committee bill, the government would have levied a 40 percent tax on the value of insurance exceeding $8,000 for individual coverage and $21,000 for family coverage, with some exceptions.
 Under Mr. Reid's bill, the tax would kick in at higher thresholds, $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families.
 Some economists say the tax could slow the growth of health spending by encouraging employers to pare back health benefits. Many labor unions oppose the tax, saying it would hit many middle-income workers who have sacrificed wage increases to secure or retain health benefits.
 The proposed increase in the Medicare payroll tax is another major new feature of Mr. Reid's bill. Under current law, employers and employees each pay a tax equal to 1.45 percent of wages. Mr. Reid would increase the rate to 1.95 percent for individuals with annual incomes over $200,000 and couples over $250,000. The tax on employers would be unchanged.
 Senate Democratic aides said the payroll tax increase would raise $54 billion over 10 years.
 By contrast, the main source of new revenue in the House bill is a surtax on high-income people. The tax would be 5.4 percent of adjusted gross income exceeding $1 million for couples and $500,000 for individuals.
 Mr. Reid's bill would also raise revenue by levying annual fees on health insurance companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Finance Committee would have imposed fees of $4 billion a year on manufacturers of medical devices, but Mr. Reid decided to cut those fees by half.
 Under the bill, most people would be required to carry insurance. A person without insurance could be required to pay a financial penalty, starting at $95 in 2014 and rising to $750 in 2016, with a maximum of $2,250 for a family.
 The Senate bill would not explicitly require employers to offer health insurance coverage. But if an employer with more than 50 employees does not offer coverage and if any worker qualifies for a federal subsidy, the employer would have to pay a penalty, typically $750 for each of its employees.

HEADLINE: Pacific Trip Encounters Rough Waters

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
For all of President Obama's laying claim to the title of ''America's first Pacific president,'' Asia was always going to be a tough nut for him to crack.
 Without the first lady at his side, he would not have the kind of round-the-clock coverage the first couple got during their inaugural tour of Europe. 
 Without a popular gesture like elevating the plight of the Palestinian people to equal status of the Israelis, he would not be showered with the kind of praise he got for his speech to the Muslim world in Cairo. 
 And without a stop in Indonesia, his boyhood home, he would not bask in the kind of adulation he received in Accra, Ghana.
 Instead, with the novelty of a visit as America's first black president having given way to the reality of having to plow through intractable issues like monetary policy (China), trade (Singapore, China, South Korea), security (Japan) and the 800-pound gorilla on the continent (China), Mr. Obama's Asia trip has been, in many ways, a long, uphill slog. 
 So it is no wonder that on the last day of the toughest part of his trip -- the China part -- Mr. Obama took a hike: a brisk, bracing 30-minute climb up the Great Wall. Around 3:30 Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Obama's mile-long motorcade arrived at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, which snakes over jagged, rocky mountains. 
 Visitors to that touristy section of the wall generally encounter a cacophonous melee of vendors, but on this day, the place was like a ghost town, courtesy of the Chinese authorities who had shut it down. (The same thing happened Tuesday when Mr. Obama sped through an empty-but-for-his-entourage Forbidden City.) 
 Even the two sightseeing trips did not offer a total respite, however, as they were prominent, well-publicized examples of what Mr. Obama did not do in China. He steered clear of public meetings with Chinese liberals, free press advocates and even average Chinese, with his aides citing scheduling conflicts. Mr. Obama did, though, give an interview on Wednesday morning to Southern Weekly, one of China's most popular newspapers, sometimes known for poking the authorities by breaking news on delicate subjects.
 Still, for an American president who has tried to make openness a hallmark of his public persona, it was a departure, made more stark since Chinese authorities largely hijacked Mr. Obama's one other attempt at a give and take with Chinese students, a town hall meeting in Shanghai, by stuffing the auditorium with young Communist Party aspirants.
 A week ago, when Mr. Obama kicked off his trip in Japan, things were not so grim. Tokyo welcomed him as much as a celebrity as a world leader, with cries of ''Obama-san!'' from the people who gathered in the rain to watch his motorcade pass. Local newspapers gushed about how he told his Japanese hosts that he wanted to eat tuna and Kobe beef. Even the ballyhoo from right-wing bloggers back at home over Mr. Obama's deep bow to Emperor Akihito did not seem to dent Mr. Obama's image in Japan; his aides said he was unfazed by the criticism.
 But Mr. Obama quickly discovered that popularity on the Asian streets did not necessarily translate into policy successes behind closed doors in the Kantei, the Japanese White House, let alone in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
 Political analysts in Japan gave Mr. Obama high marks for what was one of his principal goals: improving communication with Japan's outspoken new leaders.
 But the trip managed only to paper over some of the recent differences between the sides, like the contentious issue of the relocation of an unpopular Marine air base in Futenma, on the southern island of Okinawa. Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama could not solve that issue, instead merely deferring a tough decision by agreeing to form a working group to look at the relocation problem. 
 One former Japanese diplomat praised the president for showing patience and avoiding mishaps that would have further tarnished the relationship. The former diplomat, Kunihiko Miyake, who now teaches international affairs at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, said the United States and Japan still did not see eye to eye on their single biggest bilateral issue: how to make their cold-war-era alliance relevant in a region where the balance of power had been upset by China's rise.
 ''The two countries are in the same bed, but dreaming different dreams,'' Mr. Miyake said. ''The Americans want the alliance to be stronger, but the Japanese seem to want to do less.''
 Mr. Obama's next stop was Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, best known for its quaint custom of making all the leaders wear the same style of colorful shirt, helpfully supplied by the host country. Mr. Obama, in blue, wore a brave grin in the group photo, flanked by the red-shirted Singaporean prime minister and an identical blue-shirted Indonesian president.
 This year, APEC made headlines, though not the sort Mr. Obama might have liked. With a deadline looming for a big climate change conference in Copenhagen, the leaders convened a hastily called breakfast meeting to acknowledge that they would not be able to resolve entrenched differences in time. 
 And then, Mr. Obama departed for China, where the authorities stage-managed and restricted access to his town hall meeting in Shanghai. He did offer a nuanced, oblique critique of China's rigid controls and restrictions of the Internet and free speech without mentioning, let alone condemning, China's government. 
 Mr. Obama and President Hu Jintao presented their two days of talks as substantive, even though they did not appear to make much progress on issues like Iran, China's currency or human rights. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, took the unusual step of sending a statement to reporters -- something he did not do for either stop in Japan or Singapore -- saying the China trip went well. 
 In Seoul, where Mr. Obama ends his trip, he will have perhaps his easiest leg. South Korea is a longtime ally that has been cooperating with the United States on vital issues like North Korea and does not appear to have any big ax to grind with the United States.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Health Care Calculations

BYLINE: By ANDREW GELMAN, NATE SILVER and DANIEL LEE. 
Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia. Nate Silver is the founder of the Web site FiveThirtyEight.com. Daniel Lee is a research associate at the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia.

 BODY:
CRITICS of the health care reform plan often refer to it derisively as ''ObamaCare.'' On the policy merits, this is highly questionable: the White House has taken a hands-off approach toward the legislation that recently passed in the House and the version that is being worked out in the Senate. But when it comes to politics, ''ObamaCare'' could hardly be more apt: lawmakers' support for or opposition to reform generally has less to do with the views of their constituents and more to do with the issue of presidential popularity. 
 Consider, for instance, the 39 Democrats who voted against the bill in the House, which approved the health care bill by a margin of 220 to 215. According to data compiled by The New York Times, 31 of the 39 Democratic naysayers hail from districts that John McCain won last November. Although the upper chamber has a reputation for being less rigidly constrained by near-term political considerations, odds are that the same calculus will prevail in the Senate. 
 We've crunched some poll numbers in order to relate senators' positions on the bill to public opinion in their home states. First, we rated each of the 100 senators from 1 to 5, based on their public statements and their committee votes on the health care initiative, with 1 meaning completely opposed (like Jim DeMint of South Carolina) and 5 meaning completely supporting the bill (like Barbara Boxer of California).
 We then compared these scores against several statistical indicators that would presumably affect lawmakers' positions, including their party affiliations and the rate of uninsurance in their home states. We also looked at polling data from the National Annenberg Election Surveys, which asked voters in each state: ''Providing health insurance for people who do not already have it -- should the federal government spend more on it, the same as now, less, or no money at all?'' (The Annenberg data are from 2000 and 2004; 2008 data have yet to be released.)
 But the relationship between state-level opinion and senators' positions on health care disappears once we introduce another variable -- Mr. Obama's margin of victory in each state in 2008. This holds whether or not we take into account a senator's political party.
 For instance, Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat who has been a less-than-strong supporter of the present health care bill, recently told The Times, ''I am responsible to the people of Arkansas, and that is where I will take my direction.'' But where does she look for her cue? Hers is a poor state whose voters support health care subsidies six percentage points more than the national average. On the other hand, Mr. Obama got just 40 percent of the vote there. 
 Likewise, in Louisiana, where the Annenberg surveys showed health care reform to be popular but where Mr. Obama is not, the Democrats are not assured of Mary Landrieu's vote.
 There are exceptions to the pattern: Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, a state that Mr. Obama lost by 13 points but whose voters remain economically liberal and show high levels of support for health care reform, has been one of the most vocal supporters of the bill. 
 Using a statistical method called multilevel regression and post-stratification, we also mapped opinion on health care, breaking down voters by age, family income and state. We're used to thinking about red states and blue states, but the geographic variation is dwarfed by the demographic patterns: younger, lower-income Americans strongly support increased government spending on health care, while elderly and well-off Americans are much less supportive of the idea. But in general, senators seems to be less interested in what their constituents, old and young, rich and poor, might think about health care, and more interested in how they feel about President Obama. 
 This may actually be good news for the Democrats. Although the Annenberg surveys had shown health care subsidies to be quite popular -- they had 67 percent support nationally in 2000 and 73 percent support in 2004 -- that was back when they were a mere abstraction, and before voters might have been considering how to pay for them. Nowadays, President Obama enjoys higher approval ratings -- in the low to mid-50s, according to most polls -- than do the Democrats' health care reform plans, which are mired in the mid-40s in most surveys. Conditions being what they are, Democrats would rather have a referendum on the president than one on the health care bill itself.
 Still, what these numbers seem to reflect is a series of missed connections. On the one hand, there is a disconnect between Mr. Obama and the electorate: the president -- who had popularity ratings in the 60s when the health care debate began -- has generally stayed in the background during health care negotiations, leaving the unpopular Congress to be the public face of the bill.
 On the other hand, there is a disconnect between the electorate and the 535 members of Congress, who seem to be so fixated on Mr. Obama's standing in their states that they've paid little attention to what their constituents might want -- or need.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on Thursday, about senators and the health care plan, misstated the support for health care subsidies in Arkansas. It is four percentage points more than the national average, not six. 
 In addition, a chart accompanying the article mislabeled a category. The second line of maps reflects the support of Americans ages 30 to 44, not ages 30 to 34.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.: The Real Cost of College

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: An exchange with an economist who closely follows college costs.

 BODY:
For anyone interested in more on this subject, we recommend the work our colleagues are doing at The Choice blog. Particularly relevant are these three posts. 
Now onto the discussion with Ms. Baum: 
Families and students consistently overestimate the price of college. Headlines frequently focus on the most expensive colleges, but the United States system of higher education includes a wide variety of institutions offering diverse educational experiences and a wide array of prices. Public-two year colleges -- typically known as community colleges -- generally have much lower tuition than public-four year colleges. Public four-year colleges cost less than private colleges. However, even among private colleges, prices differ by thousands of dollars.
The other major confusion is between the published price, sometimes called the "sticker price," and the net price that students actually pay after taking grant aid into consideration. Federal and state governments distribute billions of dollars in grants (also known as scholarships), but the largest part comes from colleges and universities themselves. They are essentially discounting their prices. Grant aid covers a large part of tuition for many students, particularly those from low- and moderate-income families.
The average grant aid for full-time public two-year college students is more than enough to pay the $2,544 published tuition price. So the average net tuition price at these schools is actually zero. At public four-year colleges the average net price is about $1,600 (compared with a list price of $7,020). At private four-year colleges, it's about $11,900, compared with a list tuition price of $26,273. Of course, each student's circumstances are different, so most students are paying more or less than these average amounts -- and these prices do not include room and board.
The differences between list tuition and net tuition are so large because about two-thirds of full-time college students receive some grant aid. At private four-year colleges, almost 80 percent do. 
The net tuition price paid by students at public two-year college has been declining steadily for at least 15 years, after adjusting for inflation. At public and private four-year colleges, the average net price is lower this year than it was five years earlier -- despite significant increases in published prices. The federal government has recently increased Pell Grant financing quite a bit, after a number of years without increases. We don't have good data yet for state and institutional awards in the current year, but aid from these sources has also been rising in recent years. The average net prices student pay, considering all the grant aid they get, have declined at public colleges and risen very slightly relative to general inflation at private colleges over the past decade. This is a real contrast to the published prices, where the most rapid increases have been about 5 percent a year beyond inflation at public four-year colleges.
Yes. At public four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 20 percent over the past five years (these are inflation-adjusted dollars, as are all historical comparisons I'm making), but the average net price fell $400 -- from about $2,000 to $1,600. At private four-year colleges the sticker price rose by 15 percent, but the average net price fell 9 percent, or about $1,100. 
It is important to note that these figures are just for tuition and fees. Students also have to live, eat, buy books, and cover other expenses while they are in school. 
Despite the declines in actual net tuition prices, college feels more expensive to people for a number of reasons. First, a third of all full-time students pay the full published price, without the benefit of grant aid. College truly has become more expensive for these upper-income families. Second, room and board and other living costs have increased faster than inflation over time, and for most students, grant aid doesn't stretch far enough to cover these expenses. This is why community college can be difficult for students to afford even though average net tuition is zero. 
Another very important reality is that family incomes have been stagnant for the past decade for people at all but the highest income levels. This means that it feels more and more difficult for people to maintain their standards of living and certainly more difficult to finance the major expense of going to college. 
It is true that the gap between full-pay students and others is growing, although at some private colleges, virtually every student gets at least some grant aid. Low-and moderate income students pay lower net prices than middle-income students and middle-income students pay lower net prices than upper-incomes students. 
But a considerable amount of grant aid is distributed without regard to financial need and many high-income students pay less than the published prices. At public four-year colleges, about two-thirds of the institutional grants awarded are non-need-based. And of course, federal tax credits and deductions go primarily to middle- and even upper-income students and families. These upper-income families that are paying more tuition than they used to are also the families that, on average, have received the largest raises in recent years.
College tuition -- the list price -- continues to rise faster than other prices in the economy. This is particularly true at public colleges, where diminished state appropriations are creating severe budgetary problems. Over the past decade, published prices at public four-year colleges have risen very rapidly by historical standards, but this is not the case at either public two-year or private four-year colleges.
The average net price of attending college is not rising nearly as fast as the published price, because growing amounts of financial aid are available. But in 2009-10, the net price of college did rise, even after adjusting for inflation. 
The net prices I mentioned don't take loans into account. We consider loans to be part of the students' contribution. The students have to pay them back eventually.
But it's still worth following trends with loans, both because they make it possible for many students to pay their bills and because they lead to difficulties in the future for students who borrow more than they can afford to repay. In 2008-9 there was a real shift in the sources of student loans. Loans from non-federal sources (primarily private lenders) declined by about 50 percent as a result of the credit crisis and the increased availability of federal loans. Federal loans increased quite a bit, and over all, education borrowing was almost constant. Over the past decade, the proportion of student loans that are subsidized -- with the federal government paying the interest while students are in school -- has declined considerably, with unsubsidized federal loans playing a larger role. It is a real plus for students that the federal government is making it easier for them to borrow the money they need at regulated interest rates and with protections for repayment difficulties. But for most students, interest is accruing while they are in school and they should keep track of how much they actually owe.

HEADLINE: At Ad Council Dinner, Tart Humor From Tina Fey

BYLINE: JANE L. LEVERE


HIGHLIGHT: The "30 Rock" actress poked fun of the heads of NBC Universal and General Electric, as well as her look-alike, Sarah Palin. 

 BODY:
Despite, or perhaps because of, the serious messages of many Advertising Council campaigns - which focus on topics as varied as teen dating violence and hunger in America - the group offered some comic relief at its annual dinner Wednesday night by inviting Tina Fey to host the event, at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.
Ms. Fey didn't miss her chance to poke fun at her superiors - Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, and Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, which is reportedly about to sell a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast - in the audience, or at her look-alike, Sarah Palin. 
"My name is Tina Fey and I work on a show that you may have heard of called '30 Rock,'" she began. "I say you may have heard of it because I know from the ratings that you have not seen it. I work at NBC, which is sadly the fourth-place network right now. Actually, we're in ninth place, if you count the couple of radio stations that are ahead of us right now."
"It's a crazy time to work at NBC," she continued. "because we keep hearing these rumors that maybe we're going to get bought out by Comcast, leaving all NBC employees kind of nervously wondering the same thing, will I be able to get the Spice Channel for free in my office?"
"And it leaves me wondering, will I have to change the name of my show from '30 Rock' to 'Industrial Park Along the Schuylkill River'? Whatever we need to do, we will do it," she said.
Turning to Ms. Palin, whom she referred to initially as "Governor Palin" and then as "Person Palin," Ms. Fey said the two "continue to have so much in common. They recently made a porn movie, this is true, about Sarah Palin, and then the same adult actress, Lisa Ann, played me in a porn parody of '30 Rock.' Weirdly, of the three of us, Lisa Ann knows the most about foreign policy. But I know the most about three-ways." 
Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, who was given the Ad Council's annual public service award by Mr. Immelt, its 2008 recipient, was in cheerleader mode, discussing the importance of brand-building and advertising in today's weak economy in his acceptance speech.
Waving an original copy of his company's 1931 annual report, Mr. Kent read from the letter of its president at the time, Robert Woodruff, noting Mr. Woodruff said Coca-Cola was "'able to generate a profit that year despite a small decrease in volume. The keys to our success in 1931 were staying committed to advertising and communicating with our consumers.'"
"Strong discipline, respect for consumers, helped the Coca-Cola Company endure the greatest financial crisis in American history, and I think the same lesson applies today. So my message to the advertising community is keep the faith - these tough days are going to pass," Mr. Kent said.
According to TNS Media Intelligence, he is putting his money where his mouth is: in the first half of this year, Coca-Cola spent $271.5 million on all advertising in the United States and was the 36th-largest advertiser in the country, up from $257.3 in the first half of 2008, when it was the 42nd-largest.

HEADLINE: Mammogram Debate Took Group by Surprise

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The federal Preventive Services Task Force, the group that created a political firestorm this week with its recommendation that women get less-frequent mammograms, was created to be insulated from politics.
 Yet, some observers say, its apolitical nature may have made it naive about just how strongly Congress; some professionals, like radiologists; advocacy groups, like the American Cancer Society; and members of the public would react.
 As soon as the task force's guidelines were released on Monday, recommending against routine mammograms for most women in their 40s and saying women should consider having the screening test every other year instead of annually, the maelstrom erupted. 
 Republicans and some groups, like the American College of Radiology, said the guidelines were made in response to the Obama administration's wish to save health care dollars.
 The health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, distancing herself from the group's recommendations, told CNN on Wednesday, ''This panel was appointed by the prior administration, by former President George Bush.''
 Dr. Diana Petitti, the vice chairwoman of the task force, said Thursday that she had been taken aback by the reaction. She did not realize, she said, the extent of the context. There has been an intense controversy over the screening of younger women, dating back more than a decade and involving Congressional hearings.
 ''I was relatively unaware of it,'' she said. ''I have been made aware of it now.''
 Dr. Michael LeFevre, another task force member, said he, too, had been caught off guard by the way the guidelines were received. The task force's message was distorted, he said, into a purely negative one, when the group meant to encourage women to make their own decisions.
 ''It's partly our fault,'' Dr. LeFevre said, adding that the group would now be trying to figure out how they could have gotten their point across without stirring such a controversy.
 But Dr. Philip Lee, who was an assistant secretary for health in the Clinton administration, said he was surprised by how politically naive the task force members seemed.
 ''Here we are on the lip of health care reform,'' he said, a time when people are suspicious of any talk of taking away benefits. And the task force says, ''They just have to look at the evidence and present the evidence and that's that?''
 The task force was created in 1984, at a time when screening methods for cancer, cholesterol levels and diabetes were just emerging and rarely paid for by insurers. So Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, deputy assistant secretary for health, decided to set up the group to evaluate how well such methods worked. 
 He decided right away that the group had to be insulated from politics. The idea, he said, was to identify medical experts who could objectively evaluate evidence and to protect the group from any political pressures so they could write honest assessments.
 And so the United States Preventive Services Task Force was born. It is financed by the Department of Health and Human Services but works at arms length from it, making its decisions without consulting the agency.
 Panel members said politics and questions of cost were never part of their discussions of the risks and benefits of mammograms -- in fact they are prohibited from considering costs when they make guidelines. It was the scientific evidence, they said, that led them to conclude that women in their 40s should carefully consider whether they want to be screened rather than assuming they should start screening then. And it was the evidence, they said, that led them to conclude that screening every other year provides all the benefits of screening annually.
 They also said they never thought of themselves as being political appointees, much less being Bush appointees. 
 Medical experts become members of the task force by nominating themselves or, as usually happens, by being nominated by colleagues and professional organizations.
 They are vetted by Health and Human Services to be sure they have no conflicts of interest, their names are published in the Federal Register, and they are appointed by the head of the Agency for Health Care Quality and Research, which is part of Health and Human Services.
 ''I grew up in the '60s,'' said one panel member, Dr. J. Sanford Schwartz, a professor of medicine, health care and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. ''My kids grew up under a banner saying 'Question authority.' That's where I am coming from.''
 Dr. Russell Harris, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, whose term on the task force recently ended, said, ''I'm sure George Bush would never have appointed me to anything.''
 Some members, in fact, find the accusations that they were politically motivated a bit hard to fathom. In 2002, the group, with different members, said for the first time that screening could start at 40 but that doctors should inform women about the potential benefits, harms and limitations of the test. They also said mammography's benefits increased as women grow older, until age 70. Committee members said they considered those guidelines a weak recommendation for screening women in their 40s, although they were widely interpreted as a strong endorsement.
 That time, their report was announced at a news conference by the Health and Human Services secretary, Tommy G. Thompson, and critics of that report said that it had been influenced by Mr. Thompson, whose wife had had breast cancer. 
 Yet, Dr. Lee said, the task force should have known what it was getting into with its new guidelines.
 ''For so many years, you've got certain highly regarded people in the medical profession saying that women ought to be screened at age 40,'' he said. ''This is an idea that has taken hold.''
 So, Dr. Lee said, for the task force to simply put out its guidelines and expect people to change their minds was not realistic.

HEADLINE: Treasury to Auction Off Big-Bank Warrants

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
A year after the federal government rescued the nation's financial industry, the Treasury Department announced Thursday that it would auction off its remaining investments in three large banks, freeing the lenders from the federal bailout program. 
 The Treasury will sell warrants that the government received as part of the taxpayer-financed rescue via auctions next month. The sales could raise $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion. The move will free the three banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Capital One Financial and TCF Financial -- from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. 
 The warrants on shares of the biggest of the three banks, JPMorgan, could fetch as much as $2.75 billion, according to an estimate by Linus Wilson of the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. 
 Other banks, among them Goldman Sachs, negotiated deals to buy back their warrants -- which are similar to stock options -- rather than auction them off to investors. Some financial analysts argued the negotiated sales did not benefit taxpayers as much as auctions might have. 
 Goldman Sachs -- which has made a rapid recovery from the financial crisis -- bought its warrants for $1.1 billion in July. Today, those warrants would be worth $1.24 billion to $2.1 billion given the surge in Goldman's stock price since then, according to Mr. Wilson. By buying back the warrants directly, banks like Goldman were able to retire the securities and avoid diluting the stakes of existing shareholders. 
 In all, however, the warrants have turned out to be good investments for the Treasury. 
 But after failing to agree on prices for the warrants with the government, JPMorgan, Capital One Financial and TCF Financial elected to auction them off and let private investors determine their value. 
 The Treasury will sell the warrants through a so-called Dutch auction. It has hired Deutsche Bank to solicit bids from sophisticated investors and set minimum bids. The format will enable the three banks to bid for the warrants themselves. It is unclear if they will to do so.
 Officials from JPMorgan and Capital One declined to comment; a TCF spokeswoman did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
 The warrants in JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion of federal aid that it received last year, could be worth $1 billion to $2.75 billion, according to Mr. Wilson. Those in Capital One could be worth $241 million to $393 million, while those in TCF could fetch more than $12 million. 
 It will not be the first time that the government has held such a sale. In the early 1980s, it conducted a similar sale for warrants the government received in connection with its rescue of Chrysler. Chrysler, which initially asked the government to return the warrants at no cost, submitted the winning bid that gave a tidy profit for taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Modern Art for Modern Museumgoers

BYLINE: By JESSICA REAVES. 
Jessica Reaves has covered arts and culture for The Chicago Tribune and Time.com.

 BODY:
On a recent Thursday evening in Chicago a crowd was forming. Young women grasped the hands of balky children; aspiring artists with pierced eyebrows clutched pencils and sketchbooks. They were waiting to be granted entrance to the Modern Wing of the Art Institute. And they were getting restless.
 At exactly 5 p.m. a barrier was lifted, and the crowd broke apart. People streamed past the ticket stands, fanning out beneath the soaring cathedral ceiling. Some strode immediately up the staircases to the upper galleries, some moved slowly through the airy entrance hall, marveling at the interplay of light and glass. 
Three hours later museum guards shooed away the last visitor and secured the heavy doors for the night. More than 4,500 people had taken advantage of a Chicago tradition: an opportunity to bypass the Art Institute's $18 admission fee, enjoy a civilized cocktail and admire the museum's 300,000-piece permanent collection.
 For the last six months that list of attractions at the museum (artic.edu) has included the Modern Wing, Renzo Piano's ballyhooed addition to the ''old'' Art Institute. And while not everyone agrees on the aesthetics, or the architecture, some things about Mr. Piano's contribution are beyond debate: The new wing gives the venerable museum room to breathe, markedly expanding the number of works on display. It also stands to attract a new generation of members -- and potential donors -- who are young, culturally adventurous and drawn to anything new and different.
 Though the Art Institute does not track the age of visitors in detail (there are rates for students and the elderly, and children under 14 get in free), and the museum's press office said it did not have membership demographics, one look at the crowd on a free-admission Thursday paints a straightforward, albeit unscientific, picture: Young people (under 30) tend to enjoy modern art. They are happy to take advantage of anything free. And they put a premium on the ''new.'' 
 That is all part of what Chris Semel, a 21-year-old student at Columbia College Chicago, calls the ''vibe'' he gets from modern work. 
 ''It's more intriguing to me,'' he said, standing with a classmate in front of a huge, luminous Jeff Wall photograph. ''I am not bashing the old masters,'' but, he added, ''old-school style was all about following the rules, and the stuff in the Modern Wing is generally about taking the rules and distorting them into something entirely new.''
 Certainly, taste in art is not dictated solely by age, or by any other single factor; a walk through any museum confirms that art lovers of all ages can be equally passionate about Rauschenberg and Raphael. Perhaps, then, what is seen at the Modern Wing is less about the artwork and more about the space -- the airiness of the rooms, the sense, as another student, Lauren Miller, 22, put it, ''that you have room to move.''
 Robert Kotula, 21, has been working part time for several months for Discovery Audio, the company that provides the museum's audio tours. Every week Mr. Kotula, a photography student, watches as others his age flock to the Modern Wing. Many more come through the Michigan Avenue entrance, flanked by the familiar lions, than through the more modest Monroe Street entrance, facing Millennium Park, into the Modern Wing. But once inside, Mr. Kotula said, they move quickly into the new building.
 The suggestion that a generational rift might be brewing between the Modern and old wings of the Art Institute was met in official circles with good-natured but firm denials. That is hardly surprising; even if a culture war were looming, this is no time to rock the boat. This has been a very good year for the Art Institute; despite the recession individual donations are on the rise, according to Erin Hogan, an Art Institute spokeswoman.
 The Modern Wing is drawing huge crowds; membership and admissions, both paid and free, are up, putting the museum on track to shatter attendance records. It is on pace for two million visitors this year, up from an average of 1.5 million in recent years. 
 And no one in Chicago's famously vocal art scene -- from Madeleine Grynsztejn, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, to Tony Karman, the vice president of Art Chicago -- wants to talk about anything other than the Modern Wing's beneficial ripple effect on the city's art world.
 But perhaps the most forceful -- and heartfelt -- refutation of a hypothetical divide between old and new, or young and old, came from a longtime volunteer who was at the visitor information desk just inside the entrance to the Modern Wing. She declined, rather crossly, to give her name. 
 ''I think it's important that people think of this,'' she said as she waved her arms as if to encompass every piece of art, every person under the Art Institute's roof, ''as one entity, not as two separate things.''

HEADLINE: Faith and Tolerance Collide in Vallejo

BYLINE: By Scott James. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Drive through Vallejo and you will see a once-proud Navy town clearly down on its luck. A motel room goes for $30.99 a night, including HBO. Closed businesses proliferate; those that remain often have temporary vinyl signs held up by string, indicating a tentative investment in the future.
 The problems plaguing this community are among the most daunting to face any municipality: the city has declared bankruptcy, its schools are in state receivership and a court battle threatens to strip firefighters of expensive salaries and benefits. 
But there is concern that, as the city tries to find the way out of this financial abyss, it is falling into another that is perhaps more pernicious -- its political system increasingly reflects the influence of evangelical churches. This influence, many say, has been gained by condoning intolerance of the city's growing gay community.
 ''There's definitely a disconnect between the faith community and the gay community,'' said Marc Garman, editor of The Vallejo Independent Bulletin, an online town crier.
 There has been a gay migration to Vallejo from San Francisco in the past decade, lured by inexpensive home ownership and opulent Victorians ripe for renovation. The newcomers found tolerance here, but now there are signs of a push back.
 Earlier this year, the Vallejo school district settled a lawsuit after an openly gay high school student said she was harassed by staff and told she was going ''to hell.'' She was awarded $25,000, and schools were forced to adopt antidiscrimination policies. 
 Gay candidates for public office say they have been singled out for defeat by a coalition of local churches calling itself the ''faith community.'' In 2007 and 2009 the group hosted ''faith forums'' that included gay candidates, but not in other contests.
 An openly gay priest who was a school board candidate, the Rev. Lou Bordisso, said he heard murmurs and laughter at a forum this fall. A moderator asked if he wanted to put a gay and lesbian curriculum in schools. Father Bordisso is an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of California in the American Catholic Church (a sect not under Vatican control). ''They have a hidden agenda to impose their particular version of Christianity on the citizens of Vallejo,'' he said. 
 Comments posted on Mr. Garman's Web site described the forum as ''homophobic'' and ''horrid.'' An openly gay mayoral candidate, Gary Cloutier, attended such a forum in 2007. Mr. Cloutier said introductions referred to him as ''a gay.'' Then, he said, ''I was asked if I would bring the Folsom Street Fair to Vallejo.'' The question referred to San Francisco's notorious public display of sexuality.
 Mr. Cloutier said the political climate changed six years ago when he was serving as a member of the City Council. Evangelicals began forming prayer circles outside the Council chambers. '' I was disturbed because they called America a Christian nation,'' he said.
 Both men eventually lost their races. Mr. Cloutier was defeated -- by only two votes -- by Osby Davis, a devout Assemblies of God follower. ''I don't know what the fear is about considering Vallejo as a city of God,'' Mayor Davis said. If believed, he said, ''that God created heaven and earth and everything that's in it, and that God is sovereign, then you believe that he is already a part of this community and this is already his city; and so what's the big deal?''
 Mr. Davis thought the question asked about the Folsom Street Fair was ''really, really unfair.'' But his faith does inform the way he sees gay people. ''They're committing sin and that sin will keep them out of heaven,'' he said. ''But you don't hate the person. You hate the sin that they commit.''
 Told his outspoken religious passion might rattle some, he said: ''That means that they have a problem, and not me. I'm just as passionate about my faith as someone is about the Oakland Raiders football team. No one says a word when someone rides down the street with their body all painted up yelling, 'Go Raiders!' If I start yelling, 'Go Jesus! Praise God!' someone gets upset.''
 Stephanie Gomes, a City Council member, has ''a very strong feeling about the separation of church and state.'' Her recent, successful campaign focused on economic problems. Ms. Gomes is concerned about the political tone. ''We became so diverse,'' she said, ''and I wonder if some people felt threatened by that.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Hopes to End Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Thursday that the government would end its $700 billion bailout program ''as soon as we can,'' and that part of it would be used to lower the federal debt.
 During a sometimes contentious Joint Economic Committee hearing that included one lawmaker calling on him to resign, Mr. Geithner was pressed to disclose the administration's plan for dealing with the unpopular financial rescue program. 
 ''We are winding it down and will close it as soon as we can,'' Mr. Geithner said of the $700 billion bailout fund, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Congress approved TARP at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008 as a way to supply banks with fresh capital.
 Mr. Geithner said ''substantial resources'' remaining in the fund would be used to pay down the national debt, which is being pushed higher by record deficits, including a $1.42 billion imbalance for the budget year that ended Sept. 30. 
 While pledging to end TARP as quickly as possible, Mr. Geithner also said the administration did not want to repeat the mistake of other countries by ending government support too fast and derailing a fledgling economic recovery.
 But Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, said the economy was such a mess that Mr. Geithner, as the Obama administration's chief economic spokesman, should resign immediately.
 ''Mr. Secretary, the public has lost all confidence in your ability to do your job,'' Mr. Brady said.
 Mr. Geithner, who headed the New York Federal Reserve Bank before being tapped to be Treasury secretary, countered that the economy was in significantly better shape today than it was a year ago when Republicans controlled the White House, a view that was supported by a number of Democrats on the committee.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, did criticize Mr. Geithner for not pressing China forcefully enough to allow its currency to rise in value against the dollar. American manufacturers blame a significant portion of the United States trade deficit with China on an undervalued renminbi, which makes American products more expensive in China and Chinese goods cheaper in America.
 ''Today millions of Americans are out of work because the Chinese are manipulating their currency,'' Mr. Schumer said, urging the administration to impose trade sanctions on Chinese products if the Chinese government did not stop controlling the value of its currency.
 Mr. Geithner said the Chinese government had indicated that it planned to allow its currency to be set by market forces and he predicted it would not be long before China resumed allowing the renminbi to rise in value.
 Mr. Geithner was on Capitol Hill pushing Congress to move quickly in overhauling the nation's financial rules, a move he said was essential for the health of the economy.
 ''To ensure the vitality, the strength and the stability of our economy going forward, we must bring our system of financial regulation into the 21st century,'' Mr. Geithner testified.
 The House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee are working on their own versions of sweeping financial overhaul plans, but the two panels are taking divergent approaches in some areas.
 Both proposals also face sharp opposition from major sectors in the financial industry, casting doubt on how quickly Congress will be able to reach agreement and send a finished bill to the White House.
 Mr. Geithner said the administration wanted to ensure that firms would not be able to escape or avoid oversight by shopping for the most lenient regulator, a situation critics say contributed to the worst financial market crisis in seven decades.

HEADLINE: Company Piles Up Profits From City's Parking Meter Deal

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS. 
Dan Mihalopoulos is a veteran Chicago city hall reporter.

 BODY:
After a rocky start hurt their bottom line, Chicago's new parking meter operators are raking in more than $1.1 million a week and expect even more revenue next year, according to internal company documents obtained by the Chicago News Cooperative.
 The parking meter company projects total revenues of more than $75 million and net income of about $58 million in 2010, after a second round of rate increases go into effect across the city on Jan. 1. In the first 10 1/2 months of operation ending Dec. 31 of this year, the company expects $32.7 million in net operating profit, for a 70 percent profit margin.
 Financial experts who reviewed the data say Chicago could have made out much better in the long run had it just kept the meters. The private company, Chicago Parking Meters LLC, paid the city $1.15 billion in February for the right to reap all parking fee revenues for 75 years. Under the deal, rates immediately quadrupled at most of the city's 36,000 meters.
 The source that provided the documents to a reporter said the parking lease value was a matter of great civic importance and the company's profits should be made public. But the source wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from the private meter company or the city. The Chicago News Cooperative verified the authenticity of the documents. 
 The glimpse into the meter company's books rekindles the debate over whether Mayor Richard M. Daley's long-term lease of the system was the wisest approach for Chicago taxpayers.
 ''Had we done this ourselves, it could have made a lot more money,'' said Alderman Scott Waguespack, one of the dissenters when the City Council took a quick 40-5 vote in favor of the deal. ''It was too easy for the mayor to give it away and get the quick shot in the arm.'' 
 Another of the naysayers on the Council, Rey Colon, said this week that the parking meter company's own numbers showed that aldermen should have raised parking charges and kept the money that the increases would have generated.
 ''At this rate, it was a great deal for the parking meter company,'' he said. ''I don't know if it was a good deal for the city. We should have just bit the bullet and done it ourselves.''
 Mr. Daley heatedly disputes accusations that he mortgaged the city's future, calling the deal a godsend for Chicago's finances. The mayor also says that he would have been forced to raise taxes or cut services to balance the budget if not for the windfalls generated by the parking meter lease and the $1.83 billion privatization of the Chicago Skyway toll road four years ago.
 ''The people own the asset to be used today for this generation of people and not for 2050,'' Mr. Daley said soon after the Council's parking meter vote last December. ''Our responsibility is to help the generation right now.''
 Also benefiting from the parking deal are investors in Chicago Parking Meters, the venture led by New York-based Morgan Stanley. Avis LaVelle, a former press secretary for Mr. Daley who works as the company's spokeswoman, said the company officials declined to comment on the freshly revealed documents.
 The financial records were compiled by LAZ Parking, which runs the system for Chicago Parking Meters. The firm's figures show that the private parking effort was not generating as much revenue as anticipated in the first months after the Feb. 13 turnover of the parking meters from public hands.
 According to the meter deal's income statement for May 2009, revenues for the month were about 20 percent below projections. At the same time, expenses were far over budget, mostly for ''supplemental staffing.''
 The company has acknowledged that it did not have enough workers to deal with the turnover, which was marked by widespread technical problems. Many meters became choked by the high flow of quarters needed to pay the new, higher rates.
 To quell public and local political discontent, the company scurried to speed the replacement of meters with new ''pay and display'' machines that accept credit cards, further driving up its first-year costs. 
 Revenues began to rise after the rate increases were fully instituted at meters across the city in early June. 
 The early revenue numbers also fell short of expectations because the meter company voluntarily suspended writing tickets -- as the deal with the city allows it to do -- on March 21. That move was intended to allow the firm to focus on solving the technical problems.
 Because the company is not writing tickets, it seems many Chicagoans are getting away with parking for free. A company audit of a section of the North Side found 41 percent of occupied spaces filled by motorists who were not paying, according to the company records.
 Now, however, the parking company wants to resume writing tickets. The meter company ''has notified city of desire to get enforcement back into effect,'' the documents show.
 City officials declined to comment when asked this week about the company's plans to return to writing tickets. A spokesman for the Daley administration's Revenue Department said the city could not comment on internal parking company documents. 
 City workers have continued to write tickets, and Chicago still keeps the fines, regardless of who issues the tickets. 
 Last year, before the privatization and the rate increases, the city reported parking meter revenues of almost $24 million. This year, despite its rough start, the parking meter company has received revenues of almost $35 million through October and expects to hit a total of about $46 million between Feb. 13 and the end of the year, the records show.
 Examining the parking company's numbers so far and its 2010 projections, financial experts said they expected that private investors would be happy with the deal.
 ''There is little doubt they will recoup their investment in a relatively short period of time,'' said Dennis Enright, an investment banker who specializes in privatization deals for NW Financial in Jersey City, N.J.
 Mr. Enright added that the Daley administration got about as much as it could have from a private bidder, given the economy. But he said the city's taxpayers would have been better served by holding onto the system. 
 ''The value the city could have captured was probably double what they got,'' he said.
 Like Mr. Enright, the economist Roger Skurski calculated the current value of the deal. Mr. Skurski said his conservative estimate was that ''the city could have earned about $670 million more by keeping the asset.''
 ''They left some serious money on the table,'' said Mr. Skurski, an emeritus professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. ''Sure, they got the money up front and plugged their budget hole, but on every other score, the city did not get a good deal.''
 Even without the benefit of revenue data from the private company, the city's inspector general had issued a report in June asserting that the true value of the parking system to the taxpayers could have been more than $2 billion.
 Some critics suggest that the city back out, but Mr. Daley has said that the deal has been a good one. In any case, the vast majority of the money that the company paid his administration will be spent within a couple of years of the deal's approval.
 The Daley administration will use up more than $400 million from the deal by the end of this year. Under the mayor's proposal for next year, which the Council will vote on Dec. 2, almost an additional $600 million will go toward balancing the budget for 2010.
 Alderman Waguespack said it was too easy for the mayor to give the meter system away ''for a quick shot in the arm.''
 ''Now they've burned through that,'' he said.
 The alderman recently introduced a measure that would require an ''independent third-party valuation'' of major asset lease proposals before any future privatization deal is completed. The legislation would require ''a comparison of public retention and private leasing over the life cycle of the agreement.'' Only 12 of the Council's 49 other members have signed on as co-sponsors.
 The city's $2.5 billion deal with a private company that wanted to take over Midway Airport recently fell through, but the mayor remains eager to revive that effort. And he has met with consultants who have suggested other assets that the city could lease, with speculation swirling around the future of Chicago's water system.
 Before entering into the parking meter deal, the city hired a consultant whose confidential report suggested the lease could generate $650 million to $1.2 billion for the city.
 The report was not disclosed to the public until after the check from the winning parking meter bidder cleared. Officials say revealing a consultant's valuation analysis before a deal closes would hurt the city's chances of getting the best possible deal.

 Broadway
 'AFTER MISS JULIE'Patrick Marber's adaptation of Strindberg's short shocker from 1888, stiffly directed by Mark Brokaw and starring Sienna Miller, who emerges as sane, healthy and confident, which doesn't help much in her portrayal of a death-courting neurotic. The very good Jonny Lee Miller plays her sexual sparring partner (1:35). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Ben Brantley)20091119
 'BURN THE FLOOR' A nonstop exhibition of pop ballroom dancing, directed and choreographed by Jason Gilkison. A little tacky and vulgar, but would you want your steamy cha-chas and tangos any other way? (2:05). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)20091119
 'BYE BYE BIRDIE' Robert Longbottom's color-coded revival of this 1960 musical satire is a painful example of misapplied talent. The unlucky cast members include John Stamos, Gina Gershon and Bill Irwin (2:20). Henry Miller's Theater, 124 West 43rd Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'FINIAN'S RAINBOW' A glorious cast restores the luster of this oddball 1947 musical with a first-rate score by E. Y. Harburg and Burton Lane. Kate Baldwin and Cheyenne Jackson are the frisky lovers, Jim Norton the wily Irishman with a purloined pot of gold, and Christopher Fitzgerald the leprechaun on the lam. Daft? Yes, but heaven for musical theater lovers (2:25) St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'GOD OF CARNAGE'Yasmina Reza's farce about combustible parents in conflict, impeccably directed by Matthew Warchus. Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott make up the new set of brawlers.(1:30). Bernard Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'HAIR' (Tony Award for best musical revival.) Diane Paulus's thrilling, emotionally rich revival of the 1967 rock musical delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn't felt this season: the intense, unadulterated joy and anguish of that bipolar state called youth. A production that finds the complexity and deep ambivalence in a show people tend to remember as a feel-good free-for-all (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'HAMLET'Jude Law embodies the Prince of Denmark with lots of energy, many hand gestures and little modulation. Though the look of Michael Grandage's black-on-black production is chicly of the moment, its performances suggest what a 19th-century barnstorming production might have been like. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'MEMPHIS' In the city of the title in the 1950s, a pioneering white radio D.J. (the endearing Chad Kimball) falls in love with R&B music and one of its comely practitioners (the lovely Montego Glover) in this slick but essentially soulless musical written by David Bryan and Joe DiPietro (''The Toxic Avenger'') and fleetly directed by Christopher Ashley. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'NEXT TO NORMAL' No show on Broadway makes as direct a grab for the heart -- or wrings it as thoroughly -- as this brave, breathtaking musical. Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey's portrait of a manic-depressive suburban mom (the astounding Alice Ripley) and her family, directed by Michael Greif, isn't a feel-good musical. It's a feel-everything musical (2:20). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'OLEANNA' Doug Hughes's measured revival of David Mamet's confrontational drama from 1992, which stars the excellent Bill Pullman and a luminous Julia Stiles as a university professor and his combative student, pumps the play full of an air of thoughtfulness that paradoxically comes close to smothering it. Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'RAGTIME' Marcia Milgrim Dodge's appealingly modest interpretation of this 1998 musical about early-20th-century American growing pains, adapted from E. L. Doctorow's novel, finds an affecting, uneasy human soul within the work's panoramic sweep. This production doesn't disguise the work's hearty preachiness, but it elicits glimmers of delicate beauty (2:45). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'ROCK OF AGES' The Sunset Strip in the 1980s is the setting for this absurdly enjoyable jukebox musical weaving more than two dozen arena-rock hits from the glory years of MTV -- from Journey and Pat Benatar to Poison and Whitesnake -- into a story of heartbreak and warped-vinyl dreams. Big hair, songs that are trashy fun, fabulous cast (2:25). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'THE ROYAL FAMILY' This unevenly cast, sumptuous-looking revival of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's 1927 portrait of a theatrical dynasty takes a while to find its rhythms. But as a stage-addicted mother and daughter, Rosemary Harris and Jan Maxwell spin hokum into pure moonlight (2:40). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'SHREK THE MUSICAL' This musical cavalcade of storybook effigies, adapted from the animated film of the same title, can feel like 40 blocks' worth of a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, accompanied by an exhaustingly jokey commentary. But Brian d'Arcy James and the hypertalented Sutton Foster find a sweet, goofy chemistry as an ogre and a princess (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'A STEADY RAIN' Big names, little show. Keith Huff's 90-minute melodrama about Chicago cops, directed by John Crowley, is best regarded as a small, slightly wobbly pedestal on which two gods of the screen -- Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman -- may stand in order to be worshiped (1:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'SUPERIOR DONUTS' The new play from the ''August: Osage County'' author Tracy Letts is a warm-hearted, bile-free comedy about the friendship between an emotionally stunted ex-radical (Michael McKean) and the brash young man he hires to help out in the establishment of the title (Jon Michael Hill, in an exciting Broadway debut). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'WEST SIDE STORY' In a startlingly sweet revival of this epochal musical, Arthur Laurents trades insolence for innocence, with dividends and losses. If the Jets and the Sharks seem too cute to be true, the show's doomed lovers (played by Josefina Scaglione and Matt Cavenaugh) have rarely been more affecting. And as Anita, Karen Olivo is a stunner (2:35). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 46th Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'WISHFUL DRINKING'Carrie Fisher's brut-dry, deeply funny one-woman show allows you to see the world through the self-dissociating gaze of a child of Hollywood who has always lived in a fishbowl (2:20). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)20091119
 Off Broadway
 'AVENUE Q' Even without legs of their own, the singing hand puppets of this Tony-winning musical are still standing tall in their new Off Broadway digs. This ''Sesame Street''-style show about being young and jobless in New York remains fresh, in all senses of the word (2:15) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091119
 'THE BROTHER/SISTER PLAYS PART 1 & 2' Tarell Alvin McCraney's gorgeous trilogy of poetic plays, about hard lives in the bayou country of Louisiana, are pumped full of a senses-heightening oxygen. Directed by Tina Landau and Robert O'Hara, and acted by a rousingly good ensemble, these interconnected works are the product of that rare and great thing, an original artistic vision. (Part 1 is 2:00; Part 2 is 2:30.) Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20091119
 'CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND THE SPECIAL SERVICE/PANTALEON Y LAS VISITADORAS' Peruvian soldiers in the Amazon need female companionship, so Captain Pantoja enlists a whole corps of prostitutes, complete with cute, midriff-baring uniforms. This rousing, sexy and surprisingly sweet new musical could give bawdiness a good name. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation. Repertorio Espanol at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street , (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org. (Anita Gates)20091119
 'THE EMPEROR JONES' Ciaran O'Reilly's inspired, poetic production of Eugene O'Neill's short, brutal drama -- starring a wondrous John Douglas Thompson -- finds Jungian echoes of universal resonance in a work often perceived as a dated portrait of the black man's burden (1:10). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)20091119
 'IDIOT SAVANT' Some kind of wonderful. Richard Foreman's cheerful, mad and eminently sane exaltation of the world as a stage stars an antic and very skillful Willem Dafoe, as a rogue philosopher trapped in a play. Alenka Kraigher and Elina Lowensohn are his female supplicants and tormentors (1:20). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20091119
 'THE LADY WITH ALL THE ANSWERS'Judith Ivey, in a giant meringue of dark auburn hair, plays the syndicated advice columnist Ann Landers (a k a Eppie Lederer) in this genial solo play by David Rambo, set in 1975, when Eppie has to reveal to her dedicated readers that she's getting a divorce (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'LET ME DOWN EASY'Anna Deavere Smith's engrossing new show, drawing as usual on verbatim excerpts from interviews with a wide variety of subjects, addresses the power and the fragility of the human body and its susceptibility to disease. Most moving are the many voices discussing the harsh realities of death, and the possibility of finding grace in its shadow (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 246-4422, 2ST.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'LOVE, LOSS, AND WHAT I WORE' Or, shoes, bags and heartaches. A stuffed closet of comic or poignant stories, or both, collected by Nora and Delia Ephron, about women and their relationship to clothes. Featuring a rotating cast of five comics and actors. Westside Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'LOVE CHILD' Daniel Jenkins and Robert Stanton star in this rollicking two-hander, which they also wrote. It's a backstage story in which the two men play all the characters: a group of actors staging a ridiculous updating of Euripides, as well as a couple of overly loud audience members. No wigs or costume changes here: it's all in the tics and accents, and half the fun is seeing if you can keep up (1:20). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)20091119
 'NIGHTINGALE'Lynn Redgrave's imagined memoir of her maternal grandmother, Beatrice Kempson, examines the limitations and disappointments of women's lives with both frankness and empathy (1:30). City Center, Stage 1, 131 West 55th Street , (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)20091119
 'OR' Maggie Siff (''Mad Men'') plays the pioneering female writer Aphra Behn in Liz Duffy Adams's mock-Restoration comedy, which imagines Behn as one point in a love triangle also involving King Charles II (Andy Paris) and Nell Gwynne (Kelly Hutchinson). Frisky, funny and Smart (1:30). Women's Project Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'OUR TOWN' David Cromer strips away the folksy warmth in which Thornton Wilder's play is often saturated to reveal this classic's quietly mournful depths. This wonderfully intimate production puts a small audience smack in the middle of Grover's Corners (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village , (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'THE TOXIC AVENGER' A dopey, intermittently funny musical version of the cheapo Troma picture. A geek turned monster in New Jersey tears the limbs off evildoers while singing pop-rock anthems. The cast is fun, but Joe DiPietro's book and David Bryan's music are mostly mediocre (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'THE UNDERSTUDY'Julie White fabricates bountiful laughs from a sumptuous display of strained nerves in Theresa Rebeck's scattershot backstage comedy, which also stars Justin Kirk (''Weeds'') and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (''Saved by the Bell'') as actors on far different levels of the showbiz totem pole (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)20091119
 Off Off Broadway
 'THE SUPPER CLUB OF LOST CAUSES' Jim Farmer tells a fractured tale of faded glory in this look at a tattered supper club in Hawley, Pa., in the Poconos. The owner is odd, the waiter inept, the bandleader crazed, the two customers indifferent. And the goings-on are often pretty funny (1:25). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village , (212) 254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net. (Genzlinger)20091119

 'THE MARVELOUS WONDERETTES' At a 1958 prom, this jukebox musical's title characters sing hits of the era from a female perspective; they return at their 10-year reunion, weathered and wiser. For fanciers of the girl-group sound, the production is an utter charm bomb (2:00). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)20091119

 Last Chance
 'BROKE-OLOGY'; closes on Sunday. Nathan Louis Jackson's play, directed by Thomas Kail, is a well-observed but sluggish comedy-drama about two sons (the excellent Francois Battiste and Alano Miller) at war over who will care for their ailing father (the fine Wendell Pierce). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091119
 'CREATURE'; closes on Saturday. Heidi Schreck's absorbing new play about character and faith, loosely based on the life of Margery Kempe, a medieval Englishwoman who saw visions of Jesus and the Devil, is funny (but not Monty Python silly) and serious (but not leaden). The tight production is directed by Leigh Silverman and features a wonderful turn by Marylouise Burke as Juliana of Norwich (1:40). the Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo , (866) 811-4111, theatermania.com. (Rachel Saltz)20091119
 'CYMBELINE'; closes on Sunday. Six actors playing multiple characters and working with almost no scenery deliver a spunky version of this less familiar Shakespeare work, finding all the humor in the script and adding a bit of their own. The production, by Fiasco Theater, builds perfectly under the direction of Ben Steinfeld and Noah Brody to a dazzling, hilarious final 15 minutes (2:15). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa , (646) 845-9073, fiascotheater.com. (Genzlinger)20091119
 'LOVE, LINDA: THE LIFE OF MRS. COLE PORTER'; closes on Saturday. The jazz singer Stevie Holland tries, in a one-woman show, to tell and sing the story of the Porters' lives together, from the perspective of Linda Lee Porter. But the piece makes great demands of Ms. Holland, who barely has time to pause, and shortchanges the audience, which for the most part gets only bits and pieces of songs that cry out for full, lustrous renditions (1:00). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street , (212) 352-3101, lovelindathemusical.com. (Daniel M. Gold)20091119
 'THE NEW ELECTRIC BALLROOM'; closes on Sunday. Enda Walsh's macabre comedy, a distaff companion piece to ''The Walworth Farce,'' casts a weird, wonderful spell. Three sisters immured in their house in an Irish fishing village enact strange rites that keep them trapped in the sad past and protected from the painful present (1:15). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn , (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Isherwood)20091119
 'THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD'; closes on Sunday. A ponderous tone permeates this revival of J. M. Synge's shaggy-dog tale of the stranger whose boastful account of how he killed his dad turns him into a village hero in the lonesome west of Ireland. It also robs the play, the Pearl Theater's first production in its new Midtown home, of much of its sparkle and wit (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan , (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Wilborn Hampton)20091119
 'SAVANNAH BLACK AND BLUE'; closes on Sunday. Inside this play's dense torrent of biographical detail -- about the title character's rise in the New York Police department -- is a wonderful lead performance by the comely, charismatic Ciera Payton. But the overabundant plot threads almost overwhelm her. The Negro Ensemble Company, 244 West 54th Street, Suite 501, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Webster)20091119
 'THE VERGE'; closes on Saturday. Susan Glaspell's 1921 play is in good hands, as somewhat reimagined by the director Alice Reagan and Performance Lab (1:15). The Ontological-Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village , (212) 352-3101, ontological.com. (Claudia La Rocco)20091119
 'WHAT ONCE WE FELT'; closes on Sunday. Ann Marie Healy imagines a future without men or printed books in this confused, unsatisfying drama in Lincoln Center Theater's LCT3 series (1:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street , (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Isherwood)20091119

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20091119 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20091119
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20091119
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'WHO SHOT ROCK & ROLL: A PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY, 1955 TO THE PRESENT,' through Jan. 31. This entertaining exhibition presents more than 175 images of rock stars by 105 photographers. It includes album cover art, candid snapshots, publicity portraits and pictures of live performances. The downside is that only a few photographs rise to the level of fine art, and the general focus is on only the most famous and familiar musicians, from Elvis Presley to Kurt Cobain. There are some nice surprises, though, like a small Polaroid of Courtney Love on which she wrote a rude salutation. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091119
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'WATTEAU TO DEGAS: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE FRITS LUGT COLLECTION,' through Jan. 10. Ranging from Watteau and Fragonard to Ingres and Degas, 64 works from a celebrated Parisian repository offer a gratifying immersion in 18th- and 19th-century French draftsmanship. For urbanity, vivacity and technical merit, these artists remain in a league of their own. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20091119
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'KANDINSKY,' through Jan. 13. The Guggenheim is not exactly thinking outside the spiral with this sleek retrospective, but then the pioneering abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) is more than just its foundational artist. He is the angel in the architecture. His swirling, unanchored abstractions are implicit in Frank Lloyd Wright's great circling rotunda, and now they fill it, bottom to top -- a sensational sight that is as much Kandinsky-Wright reunion as retrospective. One of the fullest, clearest views of Kandinsky's achievement in decades, it certainly unmoors the conventional wisdom of precipitous decline after 1921, if not 1914. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20091119
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20091119
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'SERIZAWA: MASTER OF JAPANESE TEXTILE DESIGN,' through Jan. 17. Serizawa Keisuke (1895-1984), one of the most prominent Japanese artisans of the 20th century, transformed paper and fabric with intricate, hand-cut stencils. His art updated, and some might say elevated, centuries-old crafts with allusions to Korean folk art, Chinese calligraphy, Aesop's Fables, Indian miniatures and Western midcentury Modernism. This handsomely installed show includes an early artist's-book adaptation of ''Don Quixote,'' as well as curtains, screens and kimonos from Serizawa's mature and productive postwar years. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICAN STORIES: PAINTINGS OF EVERYDAY LIFE, 1765-1915,' through Jan. 24. This exhibition of 103 figurative paintings and portraits that the museum justifiably calls ''iconic'' spans the Colonial period to World War I, touching on issues like the settling of the West and the Civil War and its legacy. Many of the works are masterpieces by artists like John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt and George Bellows that will in all likelihood not be gathered together anytime soon. Others are little-known gems of genre painting; many more are less gemlike genre works full of plots, props and stilted emotions. The result is refreshingly evenhanded. Art historical viewpoints previously too often considered mutually exclusive -- pro-narrative versus pro-form -- are synthesized. The paintings benefit tremendously from the mix, as will your understanding of American art and history. A thrilling, illuminating show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE SAMURAI: JAPANESE ARMS AND ARMOR, 1156-1868,' through Jan. 10. This sumptuous exhibition alternates between extraordinarily gorgeous, intricately wrought suits of armor that count as some of the world's greatest works of multimedia art and an unprecedented gathering of some 60 bare sword blades whose Minimalist subtleties of line, proportion and surface form a show within a show. In between are amazing helmets; ornate sword mountings and fittings; scroll paintings of samurai dressed to kill; and the colorful surcoats they traditionally wore over their armor. Nearly all of the 200-plus works come from Japan's museums; about half have been designated National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties by the Japanese government. Because of their extreme fragility, not all objects will be on view at once: about 60 pieces will be replaced by similar objects of equal caliber during the first week in December. Visit early and often. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LOOKING IN: ROBERT FRANK'S ''THE AMERICANS,''' through Jan. 3. In the mid-1950s the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank made three long car trips from New York City across the United States, through the Deep South to California, and back again by a northern route, taking thousands of pictures as he went. He needed a year to develop, print and edit them down to the 83 that made up his classic book, ''The Americans,'' which was panned for its pessimism in his day, and sanctified for its political prescience since. The Met show, and the huge book that accompany it, are basically monuments to that monument. If ''The Americans'' looks more formulaic in its sentiments than it did 50 years, that is because it has had so many imitators and the country it captured has changed. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID,'' ' through Nov. 29. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WATTEAU, MUSIC, AND THEATER,' through Nov. 29. Informed by new research in music and theater, this show highlights the influence of the performing arts on paintings, drawings and prints by Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his contemporaries. It includes several elaborate fetes galantes and smaller works depicting actors and musicians, and cultivates an atmosphere of civilized hedonism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091119
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091119
 MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM: 'CEZANNE AND AMERICAN MODERNISM,' through Jan. 3. Including early works by Dove, Hartley, Gorky and more than 25 others, this fascinating show explores the art history-changing influence of Cezanne on American artists between 1907 and 1930. Nothing by the American artists looks as good as any of the 18 Cezannes on view, but the exhibition and its hefty, richly informative catalog are revelatory. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J. , (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091119
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO AND REVOLUTION: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 3. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. The nearly 80 works selected from the Morgan's own collection include excellent pieces by most of the era's best-known artists, from the Rococoists Watteau and Fragonard to Neo-Classicists like Jacques-Louis David and Etienne Louis Boullee. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20091119
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'WILLIAM BLAKE'S WORLD: ''A NEW HEAVEN IS BEGUN,'' ' through Jan. 3. Artist, poet and irritated ecstatic, William Blake listed as his primary residence the Imagination, a combination of creative command post and psychological refuge where, as he put it, the eternal and the real meet. You'll see a good amount of both in this show, drawn from the Morgan's deep holdings of Blake's hand-printed-and-painted books and from the entire series of 21 watercolor illustrations he made for ''The Book of Job.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)20091119
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived here in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, who served as a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20091119
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091119
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091119
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091119
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION,' through Feb. 15. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point, for many viewers, will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20091119
 NEW MUSEUM: 'URS FISCHER: MARGUERITE DE PONTY,' through Feb. 7. Naming his first American museum show after a fictional character from Mallarme, the young Swiss sculptor Urs Fischer spreads himself thin, but brilliantly. Admirers of his gaping holes in walls may be disappointed by the sparseness, quiet and subtlety, but for the most part -- despite too much Surrealism 101 -- Mr. Fischer's neo-Dada formalism wins out. Nose-thumbing irreverence colludes with Minimalist space, scale and perception. Take this three-floor show from the top and watch worlds collide: abstraction, found objects and trompe l'oeil; the actual-size, the large and the enlarged; images, reflections and volumes. Each floor is a kind of implosion, although it only becomes obvious on the lowest. The perpetual twilight in the middle may be the most memorable moment. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20091119
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24, 2010. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20091119
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20091119
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanchee, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu.

 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: ABSTRACTION,' through Jan. 17. The focus of this surprisingly surprising show is the first two decades of O'Keeffe's long career, beginning in 1915 when she made her first abstract drawings, which were also among the first fully abstract images by any American artist, and continuing into the 1930s, when she was spending increasing amounts of time alone in New Mexico. In between comes a body of bold, graphically punchy and sensuous painting that you tend to experience whole and fast, as you do a strong scent or a touch. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20091119
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'RONI HORN A K A RONI HORN,' through Jan. 24. Two floors is one floor too many for this late-phase Post-Minimalist. She is best represented here by some exquisite cast-glass sculptures, photographs of Iceland's extraordinary topography and several large drawings that combine aspects of carving, cartography and quilting. The catalog is even more elaborately stage-managed; the main take-away from the combination is that Ms. Horn's ostensibly androgynous (but actually butch) persona is her most engaging creation and that self-portraiture and language are her truest modes of expression. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20091119
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'MRS. DELANY AND HER CIRCLE,' through Jan. 3. This fascinating show celebrates the contributions of the exemplary 18th-century Englishwoman Mary Delany to botany, the decorative arts and English court society. A widow twice over with no children, Mrs. Delany thrived in middle and old age as a naturalist, amateur artist and close friend to Handel, Jonathan Swift and the Duchess of Portland, among others. The exhibition includes her drawings, silhouettes and floral embroidery, and a selection from the ''Flora Delanica'': a series of some 1,000 botanical collages, begun when she was 72. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba.

 Galleries: Chelsea
 MATTHEW RITCHIE: 'LINE SHOT,' through Dec. 2. It is hard to know if this artist is a genuine polymath or an ambivalent painter, unwilling to commit to his medium. The canvases in his latest New York gallery show are some of the best of his career. More abstract, they have a cosmic turbulence that is less obscurely narrative, more affectingly formal. His videos continue to impress, especially when used as stage sets; his sculptures increasingly just get in the way. It may be unnecessary, if not self-defeating, to show the different mediums together. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street , (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Smith)20091119

 BARRY X. BALL: 'MASTERPIECES,' through Dec. 12. A striking departure from the surrealistic heads for which Mr. Ball is known, this show replicates three Italian Late Baroque busts in different kinds of exotic stone using a combination of high-tech machinery and manual labor. Two glowing pieces represent ''Purity'' by Antonio Corradini, an image of a woman whose head and face are covered by a sheer veil. The third, based on ''Envy'' by Orazio Marinali, is a snarling, snake-haired Medusa. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley , (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Johnson)20091119
 'ICONS OF THE DESERT: EARLY ABORIGINAL PAINTINGS FROM PAPUNYA,' through Dec. 5. With their bold, diagrammatic compositions; finely coordinated colors; and dotted textures, paintings by indigenous Australians appeal to Western eyes trained to respond to abstraction and folk and so-called outsider art. The paintings in this excellent show are mostly from the 1970s, the early years of the modern Aboriginal painting movement. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20091119
 MIKE KELLEY AND MICHAEL SMITH: 'A VOYAGE OF GROWTH AND DISCOVERY,' through Nov. 30. This entertaining and thought-provoking exhibition features a six-channel video following Michael Smith, dressed as Baby Ikki in droopy diapers, bonnet and dark glasses, as he wanders around Burning Man, the weeklong celebration of all things psychedelic in the Nevada desert. With jungle-gym-like structures in the gallery and a towering junk-metal sculpture of Baby Ikki looming over all, the whole project represents Burning Man as a festival of infantilism. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20091119
 Last Chance
 EVELYNE AXELL: 'AXELL'S PARADISE: LAST WORKS (1971-72) BEFORE SHE VANISHED'; closes on Saturday. A few brave women took the representation of sexuality into their own hands in the 1960s. The Belgian painter Evelyne Axell (1935-72) was one. Made in glossy enamels, her colorful, Pop-psychedelic paintings of naked women in nature convey a kind of pastoral sexual utopianism. This small show of works that she produced in the two years before she died in a car accident makes a compelling case for a more extensive presentation of her regrettably brief career. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 28th Street, Chelsea , (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com. (Johnson)20091119
 MICHAEL WILLIAMS: 'UNCLE BIG'; closes on Sunday. On his second time out, this young painter's colorful, wood-grain-obsessed canvases raise the stakes. His informed if eccentric pictorial tactics hover in the vicinity of James Ensor and Roy DeForest (oh, look him up) and include bright-on-white wood-paneled spaces occupied and not; jigsaw puzzle extravaganzas figured or forested; and the occasional abstraction. The Revenge of the Regional Artists, Mr. DeForest included? Perhaps. Meanwhile, Mr. Williams is both true to himself and willing to mess around.

HEADLINE: A Permanent Theater Festival on Puget Sound

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
-- LIKE a reminder of theater's past, the face of the playwright August Wilson stares out from a gleaming glass door set in a 12-foot steel portal at the top of August Wilson Way here, a sloping side street behind the Seattle Repertory Theater.
 Mr. Wilson would often take smoke breaks near the spot while working at the theater, the only one in the nation that has produced his entire 10-play, 10-decade cycle about the African-American experience in the 20th century. While Mr. Wilson is often identified with the Hill District of Pittsburgh from his plays and childhood, he was one of many artists in recent decades who have been drawn to Seattle's creative and literary spirit, living here for more than a decade before he died in 2005. 
 The dedication of August Wilson Way last November was a big, festive deal for theater leaders and city officials, another moment in Seattle's history as a proud and meaningful theater town. The city's offerings have included productions of Broadway-bound musicals like ''Hairspray'' and ''Memphis'' at the 5th Avenue Theater; an acclaimed Children's Theater with broad appeal; and three other major theaters -- Seattle Rep, the Intiman Theater and ACT -- with year-round seasons that often include thoughtfully considered revivals and ambitious new works, sometimes nurtured by the theaters themselves.
 One of the pleasures of Seattle is the cultural common ground for tourists and theater lovers alike. 
 The larger theaters are located downtown or in the Seattle Center campus -- which are connected by the city's monorail -- and in between are a wealth of restaurants, museums, music clubs, and malls and boutique stores. And small- and medium-size theaters are scattered through the city. The proximity is a gift; it's easy to bike from a matinee at one theater to an evening show at another. Seattle Rep and the Intiman Theater are separated only by an access street and a bank of trees; they are located within Seattle Center, which includes amusement rides and the high-propulsion, highly enjoyable International Fountain that people of all ages run through in warm weather.
 ''One of the reasons I came to Seattle was because there's a theater scene here unlike most other cities,'' said Brian Colburn, managing director of the Intiman Theater, who moved here last year from the Pasadena Playhouse in Southern California. ''There's probably as much theater here as in the city of Los Angeles, but the population is one-sixth the size. You can walk from theater to theater here, meet friends or colleagues at a cafe.''
 That sort of communal, artsy spirit has long been identified with Seattle, of course, perhaps reaching its height during the grunge-rock era of the 1980s and early '90s of Nirvana and the Campbell Scott-Bridget Fonda movie ''Singles.'' Young people moved here to be part of the music or arts scene; some of them would join theater companies or even start their own.
 As I talked to artists and visited theaters here on a recent trip, some interesting truths about Seattle revealed themselves. The celebration of past greats like Wilson pointed up how the city is at a cultural crossroads today, between energetic artistic endeavors and recovery from the national economic upheaval that has battered arts institutions. 
 ''Seattle has always been a boom-bust town that suffered through the rise and fall of the dot-coms and then the economic fallout of 9/11,'' said Jerry Manning, Seattle Rep's producing artistic director. ''This city's theater community is a good prism to see this. We have incredible work going on right now, but we've also been trying for years to develop a real critical mass of theaters and artists here.''
 Live music, rock concerts and virtually every kind of instrumental sound can still be found here, but their equivalents in the theater world have taken something of a hit. Theater artists and producers are still mourning the loss of several small and midsize theaters like Alice B, Empty Stage and the Seattle Fringe theater festival, which were often praised for originality and sharply expressed viewpoints and had cultlike followings. 
 Seattle also no longer has the full-time attention of two widely admired theater directors, Daniel Sullivan (who ran Seattle Rep from 1981 to 1997) and Bartlett Sher, who is stepping down as the artistic director of Intiman in 2011. Mr. Sullivan established a program to nurture plays by writers ranging from the young Jon Robin Baitz to Arthur Miller, and his productions of Herb Gardner's ''I'm Not Rappaport'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Heidi Chronicles'' both of which transferred to Broadway and won Tony Awards for best play.
 But while some theater artists here may pine for good old days, Seattle still has more compelling theater than most cities its size, and the area's natural beauty is another reason to visit.
 Offbeat delights abound. Teatro ZinZanni, for instance, offers a five-course meal and a European-style cirque act, sometimes with aerial performing in the relatively small space. Another entertaining staple is ''The Twilight Zone: Live!,'' a long-running stage re-enactment of episodes from the Rod Serling series, at Theater Schmeater. Last winter the director Sheila Daniels staged a show with the city's Umo Ensemble called ''Rubble Women,'' about a group that cleared debris in Berlin after World War II. The show was in an unheated warehouse, and audience members were given blankets to keep warm. 
 Some of the theaters I visited also have new programs, like the Central Heating Lab at ACT, which holds readings and workshops of scripts in development and provides commissions to writers. ACT, which stands for A Contemporary Theater, has also made its sidewalk windows available to visual artists for displaying their work downtown.
 Given that ACT was on the verge of bankruptcy only a few years ago -- which sent shock waves through the theater world here -- the array of offerings at the theater recently are even more notable, like ''Das Barbecu'' (a comic adaptation of Wagner's Ring Cycle) and Tom Stoppard's ''Rock 'n' Roll.''
 ''Our ambition now is to be a hothouse of creativity, to force conversations and to create new literature for the stage,'' said Kurt Beattie, the artistic director of ACT. ''But we also want people to have a good time, to want to keep coming back.'' 
 Theatergoing tourists will have little trouble filling their downtime. Art aficionados can indulge their passions even at sleeping quarters like Hotel Max, which has more than 350 paintings and photographs by Seattle artists in the lobby, guest rooms and corridors. And the fish throwers at Pike Place Market and the ferries on Puget Sound are only blocks from the Peter Miller bookstore, a redoubt for architecture and design buffs.
 ''Two really interesting things I learned about Seattle when I moved here were, this city has fewer churches per capita than any major city, and more bookstores per capita than any major city,'' said Mr. Manning of Seattle Rep. ''You get on a bus and everyone has a book. It's a wonderfully literate town, which is fortunate for us in the theater.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Escapes pages on Friday about theater in Seattle, where the playwright August Wilson lived for more than a decade and worked at the Seattle Repertory Theater, misstated the history of the production of his 10-play cycle about African-American life in the 20th century. The Seattle Repertory Theater is not the only one in the nation to have produced the entire cycle. The article also misstated the name of one of the small and midsize theaters that have closed in Seattle. It was the Empty Space Theater, not the Empty Stage.

HEADLINE: As Delinquencies Soar, One in 10 Mortgages Is a Month or More Late

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The economy and the stock market may be recovering from their swoon, but more homeowners than ever are having trouble making their monthly mortgage payments, according to figures released Thursday.
 Nearly one in 10 homeowners with mortgages was at least one payment behind in the third quarter, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in its survey. That translates into about five million households.
 The delinquency figure, and a corresponding rise in the number of those losing their homes to foreclosure, was expected to be bad. Nevertheless, the figures underlined the level of stress on a large segment of the country, a situation that could snuff out the modest recovery in home prices over the last few months and impede any economic rebound. 
 Unless foreclosure modification efforts begin succeeding on a permanent basis -- which many analysts say they think is unlikely -- millions more foreclosed homes will come to market.
 ''I've been pretty bearish on this big ugly pig stuck in the python and this cements my view that home prices are going back down,'' said the housing consultant Ivy Zelman.
 The overall third-quarter delinquency rate is the highest since the association began keeping records in 1972. It is up from about one in 14 mortgage holders in the third quarter of 2008. 
 The combined percentage of those in foreclosure as well as delinquent homeowners is 14.41 percent, or about one in seven mortgage holders. Mortgages with problems are concentrated in four states: California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. One in four people with mortgages in Florida is behind in payments.
 Some of the delinquent homeowners are scrambling and will eventually catch up on their payments. But many others will slide into foreclosure. The percentage of loans in foreclosure on Sept. 30 was 4.47 percent, up from 2.97 percent last year.
 In the first stage of the housing collapse, defaults and foreclosures were driven by subprime loans. These loans had low introductory rates that quickly moved to a level that was beyond the borrower's ability to pay, even if the homeowner was still employed.
 As the subprime tide recedes, high-quality prime loans with fixed rates make up the largest share of new foreclosures. A third of the new foreclosures begun in the third quarter were this type of loan, traditionally considered the safest. But without jobs, borrowers usually cannot pay their mortgages.
 ''Clearly the results are being driven by changes in employment,'' Jay Brinkmann, the association's chief economist, said in a conference call with reporters. 
 In previous recessions, homeowners who lost their jobs could sell the house and move somewhere with better prospects, or at least a cheaper cost of living. This time around, many of the unemployed are finding that the value of their property is less than they owe. They are stuck. 
 ''There will be a lot more distressed supply entering the market, and it will move up the food chain to middle- and higher-price homes,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc.
 Many analysts say they believe that foreclosures, instead of peaking with the unemployment rate as they traditionally do, will most likely be a lagging indicator in this recession. The mortgage bankers expect foreclosures to peak in 2011, well after unemployment is expected to have begun falling.
 There was one sliver of good news in the survey: the percentage of loans in the very first stage of default -- no more than 30 days past due -- was down slightly from the second quarter. If that number continues to decline, at least the ranks of the defaulted will have peaked.
 ''It's arguably a positive, but it doesn't undermine the fact that there are still five or six million foreclosures in process,'' Ms. Zelman said.
 The number of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration that are at least one month past due rose to 14.4 percent in the third quarter, from 12.9 percent last year. An additional 3.3 percent of F.H.A. loans are in foreclosure.
 The mortgage group's survey noted, however, that the F.H.A. was issuing so many loans -- about a million in the last year -- that it had the effect of masking the percentage of problem loans at the agency. Most loans enter default when they are older than a year. 
 When the association removed the new loans from its calculations, the percentage of F.H.A. mortgages entering foreclosure was 30 percent higher. 
 The association's survey is based on a sample of more than 44 million mortgage loans serviced by mortgage companies, commercial and savings banks, credit unions and others. About 52 million homes have mortgages. There are 124 million year-round housing units in the country, according to the Census Bureau.

HEADLINE: After Other Hardships, Trying to Bounce Back From Unemployment

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
Once Andrea Combs sensed that layoffs were imminent, she went to her caseworker's office with a sense of purpose. 
 ''She said she wanted to revise her resume, so we went back and forth and revised it, so she was prepared even before she got laid off,'' recalled Mimi Watanabe, her caseworker at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service. 
 Sure enough, Ms. Combs's data entry position at a mail distribution company evaporated in August, along with 20 others. But she has dealt with that setback, as she has handled others her whole life. 
 Ms. Combs, 48, of Queens, was born with significant learning disabilities and had to study harder than her peers because of what she calls ''my perceptual and learning problems,'' including severe dyslexia. 
 She has trouble distinguishing certain letters -- an E on the eye chart looks like a U to her -- and when first presented with information, she has a hard time comprehending it. But once she absorbs a new skill through repetition, she does not forget it. 
 She began junior high school in special education, but her mother enrolled her in extracurricular reading programs at area colleges that gradually brought her in line with her peers. By the time she was a senior at Hillcrest High School in Jamaica, Queens, her special education days were behind her. 
 She held clerical positions at private companies and at government agencies like the Postal Service and New York City Transit, and when she was not working she enrolled at a technical school and studied computer programming and medical billing. 
 ''I always try to better myself,'' she said. 
 She was halfway through a course of study at Kingsborough Community College when she met her future husband, Kevin, on the E train. At first, she did not notice him staring, because her head was buried in her books. (''I have to work harder than everyone else,'' she said.) But when she continued to see him at different stops along the line she eventually gave him her number.
 Three years later they married, and they soon had two sons: Dwight, now 23; and Jesse, now 20. 
 But several years after they were wed, Kevin Combs fell into a diabetic coma and died at 33. Ms. Combs found herself a widow at 32. But she did what she had always done: She just kept going. 
 ''I didn't have a chance to grieve because of Jesse and Dwight,'' she said. ''I had to make sure they were O.K., so I just went on. I just did.''
 She worked as a public health assistant for the city, and in medical billing and data entry after that, until the recent pink slip put her on the unemployment rolls. For one month.
 In September, she was hired as a saleswoman at a Brooklyn Heights greeting card store. Her commute to work from her apartment in Hollis takes about 90 minutes, but a bigger obstacle was her wardrobe. 
 She needed business attire, so with $150 she received from the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she was able to get two sweaters, some dress pants and a dress blouse from Avenue and Target -- with her caseworker's help. 
 ''I preselected some of the clothes that would be suitable for her because I know her taste,'' Ms. Watanabe said as Ms. Combs showed off her recent purchases.
 Ms. Watanabe added that she had high hopes for Ms. Combs at her new position.
 ''Andrea is exceptionally competent, and very personable, with a good memory,'' she said.
 For that, Ms. Combs credits her mother, Lillie Bain, now in her 70s, who lives with her and Jesse.
 ''My mother always told me, even though you have a little hang-up, you shouldn't let it eat you inside. Because you can overcome it,'' Ms. Combs said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Got No Help From Hiring For Holidays

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The usual preholiday hiring by stores did not happen in October as New York City's unemployment rate held at 10.3 percent, its highest level in 16 years, the State Labor Department said Thursday. 
 The city's official unemployment rate remained slightly above the national rate, which rose to 10.2 percent last month, and well above the state's rate, which edged up to 9 percent in October, the department said.
 The only fields in the city that grew significantly last month were education and health services, which added a combined total of 21,600 jobs, said James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department. Otherwise, Mr. Brown said, ''the job market showed broad weakness.''
 Employers traditionally add to payrolls in the fall, but they have shown a reluctance to hire this year, despite proclamations from some government officials that the recession has ended. Stores, restaurants and hotels usually start taking on workers in September and October and shed them in January and February.
 But that pattern has been as weak this year as it was last year. The number of jobs in the retail trade in the city declined by 1,100 in October, Mr. Brown said.
 The leisure and hospitality sector ''lost jobs last holiday season and is doing slightly worse so far this year,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Unfortunately, this latest monthly report suggests that the city's job market remains quite weak, and Christmas hiring will be both late and subdued.''
 Mr. Brown does not adjust the city's job figures for the usual seasonal fluctuations, but Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist who does, said that, after those adjustments, October appeared to have been the city's worst month since December. 
 Ms. Denham, a chief economist for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment company, said that the city lost 15,600 jobs in October and had now lost more than 125,000 jobs during this downturn. The biggest losses last month came in construction, securities brokerages, restaurants and retail stores, according to Ms. Denham. 
 The number of unemployed city residents has averaged more than 413,000 for the past three months, a level it had not reached in more than 32 years of record keeping. The city's unemployment rate -- a measure of how many people are looking for jobs but are unable to find them -- has also been lifted by continuing growth of the city's labor force.
 The number of people working or looking for work in the city has remained above four million for almost all of 2009, up about 10 percent since the start of this decade. The labor force usually shrinks in a recession, as some people give up looking for jobs and are no longer counted. City officials point to the growing labor force as a sign of optimism about the local economy.
 The city's comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said the latest data reinforced a report his office released this week that showed that education and health care had grown steadily through the recession and should be nurtured as critical industries. ''It's time to take these sectors seriously as potential engines for our city's employment growth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Learning to Teach to Bridge the Achievement Gap

BYLINE: By PHIL YOST

 BODY:
Kathleen Martin stood in front of a white board covered with math problems, her class clustered at her feet. As they talked through the solutions together, the students repeated the headings over each problem on the board: ''Algebra and Function,'' ''Probability,'' ''Data Analysis.'' 
 ''So I see three addends here,'' said Mrs. Martin, in her third year of teaching, ''and I know I am going to find the sum.'' The children then call out the addends -- make that the numbers -- in unison. They are adding six, four and zero.
Mrs. Martin teaches first grade at Leroy Anderson Elementary School in San Jose, a regular public school. Of its 430 students, 90 percent receive subsidized lunches. For 70 percent, English is a second language and 70 percent are Hispanic. 
 Those can be the demographic ingredients for a watered-down curriculum and the excuses for academic failure. Indeed, four years ago Anderson was, academically, the worst elementary school in Santa Clara County, with the lowest score on California's Academic Performance Index. But when scores were released this fall, Anderson had jumped 136 points in a year, to 810 out of a possible 1,000. 
 Only a handful of Bay Area schools notched triple digit increases. In the past three years, Anderson's scores rose 206 points. 
 What is turbo-charging academics at this school? It is never easy to prove a cause-and-effect relationship in education, but three ingredients associated with success in other schools are at work: high expectations for everyone, constant assessment and family involvement. 
 Now, other schools are looking to Anderson for guidance in eliminating the so-called achievement gap between Hispanic and African-American students on one hand and whites and Asians on the other. 
 Anderson is bucking a disturbing trend in Santa Clara County: on California's 2009 Accountability Progress Report, which measures student performance, scores for Hispanic students in the county -- 715 -- fell further behind those of Hispanic students statewide. The gap this year was 19 points; last year it was 14. 
 Not surprisingly, given the affluence and high education levels in Silicon Valley, its overall scores exceed the statewide average. But many Hispanic students -- 37 percent of the school population -- are in danger of being left out of the ''knowledge economy.'' 
 Closing the gap is this generation's civil rights issue, said Charles Weis, superintendent of schools in Santa Clara County. ''We know what needs to be done; we know how to do it,'' Dr. Weis said at a rally for educational improvement. Yet, he added, ''educators are notoriously bad at adopting others' good ideas.'' 
 Anderson illustrates the potential and the challenge. Much as the school has improved, its A.P.I. score still falls just below the upper half of the county's elementary schools. While 71 percent of its students are proficient in math, only 53 percent are in reading and writing. 
 When Glen Ishiwata became superintendent of the Moreland School District in July 2006, he chose for Anderson a young new principal, Destiny Ortega, and assistant principal, Karen Allard. They overhauled the core instruction, tested all students to establish their skill levels and insisted on a can-do attitude. 
 The despairing mentality of ''What are we going to do with these kids?'' ended quickly, Mrs. Allard recalled. 
 Reading came first. ''My focus then,'' Mr. Ishiwata said, ''was on how early literacy should be taught.'' 
 Previously, reading ''was mainly textbook driven, the teacher in front of the whole class,'' said Mrs. Ortega, now 32. 
 ''We said the first two hours of the day with the kids needed to be focused on literacy,'' she continued, and that it include working in small groups. 
 On a recent day in Martha Borg's third-grade classroom, she asked three students to join her at a small semicircular table. While the other students worked in their notebooks or with tutoring programs on computers, the three sounded out some new words -- like ''natural,'' ''environment'' and ''tortoise'' -- and then read aloud as Mrs. Borg moved from one to the next. 
 Small groups are a part of all classes at Anderson, and students get small-group time with the teacher. ''The teachers help me a lot,'' said Brizia Arce, a fifth grader, ''and I understand more.'' 
 The groupings cluster students of similar skills, as determined by another practice the new leadership introduced: continual assessment. The assessments then guide individual instruction. 
 Anderson is not alone. One charter school with a similar student body, Rocketship Mateo Sheedy in central San Jose, scored 926. John Danner, the chief executive of Rocketship Education, said: ''The key is not the collection of data. It's how you translate that data into the way that teachers' classroom instruction changes.'' 
 Anderson also has put in place more computer-based instruction in reading and math, allowing children to learn at their own level and pace. ''The kids love it,'' said Terry Clavelli, a first-grade teacher. She can monitor their work not only by looking over their shoulders, but also through a report that the JiJi program, developed by the MIND Research Institute in Santa Ana, compiles. 
 BoardMath, the program Mrs. Martin uses, acquaints children with formal mathematical terminology in the first grade and beyond, but the familiar methods remain. Holding up her fingers, she kept the tally as children added five and three. 
 None of this works, Mrs. Ortega said, without ''believing that kids can and will learn.'' 
 Maritza Lauriano, a fifth grader, said students used to be ''nervous that we wouldn't pass the test'' but now took exams with confidence. 
 Anderson's academic makeover proceeded with the support of its teachers. ''They allow quite a bit of flexibility for us to be good teachers,'' said Katrina Rumbold, a fifth-grade teacher. ''At a school like this you work harder.'' Many teachers stay after school to tutor students needing extra help. 
 Anderson's staff members also work to include parents and assist them. At a class that meets three mornings a week, the mostly Spanish-speaking parents learn English, life skills and how to talk to teachers about their children. 
 One parent, Lucy Diaz, said through an interpreter that she attended ''to help my child with homework when he doesn't understand.'' 
 In the meantime, optimism is in the air. Anderson has been invited to apply for the state's Distinguished School designation. 
 Peg Batista, the bilingual secretary in Anderson's main office, reflected on her 16 years at the school, many of them when ''nothing was working.'' Now, Mrs. Batista said, ''the kids talk about how well they are doing.'' 
 As for parents, Eva Chesnut, the community liaison, said: ''They feel more comfortable. They feel more pride.''

HEADLINE: A Saudi Gamble to See if Seeds of Change Will Grow

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: THUWAL, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
The $12.5 billion question is this: Can Ben Frevert change Saudi Arabia? 
 Mr. Frevert is 22 years old. He is from Minneapolis. He had never set foot outside the United States until the day he flew to Saudi Arabia, where he became one of the first 400 graduate students to start classes at the sparkling new King Abdullah University of Science and Technology on the Red Sea.
 Mr. Frevert's presence in this conservative kingdom represents a bold, pricey gamble by Saudi Arabia's monarch, King Abdullah, who allocated about $10 billion to endow the university. The stated goal is to take a country that consistently ranks among the poorest performing nations in education and, with all the brain power and high-tech equipment oil money can buy, build a world-class research center and university. 
 But there is a less discussed, yet no less consequential, objective: Can the university help this tradition-bound society become more open to new ideas? Can it help Saudi Arabia stamp out the kind of homegrown extremism that has spawned terrorism?
 ''We wouldn't see change without having more things like this,'' said Awadh al-Badi, a political scientist at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh. ''My thought is that they are trying to create a parallel system that with time would take from others or balance what exists.''
 The first 400 students and 74 faculty members began studies in September, even as construction crews labored to ready the multibillion-dollar campus. In time, the university will be a small town of 20,000, cloistered behind three layers of security, in isolated luxury on the banks of the Red Sea. There will be a yacht club, a golf course, a movie theater (no theaters are allowed elsewhere in the kingdom), a town center with fast food and shops -- and there will be no rules against men and women working, studying and socializing together. On campus, women do not have to cover up and wear the baggy black gown, called an abaya, mandatory everywhere else in Saudi Arabia.
 Because of this, the university is in a rush, hoping to establish itself as a source of pride -- and perhaps revenue -- before conservative forces beyond its walls try to rein it in.
 Not long after the lavish opening ceremony with thousands of guests and dozens of heads of state, a member of the Saudi Council of Senior Scholars, an official body appointed by the king, criticized the university. Most of the uproar focused on his condemnation of ''mingling,'' which he called ''a great depravity.'' But the critic, Sheik Saad al-Shathry, also called for the creation of a religious committee to ensure that the curriculum was consistent with Islam.
 King Abdullah promptly, and with great effect, fired Sheik Shathry from the council. But at the university, some staff members and students said they were wondering how long they had before the king decided, for political expediency, that he must bow to the nation's powerful religious forces. 
 And what happens when the king is gone? He is 85, and it appears that the next in line is not Crown Prince Sultan, who has been out of the country for months after cancer treatment, but the interior minister, Prince Naif, whose political base has been the nation's conservative religious community. 
 ''We have a leader who is willing to take the furthest step, but is it a policy of the country or just the leader?'' asked Mr. Badi, the political scientist. ''That issue is not resolved.''
 And there is reason for concern. Even though the king fired Sheik Shathry, demonstrating his commitment to the university, his critics have not been silenced.
 ''Those voices calling for opening up are strange voices that do not represent public opinion,'' said Soliman al-Duwaish, a Saudi preacher who described the mingling of men and women at the university as a ''blemish'' on the king's ''dream.''
 The idea of trying to foster change by building enclaves like the university is not new. Even in an absolute monarchy, public sensitivities and political alliances cannot be ignored. So the leadership tries to promote change from the outside in. The royal family has relied on the outside-in approach for years. It has two pan-Arab newspapers in London and a satellite television station, Al Arabiya, in Dubai. Not far from the university, crews are building the King Abdullah Economic City, which like the university will allow residents to live a more Western life -- behind a cordon of security. And there is Aramco, the nation's oil company, which operates almost as another state and has been credited with liberalizing and modernizing eastern Saudi Arabia.
 But that, many people here say, is exactly the problem. Aramco changed its community but had little effect beyond that. 
 ''You cannot bring change from the outside, you have to build it from within,'' said Saleha M. Abedin, vice dean of a women's college, Dar al-Hekma, in Jidda, 50 miles away. ''All our programs and our curricula have sensitivity to local needs. It is not a totally foreign institution that doesn't realize the reality on the ground.'' 
 On campus at the university recently, Mr. Frevert, the student from Minneapolis, was in the library curled around his laptop. He had been there, he said, exactly two months and three days and had visited Jidda a few times. But when he had the chance to take time off, he said, he flew to Dubai.
 His parents, he said ''were a little freaked out'' when he decided to study in Saudi Arabia. But he was enticed by the financial aid and the adventure. The kingdom paid for the last two years of his undergraduate education and, as it does for all its students, waived tuition, provided free room and board and gave him a stipend. Mr. Frevert said he was studying solid state optics, and while obligated to complete his master's degree, he said he had already decided that he would be heading back to the United States for his Ph.D.
 ''My mother will sleep better, at last,'' he wrote in a recent blog entry.

HEADLINE: Saints at a Cultural Crossroads

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
At monasteries on Mount Athos in northern Greece, you wake in the night to the sound of Greek Orthodox monks chanting Byzantine prayers. It's an unforgettable sound, distant and unearthly, but also inside you, like a buzz in the blood.
 The painter Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, almost certainly heard it growing up far to the south on the island of Crete. You can hear it today when you visit ''The Origins of El Greco: Icon Painting in Venetian Crete,'' a lustrous exhibition at the Onassis Cultural Center in Midtown Manhattan.
 With its extraordinary ensemble of almost 50 religious images, most of them painted on Crete -- seven by El Greco and some of the rest by artists whose names are not known -- the show is essentially a dual-purpose visual essay. On the one hand it roughs out the texture of a specific, cosmopolitan, East-meets-West island culture. On the other it tells the story of a great artist who emerged from that culture, lived outside it and lastingly belonged to it. 
 At the time of El Greco's birth, in 1541, Crete had been a preserve of Byzantine tradition for a hundred years, since the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, and a colonial possession of Venice for more than three centuries. Most of the population was Greek Orthodox, but economic power was in the hands of a Roman Catholic minority. Local artists necessarily catered to both, turning out Byzantine-style icons for one, late Gothic devotional paintings for the other and, increasingly, synthesizing the two modes. 
 The show opens with an example of Byzantine art in something like a pure form: a large 14th-century image (unsigned, as many of these paintings are) of Christ Pantokrator, or All Powerful, modeled after an older icon preserved in the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. It's a classic of its kind, an egg tempera painting on a wood panel of a bust-length male figure, dressed in royal purple, against a gilded ground.
 The figure is half-abstract. The bearded face, set on a brawny neck, is a dainty oval topped by a turban of pulled-back hair. The nose is thin, a long droplet of flesh; the mouth, with its coral-pink lips, is minute, unsuited for eating or speaking. The eyes -- large, shadowed and radiating fine stress lines -- are the central feature. They look impassively at or past us, as we look into them. In the context of a church or monastery, a two-way connection between icon and worshiper is assumed.
 No doubt for some viewers, the much-reproduced Pantokrator image more or less defines icons as a genre: conservative and limited in variety. But the show, organized by Anastasia Drandaki, curator of the Byzantine collection at the Benaki Museum in Athens, demonstrates otherwise. 
 The Virgin, for example, appears in several guises: as a nursing mother, as the mourner of an adult child, as a corpse shrouded in ultramarine and about to be beamed up to heaven. Saints come in many picturesque forms and types. In a sparkling little panel, two spun-gold soldier-saints, wearing chain-mail miniskirts, do their martial thing: one skewers a dragon, the other pins the emperor Julian the Apostate like a bug to the ground.
 A depiction of the death of St. Sabas is set in a craggy landscape dotted with hermits' caves and painted in a Tuscan, or maybe Persian, palette of pink, orange and bread-crust brown. Aged and infirm monks -- one riding a lion, another hunched in a litter, a third crawling on the ground -- approach the saint's prone body. Their faces are painstakingly detailed; his is gone entirely, worn away by the kisses of worshipers over the centuries. 
 By the time this picture was done in the second half of the 15th century, painting in Crete had moved far beyond categories like Byzantine and Gothic. Artists had absorbed Renaissance naturalism and were pushing toward Mannerism, inventing, stealing and collaging motifs as they went. In a ''Pieta,'' on loan from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the figures of Jesus, Mary and St. John are straight-up Giovanni Bellini plunked down on a plain gold ground. Is the painting Cretan or Venetian? Your call.
 In Crete, an art-star system, long in place in Italy, came into vogue. Many early pictures went unsigned, but as painting grew more cross-culturally idiosyncratic, names appeared. Artists like Angelos, Andreas Pavias and Nikoloas Tzafouris enjoyed considerable celebrity, as did the home-grown Mannerist Georgios Klontzas, whose fantastically seething miniaturist cosmologies are among the show's highlights. By 1584, Michael Damaskenos, who was a big deal in Venice, had returned to Crete to be a big deal there, perfecting a Byzantine-Renaissance synthesis that sold like hot cakes and spawned countless imitators.
 Where was Domenikos Theotokopoulos in all of this? He was in the cosmopolitan thick of things. Until around 1567, when he was in his mid-20s, he stayed in Crete and thrived. Not much of his output from that period survives, but a few things do, and they are fascinating documents of an ambitious career on the move.
 A small, beat-up ''Dormition of the Virgin,'' which some scholars take to be his earliest known work, is standard-issue Byzantine, with foreign intrusions. Italianate angels parachute into the scene; a fancy gold candlestick with figures of female nudes sits indecorously front and center in what is, after all, a funeral. 
 The painting dates to sometime before 1567, when El Greco left -- permanently, it turned out -- for Venice. He may have spent time with Titian there. He certainly looked hard at the master's painting and at Tintoretto's, and then at Michelangelo's and Parmigianino's when he got to Rome in 1570. Bits of all of them stew around in a murky painting of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' that most likely belongs to the Roman stay. 
 He moved on to Spain with great hopes: King Philip II was a big fan. But then, for some reason, he wasn't. What happened? Most likely the artist's peculiar style -- Mannerist extravagance laced with island-art gumbo -- didn't fly after all at court, where suavity usually tends to be rewarded. So he ended up working for churches, the institutions that had hired him in the first place in Crete. And the icon painter in him gradually resurfaced.
 We see it in the very last painting in the show, a 1603 oil study for a ''Coronation of the Virgin'' commissioned by the Hospital of Charity in the town of Illescas. The composition has an iconlike symmetry. The figures, in their expressive abstraction, are as much Byzantine as Mannerist. And the picture scintillates with light, illusionistically painted rather than reflected from gold. Even cherubs tumbling around like kittens can distract from the picture's nuclear focus: this is an image meant to promote, as music can, time-suspending, space-vivifying contemplation.
 Exactly this psycho-sensual dynamic lies at the heart of how icons, as spiritual utensils, function. I wish the exhibition made something of this; had taken, as its third theme, the reality of these objects, not just as historical artifacts illustrating the progress of a culture or a famous career, but also as living and interactive energy sources, designed to embody and radiate charisma.
 But that's a major subject. It needs a full-dress show of its own. Maybe some day we'll get it. In the meantime this one has some of the most enwrapping and enrapturing art in town, framed by alert scholarship, a lambent environment (the installation design is by Daniel Kershaw), and a score of Byzantine music, arranged and performed by the Greek ensemble En Chordais, that will soak into your system and stay there. Miraculously, admission to all of this is free.

HEADLINE: University Of California Drops New Museum Plan

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The University of California, Berkeley, has decided to scrap its ambitious designs for a new Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, saying that it has been unable to raise enough money, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The building, to have been designed by Toyo Ito and estimated to cost from $143 million to $200 million, was to be constructed in downtown Berkeley and replace the museum's current on-campus home, which was declared seismically unsafe a decade ago. Lawrence Rinder, the museum's director, told the newspaper that the decision was a consequence of the economic downturn. The museum's capital campaign, whose goal was $200 million, raised only $81 million by this month. ''The gap was just too great, looking forward,'' Mr. Rinder said. The museum hopes to announce another plan by early January. ''While architectural plans are changing,'' Robert Birgeneau, the university's chancellor, said in a statement, ''the goal of building a dynamic, welcoming and seismically safe new museum downtown is not.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Economic Indicators Weaker Than Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A private forecast of economic activity over the next six months edged up less than expected in October, signaling slow growth next year. 
 The Conference Board says its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 percent last month. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a gain of 0.5 percent.
 The index climbed 1 percent in September.
 The Conference Board forecasts economic activity by measuring claims for jobless benefits, stock prices, consumer expectations, building permits for private homes, the money supply and other data.
 On the jobs front, the number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment insurance was unchanged last week, while those continuing to claim benefits declined.
 The Labor Department said first-time claims for jobless benefits were a seasonally adjusted 505,000, the same as the previous week's revised figure and matching analysts' expectations.
 The four-week average, which smoothes out volatility, fell for the 11th straight week to 514,000, the lowest level in almost a year.
 Economists closely track initial claims, which are considered a gauge of the rate of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire new workers.
 The number of people continuing to claim benefits fell by 39,000 to 5.61 million.

HEADLINE: The Big Squander

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Earlier this week, the inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a k a, the bank bailout fund, released his report on the 2008 rescue of the American International Group, the insurer. The gist of the report is that government officials made no serious attempt to extract concessions from bankers, even though these bankers received huge benefits from the rescue. And more than money was lost. By making what was in effect a multibillion-dollar gift to Wall Street, policy makers undermined their own credibility -- and put the broader economy at risk.
 For the A.I.G. rescue was part of a pattern: Throughout the financial crisis key officials -- most notably Timothy Geithner, who was president of the New York Fed in 2008 and is now Treasury secretary -- have shied away from doing anything that might rattle Wall Street. And the bitter paradox is that this play-it-safe approach has ended up undermining prospects for economic recovery. For the job of fixing the broken economy is far from done -- yet finishing the job has become nearly impossible now that the public has lost faith in the government's efforts, viewing them as little more than handouts to the people who got us into this mess. 
 About the A.I.G. affair: During the bubble years, many financial companies created the illusion of financial soundness by buying credit-default swaps from A.I.G. -- basically, insurance policies in which A.I.G. promised to make up the difference if borrowers defaulted on their debts. It was an illusion because the insurer didn't have remotely enough money to make good on its promises if things went bad. And sure enough, things went bad.
 So why protect bankers from the consequences of their errors? Well, by the time A.I.G.'s hollowness became apparent, the world financial system was on the edge of collapse and officials judged -- probably correctly -- that letting A.I.G. go bankrupt would push the financial system over that edge. So A.I.G. was effectively nationalized; its promises became taxpayer liabilities.
 But was there any way to limit those liabilities? After all, banks would have suffered huge losses if A.I.G. had been allowed to fail. So it seemed only fair for them to bear part of the cost of the bailout, which they could have done by accepting a ''haircut'' on the amounts A.I.G. owed them. Indeed, the government asked them to do just that. But they said no -- and that was the end of the story. Taxpayers not only ended up honoring foolish promises made by other people, they ended up doing so at 100 cents on the dollar.
 Could things have been different? Some commentators argue that government officials had no way to force the banks to accept a haircut -- either they let A.I.G. go bankrupt, which they weren't ready to do, or they had to honor its contracts as written.
 But this seems like a naive view of how Wall Street works. Major financial firms are a small club, with a shared interest in sustaining the system; ever since the days of J.P. Morgan, it has been common in times of crisis to call on the big players to forgo short-term profits for the industry's common good. Back in 1998, it was a consortium of private bankers -- not the government -- that put up the funds to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
 Furthermore, big financial firms have a long-term relationship, both with the government and with each other, and can pay a price if they act selfishly in times of crisis. Bear Stearns, the investment bank, earned itself a lot of ill will by refusing to participate in that 1998 rescue, and it's widely believed that this ill will played a major factor in the demise of Bear Stearns itself, 10 years later.
 So officials could have called on bankers to offer a better deal, for their own sake, and simultaneously threatened to name and shame those who balked. It was their choice not to do that, just as it was their choice not to push for more control over bailed-out banks in early 2009.
 And, as I said, these seemingly safe choices have now placed the economy in grave danger.
 For the economy is still in deep trouble and needs much more government help. Unemployment is in double-digits; we desperately need more government spending on job creation. Banks are still weak, and credit is still tight; we desperately need more government aid to the financial sector. But try to talk to an ordinary voter about this, and the response you're likely to get is: ''No way. All they'll do is hand out more money to Wall Street.''
 So here's the real tragedy of the botched bailout: Government officials, perhaps influenced by spending too much time with bankers, forgot that if you want to govern effectively you have retain the trust of the people. And by treating the financial industry -- which got us into this mess in the first place -- with kid gloves, they have squandered that trust.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Politics Take On a Familiar, Nationalist Tone

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
 -- These days, politics here look more and more like a movie Pakistanis have seen before. 
 Anti-Americanism is peaking. Enemies of the state lurk around every corner, if the nationalist media is to be believed. President Asif Ali Zardari could hardly be more unpopular. Political insiders make a sport of handicapping how long it will be before he falls. 
 It is a familiar plot line. The question on Pakistani minds now is whether the movie will end differently this time. It is an increasingly urgent concern in a country where no elected civilian government -- undone by its own vices and undercut by a powerful military and intelligence establishment -- has ever survived a full term. 
 The last time Pakistan was in this situation was in the early 1990s, when the United States was fighting a war in the Persian Gulf and Nawaz Sharif, then the prime minister, and Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, were accused of corruption and traitorous sellouts to Pakistan's archenemy, India. 
 What followed is history: a decade of weak civilian governments that changed almost with the seasons and, in 1999, a coup by Pervez Musharraf, a general, whose rule lasted for nine years. The events were part of the pattern of weak civilian governments punctuated by military coups that Pakistan has lived through for nearly all of its 62 years.
 This time it is President Zardari who is in the hot seat. Many blame him for creating his troubles. Corruption cases, which he says are politically motivated, dog him from past and present. He has needlessly antagonized his political opponents. He has linked himself to the Americans in ways that the military establishment has found both threatening and humiliating. 
 A case in point is the American aid bill last month that allocated billions of dollars for civilian use, a first in the history of relations between the countries. The uproar it created, which included a public protest by the military, tore through the Pakistani establishment with a vigor that surprised both American officials and members of the Zardari government.
 While there is no doubt that Mr. Zardari has brought much of the trouble on himself, his situation is also part of a recurring struggle, noted Aasim Sajjad, an assistant professor of political economy at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. 
 ''It's a story of a military that's so bloated and so completely used to having a total monopoly on the affairs of the state,'' he said. ''All they have to feel is a very minute threat to respond in a very defensive way.''
 The military has long had poisonous relations with Mr. Zardari's party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, whose founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, so frightened the establishment with promises of reform that he was deposed by the military and executed in 1979.
 That history remains raw, and the animosities and distrust between the governing Pakistan Peoples Party and the military provide the backdrop to the country's narrative of instability today. 
 But that does not mean the military wants to run the country again. ''Memories of military rule are very fresh,'' said Ahsan Iqbal, an opposition lawmaker. ''People have seen that it is not the solution.''
 Najam Sethi, editor in chief of The Friday Times, a Pakistani weekly, argues that the nationalist upswell is part of a more general expression of angst. The hopes of the 2008 election -- which restored civilian government after nearly a decade of military rule -- have fallen flat.
 ''There is a feeling of impotence, frustration and anger all around, and Zardari is on the receiving end,'' Mr. Sethi said. 
 Successive civilian governments have found themselves in similar positions. The party system is built on feudal patronage rather than service to citizens, perpetuating incompetence, indifference, callousness and corruption. 
 Defenders of the politicians argue that they have never been given enough time in power to improve their stewardship or to be punished by voters.
 The military and intelligence establishment remains unassailable. It is both revered and feared by Pakistanis, who suspect its nationalist fringes of maneuvering behind the scenes, with help from allies in the news media, to keep civilian governments off balance. 
 At the same time, the news media today need little prodding, and are more diverse, powerful and nationalistic of their own accord than at any other point in the nation's history. 
 ''The media has a larger-than-life role,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States. ''It's been setting the agenda for the country.''
 Pakistanis themselves are not entirely comfortable with that development. In a Gallup Pakistan poll released last Friday, nearly one-third of 2,765 Pakistanis surveyed blamed the media for political instability in the country, according to the Gilani Research Foundation, which released it.
 The anti-Americanism is part of that new media explosion. ''It reached a fever pitch,'' said Madiha Sattar, a journalist with the monthly magazine The Herald, who wrote a cover article on the topic in October.
 At times, it feels menacing. Newspapers have published the local addresses of American diplomats, and identified the director of a nonprofit group as ''a Canadian Jew,'' in an article about a visa blacklist. 
 Some of that tone, which also contains deep strains of anti-Semitism, comes from a national education system that was put into place by the dictator Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, whose textbooks and ideology were aggressively Islamist and ultranationalist.
 ''The state-supported Islamist-jihadi politics of the last 30 years has had a profound impact on the mind-set of the new urban middle classes,'' Mr. Sethi said. ''This mind-set is anti-U.S., anti-India. It's a jihadi-nationalist mind-set.''
 But there are concrete reasons for the anger, too, he said. First among them are America's wars in the region, a sentiment reflected in another Gallup Pakistan poll, released in August, which found that a majority of Pakistanis saw the United States as the biggest threat to Pakistan, far more than the percentages naming India or the Taliban. 
 Other sources of the anger spring from the complex history the two countries share. Almost any Pakistani can recite the narrative: in its obsession with the cold war, the United States showered General Zia with aid, even though he had crushed Pakistan's progressives and executed a popularly elected leader in Mr. Bhutto. 
 Then, when the cold war ended, the United States abandoned the region and imposed sanctions on Pakistan for its nuclear program. 
 So how will this story end? Mr. Zardari's political survival looks increasingly tenuous. Pakistan's Supreme Court is scheduled this month to consider the constitutionality of a decree giving politicians immunity from corruption cases. Its powerful chief justice, invigorated from a power struggle with Mr. Zardari in the spring, is not expected to be gentle. 
 Mr. Sajjad believes the plot will only be repeated, until a critical mass of Pakistanis with progressive politics coalesces to counter the ultranationalist right-wing voices. 
 ''It's a jumble,'' he said. ''The right presents a simple explanation and people accept it.''

HEADLINE: A Crown Jewel of Education Struggles With Cuts in California

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
As the University of California struggles to absorb its sharpest drop in state financing since the Great Depression, every professor, administrator and clerical worker has been put on furlough amounting to an average pay cut of 8 percent. 
 In chemistry laboratories that have produced Nobel Prize-winning research, wastebaskets are stuffed to the brim on the new reduced cleaning schedule. Many students are frozen out of required classes as course sections are trimmed. 
 And on Thursday, to top it all off, the Board of Regents voted to increase undergraduate fees -- the equivalent of tuition -- by 32 percent next fall, to more than $10,000. The university will cost about three times as much as it did a decade ago, and what was once an educational bargain will be one of the nation's higher-priced public universities. 
 Among students and faculty alike, there is a pervasive sense that the increases and the deep budget cuts are pushing the university into decline. 
 The budget cuts in California, topping $30 billion over the last two years, have touched all aspects of state government, including health care, welfare, corrections and recreation. They have led to a retrenchment in state services not seen in modern times, and for many institutions, including the state university system, have created a watershed moment.
 The state's higher education budget has been slashed by $2.8 billion this year, including $813 million from the university system -- about the equivalent of New Mexico's entire higher education budget. 
 ''Dismantling this institution, which is a huge economic driver for the state, is a stupendously stupid thing to do, but that's the path the Legislature has embarked on,'' said Richard A. Mathies, dean of the College of Chemistry here at Berkeley, long the system's premier campus. ''When you pull resources from an institution like this, faculty leave, the best grad students don't come, and the discoveries go down.''
 As the litany of cuts continues, there is a growing worry that senior faculty members may begin to defect. In fact, some colleges around the nation have begun identifying funds to use to recruit U.C. professors.
 Since California adopted a master plan for higher education in 1960, the state has been, in the words of the historian Kevin Starr, ''utopia for higher education.'' Eight of the 10 University of California campuses -- all but Merced and San Francisco -- are in the top 100 in this year's U.S. News & World Report's rankings. But maintaining that edge, without resources, is difficult.
 In 2004, international rankings by the London-based Times Higher Education named Berkeley the No. 2 research university in the world, behind only Harvard. This year, Berkeley plummeted to No. 39, mostly because of its high faculty-to-student ratio. The other international rankings, by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, rated Berkeley No. 3 this month. 
 Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a nonpartisan group that promotes access to higher education, said that while public universities in many states were facing financial problems, California was in a class by itself. 
 ''In most states, it's the economy, and you can say that in a couple of years, it will bounce back,'' Mr. Callan said. ''But in California, it's really part of a significant retrenchment of the whole public sector. If the perception is that it's going to be chronic, and people give up on California, the pre-eminence of Berkeley and U.C.L.A. would be in danger.'' 
 No wonder, then, that people like Bruce Fuller, a Berkeley professor of education and public policy, are asking themselves whether it is time to move on. 
 As co-director of the Institute for Human Development, an interdisciplinary research group that suffered big cuts, Mr. Fuller worries that the unit is losing its intellectual excitement and its ability to support his grant proposals. Then, too, he lost his two best graduate students last year to Stanford.
 ''To stay on top, you need to be bringing in new people,'' Mr. Fuller said. ''And I'm not sure how many of my most stimulating colleagues will still be here in three years.''
 So although he was not swayed last year when the University of North Carolina came calling, Mr. Fuller said, he may be more receptive this year. 
 Formerly taboo ideas, like allowing U.C.L.A. and Berkeley to charge substantially more than other campuses, or even eliminating the research mission at some of the newer campuses, are being put forward. Many here seem to be in a state of shock that things have been allowed to get so bad at one of the nation's leading public research universities, one with a long tradition of excellence. Berkeley faculty, past and present, have won 21 Nobel prizes. And last month, two of the 24 MacArthur fellowship grants went to a Berkeley computer scientist and a molecular biologist.
 Students, professors and union workers alike say the state's 20 percent cutback in financing imperils the system's ability to provide a top-quality education to all qualified California students, particularly those from low-income families, who make up almost a third of the university's student body. 
 Mark Yudof, the university system president, has created a commission that will make recommendations next spring on the future size and shape of the system. Just about everything seems to be on the table. There is even talk of creating an online ''11th U.C. campus,'' to bring in new revenue by offering courses -- and degrees -- to qualified students in other states and countries. 
 As support from the state dwindles, it is inevitable that the university will begin to look more like a private institution. The proportion of out-of-state students will rise next year: at Berkeley, almost a quarter of the freshmen admitted for next year will be international or out-of-state students. 
 And, as at private universities, student fees are rising rapidly, balanced, in large part, by bigger aid packages for low- and middle-income students. Across the 10 campuses, instructional budgets are being reduced by $139 million, with 1,900 employees laid off, 3,800 positions eliminated and hiring deferred for nearly 1,600 positions, most of them faculty. 
 Mr. Yudof rejects suggestions to retrench, like adopting a two-tiered system in which the Santa Cruz, Riverside and Merced campuses would be teaching institutions and no longer focus on research.
 ''My mission is to defend, protect, enhance and grow the University of California,'' Mr. Yudof said. He added that he hoped the current measures would be enough to get the system back on track. 
 But that may not be the case. Just to fend off further cuts, he said, the state will need to add nearly $900 million to the university's budget next year. 
 Whatever that budget looks like, Mr. Yudof said, there will be no more furloughs. ''It's too demoralizing,'' he said. 
 This year, the University of Texas lured three senior faculty members from the University of California, among them William F. Hanks, and his wife, Jennifer Johnson-Hanks, both anthropologists. 
 ''Last spring, when we made the decision, there were issues, but the budget hadn't quite slammed down to the extent it has since then,'' Mr. Hanks said. ''It looks a lot bleaker now.
 ''But in our case, it wasn't so much wanting to leave Berkeley as wanting to come to U.T. Surprisingly, there's more intellectual excitement and dynamism here. The department is growing and expanding, and we're part of a cohort of new people, which is a fabulous feeling, fraught with potential.'' 
 Meanwhile, back in his old department at Berkeley, things are tight -- and no replacements can be hired. ''Our biological anthropology course, which is required for psych majors, used to be offered every semester,'' said Meg Conkey, an archeology professor, ''and now it's just spring semester, and probably there will be students who don't get in. 
 ''We just don't have as many people to draw from, and we're likely to have three retirements coming up,'' she said. For undergraduates, the budget cuts are creating new strains about graduating in four years. Classes will be larger and teaching assistants fewer, and already, dozens of students have been unable to register for sections of introductory chemistry courses. 
 ''Last semester, I couldn't get into a lab section for Chem 3A,'' said Nawal Siddiqui, a bioengineering major who hopes to go to medical school. ''So now I'm taking Chem 3B lectures, with the labs for Chem 3A. It's kind of hard.'' 
 The chancellor of Berkeley, Robert J. Birgeneau, expresses optimism that more money can be saved without cutting into the educational muscle of the university. ''If the budget doesn't get worse,'' he said, ''we can recover in two years.''
 Dr. Birgeneau tells of a recent meeting with a student leader, who said students were most unhappy about the decision to end Berkeley's tradition of keeping the library open 24 hours during finals, and an hour later, a parent meeting where he mentioned that complaint -- and immediately got a $30,000 pledge to pay for round-the-clock library access during finals. 
 ''If they keep cutting, it'll take us longer to recover,'' Dr. Birgeneau said. ''But Berkeley can always recover.''

Meanwhile, the University of California Board of Regents has nearly tripled average student fees in the last decade . . . . . . while state support for the University of California system has declined substantially.

HEADLINE: Indexes Fall as Rising Dollar Lures Investors

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street shares slid sharply on Thursday as a stronger dollar lured investors away from riskier stock markets and commodities like gold and oil.
 Relatively bright economic reports did little to quell nervousness over the health of the broader economy, leaving traders wondering whether the momentum behind a remarkable stretch of gains, with the major indexes touching 13-month highs this week, was sustainable.
 The losses were broad-based but most severe in financial, technology and energy stocks, which are subject to changes in the price of commodities like metals and petroleum. 
 In the last eight months, the weak dollar has helped propel a dazzling rally in the stock markets, as investors moved their assets into riskier equity markets in the hope of higher returns. Persistently low interest rates in the United States have made the dollar a less lucrative investment, but on Thursday, investors were snapping up the currency, sending stocks tumbling.
 At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 93.87 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,332.44. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 14.9 points, or 1.34 percent, to 1,094.90 -- its biggest drop this month.
 The Nasdaq composite index also had its biggest decline of the month, falling 36.32 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,156.82, after Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgraded its assessment of eight chip makers. Intel fell 4 percent and Texas Instruments fell 3.4 percent.
 Jason D. Pride, director of research at Haverford Investments, said Thursday's sell-off reflected deeper concern over the pace of economic recovery.
 ''Now we're getting to the point where truly the market needs to see meat, more so than just a little bit of a flash of meat,'' he said. ''Any time a piece of information comes out that suggests that we don't have a truly sustainable recovery yet, the market backs off.''
 Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said traders were also looking to cash in on the year's strong performance.
 ''It's about a healthy and overdue profit-taking,'' he said. ''The hedge funds and investment managers are trying to move into hibernation mode from now to the year-end. A lot have had great years, and they really want to reduce risk.''
 The dollar, which in recent weeks has dropped to 15-month lows, posted gains against world currencies, hovering above $1.49 against the euro.
 The bond market benefited from the dollar's gains, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note climbing 7/32 to 100 10/32. The yield was 3.34 percent, down from 3.36 percent late Wednesday.
 Gold fell to $1,144.60 an ounce, down from $1,145.50 on Wednesday, and copper fell 3 cents, to $3.08 a pound. Oil dropped to $77.46 a barrel, from $79.58 on Wednesday.
 Investors seemed indifferent to a Labor Department report suggesting the rate of layoffs in the United States was slowing as the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week held steady, meeting expectations. 
 Over all, the number of people continuing to claim benefits fell by 39,000 to 5.61 million the week before, slightly worse than expectations. Analysts cautioned that the drop did not necessarily mean more people were finding jobs -- many Americans have exhausted unemployment benefits and are no longer included in the government's tallies.
 The relatively reassuring employment figures collided with news that AOL would reduce its work force by a third.
 The Conference Board predicted economic growth over the next six months, but not at a fast enough rate to placate Wall Street. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region grew in November at the fastest rate in two years.

HEADLINE: The Days May Be Grim, But Here's a Good Word To Put in Your Pocket

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
''The Waterfalls'' flowed in the East River. ''The Gates'' snaked through Central Park. Now New York's latest large-scale public art project is being exhibited in an even unlikelier space: your wallet.
 On the back of seven million MetroCards distributed this fall is a single printed word: ''optimism.'' Composed in clean, bold, sans-serif letters, it floats in a sea of white just beneath the boilerplate fine print. Another seven million are on the way early next year. 
 At first glance, the word appears simple and unassuming, a non sequitur easily overlooked amid the blur of travel in the city. Even its creators acknowledge that many subway and bus riders may never see it.
 But as unemployment in the city reaches a 16-year high, as corporations close and deficits mount, optimism has become a scarce commodity, aboveground and below. New York, it seems, could use a chance to restock.
 ''God knows people want to feel good, they want to feel up, they want to feel positive,'' said Christopher P. Boylan, who oversaw the project at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ''If I can make a couple of customers smile a day, that's nice.''
 The work itself is the creation of Reed Seifer, a graphic artist and designer who first printed the ''optimism'' logo on small buttons that he distributed as a college student.
 ''I've always loved art that exists in unexpected places,'' he said recently, near his home in Hell's Kitchen. ''I like that maybe not everyone's going to see it. Or maybe one day you just look and say, 'Oh.' ''
 The MetroCard, a ubiquitous slip of thin plastic barely three and a half inches across, certainly qualifies as an unusual canvas for conceptual art. The back of the card is mostly reserved for historical factoids (''The first female subway conductor began work on Dec. 28, 1917''), safety tips (''Fold the stroller. Hold your baby''), or the occasional commemoration of a World Series win or Rockettes performance (''MetroCard saves you $10 to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular!'').
 Occasionally, the card is also used for advertising, but those revenues have remained low, in part because of a lengthy production process. This year, the authority sold $165,000 worth of MetroCard ads, a fraction of its overall take in advertising revenue. 
 The MetroCard ad revenue in 2009 is nearly double the amount sold in 2008, but ads were still printed on fewer than 3 percent of the 120 million MetroCards produced in the first 10 months of this year -- perhaps underscoring the relevance of ''optimism'' to an agency facing further budget cuts from the state.
 Indeed, not all that the ''optimism'' project suggests is, well, optimistic. The word on the card can be read as an encouragement, a command, a taunt, an aspiration.
 ''I like that people can digest it in any way they choose,'' Mr. Seifer, 36, said. ''I accept all praise and criticism. I love artwork in which people perceive things beyond the intention of the artist.''
 Despite its sunny surface, ''optimism'' originated in a darker place. Mr. Seifer was inspired by a maxim he found printed on a Domino's sugar packet: ''An optimist is someone who tells you to cheer up when things are going his way.''
 An undergraduate at the time, studying art at Clark University, Mr. Seifer incorporated the phrase into his senior thesis, which focused on an incident with his father, who once offered an empty soda bottle to a homeless man collecting cans for redemption. The man refused, finding the offer patronizing.
 To promote the project, Mr. Seifer created the ''optimism'' logo, a balanced, streamlined composition in Akzidenz-Grotesk, a 19th-century font considered a precursor to Helvetica. (An influential, widely used font, Helvetica is common in the subway system's signage.)
 ''It's very open and minimal, and you can see the line weights of the letter forms are all equal weight, so it's not distracting,'' Mr. Seifer said. ''What I like about this typeface is it promotes without calling attention to itself, which is sort of what the 'optimism' MetroCard is about.''
 ''Optimism'' buttons have been sold at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the New York Public Library, and handed out free by Mr. Seifer himself. Early last year, seeking a wider distribution, he got in touch with Creative Time, a nonprofit organization that works with artists on public art projects. The MetroCard idea came to him at an interview, after his initial plans were rejected.
 Arts for Transit, an arm of the transportation authority, receives hundreds of ideas from artists. But Mr. Seifer's plan, with its simplicity and ease of installation, caught the eye of Sandra Bloodworth, the program's director, who immediately accepted it.
 Riders and reporters were not informed when the word began appearing on MetroCards in September. The point, Mr. Seifer said, was for it to be intimate, a serendipitous discovery for the viewer. ''It exists between the card and the person who receives the card,'' he said.
 As he designed the card, Mr. Seifer said, he did not take into account the small hole punched along the left edge of every MetroCard. In a happy accident, the hole lined up perfectly with the word, becoming a kind of period.
 Mr. Seifer found this appropriate: ''Optimism is about openings where people don't expect to find them.''

PERSON: John Crofton 

HEADLINE: Sir John Crofton, Pioneer In TB Cure, Is Dead at 97

BYLINE: By DENISE GELLENE

 BODY:
Sir John Crofton, a pioneering clinician who demonstrated that antibiotics could be safely combined to cure tuberculosis, a dread disease that once killed half the people who contracted it, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Edinburgh. He was 97.
 The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh announced his death. 
 Sir John started his research in the late 1940s, just as the first antibiotics were entering clinical practice, carrying with them the hope of conquering a disease for which helpless physicians had little to offer besides bed rest. But the mutable tubercle bacillus proved an elusive target, becoming resistant to each successive drug tried. Increasingly, researchers came to believe that drugs alone would never cure tuberculosis.
 Building on evidence that a two-drug combination reduced the development of resistant strains, Sir John started using three antibiotics at once to treat patients in Edinburgh during a tuberculosis crisis, reasoning that a multipronged attack would overcome the problems of resistance.
 In 1958, at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, he announced that his regimen had cured tuberculosis in the 63 patients who adhered to it for at least 18 months. But his triumph was met with skepticism until a multinational clinical trial confirmed his results.
 Sir John's multidrug approach remains the standard for treating tuberculosis and has provided the template for combination therapies to combat grave diseases like cancer and AIDS.
 ''He was a giant,'' said Dr. Jacques Grosset, a professor at the Center for Tuberculosis Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who lost a portion of his lung to tuberculosis. ''John Crofton understood that using three drugs at the same time would increase their potency, something lab researchers like me did not understand. It was a big, big revelation.''
 John Wenman Crofton was born on March 27, 1912, in Dublin, the son of a physician. He earned bachelor of medicine and doctor of medicine degrees from Cambridge University, and pursued further training at St. Thomas's Hospital in London.
 In 1939, during World War II, he entered the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in field hospitals in France, Germany and the Middle East. On a posting to Egypt, he ran a typhoid ward for 18 months under the command of Dr. John Guyett Scadding, a British expert on respiratory diseases. The men became friends, a relationship that would soon shape Sir John's career.
 After the war, Dr. Scadding rejoined the staff of Brompton Hospital in London and invited Sir John, who was then unemployed, to work with him as an unpaid clinical assistant. Sir John was soon appointed to a registrarship, or senior training position, at Brompton. 
 In late 1946, at Dr. Scadding's suggestion, Sir John joined a research team that was being formed by Britain's Medical Research Council to test the effectiveness of a new antibiotic, streptomycin, against tuberculosis.
 A Rutgers University scientist had isolated streptomycin from two soil fungi in 1943, and the antibiotic appeared to be effective against tuberculosis in guinea pigs and in some highly publicized cases of patients who had received the drug. But streptomycin was expensive, and only a limited quantity of it was available in impoverished postwar Britain for testing on patients. Sir John's role was to coordinate the trials at Brompton Hospital. 
 The British study randomly assigned 107 patients either to a control group that received only bed rest or to a treatment group that received daily injections of streptomycin in addition to bed rest. The drug reduced deaths from tuberculosis at first, but the victory was brief. After three to four months of treatment, tubercle bacilli became resistant to streptomycin, and the disease resumed its tragic course. 
 The study, although a huge disappointment, spurred Sir John to continue working on tuberculosis treatment and gave him the clinical research skills to find an approach that worked.
 In 1952, Sir John was appointed chairman of the department of respiratory diseases and tuberculosis at the University of Edinburgh, amid a tuberculosis epidemic in Scotland. Three years earlier, researchers in Britain reported that combining streptomycin with a newer medicine, para-aminosalicylic acid, could reduce the development of drug resistance. To this mix, Sir John added isoniazid, a new drug that became available shortly after his arrival in Edinburgh. 
 The third drug was the charm. Through careful monitoring, he devised a regimen that called for starting patients on all three drugs and then stopping streptomycin, which can cause hearing loss, after several months. For more than a decade, until it was replaced by a cocktail of newer and more powerful drugs, Sir John's three-drug regimen was the standard treatment for tuberculosis.
 ''The treatment principles he developed are the ones we are using today,'' said Dr. Mario C. Raviglione, director of the World Health Organization's Stop TB department. ''They are the model for cancer and for H.I.V. His legacy is quite significant.'' 
 Sir John was knighted in 1977, the year he retired from the University of Edinburgh. In the mid-1990s, as an adviser to W.H.O., he helped write the organization's tuberculosis treatment guidelines. 
 His survivors include his wife, Eileen; three daughters, Pamela Feaux de la Croix of Germany, and Alison Kilpatrick and Patricia Raemakers, both of Scotland; two sons, Dr. Richard Crofton of Scotland and Ian Crofton of England; 11 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Easy Loans in Expensive Areas

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Louise Story contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In January, Mike Rowland was so broke that he had to raid his retirement savings to move here from Boston.
 A week ago, he and a couple of buddies bought a two-unit apartment building for nearly a million dollars. They had only a little cash to bring to the table but, with the federal government insuring the transaction, a large down payment was not necessary.
 ''It was kind of crazy we could get this big a loan,'' said Mr. Rowland, 27. ''If a government official came out here, I would slap him a high-five.''
 In its efforts to prop up a shattered housing market, the government is greatly extending its traditional support of real estate, including guaranteeing the mortgages of middle-class and even upper-class buyers against default. 
 In 2007, the government did not insure a single mortgage in this city, one of the most expensive in the country. Buyers here, as well as in Manhattan, Santa Monica and every other wealthy area, were presumed to be able to handle the steep prices and correspondingly hefty down payments on their own. 
 Now the government is guaranteeing an average of six mortgages a week here. Real estate agents say the insurance is such a good deal that there will soon be many more.
 Policy changes like the shift in insurance, while often introduced on a temporary basis, are becoming so popular that they could prove difficult to undo. With government finances already under great strain, the policy expansions are creating new risks for American taxpayers.
 The Internal Revenue Service is giving tax rebates to first-time buyers, and soon to move-up buyers, in a program beset by accusations of fraud. And the government agency that issues mortgage insurance, the Federal Housing Administration, is underwriting loans at quadruple the rate of three years ago even as its reserves to cover defaults are dwindling. On Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said more than one in six F.H.A. borrowers was behind on payments. 
 F.H.A. insurance was created for minority and low-income families who could not come up with the traditional down payment of 20 percent required by private lenders. Buyers receive loans from government-approved lenders and are required to document their income and assets. They must pay a substantial insurance premium of 1.75 percent of the loan. But in return, their down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent.
 For decades, most F.H.A. loans were in low-cost states like Texas and Michigan. Under the agency's loan limits, houses along the coasts were usually too expensive to qualify. In 2007, fewer than 4,400 F.H.A. loans were made in California, according to the research firm MDA DataQuick, and none were in San Francisco.
 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 helped change that by temporarily doubling the maximum loan the F.H.A. insured, to $729,750. A two-unit property like the one bought by Mr. Rowland and his friends can be insured for up to $934,200.
 ''F.H.A. financing was a lost language in San Francisco, the real estate equivalent of Aramaic,'' said Michael Ackerman, the agent who represented Mr. Rowland and his friends. ''Once the limits were raised, smart buyers started calling.'' 
 The F.H.A. has insured more than 107,000 loans so far this year in the state, according to DataQuick, about 270 of them in San Francisco.
 Condominium buildings approved for F.H.A. financing -- a relative handful -- trumpet the news on their Web sites. The Soma Grand, a new 246-unit building downtown where one-bedrooms cost in excess of $500,000, received F.H.A. certification early in the summer. A half-dozen buyers since then used F.H.A. insurance.
 At Guarantee Mortgage Corporation, which has 150 mortgage brokers in the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland, Ore., F.H.A. loans have grown to about 15 percent of its business, from less than 3 percent a few years ago.
 ''It sure has helped us put a lot of deals together,'' said Guarantee's chief sales officer, Bob Siefert. He predicts that a quarter of Guarantee's deals will soon be guaranteed by the F.H.A.
 Some F.H.A. borrowers here say they have the cash for a full down payment but would rather invest it in the stock market or use it for remodeling. Others, like Mr. Rowland and his friends, simply do not have the money required by private lenders -- which would have been nearly $200,000, in their case.
 ''We were resigned to waiting another year,'' said a second partner, Michael Bedar, 31. ''Then we read about the F.H.A. I had never heard of it before, and couldn't quite believe it. But it was the answer to our problems.'' They put down about $33,000, split among the three of them.
 While the F.H.A. is certainly strengthening the high-end market in the Bay Area by prompting more sales, there are growing concerns that it might become a destabilizing force. 
 Kenneth Donohue, inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the parent agency of the F.H.A., said the higher loan limits were increasing the potential risk to the F.H.A. Last week, the agency said its cash reserves had fallen below their Congressionally mandated minimum because of the large volume of foreclosures.
 ''If one of these higher-limit loans fail, that's equivalent to two or three cheaper loans,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''You have to ask yourself, was the F.H.A. ever intended to address these markets?''
 He sees another risk: larger loans will be a greater draw for those who want to commit fraud. That would exacerbate a problem already besetting the agency.
 Even some San Francisco agents who are doing F.H.A. deals worry about the long-term consequences. Real estate commissions are 6 percent. If the value of a property were to hold steady, a seller who put down the F.H.A. minimum would suffer a loss after fees. And while the Bay Area has traditionally been an excellent investment, the last few years have proved a big exception.
 ''Is this going to be the next wave of the housing downturn?'' asked Eileen Bermingham, an agent with Pacific Union. ''With such a minimal down payment, how do we make sure people don't get in over their heads?''
 The F.H.A. commissioner, David H. Stevens, said recently that its loans were relatively safe because the buyer was required to live in the property. They ''are for shelter. They aren't speculative-type investments,'' Mr. Stevens said.
 But the idea of a house as an investment dies hard. Mr. Bedar, Mr. Rowland and the third partner in their property, Jordan Kurland, are all in the technology field, but their dreams of wealth do not feature stock options. 
 ''We're banking on real estate,'' said Mr. Kurland, 24. ''Everyone expects prices to keep going up.''
 Mr. Kurland and Mr. Bedar, who are employed full time, are the buyers of record. Mr. Rowland, a freelancer, will have his interests protected by a legal agreement.
 Their building, for which they paid $963,000, is on a quiet street in the up-and-coming Hayes Valley neighborhood, close to fashionable restaurants they have already been trying out. The friends plan to live in the bottom unit and rent out the top. Thanks to rock-bottom interest rates, none of them will pay much more than a thousand dollars a month. ''Everyone should have the chance to do this,'' Mr. Kurland said.
 Everyone may get a chance.
 A few weeks ago, Congress extended the higher lending limits for another year. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that he planned to introduce legislation next year raising the maximum F.H.A. loan by $100,000, to $839,750.
 His bill would make the new limits permanent.
