HEADLINE: After 43 Fun Years, Ford Takes the T-Bird Away

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 17

 BODY:
With even the Beach Boys going bald and turning gray, perhaps it had to happen: The Ford Motor Company announced today that it will end production this year of its legendary Thunderbird after 43 years of building the car that found a beloved spot in America's cultural history.
Introduced in Detroit's postwar glory period, the Thunderbird went on to win the affection of generations of Americans for its supporting role during their years of young love and adventure. 
 When the Beach Boys crooned about the good times, the Thunderbird was their chosen symbol. "She'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-Bird away," they sang, and America's crush on the Thunderbird deepened as it seemed to capture the melody of the times.
Even as Ford announced that it would stop making the Thunderbird, it held out hope to longtime fans that it might resurrect the model as a small two-seater a few years from now. But a T-Bird return was presented as an if, not a when. For now, Thunderbird devotees could only mourn.
Ford announced the move as part of a broader plan to cut costs, and, in the process, up to 2,500 jobs.
The company also said today that it would discontinue three of the Thunderbird's slow-selling siblings later this year -- the Aerostar van, Probe and the Mercury Cougar, itself a legend to many baby boomers.
The Thunderbird dates to the early 1950's, when a group of Ford engineers drafted plans for a powerful new roadster only to be discouraged from building it by Ford's senior management, which was more interested in family cars. But that attitude among top executives changed completely when General Motors displayed the first Chevrolet Corvette in January, 1953, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Moving with a speed that would be unusual today and was extraordinary then, Ford was able to start selling two-seat Thunderbirds in September 1954.
The Thunderbird also had one feature that the Corvette did not: It was the first mass-produced American convertible offered with two roofs, said Eugene M. Nelson, a Ford engineer who is treasurer of the Detroit chapter of the American Road Thunderbird Club. A young couple out on a summer date under cloudless skies could leave the removable hard top behind in the garage. If a storm suddenly blew up, the couple could then pull up the collapsible soft top.
For all its glamour, the two-seat Thunderbird moved slowly out of the showrooms at first, with just 14,190 cars sold in the first year. Ford responded in 1958 by installing a rear seat. Sales climbed to 91,000 in 1960 and hit a peak of 322,517 in 1977. By last year, Thunderbird sales had shrunk to just 80,000.
But the classic Thunderbirds live on. Mr. Nelson said that just two years ago, he was out driving one of his two 1957 Thunderbirds on a sunny Saturday when clouds appeared and it suddenly began to rain. "I'd had the top off, but I had the soft top," Mr. Nelson recalled. "So no problem, I put up the soft top and away we went."
While a press release issued by the company said, "The Thunderbird nameplate will return in a different form in the future," a Ford executive said he was less sure it would be resurrected. "If we do bring it back, it would need to make good business sense," said Jacques A. Nasser, the president of Ford's Automotive Operations.
"We haven't made a decision," Mr. Nasser said, but in several years, Ford might sell a smaller, sporty car carrying the Thunderbird name, one that recalls the T-Bird's roots. "It would be very limited production levels," Mr. Nasser said.
The T-Bird came on the scene in what seemed like a more expansive era, when downsizing was foreign to the national vocabulary and to a mighty United States auto industry.
These days, all of Detroit's grand old names -- and roomy, soft-riding cars -- are struggling. Buick, Mercury, Oldsmobile and even mighty Cadillac have watched their sales slow for years as younger buyers shied away from the gas-hogging road barges driven by their parents -- most recently in favor of enormous, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and mini-vans. Even a grand name like Thunderbird no longer seems to be enough of a lifeline.
"What we're really seeing is the continuing trend to more trucklike products," Mr. Nasser said. Discontinuing the Thunderbird and the other models "is really responding to changing consumer tastes."
Discontinuing the Thunderbird and Cougar will shutter part of the Ford factory in Lorain, Ohio, at the cost of about 1,800 jobs. Because 20 other factories nationwide build parts for the vehicles being discontinued, the moves could result in an additional 700 layoffs.
Wall Street's initial reaction was to cheer, not to mourn, the passing of the Thunderbird and other models. Ford stock rose 12.5 cents, to $32.25 in trading yesterday.
"It is an encouraging development," said David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at Smith Barney. "The reason they are doing this is that these products didn't sell."
Ford is likely to take a charge against earnings in the second quarter of up to $150 million to pay for the moves announced today, Mr. Nasser said. Workers who are laid off will receive long-term pay and benefits under their union contracts. For the first 36 weeks of joblessness, workers will receive unemployment benefits and other payments amounting to about 95 percent of their pay. After that, they will receive 100 percent of their pay and report for duty, where they will be assigned community service or job training. When other Ford factories nationwide have openings, the Ohio workers would be high on the list to get those jobs.
Of the models being discontinued, only Thunderbird and Cougar are built in Ohio and will result in layoffs. The Probe, a sports car, is built at a factory in Flat Rock, Mich., that Ford and the Mazda Motor Corporation jointly operate, and workers who built the Probe will instead build additional Mazdas. The Aerostar is built in the same St. Louis factory that builds the popular Ford Explorer, and workers there will switch from building vans to assembling sport utility vehicles.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Default Rate Is Climbing

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Over the last three years, Americans have received in the mail more than eight billion offers for credit cards. The good news, for the credit card companies, is that millions of people have taken the cards and borrowed more than ever before. The bad news is that a growing number cannot pay their bills, and in recent months the problem has been getting worse.
Many credit card companies recently tightened their lending standards in hopes of avoiding a plague of defaults and late payments. But instead of improving the situation, the latest moves by the credit card companies appear to be rippling negatively through the industry. 
 Yesterday, the Advanta Corporation, one of the fastest-growing credit card issuers, said it would lose money in the first quarter because as much as 7.5 percent of its loans outstanding had gone bad. Advanta, long proud of its independence, has hired an investment banker to consider, among other options, selling the company outright.
Advanta's woes reflect a wider trend. Last week, the American Bankers Association said 3.72 percent of credit card borrowers were behind on their payments in the fourth quarter of last year, up from 3.48 percent in the third quarter. By comparison, 3.34 percent of borrowers were behind on payments in the fourth quarter of 1995. And the problems are likely to get worse before they get better, because credit card borrowing has jumped sharply recently as Americans stretched to finance their Christmas and post-Christmas shopping.
Advanta, while perhaps worse off than many of its competitors, is certainly not alone. Earlier this month, the Banc One Corporation became the latest card issuer forced to bail out bonds backed by its credit card loans, because losses were higher than investors in the bonds had expected.
So now the card companies are preparing to get even tougher on customers, imposing higher interest rates and more fees on card users and providing them with fewer goodies. Advanta and others are starting to raise interest rates on riskier customers. They are increasing "nuisance" fees -- for being late on payments or going over a credit limit. And new credit card offers will have less attractive terms, such as shortened periods in which low introductory "teaser" interest rates apply.
Other credit card companies have been raising fees and cutting back on such giveaways as discounts on new-car purchases or, simply, cash back.
"There is more risk in the system today than a year ago," said Alex W. Hart, Advanta's chief executive. The result, he said, is that lenders will try to make card borrowing more expensive in an attempt to maintain their lucrative profit margins.
For the economy, tighter standards for credit cards may well slow spending by hard-pressed consumers, who have relied heavily on cards in recent years to help maintain their living standards. But if consumers cut back and weaken the economy, then credit card losses are likely to go nowhere but up.
While banks have started to tighten their lending standards, the moves have not yet had any effect on overall borrowing, which has continued to climb at a rapid clip. The Federal Reserve said last week that consumer borrowing in January jumped $8.4 billion, to $1.203 trillion, the largest rise in two years, after increasing $3.8 billion in December.
"It's not going to look pretty for a while," Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said of the industry's situation. "The streets are littered with companies that have 7 percent loss rates." Mr. Orenbuch said that Advanta, long seen as one of the more sophisticated issuers, seemed to have slipped behind the industry leaders.
In contrast to lenders who have run into trouble by lending to people with past credit problems, Advanta was known for seeking out more affluent customers, mainly offering gold cards with greater credit limits. The company had developed complex computer models intended to sift millions of tidbits of information about prospective customers to find those it believed would run up big balances while still being able to repay them.
But Advanta's experience shows that lending to the affluent can be just as precarious as providing credit cards to low-income customers.
For a few years, Advanta's strategy paid big dividends as it racked up one of the industry's best records. But by the middle of last year, it was hit by rising losses and it slowed its marketing virtually to a halt.
The company had once told analysts that its revenue would rise sharply this quarter as the low introductory rates on its accounts, generally 5.9 percent, increased to almost 15 percent. But Advanta found that too many of its customers simply moved their balances to other cards as soon as the rate increased. So the company did not have as much income as it would have liked to cover the surging losses nor did it employ enough bill collectors to bring in revenue from delinquent accounts.
While Advanta focused on generic cards with low teaser rates, the competition moved to attract customers in other ways, forging links with organizations like alumni associations and creating tie-ins with airline frequent-flier accounts.
The shakeout in credit cards has been going on for several years. Two years ago, several regional banks, like the Mellon Bank Corporation and the Mercantile Bancorporation, had unexpected losses from their card operations. But now even the leading lenders, including Dean Witter, Discover, Banc One and First Chicago NBD are experiencing escalating losses. And yesterday, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts said that a record 1.125 million households had filed for personal bankruptcy last year.
"This is not a typical economic cycle," said Tanya S. Azarchs, a bank analyst with the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "We are in a good economy but consumers have become overleveraged."
As a result of its losses, Advanta said yesterday that it expected to lose $20 million in the first quarter, in contrast to a profit of $41 million in the 1996 quarter. It said it expected to be profitable in the second quarter. The shares of Advanta fell $8.50 each, to $31.875, in Nasdaq trading.
The company, based in Horsham, Pa., also said that David A. Brooks, a former Visa executive it had hired two months ago as its chief operating officer, had resigned. Several other top Advanta executives have left in recent months.
Advanta said it had hired BT Wolfensohn, a division of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, to look at "strategic alternatives" for the company. These include a sale or merger, the sale of some divisions, or some sort of joint venture.
Analysts said the current uncertainties would make it difficult for Advanta to sell itself.
"With such a great amount of other assets for sale in the financial services industry, the price Advanta will get would not be to its liking," said Thomas Facciola, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: New U.N. Chief Proposes Plans To Slash Waste

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 17

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan today outlined the first detailed, concrete plans for streamlining the United Nations in the hope of polishing its image, solving its financial problems and persuading Congress to authorize spending for about $1 billion in unpaid American dues.
The proposals, the first part of a reform program that Mr. Annan, of Ghana, promised when he took over the job in January, deal mainly with management and organizational matters that fall under the Secretary General's personal authority. They involve shifting some $200 million in bureaucratic spending to development aid, reducing budget and staff levels and reorganizing parts of the New York-based Secretariat. 
 The response was favorable, both from the Clinton Administration and from the most powerful critic of the United Nations in Congress, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Annan called Mr. Helms today to brief him on the proposals.
Mr. Helms's spokesman, Mark Thiessen, called the Secretary General's announcement "a good first step in the right direction." But he said the Senator wants to insure that the staff cuts are real. "We don't want any shell games here," he said.
He added that Mr. Helms would press for conditions to be written into legislation authorizing payment of Washington's arrears to insure that certain goals are met before any money is paid.
Mr. Annan was chosen for the position after Washington vetoed a second term for his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, saying he had not done enough to promote change at the United Nations.
While the Secretary General defended the changes he announced as "a powerful tool for strengthening the organization," he also made clear his other objectives.
"Congress said it will pay if it gets reform," Mr. Annan said at a news conference here. "We are giving them reform. I hope they will deliver on their part of the bargain."
Washington's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, called the proposals "a significant step toward the kind of structural reform that will help the United Nations do more, better and for less."
Mr. Annan said he would present a more sweeping package of suggestions in July for the organization's long-term future, for which he would seek member states' approval.
Diplomats say any improvement in the United Nations' financial prospects -- the organization says it is owed $1.3 billion by the United States in unpaid budget and peacekeeping dues and a further $840 million by other members -- is likely to be tied to the fate of the second package.
Among the changes that the United States is hoping to negotiate is a cut in its share of the total United Nations budget. The Administration wants Congress to appropriate $1.2 billion to pay back dues to the United Nations and other international organizations but favors withholding most of the money until 1999, when the outcome of the latest spending cuts should be clear.
Under the plan, the United Nations will cut by a third the portion of its $1.2 billion in annual spending, now 38 percent, that now goes for administration. The roughly $200 million that reduction should save will be transferred to aid programs run by Unicef, the United Nations Development Program, which provides technical help to poor countries, and other development agencies.
The United Nations' budget for 1998 and 1999 is set at $123 million less than the current two-year budget of $2.48 billion. Under the new budget, 1,000 staff posts, most of them vacant, will remain unfilled. Other plans include the merging of the Secretariat's three separate departments dealing with economic and social issues into one and taking steps to coordinate aid agencies' field operations more tightly. Plans also call for consolidating the separate administrative, personnel and procurement services that those agencies maintain at their New York headquarters.
The Secretary General also plans to overhaul the United Nations' information department and draw up a code of conduct for its staff.
While Mr. Annan can make most of the changes on his own authority, much more difficult issues are likely to be raised by the second package of proposals he will put forward this summer. One is Washington's insistence that its share of the regular budget be cut from the current 25 percent to around 20 percent and that its peacekeeping assessment be trimmed from just over 30 percent to about 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget. But diplomats acknowledge that negotiations on those matters may be hard to separate from parallel efforts to enlarge the Security Council by giving permanent seats to Germany, Japan and some large developing nations.
Only if Germany and Japan get permanent Council seats are they likely to be generous in helping fill the budget gap created by the cuts the United States is seeking.

HEADLINE: Striking a Balance Between Deer and Residents in the Florida Keys

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: BIG PINE KEY, Fla.

 BODY:
For two years, the endangered Key deer have died in record numbers. That, some residents of the Florida Keys say, may be good news.
The herd, estimated at about 300 deer here and on a few other islands of the Keys, lost 104 deer last year and 94 in 1995, said officials at the Federal National Key Deer Refuge here. Two-thirds of those that died were killed by cars on U.S. 1 and residential paved roads, they said. Before 1995, about 70 deer were killed each year. 
 But while Federal officials say the mounting number of deaths underscores the need to further control traffic and development, many residents question whether the deer population was as small as reported. If about 100 deer were dying a year, as one developer put it, it might mean there were "more deer jumping around" in the islands' vegetation.
The question is more than academic. With Florida's explosive population growth, developments have been invading the habitats of many species of animals and plants, and environmentalists, government officials and residents have clashed over how far to go to protect them.
In Big Pine Key, an island two miles wide and eight miles long, where most of the deer live, protecting the Key deer has meant severe restrictions on construction of new homes, schools and roads. Speed limits of 30 to 35 miles an hour have slowed traffic to a crawl.
Many of the island's 5,000 permanent residents say they feel like second-class citizens, compared with Bambi.
"I love the animals. I don't want to see them hurt," said Don Pollock, 51, the owner of Jig's Bait and Tackle. "But it's gotten to the point where you don't have any personal rights anymore. Maybe I should go to Cuba."
Key deer, a subspecies and the smallest of the North American white-tailed deer, less than three feet high at the shoulder, were placed on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Nevertheless, development was allowed to flourish here through the 1980's, before state and county officials began clamping down on growth through ordinances and by buying land. A patchwork of about half of the land on Big Pine Key is now under some form of protection by environmental groups or the government, officials said.
One of the most controversial growth management policies has been the one that severely restricts new construction, denying owners of vacant lots the right to build on them.
"These were their dream lots, since they had planned to retire here, and now they can't build here and it's very distressing for them," said Timothy McGarry, director of planning for Monroe County. "But it's a question of who was here first. The deer were."
Most residents say they love the animals, which are the size of big dogs and often behave like pets. Visible throughout the island and comfortable around encroachers, they munch on hibiscus in backyards, graze among homes and cars and do not hesitate to approach people.
But hand-feeding is punishable by a $250 fine because it makes the deer fearless and more likely to be killed by cars or dogs, said officials at the refuge, which covers 8,000 acres. Thirty people have been fined since enforcement was tightened last summer. Biologists said that in the last 10 years, the deer population, attracted by handouts and garbage, has grown in developed areas while declining in wild ones. This is a concern because when the herd is concentrated, a disease outbreak or catastrophe could wipe out the deer.
"Why go chew on a mangrove leaf if you can have a potato chip?" said Michael J. McMinn, assistant refuge manager for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
Fines are just one of the many restrictions on humans who co-exist with the Key deer in the Florida islands that are the deer's only home. Dianne Stevens, 34, a waitress with two sons, said she was not allowed to erect a fence around her corner property to protect her children, because it would have prevented the deer from roaming freely.
In addition, Ms. Stevens said, the children must commute to schools on other islands, too far away for her to volunteer or attend functions, because construction of new schools would take away more habitat.
"I don't blame the deer," she said. "I blame the politicians."
Indeed, residents like Ms. Stevens say the deer are so plentiful and "street-smart" that many of the measures to protect them are unnecessary. The most skeptical suspect a land grab by government officials whose goal is to hold on to their preservation jobs.
The Lower Keys Chamber of Commerce is urging Federal and state officials to conduct a new deer census. A study in the 1970's estimated that there were 200 to 250 deer on Big Pine Key and as many as 150 more on 22 other islands.
But while some hope a new count would bolster their argument that the deer are thriving alongside humans and can survive more development, others said that disaster evacuation constraints and sewage needs may limit growth anyway.
Conservationists say numbers are meaningless.
"There could be 1,000 and they'd still be endangered and unique," said Harold Nugent, 63, a retired English professor who lives here and belongs to the Key Deer Protection Alliance, a volunteer group. "You can go through 1,000 very quickly if something happens, like a hurricane."
For now, the most immediate danger is traffic, although refuge officials said most deer killed last year were less than two years old, indicating that the does were bearing well.
Long-term solutions being considered include transplanting some of the herd to less populated islands nearby and establishing an undeveloped corridor the length of Big Pine Key to connect the patchwork of publicly owned lands and help minimize the deer's interaction with people, Mr. McMinn said.
What is clear, he said, is that the time is past for compromise between the needs of people and the deer.
"We've messed up," he said. "We allowed all these subdivisions to be put in. There's no way politically or economically to buy that land. The deer are going to have to survive on what's left."

HEADLINE: Canada Says U.S. Falls Short With Proposal to Bolster Air Quality

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
In an unusual formal criticism of another country's domestic policies, the Government of Canada maintains that proposals in the United States to toughen air quality standards -- denounced by industry as too demanding -- do not go far enough.
Canada said that the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rules "will continue to result in health damages and death," and it bluntly recommended that the rules be made more stringent. 
 Canada's comments, filed with the environmental agency, are unusual not only because they came from abroad, but also because they unequivocally call for even tougher measures than the agency has proposed and are based on a detailed scientific examination of the issues by Canada's own pollution control authorities.
Because residents of some border cities in Canada breathe air that is sometimes contaminated by soot and smog blown in from the United States, tightening air pollution rules in this country could benefit Canadian citizens as well as Americans.
The E.P.A. seems unlikely to toughen its proposals in response to the Canadian criticism.
Rather, the agency is likely to use the independent scientific assessment by Canada as evidence that the United States is moving in the right direction.
Canada's rebuke is just one among thousands of documents, ranging from brief electronic mail messages and petitions to hefty crates of legal, economic and scientific arguments, that were filed with the E.P.A. before the March 12 deadline for public comments on proposals to set new health-based limits on pollution by soot and smog.
A United States group, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which represents the health agencies of each state, also filed comments warning that the E.P.A.'s proposal "will not fully protect the public."
The group praised the E.P.A.'s scientific review, saying that "a wealth of evidence" supported tougher smog goals and that "sufficient evidence" supported tougher soot goals.
But major industry groups filed voluminous comments deriding the science behind the rules and saying they would cost far more than they are worth in terms of health protection.
The American Petroleum Institute, for example, filed documents measuring about a foot high. The group said that tighter rules on smog "would not provide any significant improvement in protection of public health." And it said there was "no credible evidence" that the fine sooty particles that the E.P.A. wants to control more tightly were causing health problems.
The industry argument was expressly contradicted by Canada.
"Canada wishes to congratulate and encourage the E.P.A. for moving forward with tougher clean air requirements," its Government said in a 15-page unsigned document delivered on March 11, the day before the comment period closed. "At the same time, Canada is convinced that the proposals being made, if implemented, will not provide adequate protection for human health."
After considering public comments, the E.P.A. is to issue final rules this summer. The rules will define what levels of fine chemical particles and of ozone, a gas that is the main ingredient of smog, can be tolerated in the air without unduly jeopardizing public health.
Once the standards are set, states must devise plans for meeting them, subject to Federal approval.
The Clean Air Act requires the E.P.A. to review air quality standards periodically for six major pollutants and to set goals at levels that protect the public's health with a margin of safety that considers especially vulnerable people, like children with asthma or people who work and exercise outdoors. Under the law, the standards must be set without consideration of how much it might cost to meet them.
The Canadian Government and the provincial governments have already determined that pollution standards should be tightened in Canada, which would make them tougher than those that the E.P.A. is proposing for the United States.
A few other industrial countries have assessed studies of air pollution and health in their nations and come to conclusions similar to Canada's.

Ahmanson Sweetens Bid For Great Western Financial
H. F. Ahmanson & Company, battling to acquire Great Western Financial, a rival California savings and loan, sweetened its all-stock hostile bid for the company, to $6.6 billion, or about $50 a share.
The value of the revised deal would change with the price of Ahmanson stock, but it appears to top the friendly $6.25 billion offer that Great Western accepted on March 6 from Washington Mutual. [Page D6.]
 
Dow Rises as Nasdaq Falls
Blue chips staged a late rebound, with the Dow Jones industrials closing up 20.02 points at 6,955.48. But losers exceeded winners by almost 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq index lost 13.54 points, closing at 1,279.43. [D10.] 

Prices of Treasury securities slipped, as investors worried about a possible Fed rate increase and were wary ahead of the week's economic data. The yield on the 30-year bond edged up to 6.95 percent. [D20.]
 
S.E.C. Considers Shift on Funds
The S.E.C. is considering dropping its requirement that mutual funds disclose to shareholders all the securities they hold. Rather, it might require a list of the top 25 to 50 holdings. Industry analysts were critical. [D2.]
 
Thyssen Sees Hostile Krupp Bid
Thyssen A.G., Germany's largest steel producer, said that the Krupp-Hoesch group was planning to attempt a rare hostile takeover, and that Thyssen would fight it. Krupp refused to comment. [D2.]
 
For Time Warner, Delay Could Pay
Time Warner may be able to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in capital gains tax if it keeps its troubled partnership with U S West intact through late June. Market Place. [D10.]
 
News Corp. to Acquire Heritage
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation said that it would acquire Heritage Media, a direct-marketing and broadcasting company, in a tax-free stock deal worth $754 million. [D4.]
 
Rockwell to Shed Auto Operations
Rockwell International, continuing to reposition itself as an electronics and communications company, said that it would spin off its automotive parts operations as an independent, publicly traded company. [D2.]
 
A New Approach at Pearson P.L.C.
Pearson P.L.C., the British media and entertainment company, announced it would invest $160 million in The Financial Times over the next five years in the United States and Asia. Marjorie M. Scardino, the chief executive, also said she had put a new management team in place and begun a system to raise profits and cut costs. [D4.]
 
H.M.O.'s Found To Limit Elderly
Elderly people in health maintenance organizations often find that they cannot obtain the medical services they need because H.M.O.'s limit their ability to appeal adverse decisions on treatment, Federal investigators said. More than half the H.M.O.'s examined by Federal auditors did not fully comply with Federal rules for handling appeals and grievances. [A1.]
 
Canada Criticizes U.S. Plan on Air
The Government of Canada criticized proposals in the United States to toughen air quality standards -- denounced by industry as too demanding -- saying they "will continue to result in health damages and death." [A17.]
 
Former Chief Returns to Luby's
Luby's Cafeterias, whose chief executive, John Edward Curtis Jr., died last week in what the police have ruled a suicide, said that its chairman, Ralph Erben, had quit. A former chairman of the chain, John Lahourcade, will return as chairman and chief executive. [D20.]

HEADLINE: Albanians Must Foster Stability From Within;
Modest Comforts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re your March 17 news article "As Unrest Swells in Albania, Eerie Calm Falls on Capital": 
 During a monthlong visit to Albania last August, my husband and I lived with many families who had been our hosts during earlier trips. Except for a few improved roads near major cities, the infrastructure seemed not to have improved at all, but most of our friends' lives had become a little easier.
Their greatest pride was their new bathrooms, equipped with modern showers and toilets and water storage tanks. It was hopes of modest comforts like these, not dreams of quick riches, that persuaded many people that the pyramid schemes in which they were ultimately swindled were worth the risk.
A lasting solution of the crisis must defuse the powderkeg by dismantling the remaining "investment" companies and transforming their assets into legal and productive economic enterprises.
A national infrastructure -- water, electricity, communications and roads -- to support modern investment is an urgent priority. Albania's latest tragedy is the culmination of five years of social, economic and political dreams gone sour; we can only hope that somehow these dark times will bring forth wise leaders.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Suggests Party Leaders May Drop Push for Big Tax Cut

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said today that the Republican Party should consider shelving its demand for a big tax cut to advance the prospects of balancing the budget.
Mr. Gingrich's statement was the latest indication of a growing split among Republicans over whether to surrender, at least temporarily, their long-running debate with the Democrats and the Clinton Administration over sweeping tax reductions. 
 Other influential Republicans, including Senator William V. Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, have insisted in recent days that the party would press ahead with its tax-cutting proposals, which have been the centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the last two years.
In impromptu comments to reporters, Mr. Gingrich said, "We've said all along we think it's very, very important to balance the budget and get as large a tax cut as possible while balancing the budget."
He added, "But we think that the moral imperative is to balance the budget."
Leaders of both parties in Congress said earlier today that they would try to get the budget process restarted through legislative give-and-take rather than through direct negotiations with the Clinton Administration.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said the chances of using President Clinton's budget proposals as the basis for negotiating a deal to eliminate the deficit by 2002 were waning. But Mr. Lott said Republicans and moderate Democrats in Congress might be able to reach their own compromise, including an agreement on reducing cost-of-living increases for recipients of benefit programs, like Social Security, through an adjustment to the Consumer Price Index, which most economists believe overstates inflation.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said Congress should develop a budget resolution -- the framework for more detailed spending and tax bills -- without holding the process hostage to negotiations with the Administration.
"I don't know why we feel that there has to be a negotiated settlement prior to the time we seriously consider budgetary questions," Mr. Daschle said. "I think the best approach is to start the budget process, to allow amendments, to work through the budget in the Budget Committee."
After initial expressions of optimism from both sides that they could strike a budget deal quickly, both parties agreed last week that their initial negotiations were going nowhere, particularly after Mr. Clinton backed away from a politically explosive proposal to save billions of dollars by addressing the apparent overstatement of cost-of-living increases.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee, said last week that the chances of negotiating a deal with the White House were "finished." But Mr. Domenici and other Republicans have since softened that stand, looking for potential compromises on an issue that both sides say is their overriding goal this year.

HEADLINE: At Rental Counters, Are All Drivers Created Equal?;
Avis Finds Itself at the Center Of Discrimination Complaints

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla., March 14

 BODY:
"The rental of an automobile is not an inalienable right granted in the Constitution," Richard Aronow, president of the New York Rental Vehicle Association, observes. Yet the scope of those rights has provoked a growing, national brawl, with Avis, the No. 2 rental agency, at its center.
The company faces a lawsuit over complaints that several outlets in North and South Carolina have refused to rent cars to blacks and that the top executives of Avis have hesitated to step in. In New York, the lawsuit by the state Attorney General to keep Avis and others from rejecting younger drivers has reached the state's highest court. The state Assembly plans to investigate whether some rental companies systematically turned down blacks and Hasidic Jews, as well. 
 Most recently, two former employees have accused Avis supervisors and telephone representatives at the company's global reservations center in Tulsa of rejecting corporate accounts for those who appeared to be Jewish, especially Hasidic Jews, in what the employees described as the "yeshiva" policy. Two other rental companies that charge higher rates to Brooklyn, Queens and Bronx drivers are the targets of Federal legislation to be introduced on Tuesday that would outlaw basing rates on where a renter lives.
All these complaints bear on industry practices that rental companies consider necessary to making money in a business built on putting valuable, potentially lethal assets into strangers' hands. An 1866 Federal law that bars discrimination because of race or religion has been interpreted by the courts as applying to a broad range of businesses and services, including schools, restaurants and rental agencies. The companies say they still must be choosy about whom they will rent to and at what prices. The young, the accident-prone, the Brooklyn resident all threaten, experience shows, to cost the car rental companies more than they pay.
"The rental of an auto combines the exposure of an insurance company and a bank rolled into one," Mr. Aronow, whose group leads the defense against threatened state legislation, said.
Banking and insurance, however, are two industries prominently accused of letting business judgment sometimes slide into bias. Some neighborhoods, however prosperous, with high concentrations of members of racial minorities have found that red-lining makes mortgages or insurance coverage scarce.
Challenges to such practices have increasingly succeeded. Federal agencies have forced many banks to step up their lending in neighborhoods they had shunned. Pressed by protests and lawsuits, many big insurers have begun writing homeowners policies in inner-city neighborhoods -- and are finding it profitable.
In the restaurant business, Denny's, a unit of the Flagstar Companies, agreed in 1994 to pay $54 million to settle accusations that some of its outlets had refused to serve black customers. The lead lawyer in that suit, John P. Relman of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, is also handling the Federal lawsuit in Wilmington, N.C., that accuses Avis and its local franchisee of bias against blacks.
Avis, pointing out that more than 42 percent of its employees are members of racial minorities, says that any discrimination was the fault of a franchisee over whom it had little control -- John B. Dalton 3d, who operates Avis lots in Wilmington and four other cities in the Carolinas.
"Avis did not discriminate against blacks, against Jews or against any other majorities or minorities," said Henry R. Silverman, chief executive of HFS Inc., the Parsippany, N.J., franchising operation that bought Avis last October.
Mr. Silverman acknowledged that Mr. Dalton might have shown bias. Avis, based in Garden City, L.I., tried to take over his locations in December, but a Federal court in North Carolina blocked any immediate action. Mr. Silverman called the new complaints of discrimination against Jews false -- prompted, he said, by lawyers who were trying to manipulate the media and embarrass Avis into settling the Wilmington case.
"This is a new way -- I'm trying to use a nicer word than extortion -- that lawyers for plaintiffs try to extract money from corporations," Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview.
Mr. Dalton and his lawyers refused to comment beyond issuing a statement in which he denied refusing anyone on the basis of race.
The North Carolina case has gotten wide exposure, but the details of what happened in Tulsa are still emerging.
In about 1990, the company says, underage drivers falsely claiming to work for yeshivas -- Jewish day schools, usually high schools -- began renting cars under the schools' corporate accounts. Some used the cars as taxis, trash haulers and, in one case, a hearse, then returned them in sad shape. The company says it alerted its reservation center in Tulsa to avoid establishing corporate accounts that were likely to be abused, checking customers from the Northeast most closely.
According to two former employees, however, managers of the division that sets up small-business accounts responded with a broader pattern of discrimination. In a sworn statement he provided, William B. Ward said that supervisors had coached him and other telephone representatives to watch for "Jewish-sounding names," look for locations like New York and New Jersey and listen for "Jewish accents," and then deny applications for corporate accounts from what were broadly termed "yeshivas."
Mr. Ward recalled that a supervisor blamed an agent for granting a corporate account to a New Jersey fish market that the supervisor said was a yeshiva. Another supervisor put a caller on a speaker phone to demonstrate the screening process, Mr. Ward said in the sworn statement. "We don't want your business," the supervisor said. He hung up, then looked at Mr. Ward and explained, "That was a yeshiva."
Usually, Mr. Ward said, the slight was more subtle. Customers were given accounts that yielded discounts no better than those available to auto club members. True corporate accounts offered larger discounts, ample insurance coverage and a free day's rental for every 15 paid, he explained. Over about a year and a half, Mr. Ward said, he denied hundreds of such accounts.
In Tulsa, a metropolitan area of 743,000 where there are no yeshivas and the Jewish population is estimated at 3,000, Mr. Ward said that employees were befuddled. "The term 'yeshiva' was so derogatory, I believed it was some kind of Yiddish cuss word," Mr. Ward said in an interview.
In January, Mr. Ward was dismissed after being accused of cheating on an incentive program, a charge he is challenging in an unemployment compensation proceeding.
Another former telephone agent, Elaine M. Rodgers, said in a court filing in the Wilmington case that she was instructed to spot "yeshivas" by customers' accents and addresses, though she said agents used the word to mean Hasidic Jews in particular.
Avis said that no customers had complained about prejudice against Jews and that it did not screen customers by accent or name. "The suggestion that there was any anti-Semitic motive to it is preposterous," John H. Carley, the Avis general counsel, said. Agents may have applied the term "yeshiva" more generally to customers who tried to deceive the company, he said. "Ultimately, it may have been used to denote in some minds a problem, not an ethnic group," he added.
Far larger numbers of former employees -- about 15 in the Carolinas and several more in Tulsa -- have described discrimination by Mr. Dalton and his five franchises, with some instances dating back two decades. Mr. Dalton, several said, instructed them to find any pretext for turning down blacks, whom he often referred to in derogatory terms, and also shunned members of the military. His business rationale was that blacks were more likely to return cars dirty or damaged or use them to deal in drugs.
According to a statement that an Avis complaint handler in Tulsa filed in the Wilmington case, Mr. Dalton said, "I own these cars, and I can rent to whomever I want."
That policy, according to the three black women who filed the class action lawsuit, humilated them -- spoiling vacations, family reunions and other long-held plans. One of the plaintiffs, Lerline E. Wilson, made a telephone reservation to drive a rental car about 300 miles from Mr. Dalton's Florence, S.C., lot to visit a mother-in-law dying of cancer in Kentucky. When she showed up at the counter, according to the lawsuit, Ms. Wilson -- then 54 -- was told she was too old to drive so far.
Several employees of the Dalton franchises said they had forwarded complaints to the Avis service center in Tulsa. Here, employees said they had alerted their bosses, including those at company headquarters.
"You can imagine the disgust," said Dixie Dean Bailey, a former Avis employee in Tulsa who recalled having more than 100 conversations with Mr. Dalton about the complaints. "In order to get your paycheck, you had to file reports, but nothing was ever done."
Sue P. Parker, third in command at Tulsa from 1985 to 1994, said in a court filing that the complaints came up at meetings attended by all the top Avis executives. Mr. Silverman, however, said that until former employees made sworn statements late last year, the company lacked enough evidence to take action. Most top Avis executives have left since the acquisition by HFS.
[On Monday, HFS named R. Craig Hoenshell, a former American Express executive and Wall Street consultant, as the new chairman and chief executive of Avis.]
The accusations of bias against Avis and other rental companies have prompted the New York State Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, to schedule a hearing on March 31.
On Tuesday, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, plans to introduce a bill in Congress to keep car rental companies from charging higher rates based on where customers live -- as Hertz and Budget do for residents of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, no matter where they rent in New York City.
"The kind of discrimination we're talking about is broad-brushed and callous," Mr. Schumer said. "Once they say anyone from Queens pays a higher rate, maybe it's a short step to saying anyone who's a black or Jew deserves a higher rate as well."
Budget charged Bronx drivers $127.99 a day -- $54 more than the regular rate -- for picking up a car in Manhattan, according to a report by Mr. Schumer's office in February. The company's chairman, Jack A. Frazee, said in a letter to Mr. Schumer on March 5 that Budget was seeking to limit its losses in New York City -- $8 million last year, he said -- by charging more to those most likely to steal their cars or have accidents, including residents of some boroughs.
"It is a fairness in pricing concept," Mr. Frazee said, similar to the geographical rating systems used by insurance companies.

HEADLINE: Study of Ocean Currents Offers Clues to Global Climate Shifts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
As scientists struggle to understand how and why the earth's climate is changing, they are increasingly looking deep into the oceans, where oscillations in water temperature that travel on stately currents from one continent to another may cause weather trends to change from decade to decade.
These flip-flops in climate, which scientists suspect owe their slow decadal pacing to the sluggish movement of ocean currents and the sea's prodigious ability to retain heat and move it around, determine whether winter in Northern Europe, Asia and parts of North America will be generally mild or severe -- for 20 to 30 years at a time. They control long-term rainfall patterns over wide areas. They help determine where ocean fish can thrive and where they cannot. 
 And now, scientists are studying them for clues to whether the earth's climate will be warmer in the future than it is now, and to why the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia vanished thousands of years ago.
One of the major oscillations, in the North Atlantic, may be in the process of switching to a new state, one with far-reaching implications for the study of global warming.
Since the 1970's, scientists say, the North Atlantic oscillation and a similar oscillation in the Pacific have made the continents of the Northern Hemisphere unusually warm, on the average, in winter and spring. This natural heating is believed to be a major reason for an especially sharp rise in the average global surface temperature from the 1970's to the 1990's. Mainstream scientists say emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide are also partly responsible, but they do not know which effect is more important.
The change in the North Atlantic oscillation may tell them. Last year it made its sharpest reversal on record, cooling off Eurasia and casting Northern Europe into two harsh winters in a row. North America cooled as well, though the mechanism is less clear. If the overall rise in global temperatures continues in the face of continental cooling, it would offer strong support to the theory that human activity -- particularly the emission of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere -- is disrupting the global climate system.
Just as important, climatologists would have a better idea of the magnitude of any human impact. The last cool period linked to ocean oscillations, in the 1950's and 1960's, interrupted a century-long global warming trend that resumed only when the oscillation switched again in the 1970's. This time, though, average global temperature remained at a near-record level last year despite the cooler continents. But two winters' data do not establish a trend, so scientists will be watching intently to see what happens in the years just ahead.
"If we decide the system has flipped, and if then the global warming were to continue, that would be kind of disconcerting," said Dr. Michael S. McCartney, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Woods Hole, Mass.
Climate oscillates on seasonal, annual, decadal and century-long time scales, with smaller swings imposed on larger ones. But it is the decade-to-century scale that is most relevant to the question of human-induced climate change, since that is the shortest span over which it can be reliably detected.
On this scale, the oceans provide the heartbeat of climate: their inertia determines the pace of natural change. Climatic oscillations in the atmosphere, many scientists believe, would play out rapidly if they were stripped of their contact with the seas. But because the ocean and the atmosphere are linked by the mutual transfer of heat, moisture and motion, the atmosphere to a great extent must dance to the tempo of the seas.
So far, scientists studying oscillations on the decade-to-century scale have concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere, where both the Pacific and Atlantic climatic seesaws affect mainly the winter and spring seasons. In one phase of the Pacific oscillation, sea-surface temperatures in the western three-quarters of the North Pacific are cooler than normal, while the tropics are warmer. In this state, the tropical sea warmth extends northward along the North American coast to west of the Gulf of Alaska. This creates an atmospheric pattern in which winters tend to be milder and drier in Alaska, Canada and the Pacific Northwest, cooler in the Southeastern United States and wetter in the Southwest.
This pattern has been entrenched since the mid-1970's; before that, starting about 1945, sea-surface temperature relationships were reversed, and so were the atmospheric consequences. Temperature patterns recorded by tree rings show that these flip-flops have come every 20 to 30 years for the last 200 years, suggesting that a new flip might now be due. But it is too soon to tell whether that is happening, said Dr. John M. Wallace, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. "It's very difficult to know where you are in real time," he said. "It's easy with hindsight to go back and see when it flipped."
A number of ideas have been proposed about what drives the Pacific oscillation. One says that subsurface ocean machinations outside the tropics are responsible. Another holds that interactions between the tropical and mid-latitude oceans are the cause. Some scientists suggest that El Nino, the vast pool of unusually warm surface water that comes and goes every few years in the eastern tropical Pacific, may in some fashion trip the trigger for decade-to-decade oscillations.
Strikingly different forces appear to be at work in the Atlantic. There, Dr. McCartney and other scientists are focusing on a huge, powerful current that carries warm water from the vicinity of Florida to the coast of Ireland before turning westward, cooling, sinking and curling back south near Labrador. The existence of this oceanic pipeline, which begins as the Gulf Stream and becomes the North Atlantic Current as it heads east across the ocean, has long been known. But Dr. McCartney believes, based on observations at sea, that it is linked with the atmosphere to produce the North Atlantic oscillation's interdecadal rhythm.
His analysis and that of others has found that deep-lying parcels of unusually warm water move continually through the pipeline, alternating with cooler ones. Each parcel takes about 20 years to travel from the tropics, around the North Atlantic circuit to Labrador. Observations indicate that sea-surface temperatures rise and fall in concert with the movement of these parcels and with the speed of the pipeline current -- and atmospheric pressure above the sea appears to rise and fall in concert with all the other factors.
When these factors are in one phase of the oscillation, characterized by lower sea-surface temperatures, powerful west-to-east winds across the Atlantic are on average stronger. This carries more oceanic warmth to Northern Europe and Asia, making for milder winters there (though cooler, the ocean is still warmer than the land). An analysis by Dr. James Hurrell of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has shown that in this phase, Northern Europe has more precipitation than normal, while Southern Europe and the Middle East have less.
When the system flips, the opposite is true: the westerlies weaken and shift southward, making Northern Europe much colder and drier but bringing more warmth and precipitation to Mediterranean Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Eastern Canada and Greenland are warmer.
While the system's elements do indeed appear to work in concert as Dr. McCartney says, not all aspects of his explanation of the oscillation's workings are nailed down, said Dr. Hugo Bezdek, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami. "I wouldn't call it an airtight case yet," he said. For one thing, he said, the origin of the warm-water parcels that move through the pipeline is unknown; for another, evidence of the ocean's connection to the atmosphere "is suggestive, but I wouldn't call it robust."
Nor has anyone yet figured out exactly how the oscillation functions. Some still say the atmosphere may be driving the system, but others say that given the oscillation's stately pace, it is more likely that either the ocean is driving the atmosphere or that the two are locked in a perpetual feedback loop.
"If Mike's right, this is a dynamite idea," Dr. Bezdek said. "Then you have a scheme to make some predictions," something of enormous economic value. It would be possible, for instance, to forecast rainfall trends in Europe and probably the Middle East and North Africa years ahead.
It might also be possible to predict the abundance of oceanic fish like cod, which depend ultimately on tiny marine animals for their subsistence. A recent study has found that the abundance of one such animal, a copepod called Calanus finmarchicus, rises and falls in close concert with the North Atlantic oscillation. Other studies have found that populations of Alaskan salmon and Japanese sardines similarly vary with the North Pacific oscillation.
New evidence is also emerging that implicates the North Atlantic oscillation as the cause of a long drought that archeologists believe caused the collapse, starting about 4,200 years ago, of the ancient Akkadian civilization of Mesopotamia.
Two paleoclimatologists at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Heidi Cullen and Dr. Peter deMenocal, extracted a sediment core from the bottom of the Persian Gulf that, they say, shows that huge amounts of dust blew off the Mesopotamian landscape about 4,200 years ago, just as the Akkadian drought was beginning. Another Lamont researcher, Dr. Gerard Bond, produced evidence from ice cores of a North Atlantic cooling at the same time.
Building on Dr. Hurrell's work showing that precipitation in Istanbul, near the headwaters of the life-giving Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, has varied in phase with the North Atlantic oscillation, Ms. Cullen analyzed Turkish precipitation records in detail and concluded that when the North Atlantic was cold, the headwaters region was cooler and drier and water flows dropped in the streams that supplied Mesopotamia's water.
Whether the North Atlantic oscillation could operate over time scales of a century or more, where even larger climate swings have taken place in the last few thousand years, is unclear. "There's no evidence that it couldn't happen, and no evidence that it did," Dr. Bond said. Even so, he said, the ocean could well play some major role in the large, centuries-long climatic fluctuations; variations in the sun's output are another possible cause.
The two biggest of these fluctuations in recent millenniums were the Medieval warm period, when northern climes were so balmy that the Vikings colonized Greenland and vineyards grew in Britain; and the Little Ice Age, when much of Europe starved in the cold. An especially clear record of these swings, as well as shorter recent ones, has emerged from ocean sediments on the Bermuda Rise, a hump in the ocean floor on which Bermuda sits.
There, Dr. Lloyd D. Keigwin, a paleoclimatologist at the Woods Hole institution, has tracked the swings for the last 3,000 years by analyzing the fossilized carbonate shells of tiny animals called foraminifera, in this case a species named Globigerinoides ruber, which lives year-round on the surface of the Sargasso Sea. The shells' chemical content changes according to how cold the climate was at a given time, and Dr. Keigwin has found in them evidence of the larger swings. The shells clearly reflect, for instance, two periods of Medieval warmth, 500 and 1,000 years ago, as well as an even more pronounced warming about 2,500 years ago. The shells show the depths of the Little Ice Age about 300 years ago.
"The evidence of natural oscillations is clear," Dr. Keigwin said. "They have been going on as long as we can look back in time." According to the shells, a recovery from the Little Ice Age is still going on. The big message from the Bermuda Rise, Dr. Keigwin says, is that to whatever extent humans are warming the climate, that warming is coming on top of a natural post-Little Ice Age warming. "It could be," he said, "that whatever is driving these oscillations in the ocean may overwhelm what we're doing to the atmosphere -- or it could be that we're making a bad situation worse."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Science Times last Tuesday with an article about the effects of ocean currents on the global climate misstated deviations from the average high air temperatures at the Kodiak, King Salmon and Cold Bay weather stations in Alaska since 1900. A corrected chart appears today on page C7.

GRAPHIC: Diagrams: "Currents Carry Climate Change"
Scientists studying ocean currents are gathering increasingly detailed data on how variations in ocean temperature influence climate. Among other things, they have discovered decades-long cycles in water temperature in the North Atlantic current running from the Gulf of Mexico to northern Europe and back again.
 
Seemingly minor temperature changes can cause long-term population shifts among copepods like this one and other microscopic plankton. Now researchers are tracking how plankton levels are linked to scarcity or abundance of larger creatures.
 
"Gyres, Currents and Weather"
Water in the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current, which courses between two vast gyres, or ocean-wide eddies, alternately runs warmer and cooler for periods of about 20 years years each, scientists say. They suspect that this sets off an atmospheric chain reaction that alters the strength and position of the westerly winds, making Northern Europe and Asia either generally colder or warmer in winter and spring.
 
Researchers working near Bermuda tracked changes in ocean temperature over thousand of years by measuring changes sediments bearing the fossil shells of microscopic creatures that live in the Sargasso Sea.
 
"A New Oscillation Begins?"
Starting in the 1970's, oscillations in the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans brought generally warm winter and spring weather to Northern Europe, Asia and parts of North America. Now scientists say the Atlantic pattern may be changing to colder weather, and they wonder whether global temperatures will continue to rise.

HEADLINE: The Job Engine Sputters

BYLINE: By Charles R. Morris; Charles R. Morris, a business and financial consultant, is the author of "The Cost of Good Intentions: New York City and the Liberal Experiment."

 BODY:
Joe L. Roby, president of the securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, took home $33 million last year. Perhaps shareholders did not mind, because the company, like most of Wall Street, had a very good year. But Mr. Roby apparently did not spend much of his wealth in New York's bodegas, for the city's unemployment rate rose last year to 9.9 percent, one of the nation's highest big-city rates. And therein lies a historical disjuncture.
In 1968, when Wall Street was enjoying a similarly long-running market boom, the unemployment rate in New York fell to 3.1 percent, much lower than the national average and lower than in any other big city except Dallas. The unemployment rate among blacks was only 4 percent, about half the level in the rest of the nation. 
Even in the 1980's, the recovery on Wall Street created hundreds of thousands of jobs, not even counting spinoff employment for building maintenance people and limo drivers. These were the glory days when midlevel clerical workers were pocketing $75,000 to $80,000 in salary and bonuses, and secretaries who worked past 6:30 got overtime, dinner money and a driver to take them home.
During the 1996 market boom, by contrast, the city's financial sector created only 12,500 new jobs, and those include jobs generated by all the stepped-up activity among printers, law firms and accountants. By the end of the year, Wall Street was actually cutting employment.
Since its 1989-91 recession, Wall Street has been automating with a vengeance. Until the 1980's, most trading and securities transfers were paper-based. It took an army of worker-ants to deliver, register and keep custody over millions of bond and stock certificates, and to make sure that dividends and interest were collected on schedule and properly accounted for. But the big market players have long since switched from paper to computerized registries, and the worker-ants are obsolete.
New York City has managed to retain its share of the financial services business in the 1990's, but only by keeping a rough parity with the cost-efficiency of a host of new competitors -- off-hours exchanges, computerized trading systems and discount brokers. The shareholders and top executives of the big corporations can continue to pocket big profits and bonuses only if they keep rigid control over operating costs. Even with its recent streamlining, Wall Street is still far from a model of efficiency, and the downsizing that is likely to follow the next market downturn may be cataclysmic.
The old Wall Street job engine was the last vestige of New York as Empire City, when its position as the world's business, financial, entertainment and media center cushioned the economic ups and downs. But New York can no longer defy the economic laws of gravity. Most of the recent business revolutions, like those in computer technology and biotechnology, have simply passed it by. That the city has derived little benefit from the biotechnology boom is especially disturbing, because there is an exceptional academic and research base here, and most of the big pharmaceutical companies are just across the river in New Jersey.
With the aging of the baby boomers, health care could be a real growth industry in the city. Despite its bad reputation, health care is a rapidly growing, technology-intensive and, believe it or not, high-productivity industry. (Just compare the cost and success rate of, say, knee cartilage surgery 15 years ago with the mostly outpatient procedures done today.) But in New York, the health care industry is burdened with the huge overhead of big teaching institutions. High costs could chase away insurers and push more business to suburban hospitals and outpatient centers.
Like the old Soviet Union, New York has acquired its own nomenklatura, a privileged elite who feed off the regulations and high costs that make the city such a mine field for everyone else. Take the rent laws that benefit the well-to-do on the Upper West Side and create artificial scarcities and exorbitant prices in the "free market." Or the featherbedding entertainment unions that almost succeeded in driving serious theater out of the city. Or the blackbird flock of inspectors, "environmental consultants," lawyers and mortgage brokers who collect a toll from routine daily transactions.
Only in New York, and places like Beijing, does one hire "expediters" to obtain routine government approvals. In a city of small businesses, we levy punitive taxes on small proprietors -- a flat 4 percent on anyone making more than $20,000, in addition to a uniquely high municipal income tax.
City government can help, but not by trying to create biotechnology venture capital funds, as some have suggested. It should simply do well what it is supposed to do, like run decent schools and keep the streets safe.
The Giuliani administration has made some promising starts. The recent reductions in crime -- assuming the administration deserves even half the credit it claims -- must count as the most important economic development program in years. But promising starts are just promising starts. Rolling back the bureaucratic encrustations will be the work of decades.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Tuning In to Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
"One of the strangest consequences of the Second World War," Aaron Copland wrote in 1967, "has been the belated discovery that there is music to the south of us." This was, of course, a rhetorical flourish: Copland, of all people, knew listeners were still getting used to the idea that music was composed on the Western side of the Atlantic, and it cannot have surprised him that audiences were slow to recognize Latin American concert music. He crusaded for it, using its rhythms and melodic turns in works like "El Salon Mexico" and "Danzon Cubano," and forging professional links between North, Central and South American composers. Yet for all that, the "music to the south of us" remains largely uncharted territory in the United States and Europe.
Now Dennis Russell Davies, the music director of the American Composers Orchestra, has taken up the cause. With Tania Leon, the composer, as his Latin American music adviser, Mr. Davies has devoted part of every season to a Sonidos de las Americas festival, a methodical exploration of the region's music. Puerto Rico was the focus of the fourth installment, a week of concerts, symposiums and master classes that ended with an orchestral performance on Sunday at Carnegie Hall. 
 The concerts included everything from quaint chamber music and advanced orchestral scores to vibrant pop amalgams showing influences of African drumming, Spanish folk melody and North American jazz and rock. Listeners intent on looking beyond the standard canon can only admire Mr. Davies's efforts, which in past seasons have brought Mexican, Venezuelan and Brazilian music into the spotlight.
But festivals of this sort inevitably raise questions. One is whether they have any lasting effect, and so far the answer seems to be no. Brazilian and Mexican concert works have long had a marginal presence in New York concert halls; the festivals have not noticeably increased it, nor has there been a lingering curiosity about Venezuelan music among musicians and programmers.
Related is the question of whether this music is so compelling that it demands a place in the concert repertory. Several of the chamber works offered early in the week were not: The Chopinesque "Danzas" of the 19th-century composer Juan Morel Campos and a more recent set of piano duets, "De Barrio Obrero a la Quince," by William Ortiz, had a charming salon quality, but a single hearing was sufficient.
Hector Campos Parsi's Sonatina No. 2, on the other hand, has gritty energy that catches a listener's imagination. Henry Hutchinson, a violinist, and Jose Ramos-Santana, a pianist, gave it a stately reading on Monday at Weill Recital Hall, but it sounded more vigorous two nights later at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, where Mr. Ramos-Santana had to make do with a funky upright piano.
There were also several keepers among the orchestral works Mr. Davies conducted on Sunday. Mr. Campos Parsi's "Divertimento" is a charming, sunny 1950's-vintage Neo-Classical suite. Loyda Camacho's "Ensayo" had an alluring eeriness and a strong profile, but the most powerful work offered all week was Roberto Sierra's "Glosas Para Piano y Orquesta," an edgy, chromatic score that Mr. Ramos-Santana played with virtuosity and precision.
There was, however, little in these works that seemed identifably Puerto Rican, and that raised a question that pervaded the festival and its literature: what is Puerto Rican music? And in truth, the most vital music presented all week, and the most uninhibitedly Puerto Rican, was not from the classical tradition at all. Los Planeros de la 21, at Weill Recital Hall on Tuesday, and William Cepeda's Boricua Ensemble, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, on Wednesday, played amplified, heavily percussive music buoyed by its rhythmic complexities and its bursts of bright-edged brass playing.
Those qualities, and questions of identity, also came together in William Ortiz's "Rican," a pop opera presented at Weill Recital Hall on Tuesday evening. Mr. Ortiz's protagonist, Louie Goya Beans, is disillusioned with life on New York's economic periphery and moves to Puerto Rico, only to find that he has no real connection to the country's culture. Returning to New York, he comes to terms with his place in the hybrid Nuyorican culture. Mr. Ortiz's score is fetchingly melodic and full of energy, yet Louie's journey is more clearly captured in the libretto than in the music: the New York scene is in English, the Puerto Rican episode is in Spanish, and the conclusion is in Spanglish.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls and Mark Surges On Warning of Delay for Euro

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply and the mark surged yesterday after a senior Bundesbank official offered one of the strongest warnings yet that Germany might not qualify for Europe's planned single currency.
The remarks by the official, Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, amplified concerns that the January 1999 debut of the single currency, the Euro, would have to be delayed because even the most economically powerful country in Europe might not be able to meet its strict entry criteria. That would still leave the mark as the pre-eminent European currency. 
 "Fear of delay in European monetary union is finding roots in the market, and people are jumping right back into the mark," said Stephen Flanagan, a senior foreign exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6727 marks, down from 1.6894 marks on Monday and the lowest level in three weeks. The dollar fell to 122.43 yen from 123.66 yen. The pound rose to $1.5901 from $1.5888.
Mr. Kuhbacher, a member of the Bundesbank's central council, told the German magazine Borse Online that it was highly doubtful that Germany could limit its 1997 government deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product as required for monetary union participation, and for that reason "a delay of the Euro's introduction is inevitable."
His comments followed similar anxieties over monetary union on Monday, when the German Finance Minister and other Bundesbank officials suggested a delay was preferable to softening the stringent criteria.
The Bundesbank's monthly report for February released yesterday also helped intensify doubts about Germany's chances of meeting the budget deficit criterion, saying that depended on whether "extra burdens can be offset," a reference to increased public spending costs as a result of Germany's welfare burdens and high unemployment.
The dollar weakened against the yen in early Asian dealings after the Japanese Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said the Government would announce measures by March 31 to help improve Japan's distressed real estate market and help Japanese banks reduce their enormous burden of bad loans.

HEADLINE: AT BREAKFAST WITH: Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.;
Power Brokers In New York: Beware Iridescent Ties

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
JOHNNIE L. COCHRAN JR. may be, as he proclaims, the King of Los Angeles, but he hasn't figured out where to have lunch in this town yet. The most famous lawyer in America right now, he is intimidated by Manhattan, where he has been living four days a week since January, working as a moderator for "Cochran & Grace," a nightly legal analysis show on Court TV.
One problem is that he hasn't settled into his nesting rhythm. "Where do you get your creature comforts?" he asked the other day at breakfast, appearing genuinely perplexed. "Where do you get a manicure? Where do you get a facial?" 
 Although Mr. Cochran is establishing a beachhead in Manhattan, he has a way to go before he can call himself a New Yorker. Recently, he wore a most un-New York double-breasted mauve suit with a lavender pocket handkerchief and an enameled lapel pin of a rose. His ties have been dipped in colors unknown in these parts: iridescent violet, gold, peacock blue. His wristwatch keeps a New York minute, but his cuff links are miniature gold-rimmed clocks that keep West Coast time.
And then there is his Manhattan learning curve. "Bob Morgenthau," he mused, rolling the name around. "He's the former D.A. here, right?" No, he's in his 23d year.
But at 59, Mr. Cochran is expanding his empire eastward. He rents a two-bedroom apartment on the 47th floor of a West 57th Street power palace, which has a private health club for residents, including Michael Ovitz and Diana Ross. Another perk is the 30th-floor private dining room where he is having breakfast, which has a chef at the ready and just eight tables. So what if it's in a no-name, tourists' neighborhood?
His Los Angeles firm has picked up two New York clients, one in Manhattan and the other in Buffalo. He is renting an office in TriBeCa with two former Dream Team lawyers, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld.
He has a New York public relations agent who has filled his calendar with social-conscience appearances at public schools and society-conscious parties.
And consider the ultimate change-of-address form: When this reporter called directory assistance in Los Angeles for his office number there, the operator replied, "Here it is, but Johnnie Cochran has moved to New York, you know."
All of which is to say that Mr. Cochran considers a certain double homicide in Brentwood to be 3,000 miles and 18 months behind him. "It changed my life, but I have moved beyond that case," Mr. Cochran said, sipping on his banana-strawberry smoothie.
Yet, the Simpson case remains his meal ticket to national celebrity: the reason he was given a cable show and is invited to speak by law schools and black churches alike, and why his autobiography, "Journey to Justice," written with Tim Rutten (One World/Ballantine) did well. His publisher said 345,000 copies of a 500,000 printing had been sold.
As he holds the case off with one arm and embraces it with the other, Mr. Cochran is trying to reposition himself as a civil rights champion and a lawyer of national prominence.
But the notoriety of the Simpson case sticks to him. Steve Brill, the founder of Court TV, said that the hate mail the network received about Mr. Cochran was more virulent than any they had received about other controversial lawyers.
Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor, said the resentment toward Mr. Cochran was no mystery. "The fact that this is a black guy who is affluent, who is condemning racism and who is obviously going higher and higher on the celebrity stock market and making good money drives a lot of people wild," he said.
Whether Mr. Cochran finds a permanent spot among social commentators or has to settle for being a garden-variety celebrity, he acknowledges that he has a lot to learn about television. His hourlong program, which also features Nancy Grace, an Atlanta prosecutor, lets him explore legal issues far removed from the Simpson case. But it also puts him in an adversarial relationship with the television prompter: reading from it makes him sound like the on-camera novice he is.
Because his three-year contract requires him to do most shows from Court TV's Third Avenue studios, he is sizing up his new hometown.
"Johnnie called me and said, 'I want to get wired into New York,' " said Earl G. Graves, the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine. " 'Who do you use for a bank?' Chase, I told him. He said, 'But where's the African-American bank?' I told him Carver Federal Savings. 'I want to meet them,' " he said.
"Then he said, 'O.K., now where do you get your hair cut?' "
Mr. Graves gave Mr. Cochran a tour of Harlem. "I saw a community that was larger that ours in L.A. -- with a lot of churches," Mr. Cochran said. "Economically, if they could harness everything, it could be a real force. I saw potential."
But visually, Harlem's decay shook him. "At least in South Central, you see lawns," he said. "In Watts, people live in houses."
In Los Angeles, where he owns two homes, a Rolls-Royce and a Jaguar, Mr. Cochran has been at the epicenter of the power elite -- lawyer to stars like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, good buddy of the former Mayor Tom Bradley -- for a decade. "I don't want the movers and shakers here to think I'm moving in on their space," he said. "But before I'm finished in New York, there's something I'll get involved in, you mark my words."
His New York cases are typical of two sides of Johnnie Cochran. In Manhattan, he is advising a fire victim in what may become a conventional negligence lawsuit but for the client's marquee name: Lionel Hampton, the jazz vibraphonist.
And in the other, Mr. Cochran has an opportunity to win big money and send a big message. He represents the family of a Buffalo woman who was killed crossing traffic on her way to work at a mall that allowed buses from suburbs onto its property but not those traveling through black, inner-city neighborhoods.
Bringing lawsuits to address racial injustice has made Mr. Cochran, a native of Shreveport, La., a seeming contradiction in terms: a civil rights millionaire. Since the early 1980's, he has litigated police-abuse cases on behalf of black and Hispanic clients, winning verdicts totaling more than $40 million.
"I don't apologize for making money in these cases," said the lawyer, who gets 30 percent of an award from a settlement or 40 percent of a civil verdict. He defensively added that he has stood by one client, Geronimo Pratt, a former Black Panther who was convicted of murder, for nearly 25 years without compensation. Last week, Mr. Cochran argued in an Orange County, Calif., court for a new trial for Mr. Pratt.
Mr. Cochran is also a seasoned defendant. His first wife, with whom he has two daughters, divorced him, and during the Simpson trial wrote an angry book, saying he had been abusive -- which he denies. His former mistress, with whom he has a son, is now suing him a second time, saying he broke his promise to support her. He has been married since 1985 to Dale Mason Cochran, a marketing analyst.
Questions about relationships don't ruffle him. Friends say they have never seen him flustered.
But a few days later in his Court TV office, when talk drifted toward the Simpson case, the sleekly affable Mr. Cochran revealed a vindictive streak, jabbing at journalists who wrote harshly about him. He belittled Robert L. Shapiro, the Dream Teamer who denounced him to Barbara Walters. As for Christopher Darden, the former Los Angeles prosecutor whose Simpson book outsold Mr. Cochran's autobiography: "Chris Darden's book did very well. Of course, his book isn't very good."
When asked why the most successful Simpson graduate persisted in picking on those less celebrated, Mr. Cochran, who often wears a Jesus First lapel pin, allowed that it would be more Christian to turn the other cheek. "But look at what they have said about me!" he replied, starting another tirade.
Then, he collected himself and lolled back in his chair, surrounded by the symbols of his new career: a television set, a snow-globe of the Manhattan skyline, and a jar of television makeup, Simpsonesquely named The Great Cover Up.
"My mother used to tell me: 'Son, you're not lucky. Luck is the residue of skill and preparation,' " Mr. Cochran said. "I will never be outprepared by anybody."
So a visitor had to ask, What kind of shoes was he wearing?
Startled, he slipped off his loafers and squinted at the label. "Johnston & Murphy," he purred. His mustache framing his Cheshire cat's grin, he pointedly added, "I've never seen a pair of Bruno Magli shoes."

HEADLINE: Essay;
Should Reno Have Warned Clinton?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Here's why President Clinton was the last to know about China's attempt to influence U.S. policy through contributions by secret intermediaries.
"Yes, the President should know," was Clinton's answer when asked about the failure of his National Security Council to inform him of a warning from F.B.I. counterspies. "It would have provoked . . . a red flag on my part." 
 N.S.C. staffers' claim that they had been told not to pass that intelligence upward was hotly disputed by the F.B.I., and Attorney General Janet Reno said it was all a misunderstanding. But consider the pattern of Justice's reluctance to share information with the White House about Beijing's penetration.
Two weeks before the F.B.I.'s June 3, 1996, briefing of the N.S.C. aides, Reno says she called Anthony Lake, then national security adviser, to alert him. She says she left no message and did not call again.
On Jan. 2 of this year, after reading speculation in this space that economic espionage was at the root of the campaign scandal, N.S.C. lawyer Alan Kreczko took the clipping to Jack Quinn, then White House Counsel, and received authorization to ask Justice about the charge in The Times.
On Jan. 9, Justice's Criminal Division logged in a call from Kreczko, who asked if any briefing of the White House was in the works about allegations in The Times of Chinese espionage. Answer: No briefing of the White House was planned. Not until two months later was the President "briefed" -- when he read of the June F.B.I. visit to the N.S.C. in The Washington Post.
The pattern: (1) the agonized ambivalence of Reno, who started to call Lake in May, but then changed her mind; (2) the F.B.I.'s June visit emphasizing such secrecy that the N.S.C. staffers froze it; (3) the query about espionage investigation six months later from a White House lawyer to the Criminal Division, which was rebuffed.
What does this series of disconnects show? During a long period in which the F.B.I. had warned vulnerable members of Congress and properly notified Hill intelligence oversight, there was a sustained reluctance by Justice to let people close to the President know about an ongoing criminal investigation.
Why? My theory: The Criminal Division has long suspected that officials in the executive branch -- not specifically "covered" by the independent counsel law -- are communicating with Chinese agents to influence Clinton policy.
On that theory, consider Reno's dilemma: If she ordered the F.B.I. to pass the National Security Agency's China surveillance to the executive branch (as it did to the legislative branch) and made certain it received high-level attention with a call to the national security adviser, she would risk tipping White House security risks, letting them destroy evidence or otherwise escape detection. Justice would then be accused of participating in a cover-up.
But if Reno kept the White House in the dark, better to catch the perpetrators in espionage or bribery, Justice would risk letting the President miscalculate China policy. Justice would then be accused of denying the President vital intelligence.
Not an easy call. Justice asserted this week that the F.B.I. in 1995 told State and C.I.A. about Chinese hopes to influence Congress. But here is a fact, hitherto unrevealed, to support my theory that Justice has been pursuing China's espionage in the White House: Top C.I.A. officials, including John Deutch, then Director of Central Intelligence, were never informed of 1996 F.B.I. and National Security Agency intercepts of plans to influence the executive branch.
Two years ago, in a case of clandestine influence not involving China or incriminating U.S. nationals, the F.B.I. kept the C.I.A. fully informed of surveillance. That F.B.I.-C.I.A. pipeline works. The only reason the F.B.I. would deny the C.I.A. such foreign intelligence is that it might jeopardize prosecution of United States citizens.
What should Reno have done? Last May, she should have asked to see the President alone. She should have warned him unequivocally of the penetration, enlisted his aid in the investigation -- or, if she thought it necessary, read him his rights.

HEADLINE: Stuyvesant Town Was Whites-Only 'Welfare'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your March 14 news article on the victory by tenants at Stuyvesant Town in a dispute with their landlord, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, over a botched window replacement project gave a misleading description of the development's origins. 
 This desirable government-subsidized housing for the middle class was not built for all World War II veterans, as your article suggests, but exclusively for whites.
African-American veterans and civil rights groups waged a 10-year battle for integration all the way to the Supreme Court. But the courts proved unwilling to subject the contract signed by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and Metropolitan Life to the 14th Amendment, guaranteeing citizenship rights, sparking a major direct-action protest in New York.
The first fair housing laws in the country for urban redevelopment grew out of this struggle, but the legal victories failed to lead to a meaningful integration at Stuyvesant Town. To this day it remains predominantly white.
The extent of such lawful racial discrimination in "liberal" New York until the 1950's may come as a surprise to many New Yorkers. Today, as governments are slashing benefits for the poor and unemployed, it's imperative to understand the enormous Government benefits that have been received by generations of white Americans.

HEADLINE: U.S. Starts Of Housing Soar 12.2%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Housing starts jumped 12.2 percent in February to the highest level in almost three years, the latest evidence that low unemployment, stock market profits and high levels of consumer confidence are spurring economic growth.
The Commerce Department said today that all regions of the country except the Northeast registered an increase in construction activity. Starts of both single-family and multifamily projects posted solid gains. 
 Analysts had expected a February increase of only 5.9 percent. The 12.2 percent increase pushed the annual rate of housing starts to 1.528 million. January's rise was revised downward, to only seven-tenths of 1 percent from the 2 percent reported originally.
Unusually mild weather contributed to February's gain, analysts said. Labor Department data released earlier this month showed that construction companies added 109,000 jobs during February.
The strong report came amid other signs of economic growth and speculation that Federal Reserve policy makers would raise interest rates at their next meeting, on March 25.
Permits for new housing construction rose 3 percent in February, to 1.442 million at an annual rate, after decreasing 1.5 percent in January.
By category, starts of single-family housing rose 8.8 percent during February from January, while multifamily projects climbed 27.8 percent.
Starts advanced 51.6 percent in the Midwest, to a 385,000 annual rate; 10.9 percent in the South, to 661,000; and 5 percent in the West, to 354,000. They declined 26.9 percent in the Northeast, to an annual pace of 128,000.
Looking ahead, home builders are optimistic, according to a survey released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders. The trade group's housing market index rose 4 points, to 58, in March, the highest reading in eight months. "All the market conditions are ripe for home buying," said Kent Colton, the association's chief executive.

HEADLINE: Foreign Companies Liable For Non-U.S. Price Fixing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 18

 BODY:
Criminal charges of price fixing can be brought against foreign companies even if the act of wrongdoing took place outside the United States, a Federal appeals court has ruled.
The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, was released on Monday. It is believed to be the first time a Federal appeals court has ruled on the legality of criminal charges against foreign businesses on antitrust actions taken outside the United States. 
 The ruling reversed a lower court decision.
The appeals court held that the Nippon Paper Industries Company of Japan can face criminal charges in an American court of conspiring to set the price for thermal fax paper in the United States and Canada.
Nippon Paper, Mitsubishi Paper Mills of Japan, the Appleton Papers unit of Arjo Wiggins Appleton P.L.C. of Britain and two executives were indicted on price-fixing charges in December 1995 by a Federal grand jury here. The three companies were accused of conspiring to increase the price of jumbo rolls of fax paper between February 1990 and February 1992. Small companies and home fax machines use the paper.
Chief District Judge Joseph L. Tauro dismissed the charges last year, agreeing with Nippon Paper's argument that the actions took place in Japan, beyond the reach of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
The Justice Department appealed, arguing that Nippon Paper's reported actions affected the American fax paper market.
"The indictment against N.P.I. is well within the pale," an appeals court judge, Bruce M. Selya, wrote. He also said: "We live in an age of international commerce where decisions reached in one corner of the world can reverberate around the globe in less time than it takes to tell the tale. Thus, a ruling in N.P.I.'s favor would create perverse incentives for those who would use nefarious means to influence markets in the United States."
The charges stemmed from a Justice Department investigation into allegations of price fixing in the $120- million-a-year thermal fax paper industry. The department has obtained guilty pleas in several cases, and has collected more than $10 million in fines.
Mitsubishi Paper Mills pleaded guilty in September 1995 and agreed to a $1.8 million fine.
The Supreme Court since 1945 has allowed foreign companies to be sued for acting outside the United States to block competition in this country. The right to bring such civil suits was reaffirmed by the High Court in 1993.

HEADLINE: Helsinki Journal;
The Finns, East-West Headwaiters, Feel Ill-Served

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 18

 BODY:
For 40 years, Helsinki had been known mainly for saunas, spying and summitry. Finland, the tiny Nordic neighbor of the vast Communist empire, kept its hard-won independence after World War II by pledging a friendship for the Soviet Union that it never really felt.
Forced by geography and the cold-war balance of power to placate Moscow, Finland called itself neutral. The world called its precarious condition Finlandization. 
 When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Finland eagerly sought to join the European Union, shaking off its allegiance to Moscow and carving out a new identity for itself as a loyal partner of the West.
As it prepares to play host, again, to East and West, Finns are experiencing a form of identity crisis. By holding the summit meeting this week Helsinki -- a little like a struggling actor who goes back to waiting on tables to make ends meet -- is returning to a role it thought it had left behind when the Soviet Union collapsed.
"I saw it as a regression," said Risto Penttila, 37, a member of Parliament from the Young Finnish Party. "Instead of finding a role in the new Europe that is our future, we went back to our old position of acting as a broker between East and West."
Finns are also looking backward in another direction. There is no nostalgia for Soviet interference, but as Finland struggles to restructure an economy that went into a tailspin when the Soviet Union fell apart, some are beginning to ask whether their country can retain its social democratic ways if it remolds itself to fit into a Europe preoccupied with reducing the welfare state.
Reliving the past was not the Finnish Government's intention when it impulsively offered Helsinki, two hours from Moscow, as a more convenient place than Washington for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to meet President Clinton. Last January, Mr. Yeltsin was ill, not Mr. Clinton.
Helsinki has been the site of many such meetings in the past, including the famous one that led to the Helsinki Accord of 1975, and it prides itself on efficiency and smooth service.
"Most Finns think it is flattering that the great powers trust us to manage this," said Lasse Lehtinen, a well-known novelist and host of a Lettermanesque weekly talk show. "We are known as the headwaiters of world policy. But this summit definitely has a sense of deja vu."
He was referring to the contentious issue of NATO expansion, which will dominate the summit talks and which has also spilled into Finland's foreign policy and sense of self.
This week, Mr. Yeltsin reopened old wounds by saying in an interview with Finnish journalists that Moscow opposed any attempt by Finland to join NATO, and warning that Finland's nonalignment was an important factor in his decision to agree to Helsinki as a meeting site.
"It was a voice from the past," said Janne Virkkunen, editor in chief of Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's most respected newspaper. "His views were no surprise, but the way he said it was very aggressive and not at all diplomatic."
Mr. Virkkunen, 48, said it reminded him of the days when the head of the Russian news agency in Helsinki would march into the newsroom and berate editors for articles not to Moscow's liking.
Many Finnish citizens who pay no attention to security issues were also irritated by Mr. Yeltsin's remarks.
"That was really bad, like telling little brother what to do," complained Maj Britt Lassenius, a nurse.She said she was concerned mainly that the summit meeting would reawaken old stereotypes of Finland. "Journalists come," she said, "and say it is a cold place where nobody smiles."
The meeting has also reawakened concerns about Finland's relationship to Moscow. In 1995, Finland stated that it would not seek membership in an expanded NATO, but also said it would retain the right to reconsider later. Since then, debate within Finland has boiled up over whether Finland should join. Some favor it, others don't. But the summit meeting has put the issue painfully in the open.
When Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen delivered a report on Finland's security and defense policy to Parliament on Monday, his wording about Finland's relationship to NATO was far more elliptical than it was two years ago. He spoke of a "military alliance" but avoided the word NATO. He omitted the word "reconsider" and said, "Military alignment is always a question that has to be evaluated as a part of the whole security policy."
Pertty Torstyla, a Foreign Ministry official, said: "The policy hasn't changed. We just didn't want to repeat the same language."
Finns are known for their reticence and tact. "Finland does not want to become an issue at this summit," said the American Ambassador, Derek Shearer. "This is not a reversion -- Finland is trying to be of assistance and play a positive diplomatic role in the world."
But others in Helsinki interpreted it as a sign that Finland was backsliding into accommodation with Moscow. "It was a reaction conditioned by the cold war," Mr. Penttila said, "but it is not in line with what Finland is trying to do to position itself at the core of Europe."
Some Finns have also begun to question what their identity should be within Europe. To outsiders, Finland looks like a model of high-tech efficiency and capitalist know-how -- a country so well organized that customers take a number, electronically, to await service in crowded Nokia mobile phone stores.
But the country of five million people went into a deep recession after the Soviet Union collapsed, crushing Finland's lucrative and preferential trade agreements. Finland's economy has picked up a little during the last year, but at 16 percent, its unemployment rate remains one of the highest in Europe.
As the country struggles to cut some of its costly social services, some of its leaders are re-examining Finland's eagerness to meet modern European notions of a free-market economy.
"When we lost our planned economy after the Soviet Union fell apart, some people thought we should throw out a lot of hard work we did for our nation," said Sirpa Pietikainen, a member of the Conservative Party in Parliament. She was referring to free education, day care and other generous Finnish social services.
"We embraced monetarism and capitalism too quickly," she said. "It is not our way. We have to recapture what we call our Nordic welfare concept, which is deeply rooted here."

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Wolf At the Corporate Door;
It's the Era of the Civilized Hostile Takeover

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Ronald C. Cambre, chairman of the Newmont Mining Corporation, was prepared for the looming takeover battle. Newmont had survived an assault once before, at the height of the 1980's hostile takeover frenzy, fending off one of the most aggressive corporate raiders, none other than the Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens.
And now Mr. Cambre had at his side Steven McArthur Heller of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank that has long portrayed itself as the defense adviser of choice for targets of hostile bids. 
 But this was the 1990's, the era of globalization and finding the right business "fit." Corporate America's view of hostile takeovers had evolved from outraged to indulgent, and so had Mr. Cambre's -- so much so that this time around, he was the predator instead of the prey. At first, his secret merger talks last year with the company he coveted, the Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation, were friendly. But when he realized shortly after Thanksgiving that his would-be partner was planning to break off the engagement and tie the knot with Newmont's rival, the Homestake Mining Company, he turned on Santa Fe with a fury.
Three months later, he emerged victorious, acquiring Santa Fe for $2.43 billion and creating the biggest gold-mining company in North America.
"The hostile deals of the 1980's were made by people viewed as bust-up artists and speculators looking for short-term profit," said Robert Kindler, a partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore who specializes in takeovers. "The deals today are strategically driven. Companies believe that if they can only achieve their goals through a hostile bid, they're willing to do it."
What a difference a decade makes. In the 1980's, takeover battles were like Wild West shootouts, and descriptions of the strife relied on the imagery of violence: greenmailers and raiders with their bear hugs and Saturday night specials were pitted against white knights and corporate managers who fended off their attackers with poison pills and shark repellent. There was even a famous "Predators Ball" to celebrate the mayhem.
Today, a new respectability reigns in the takeover game. No longer do the likes of Mr. Pickens, Ronald O. Perelman and Carl C. Icahn begin raids with high-risk junk bonds only to carve up their acquisitions and sell off the pieces for a quick profit. Instead, corporations seek to forge "strategic alliances" that will enable them to grow and prosper in an increasingly competitive marketplace. And the lexicon of even the most hostile endeavors is filled with sober phrases like synergy, the global marketplace and accretion to earnings.
And almost everybody, it seems, is doing it. Mainstays of the Fortune 500 like Johnson & Johnson and I.B.M. began their first hostile takeovers in 1995. In January, the Hilton Hotels Corporation made a $10.5 billion hostile bid for the ITT Corporation, and a month later H. F. Ahmanson & Company, a large savings and loan company on the West Coast, made a $5.9 billion hostile offer for the Great Western Financial Corporation in an attempt to shift toward retail banking. This week, Ahmanson sweetened the bid to $6.6 billion.So far this year, there have been 12 hostile or unsolicited bids, totaling $25 billion.
Once content to tend their regulated monopoly franchises, utilities and railroads are suddenly conducting their own raucous hostile battles in the wake of deregulation and consolidation. Western Resources Inc. not only won the first hostile takeover in the utility industry last month, but the company hired David C. Wittig, a takeover specialist from Salomon Brothers, to be its president. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company who once likened Mr. Perelman to "the Huns and the Visigoths" for his hostile raid on Revlon in 1986, now works with the financier.
American corporations today have been so thoroughly downsized and restructured that there is little fat for a 1980's-style raider to squeeze out. And junk bonds have mostly dried up as a source of corporate financing. In the 90's, the driving force behind takeovers is the scramble to stay big and strong enough to withstand the twin currents of globalization and deregulation.
As a result of the more businesslike environment, even the losers in the current crop of takeover battles display a gentility that would have been unthinkable in the 1980's. Jack E. Thompson, chairman of Homestake, for example, took his failure to gain control of Santa Fe with equanimity.
"In order to compete, there is a critical mass you have to have today," Mr. Thompson said matter-of-factly. "It was a reasonable reaction for Newmont to try and grab Santa Fe by any means. I was a little set back by some of the subsequent comments. All in all, I thought it was pretty professional, but not a pleasant thing to go through." In fact, he added, "I can see circumstances where we might end up in a hostile bid."
Wayne W. Murdy, executive vice president of Newmont, had no hard feelings, either. "We felt that the synergies between our companies were so strong that we wanted the opportunity to take our story to the Santa Fe shareholders," he said.
With a rising stock market, corporations are well financed for such deals. At the same time, investors are playing one of the raiders' old roles -- prodding chief executives to increase earnings. When revenues are flat, many corporate chiefs now look to combine with similar businesses in order to dominate markets and cut costs by eliminating overlapping operations.
No industry is immune from the new merger fervor. Last year, the Dayton Hudson Corporation withdrew from an attempted $6.9 billion takeover of the J. C. Penney Company after Penney rejected the offer, but both companies, as well as the the Kmart Corporation, remain prime targets of other expansion-minded retailers, in the view of some investment bankers. With convergence in vogue in the rapidly deregulating utility industry, nearly any natural-gas company is a potential target for an electric utility hoping to grow and survive into the next century.
In finance, banks and insurance companies that want to invade Wall Street have increasingly been looking at companies from Paine Webber Group Inc. to the American Express Company as potential takeover targets, friendly or otherwise. In a possible prelude to a takeover attempt, the Bank of New York Company announced earlier this year that it would try to increase its stake in the State Street Boston Corporation after merger talks between the two companies had failed.
And Newmont Mining's conquest of Santa Fe has only fueled speculation that more takeover activity may be at hand in the gold-mining industry, with both the Battle Mountain Gold Company in Houston and Getchell Gold Corporation in Englewood, Colo., considered as prime candidates.
Yet all this activity draws little of the outrage vented at the swashbuckling raiders of a decade ago. John E. Hayes Jr., chairman of Western Resources, drew little criticism for breaking a vow he made five years ago not to be "involved in hostile takeover activity" when he started not one but two takeover bids last year -- one for the Kansas City Power and Light Company and the other for ADT Inc., the giant home-security company. Has corporate America been worn down -- or co-opted? "The new respectability is really a product of the shift from financial transactions to strategic transactions and a shift in the nature of the bidders," said Martin Lipton, a partner with the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which that specializes in corporate takeovers and invented the poison pill defense. "When you have I.B.M. and Johnson & Johnson doing it, you're hard pressed to say it's not respectable."
Certainly, executives at the International Business Machines Corporation thought they had no other choice in 1995 but to begin their first hostile raid on the Lotus Development Corporation, an event that also marked the first hostile takeover in the software industry. With consolidation afoot in the industry, it had become increasingly important for computer manufacturers to forge direct links with software companies or risk being held captive to a competitor.
Lawrence Ricciardi, general counsel to I.B.M., acknowledged that the company had some trepidation about a takeover attempt, particularly when Lotus's greatest asset -- its employees -- might flee from an ugly dogfight. So, the company issued a $10.3 billion bid, high enough to be taken seriously on Wall Street and at Lotus, and honed a story of how well matched the two companies were to assuage the fears of Lotus employees.
"We had had conversations with Lotus and weren't able to persuade them to make a deal with us," said Mr. Ricciardi, a veteran, like Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chief executive, of RJR Nabisco in its shell-shocked, post-takeover days. "We were concerned that if we kept pushing them on a friendly basis, we might drive them into the arms of a third party. The only surprise in the end was that it was the shortest hostile deal to turn into a negotiated transaction, only seven days."
The recent bidding war for Conrail Inc., the Philadelphia-based railroad that had a virtual monopoly over rail freight in the Northeast, by the CSX Corporation of Richmond and the Norfolk Southern Corporation of Norfolk, Va., was also driven by a fear of being left behind in an expanding market. Conrail agreed this month to a $10.3 billion deal that would split the railroad between the two suitors.
To be sure, hostile takeover attempts still represent a minority of the record-breaking number of mergers today. According to the Securities Data Company, there were 73 hostile or unsolicited bids announced in 1996 and 97 in 1995, with a combined value of $155 billion. In 1988, however, there were 168 hostile bids valued at a total of $222 billion.
"It's still very hard to accomplish a hostile deal, even though it's clear there is no longer a stigma attached to doing one," Mr. Kindler of Cravath Swaine said. "The courts have become more favorable to target companies, and you have to be certain when you start a hostile bid that there is no other company in the world that is willing to pay more."
John Gutfreund, the former chairman of Salomon Brothers, offers a rare voice of caution, suggesting that mergers that appear to make sense today because of rising stock prices could backfire if the economy turns sour. "Shareholders, particularly institutional shareholders, want to get the fastest possible large return and that, in effect, endorses behavior that was previously considered unclub-like," Mr. Gutfreund said. "The deal makers cut the cloth to fit the fashion."
And Mr. Rohatyn notes that for all the difference in style between the current spate of mergers and those of the 1980's, both tend to result in mass layoffs. "It is a social issue," he said, that is still festering."

Chart/Graph: "A History of Hostility"
EARLY 1980's -- The raiders who symbolized the hostile takeover made their reputations early in the decade. Carl C. Icahn, took control of T.W.A. in 1986 and sought to break up USX the same year. Ronald O. Perelman, bought Revlon after a protracted fight. Takeover campaigns by T. Boone Pickens, forced Gulf into the arms of Chevron and saddled Unocal with billions of dollars of debt.
 
LATE 1980's -- The heyday of the hostile takeover. Multibillion dollar deals, often financed by junk bonds, became routine; any company with sizable assets on its balance sheet was fair game. The signature deals included Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company's $30.6 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 and the Campeau Corporation's purchase of Federated Department Stores for $6.5 billion the same year.
 
LATE 1990's -- After a lull in the early 1990's, hostile takeovers have returned -- but with a new respectability. Blue-chip companies intent on global leadership are gobbling up rivals or growing to survive. In 1995, for example, I.B.M. acquired Lotus Development in a lighting strike. This year, Hilton and H.F. Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings, have gone after ITT and Great Western, respectively.

Bonds Steady As Early Loss Is Reversed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mostly unchanged yesterday, after erasing early losses stemming from a report of strong housing starts last month.
The Commerce Department said housing starts in February rose by 12.2 percent, pushing the annual rate to 1.53 million -- the highest in nearly three years. Analysts credited rising stock prices, low unemployment, high levels of consumer confidence and mild weather. 
 The 30-year bond slipped 2/32 yesterday, to a price of 95 27/32 to yield 6.96 percent, up from 6.95 percent on Monday.
Government bond prices rebounded from their sharp drop early in the day, analysts said, as investors began to assimilate the data and to attribute some of the strength in the report to unusually warm weather, which may have accelerated starts originally planned for March, April or May. The rebound also suggested that investors are betting today's report on February consumer prices will show little evidence of inflation, much as producer prices did last week. However, market participants are still divided over whether Fed policy makers will raise interest rates by a quarter-point next week or May 20.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said that even though the consumer price estimates were for a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent, the market seemed to be discounting even friendlier readings. "With even the housing sector showing renewed strength, it is clear that the economy retains considerable momentum as the first quarter comes to a close," Mr. Jones said. "The threat of a Fed tightening continues to increase. The market has not yet adjusted to that reality."
Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Everen Securities Inc., Chicago, said he thought the market was a little expensive, but he predicted that prices will decline significantly by the time the Fed policy makers meet next Tuesday, as investors price in the high probability that the Fed will raise rates.
The Treasury also plans to sell two-year and five-year notes next week, although the size of the auction has not been announced yet.
"So as it stands, I think today's rally was nothing more than a situation where the market had already discounted the housing numbers and was covering shorts ahead of tomorrow's C.P.I. number, which many believe will be a positive for bonds and confirm last week's P.P.I.," Mr. Ake said. "But once we're through the C.P.I. and Greenspan's testimony on Thursday, market participants will be focusing entirely on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and supply."
If the Fed moves to raise rates next week, Mr. Ake said, the yield on the long bond is likely to move into a range of 7.10 percent, and eventually to hit 7.25 percent, with short rates like the two-year note moving to 6.50 percent.
"I wouldn't be a buyer of bonds on news," Mr. Ake said. "If the Fed moves once, then the chance is that it will move once or twice more this year. However, I do not expect the Fed to go into an extended tightening cycle like 1994, when it raised rates 300 basis points."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said: "While the Fed continues to argue that a tightening needs to be pre-emptive, the difference between tightening in March versus May is minimal in terms of economic impact, and by waiting until May, the Fed will have more information to augur whether the current strength is being generated by seasonal adjustment or genuine economic growth. That's why I don't expect any action next week."

HEADLINE: Deal With Senators on Mexico and Drugs Eludes White House

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
An effort by the White House and a group of Senators to reach a deal over the certification of Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs fell apart late this afternoon over how tough the conditions placed on Mexico should be.
But both sides said they would keep working to try to reach a compromise that would forestall a Senate vote to decertify Mexico -- a move that the Administration says would strain relations with the Mexican Government, destabilize the peso and undermine investors' confidence in Mexico. 
 At issue is how specific to make the conditions that Mexico must meet to keep certification, with the White House arguing for broader language and less stringent requirements. For example, while the Administration wants to require Mexico to improve its process for extraditing suspected drug dealers, the Senators want to go further by listing the names of those who should be extradited. The Senators feel that the White House language is too broad to have much impact.
"It's very much up in the air," Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a Republican from Texas, said this evening. "It has been very difficult to come up with something that everybody believes will work."
The House of Representatives voted 251 to 175 last Thursday to impose sanctions on Mexico for not fully cooperating with the United States in the war on drugs. And although the House bill delayed action for 90 days to give Mexican officials time to show improvement in their drug-fighting effort, the White House vowed to veto the legislation and there are not enough votes to override a veto. Still, the White House wants to avoid the embarrassment of having to veto such a bill to certify a close trading partner.
Hoping to mute the House action, the White House began lobbying members of the Senate immediately in an effort to soften the legislation.
That lobbying effort has centered on three Senators who staked out the extreme positions on the issue: Mrs. Hutchinson, who supported certification and advocated a nonbinding resolution wagging a finger at Mexico, and Senator Paul D. Coverdale, a Republican from Georgia, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, who co-sponsored the bill to decertify Mexico.
President Clinton sent some of his senior aides and advisers to Capitol Hill on Monday to try to win over the Senators. The White House team included Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin; Samuel Berger, the national security adviser; Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, and John Hilley, the Administration's chief Capitol Hill lobbyist.
Both sides said this morning that they felt they were near an agreement, but the deal fell apart by late afternoon over "specifics."
Mrs. Hutchinson and others involved in the negotiations said that both sides had agreed that Mexico should be certified and that the Mexican Government should be pressed to crack down on money laundering and improve extradition procedures against suspected drug dealers.
But Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Coverdale pressed for tougher and more specific language.
Under the law, the President must certify each year that nations receiving foreign aid from Washington to combat drugs are cooperating; otherwise they risk economic sanctions.
The Administration decided on Feb. 28 to certify Mexico, despite evidence suggesting that the Mexican Government was not making an all-out effort in the war on drugs. But President Clinton was faced with an even less appealing political prospect: decertifying a close political and trading partner.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Is Seen as a Model for the Success of Immigrants

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
New Jersey's immigrant population -- the fifth largest in the nation -- is more diverse, better educated and more likely to be legal than that of the United States as a whole. This upwardly mobile profile has helped win public support in the state for current high levels of immigration at a time of anti-immigrant backlash in California, which has a more impoverished, illegal and heavily Mexican immigrant population.
The success of immigration nationally will depend in large measure on the Federal Government's ability to create immigrant streams for the nation that are more like New Jersey's. These are central conclusions of a research project being released today in Washington that its director calls the most wide-ranging case study ever done of immigration in a single state. 
 The project, which took 19 economists, political scientists, sociologists and other researchers two years to complete, is presented in a 428-page book, "Keys to Successful Immigration: Implications of the New Jersey Experience." The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York financed the $500,000 project and the Urban Institute Press in Washington is publishing it.
Based on revenue and spending estimates in the book, the research director, Thomas J. Espenshade, a professor of sociology at Princeton University, estimated in an interview that a native-born household pays on average $250 a year more in state and local taxes because of the one million immigrants who live in New Jersey.
But New Jerseyans have focused more on the benefits of immigration than the costs, Mr. Espenshade said. While acknowledging that the good health of the state's economy in the 1980's contributed to the public's willingness to tolerate rapid growth in the state's immigrant population, he says that the special characteristics of New Jersey's immigrants were also crucial to their acceptance.
New Jersey's immigrant population became more diverse in the 1980's (the largest foreign-born national group in the state was Italian, accounting for 7 percent of all non-natives). At the same time, the immigrant populations of Illinois, California, Texas and the nation as a whole became less diverse. In 1990, 22 percent of immigrants in the United States were Mexican.
And though the proportion of immigrants from Latin America and Asia has grown sharply since 1980, the largest share of New Jersey's immigrants is still European (38 percent). Professor Espenshade suggested that the absence of one or two dominant immigrant groups in New Jersey "makes it difficult to stereotype immigrants."
"The televised notions of Mexican migrants coming across the border is not a picture that resonates with residents of New Jersey," he said.
The high education levels of New Jersey's immigrants has helped them adapt successfully to the job market and win rapidly rising wages in the 1980's.
Seven out of 10 Asian immigrants in the state have attended college, compared with slightly more than 5 out of 10 Asian immigrants nationally. And 55 percent of immigrants from Latin America have completed high school or attended college, compared with 40 percent of Latin American immigrants nationally.
The average income for immigrant households in New Jersey was $48,100 in 1989, just $3,000 a year less than that of native-born households.
And citing Federal immigration statistics, researchers said New Jersey has a much smaller share of the illegal immigrant population (3 percent) than California (43 percent), New York (13 percent), Texas (11 percent) and Florida (10 percent). The largest group of illegal immigrants in New Jersey is from Portugal, hardly typical of the nation.
The relatively small size of the illegal population has meant that the financial burden on state and local government has been more modest. Using a variety of statistical sources from the 1990's, researchers estimated that the cost of educating 16,000 illegal immigrant children and jailing 285 illegal immigrant inmates was $153 million, while 116,000 illegal immigrants paid $130 million in state sales and income taxes, and state and local property taxes.
The overall impact of immigration on New Jersey has been benign, researchers found. Kristin F. Butcher, an assistant professor of economics at Boston College, and Anne M. Piehl, an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard University, reviewed the economic data and found that immigrants had not damaged the wages or employment of American-born workers -- a conclusion that echoes the findings of other national studies.
Intriguingly, Professors Butcher and Piehl also discovered that high school dropouts working in industries with large concentrations of immigrant workers experienced relatively high wage growth, remarkable considering that the wages of low-skilled workers declined generally in the 1980's.
They say they are not sure why this occurred, but it is possible that highly skilled immigrants helped these industries expand, creating more jobs for low-skilled Americans.
Though immigrants have generally moved smoothly into the mainstream of New Jersey's economy, the researchers concluded that they receive somewhat more in benefits than they pay in taxes. That is largely because immigrant households earn slightly less than native-born people and have more children.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ALBIN, Wyo., March 17

 BODY:
If some Wyoming ranchers had their way, the small chain-link enclosures that dot dry grasslands around here would be the focus of Thursday's summit meeting between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland.
The unmarked enclosures, a testimony to the banality of nuclear stockpiles, protect a sizable portion of the nation's missile silos, each containing a Minuteman III rocket tipped with three nuclear warheads. 
 "Cutting the missiles back as fast as possible would be the best thing to do," Mae Kirkbride, an Albin rancher, said when asked her advice for the presidents. "I've heard all the rationales from the Air Force officers, but it just doesn't seem reasonable to me."
Across the United States, debate over nuclear disarmament fell out of fashion with the end of the cold war. Indeed, at the Helsinki meeting, plans to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may overshadow an American proposal for the United States and Russia to cut their numbers of operational warheads to one-third of today's levels.
But here in Wyoming, home to the Air Force base that controls the nation's 575 land-based missiles, people are less apt to forget the power that sleeps beneath the prairies. If Wyoming, the nation's least populous state, were an independent country, it would be one of the world's most powerful nuclear nations.
Near Missile Drive in Cheyenne, three decommissioned rockets stand sentinel at the main gate of the F. E. Warren Air Force Base, home of 20th Air Force. Half a century ago, this unit dropped atomic bombs on Japan. Today, it maintains the nation's land-based nuclear force -- missiles in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming.
"We have a 99.6 percent alert rate -- that's up and running, manned and fully operational," Maj. Gen. Donald G. Cook, the base commander, said on Friday. "Of course we are not targeting cities anymore, just broad ocean areas."
Openness is the order of the day on a base where the commander prints his home address and telephone number on his business card. Last fall, General Cook escorted a counterpart group from the Russian Strategic Rocket Force on a tour of American missile bases.
Despite the detente between Russia and the United States, many Wyomingites fear the momentum for disarmament is being frittered away.
"We have to make people aware that the missiles are still in the ground and are still dangerous," Margaret Laybourn, a veteran of the campaign against nuclear weapons, said last Friday over coffee.
Considered the Rosa Parks of Cheyenne's anti-bomb movement, Mrs. Laybourn was the lone voice of protest over the arrival of Atlas missiles at Warren's nuclear command in 1958. Pushing two of her children in a baby carriage, she carried a sign, written with black shoe polish, that quoted Pope John XXIII: "Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind."
Almost four decades later, photographs of her 10 children and 14 grandchildren cover her refrigerator -- and southeastern Wyoming's rangeland is still laced with warheads. "I'm getting discouraged," said Mrs. Laybourn, 73.
To her, nuclear bombs are not an abstraction. "Bob was with the first marines who went into Nagasaki," she said, just before her husband, a carpenter, came home for lunch.
"He told me of the people streaming up the hills, with flesh coming off their arms," she said, making a peeling motion over her right arm. "When you have a new baby, and another on the way, you know you never want that to happen again."
Forty years of prayer vigils and wreath layings at silos may not have changed big power politics. But it may have helped to change public opinion, Mrs. Laybourn said.
In the early 1960's, local attitudes were symbolized by a neon cowboy who rode a rocket sign advertising the Atlas Motel.
But in the mid-1980's, local opposition was credited with keeping the number of MX missiles assigned to the base at 50, below planned levels.
But nuclear weapons still represent a powerful economic force, pumping an estimated $1 billion a year into the five states with land-based missiles. Employing 11,000 people, the 20th Air Force has the impact of a Fortune 500 company in a region where jobs are scarce.
With Air Force vehicles traveling 25 million miles annually to check on silos and rotate crews, the Federal Government makes sure that local roads are patched in the summer and cleared of snow in the winter.
"It's a mighty cheap insurance policy," said General Cook, who will watch the Helsinki talks from afar. Questioning the Russians' ability to destroy weapons under an accelerated timetable, he added, "What you don't want to do with the Russians is to get ahead of your headlights."
Under the Administration's proposal, operational strategic warheads on both sides would be reduced to levels of 2,000 to 2,500. Currently, Russia has about 7,500 of these bombs, and the United States has about 7,150, according to the Center for Defense Information, a study group in Washington.
Since 1990, Russia and the United States have cut their total nuclear stockpiles almost in half.
Almost all the missile silos in Missouri and South Dakota are gone. The reductions have been matched, step by step, by Russia, but General Cook remains cautious.
"For Russia, nuclear weapons give them world-power status, a seat at the table," General Cook warned. "Despite what is going on in the economy of Russia, they still have crews on alert. While they are not targeted at us, they can change the cross hairs in seconds."

HEADLINE: Novell Selects Internet Guru To Lead Struggling Company

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 18

 BODY:
Novell Inc., the struggling network software company, tapped one of the best- known visionaries of the Internet to be its new leader today. Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., was named Novell's chairman and chief executive, ending a seven-month search.
Mr. Schmidt, who is 41, was the primary strategist behind turning a stillborn project for hand-held computers into the now highly acclaimed Java, which has rapidly emerged as the Internet's dominant programming language. He joined Sun in 1983 from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center as director of software. 
 Novell has been without a permanent chief executive since Robert Frankenberg left in August. Analysts said Mr. Frankenberg, a former executive of Hewlett-Packard, where he was credited with turning around the personal computer division, cleaned up Novell's operations, but failed to articulate a strategy.
Novell shares gained 87.5 cents today, closing at $9.4375 in Nasdaq trading; Sun shares lost 75 cents, closing at $28.125.
Analysts said that Mr. Schmidt would be a plus for Novell, although they did not expect an immediate impact on the company's bottom line, and that while his departure was a loss for Sun, that company had no shortage of proficient managers.
At Novell, Mr. Schmidt faces the challenge of transforming the company that once dominated computer networking, only to fumble the Internet opportunity. Novell's core product, the Netware operating system, is still pervasive in corporate America, but it has been losing market share to the Microsoft Corporation's Windows NT, for managing the flow of data within an organization, and to various Internet-based technologies for more far-flung networks.
Mr. Schmidt said in a telephone interview that although the challenges facing Novell were well known, the company's assets were underappreciated. "Novell has a huge user base, and more people devoted to networking protocols than anyone in the industry," he said. "They are also moving to the Internet and Java as fast as they can, which was a big selling point for me because I didn't want to go to a place that didn't have the same strategic vision I have."
Since Java's introduction, Mr. Schmidt has been highly visible within the industry, making frequent appearances at conferences, testifying today before Congress on data encryption. Analysts said Novell's choice of Mr. Schmidt was a bid to regain technical leadership.
"When Bob Frankenberg left, we said they needed either an Internet guru or a marketing guru; they just got the Internet guru," said Jon Oltsik, an analyst with Forrester Research. "Novell has to reposition itself as an Internet leader, and Eric brings a lot of credibility to that," he continued. "If you look at Novell historically, they should have been an Internet leader, but they sort of missed the boat. The good news for Eric is the boat is still in the dock."
But Mr. Schmidt was evidently not Novell's first choice. According to executives close to the company, it first approached Ray Lane, president of the Oracle Corporation, and went as far as offering a multimillion-dollar signing bonus. But Mr. Lane, who is credited with turning Oracle around when it was on even shakier ground than Novell, negotiated a substantial option package to remain, according to these executives.
Without Mr. Lane's experience or track record, Mr. Schmidt was presumably offered a smaller package, which Novell said it would disclose in a March 21 proxy statement. Novell officials declined to comment on negotiations with any other candidates.
Mr. Lane declined to comment on any negotiations with Novell, but said that Mr. Schmidt's appointment was good for the company, which is an important strategic ally to Oracle. "I know Eric very well; we're good friends, and I think it will make working with Novell much easier," he said in a telephone interview.
Analysts and former Novell executives said they believed Mr. Schmidt could help Novell form strategic alliances with companies like Oracle, Netscape Communications, and of course, Sun. These companies all compete against Microsoft, and if they can convince customers to standardize on Novell technologies for core networking tasks, they will all benefit. They expect Mr. Schmidt to work to make Novell succeed as an independent entity rather than cleaning it up for an acquisition.
"They really went with the guy with industry vision, for re-energizing the company," said Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer of U.S. Web Inc., who previously held the same position at Novell. "He's not a breakup sort of a guy," he said. "He's well respected by everyone in the industry."
John Thompson, vice chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, a leading executive search firm for the technology industry, said, "I think he's got to partner with some key people, Sun and others, to really hold off the Windows NT locomotive." He added, "He's not going to stop it, but maybe he can get it to jump tracks." Noting that Mr. Schmidt's strengths were as a thought leader, he said he would need to add operational talent to Novell, particularly since Mary Burnside, an executive vice president, left last week.
Mr. Schmidt said he had more operational experience than most people realized, including 10 years of operating jobs at Sun before he was named chief technology officer. And he said he was planning to form strategic alliances. "Of course, I'll be partnering pretty closely with Sun," he said.
Novell's chairman, John Young, the former chairman and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, will become vice chairman of the company. Joseph A. Marengi, the former executive vice president of sales who has been Novell's president and chief operating officer since Mr. Frankenberg's departure, will take on a new position to be determined by Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Marengi said.

HEADLINE: Collision Odds Turn Lopsided As Sales of Big Vehicles Boom

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 18

 BODY:
In this corner, weighing in at 3,326 pounds: the Ford Taurus, America's best-selling car. In that corner, weighing in at as much as 5,174 pounds: the Ford Expedition, one of the most popular among the fast-growing category known as light trucks that includes sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans.
Such mismatches, even more striking with sports vehicle behemoths like the Chevrolet Suburban that weighs up to 6,750 pounds, are becoming far more common on America's roads. The consequences can be deadly. More Americans now die in crashes involving a car and a light truck than in crashes involving two cars, Federal accident statistics show. And that is true even though light trucks still make up just a third of all vehicles on the roads and are involved in fewer crashes than cars. 
 What is more, of the 5,426 people killed in collisions between cars and light trucks in 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available, only 20 percent were in the light trucks; 80 percent were in the cars. (The number killed in collisions between cars in 1995 was 4,271.)
The gap in weight between light trucks and cars has widened considerably in recent years. For the first time since the Government began keeping reliable records in 1984, the average light truck outweighed the average car by at least half a ton, or 1,000 pounds, in the 1995 and 1996 model years, the most recent for which figures are available. Yet most cars are designed to meet Federal crash standards that test a car's ability to withstand a collision with a similarly shaped vehicle within 500 pounds of its own weight.
The main criticism of light trucks has long been their poor fuel economy, with the largest models getting less than 15 miles a gallon in city driving. But now Federal and nongovernment experts are also concerned about the safety question. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will issue several reports within a few days looking at the links between safety and vehicle weight. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the large research group backed by insurers seeking to reduce the cost of accident claims, also plans a study later this year on accidents involving light trucks, said Brian O'Neill, the group's president.
Safety engineers at Federal agencies, auto makers and advocacy groups all agree that collisions between vehicles of mismatched weights tend to be the deadliest. In an accident, the sheer bulk of a light truck "will provide some benefits to its occupants, in effect, by penalizing the occupants of smaller vehicles," Mr. O'Neill said.
Safety experts at most private groups make the further claim, contested by auto makers, that the design of light trucks makes them an even greater threat to cars than their weight would suggest.
For example, even though fewer than a quarter of all buyers of sport utility vehicle use them for off-road driving, most models are designed with very high ground clearances to allow travel over rocky, rutted roads without leaving a trail of parts from the undercarriage. Because the bumpers and frames of many bigger light trucks are higher off the road than the bumpers and the strongest sections of most cars, the light trucks tend to hit cars in structurally weak places, said Robert D. Knoll, the director of automobile testing for Consumer Reports magazine.
"In many cases, it would go over the bumper and into parts of the vehicle that aren't designed to take the impact," Mr. Knoll said. As one example, the nine-seat Ford Expedition has a bumper that reaches 31 inches off the ground, whereas the Taurus's is 21 inches.
Almost all light trucks are made by separately assembling the body and a stiff steel-framed underbody, and then lowering the body onto the frame and welding it. Cars used to be built this way, but these days almost all cars are so-called unibody designs in which a lightweight steel shell is welded together and then filled with seats, a dashboard and other equipment. When the steel beams that form a light truck's rectangular underbody encounter the thinner steel lattice of an automobile's shell, they tend to inflict a lot of damage, said Gerald A. Donaldson, the senior research director at Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an advocacy group in Washington.
Safety engineers at auto makers acknowledge that the greater weight of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks gives them an advantage in crashes, but contend that the designs are not a problem. The two steel beams that run the length of the underbody of Ford's light trucks, for example, have a wavy pattern near the front that is designed to let them compress in an accident, reducing the odds that they will punch through the other vehicle, said Charles E. Christopher, a Ford safety engineer.
"It's not just a big dagger sticking out there; it's designed to collapse," Mr. Christopher said.
A draft of one report being prepared by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that Federal investigators are worried because sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans are not only becoming more common but are also becoming larger and heavier.
"Continued growth in the number and weight of light trucks, unless offset by safety improvements, is likely to increase the hazard in collisions between the trucks and smaller road users," said the draft, which has been circulated for peer review by safety experts at other Federal agencies.
Safety administration officials declined to comment on the issue until the reports are released in the next few days.
To be sure, not all light trucks are large. But as Americans buy more and more sport utility vehicles, pickups and mini-vans these days, they are favoring the biggest models, like the Suburban and Chevrolet's 5,154-pound extended-cab pickup. Sales of such full-size pickup trucks, for example, have nearly doubled since 1991, while sales of compact pickup trucks have fallen slightly over the period. Sales of large sport utility vehicles like the 4,933-pound Land Cruiser by Toyota and the 4,960-pound Range Rover by Land Rover have quintupled in the last five years.
By contrast, the Toyota Camry midsize sedan weighs 3,086 pounds; the smaller Honda Civic is 2,438 pounds and G.M.'s compact Geo Metro weighs just 1,962 pounds.
Light trucks have soared in popularity partly because, with gas prices low, Americans want bigger vehicles. A quirk in Federal regulations prevents the auto makers from simply selling a lot of big cars like station wagons, the quirk being that Federal fuel economy standards are much higher for cars than for light trucks.
The Transportation Department sets the fuel-efficiency standards for light trucks and has been discussing for several years whether to raise them. The pending reports by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration try to assess the safety consequences of reducing the average weight of light trucks by 100 pounds, which might happen if fuel-efficiency standards are raised.
The draft reports concluded that such a weight change would reduce the number of Americans killed in fatal crashes by 50 each year, and reduce the number of serious injuries annually by 601. But the number of less serious injuries would rise by 1,794, the reports concluded, as the light trucks would provide less protection for occupants in hitting trees and other hazards.
These conclusions have been criticized in a separate report prepared by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council, which conducted the peer review over the last year. The board concluded that there were so many variables involved, such as the use of seat belts and the relative aggressiveness of drivers, that it was impossible to form any firm conclusions about the safety consequences of building sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks that weigh less.
Detroit's Big Three auto makers bitterly oppose any move to raise fuel-efficiency standards for light trucks because the companies make all of their profits on light trucks and actually lose money on cars. Higher fuel-efficiency standards would tend to help their Japanese rivals, which produce mostly cars and which tend to build engines that are somewhat less powerful and therefore more fuel efficient. Higher fuel-efficiency standards could widen the American trade deficit with Japan and hurt American workers and companies, Detroit executives warn.
Groups like Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety favor two big design changes to reduce the risks that light trucks pose: requiring all vehicles to have bumpers of the same height and replacing the steel beams in light-truck frames with lighter, steel-lattice "unibody" designs. But neither change is likely soon.
Putting higher bumpers on cars would interfere with their aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. Putting lower bumpers on light trucks would ruin the rugged, boxy look that so many buyers find attractive. And while a few new sport utility vehicles have unibody designs, like the 2,600-pound Toyota RAV4, changing the designs of Jeep Grand Cherokees and other light trucks would take many years and cost billions of dollars.
Auto makers say that a reduction in traffic accidents is better accomplished by cracking down on drunken drivers, encouraging seat belt use and fixing potholes. "It would be much more productive to improve highways," said Jason H. Vines, a Chrysler Corporation spokesman.
The overall safety record of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans is mixed. Because their centers of gravity are higher, the tallest of these are more likely to roll over, particularly during tight high-speed turns. Their stiff steel underbodies also transmit a lot of the shock of a crash to the occupants when a light truck hits a tree, a concrete bridge abutment or some other fixed object. Moreover, light trucks have not been required to meet some of the safety standards set for cars.
While occupants of light trucks tend to fare better than car occupants in multiple-vehicle accidents, their fatality rates are higher in single-vehicle accidents, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
But when asked what they would like to be driving in case of an accident between a sport utility vehicle and a car, auto executives invariably choose the light truck. "I'd rather be in an Explorer if that should occur," said Ross H. Roberts, the general manager of the Ford division.

HEADLINE: Easing Crisis, China Lets North Korea Defector Go

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 18

 BODY:
China defused a five-week diplomatic crisis today by spiriting a senior North Korean defector out of the country and sending him by special plane to the Philippines, where he is expected to stay for a decent diplomatic interval before traveling to South Korea.
The defector, Hwang Jang Yop, an ideological mentor to Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, was the most senior member of his country's hard-line elite ever to defect. 
 He arrived at the Clark Special Economic Zone, a former American military base in the Philippines, just after noon aboard a China Southern Airlines Boeing 737 that had carried him and three escorts from the south China port of Xiamen.
"What I can tell you is that through consultations among all sides, the problem has already been solved," a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Cui Tiankai, told reporters at a news conference this afternoon. Shortly after that, the official New China News Agency reported that Mr. Hwang "left China today for a third country."
None of the governments involved in the arrangements for Mr. Hwang's departure from China disclosed the conditions for his safe passage to South Korea.
On Monday, a senior South Korean official said Mr. Hwang would remain in a "third country" for "a considerable period of time" before going on to Seoul. That condition was presumably intended as a gesture to spare China the image of having its territory used as an escape route from North Korea.
Mr. Hwang, who is believed to be 74, sought political asylum at the South Korean Consulate in Beijing on Feb. 12. He was passing through the Chinese capital on the way home from a conference in Japan.
North Korea initially accused South Korean agents of "kidnapping" Mr. Hwang and threatened unspecified retaliation.
Fears that North Korean intelligence agents would try to seize or kill the defector set off a sizable security alarm here and led to the deployment of Chinese troops backed by armored personnel carriers to Beijing's diplomatic quarter.
The high-security operation today ended five weeks of drama around the South Korean Consulate that served as Mr. Hwang's sanctuary as diplomatic negotiations were carried out in several Asian capitals to pave the way for his departure.
Mr. Hwang's departure was a significant diplomatic victory for China, whose leaders were aghast at suddenly finding Beijing a battleground in a high-stakes struggle over a defector. His intimate knowledge of the North Korean leadership makes his desertion as embarrassing to the North as it is valued by the South and by those Asian and Western governments that will profit from the treasure of intelligence that Mr. Hwang brings with him.
In managing the defection crisis, the goal of China's Communist Party leaders was to prevent violence in Beijing as intelligence operatives from both Koreas circled each other warily behind the police cordons that were thrown up to protect the South Korean Consulate.
But Beijing also demonstrated that it has balanced its relations between its longstanding Communist allies in the North and its newfound capitalist allies in South Korea.
China said today that it had acted "according to Hwang's own will" in aiding his departure, but had also taken into account "the positions taken by the parties concerned" and a desire to safeguard "peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."
After North Korea's initial strong protests, its propaganda outlets fell silent as the standoff in Beijing wore on, indicating that the North's leaders had become resigned to the fact that China was not going to hand over the defector.
Mr. Hwang's arrival in the Philippines was surrounded by the same secrecy as his departure from China, and Government officials refused to confirm that he was there. When asked Mr. Hwang's whereabouts, Foreign Under Secretary Rodolfo Severino insisted, "I have no idea."
Officials at the Clark Special Economic Zone confirmed that Mr. Hwang had arrived there on a chartered Chinese aircraft. Airport officials said South Korean and Philippine officials had met him. But beyond that, his location was unclear.
There were no signs of unusual activity at the South Korean Embassy in Manila.
Like most other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. But relations between the two countries are friendly, and last year the Philippines sent $20,000 in food and medical aid to North Korea.
In Seoul, South Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lee Kyu Hyung, said of Mr. Hwang: "He is under our control. With the cooperation of a third country, we have him staying in a secure and safe place."
Mr. Lee reiterated that "Hwang Jang Yop himself wanted to defect, and the arrangements were made after negotiations with China, so I hope no new tensions will develop between South and North Korea."

HEADLINE: Thomas Fichandler, Washington Theater's Executive Director, 81

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Thomas C. Fichandler, a founder of the Arena Stage in Washington and the theater's executive director until his retirement in 1986, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 81.
The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Zelda Fichandler. 
 The Arena Stage, created in 1950 by Mr. and Mrs. Fichandler and Edward Mangum, was from the first a principal force in the regional theater movement, and it remains one of the leading theater companies in the United States. During most of the Arena's existence, Mr. Fichandler ran the business side of the operation while Mrs. Fichandler was the artistic director.
As a creative team, they won many honors, including the first Tony award given to a regional theater. The Fichandlers continued their professional partnership after they were separated in 1975.
Mr. Fichandler was born in New York City. He graduated from Brooklyn College and later from George Washington University. Trained as an economist, he went to Washington in 1936 and worked for the Treasury Department. Then he became chief of the Actuarial Division for the Social Security Administration's unemployment insurance program.
His office was in the building that also housed the National Theater, which was closed after a dispute over its policy of not allowing blacks to sit in the audience with whites. Mr. Fichandler joined the pickets outside the National, and when he and his wife opened the Arena Stage, it was the first integrated theater in Washington.
The original home of the Arena was in a boat on the Potomac River, after which it moved to an abandoned movie theater and later a former brewery. In 1961, the company occupied a new, modern building near the Potomac. Mr. Fichandler was primarily responsible for planning the construction of the Arena and for raising the money to support it.
Under the leadership of the Fichandlers, the Arena built a reputation for venturesome theater. It made its national reputation with such plays as "The Great White Hope" by Howard Sackler (which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama after it moved to Broadway) and "Moonchildren" by Michael Weller. The Arena was also known for the professionalism of its acting company. At the same time, the theater achieved financial stability, largely through Mr. Fichandler's efforts.
Mr. Fichandler was active in the regional theater movement, as president of the League of Resident Theaters for six years and as a consultant to the Ford Foundation.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Hal, of Philadelphia and Mark, of New York City, and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Ralph S. Abascal, 62, Dies; Leading Lawyer for the Poor

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
Ralph S. Abascal, a pioneering legal-services lawyer in California who won landmark decisions on behalf of farm workers, welfare recipients and undocumented immigrants, died on Monday at his home in Berkeley. He was 62 and had been suffering from cancer.
Mr. Abascal, a rumpled, soft-spoken man whose manner sometimes belied a disciplined legal mind, was for more than 20 years the general counsel and guiding spirit of California Rural Legal Assistance, one of the largest of the 280-odd programs endowed by the Federally financed Legal Services Corporation. 
 He was among the first and most vigorous combatants in environmental law, winning cases that forced an end to the agricultural use of DDT and other pesticides. He also fought successfully to block state efforts to cut welfare benefits in the 1970's, becoming a particular nemesis of the administration of Gov. Ronald Reagan. Soon after becoming President in 1981, Mr. Reagan tried to halt all Federal financing for the legal services program.
To Mr. Abascal's conservative critics in the California capital and in Washington, he epitomized what was wrong with the legal services organization: He viewed himself more as a civil rights activist than a social worker. He worked closely with liberal politicians. And he offered no apology for his focus on sweeping class actions that sought to change the lives of thousands of people, some of whom were only dimly aware of what he was doing.
Mr. Abascal also inspired a generation of young law-school graduates, many of whom forsook the promise of more lucrative careers so they could serve poor clients in farm towns in the Central Valley of California.
"He was the quintessential public-interest lawyer," said Al Meyerhoff, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council who frequently worked with Mr. Abascal. "If you look at how the Legal Services Corporation has been under siege for all these years, it has been because of lawyers like Ralph Abascal."
The grandson of a stonemason from the Spanish seaport of Santander, Mr. Abascal said he had inherited some of his liberalism from his father, Manuel, who lost three brothers in the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. As a young man, Manuel Abascal traveled to Cuba, helped build a railroad in northwestern Mexico and then walked across the border to San Diego. He settled in San Francisco, where his son Ralph Santiago was born on May 31, 1934.
Mr. Abascal, whose mother came from a family of immigrant fruit-pickers, did not start learning English until he was almost 5. He once said he had spent much of his youth haunting pool halls, but he became serious enough about his studies to earn a master's degree in business and pursue a doctorate in economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
Then, he recalled in an interview last year, he saw the 1960 film "Inherit the Wind," which depicted the debate over evolutionary theory waged by Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan in the 1925 Scopes trial. That helped shift the focus of Mr. Abascal's studies, first toward the Progressive Era in American history, then to the law. He quit economics for the Hastings College of Law at the University of California, graduating in 1968.
Mr. Abascal went to work immediately as a staff lawyer for California Rural Legal Assistance, one of the many legal-services programs born of the War on Poverty. He started out in Salinas, quickly joining forces with the leaders of California's nascent farm workers' union, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.
Their collaboration resulted in several groundbreaking cases. One led to a ban on the use of the short-handled hoe, a symbol of harshness in the lettuce fields that allowed foremen to assume that their laborers were slacking off if they were not hunched over. In another, more contentious case, 19 farm workers represented by Mr. Abascal challenged the right of the University of California to conduct publicly financed research intended to develop labor-saving farm machinery.
Branded by his adversaries as a Luddite, Mr. Abascal responded that Congress had never meant to save money for big agribusiness enterprises. Rather, he said, it had intended to support "the little person, the person most in need."
Mr. Abascal's defense of that constituency led him into frequent battles with California's biggest farmers. A suit filed in 1969 on behalf of six nursing mothers who were working in the fields eventually led to the banning of DDT. Two decades later, two other cases in the Federal courts led to limits on dozens of pesticides thought to cause cancer.
In 1970, Mr. Abascal moved to the San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation, where he filed dozens of lawsuits on behalf of welfare recipients whose benefits were threatened by Governor Reagan's early efforts to cut the welfare rolls.
Years later, he described those efforts to fight poverty by preserving entitlements as fundamentally misguided.
"We should have been strong advocates of getting people into work," he said after President Clinton signed the welfare legislation last year. "Had we done that then, we would not have had this welfare bill now."
Mr. Abascal served on the boards of many legal and public-interest organizations and received many awards for his work, including the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award in 1995 and the Kutak-Dodds Prize of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association and the Robert Kutak Foundation.
The latter prize came with a $10,000 check, which Mr. Abascal put toward a small Chrysler convertible. Mr. Abascal, who once shared a single pair of wingtip "court" shoes with another lawyer whose feet were roughly the same size, had to stop himself in the interview from apologizing for the luxury.
Mr. Abascal is survived by his wife, Beatrice A. Moulton, a law professor at Hastings; their daughter, Pilar C., of Berkeley; two brothers, Manuel, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Richard, of Fremont, Calif., and a sister, Mary Jo, of San Diego.

HEADLINE: Gore in a Quandary Over the Chance to Seal Boeing Deal in China Trip

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The Chinese Government quietly approached the Clinton Administration recently with a deal it thought Washington could not refuse: When Vice President Gore lands in Beijing next week, Chinese officials suggested, he could preside over the signing of a billion-dollar deal for China to buy a small fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.
But what looked like a plum opportunity -- a chance to beat out Europe's Airbus Industrie and protect hundreds of jobs at Boeing's plant in Seattle -- has turned into a foreign policy quandary. At a time when the White House is caught in the middle of campaign finance charges that make any deal with the Chinese the subject of intense scrutiny, some of Mr. Gore's aides say he should steer clear of events that sniff of deal-making. 
 And it does not help, officials familiar with the deal say, that China would send to the signing its hard-line Prime Minister, Li Peng, who presided over the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square.
"I can't tell you how many meetings there have been on this problem," one exasperated Administration official said earlier this week. "It's the kind of thing that paralyzes the White House these days."
Boeing, which has consistently complained that its huge orders are held hostage to the political atmosphere between China and Washington, has a clear position on this issue: It wants the Vice President to seal the deal.
"I don't think we know yet if we really have an order," said Thomas Tripp, the director of public affairs for the company. "These are the kinds of deals that are highly politicized to begin with. If the Vice President's schedule permits, and there is an order, we think it is entirely appropriate that he attend."
Mr. Gore's national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, was noncommittal today, saying, "We will consider any development that may arise if it is a normal transaction, appropriate and good for American business and labor, and in the commercial interests of the United States."
Mr. Fuerth noted that Mr. Gore was already scheduled to meet Mr. Li, in connection with the Vice President's main agenda: the environmental impact of China's industrialization.
Mr. Gore, Administration officials say, clearly does not want to appear to be snubbing the Chinese during his most important venture abroad. Nor does he want to jeopardize a deal that Boeing, which dominates China's air market, appears to have nearly in the bag.
But given the political environment in Washington, Mr. Gore's aides have worked hard in recent weeks to steer clear of potentially controversial economic issues. They have begged off detailed discussions of China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the biggest ongoing negotiation right now between the two capitals. No business executives are traveling with him, though in the first term they often accompanied Cabinet members on tours of the world's greatest emerging market.
Other world leaders have not been so shy. Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has led several missions to China. So has France's President, Jacques Chirac. During his first term, President Clinton often put his weight behind major deals, including a Boeing sale to Saudi Arabia.
In recent months, though, there is evidence that the White House has been playing down that role. The new Commerce Secretary, William Daley, has issued strict regulations governing how companies are selected for participation in trade missions to pre-empt critics on Capitol Hill who charge that the Administration has favored big contributors. (Boeing donated $118,250 to the Democrats last year, but Federal Election Commission records show that it gave even more to Republicans.)
When pressed, Administration officials say they are no less committed to fighting a daily battle with Japan and Europe to win major contracts around the world, particularly those decided by foreign governments.
But no one is certain how to involve the President and the Vice President in those deals without appearing to make mercantilism seem a centerpiece of American foreign policy. It is a sign of the shift that one of the phrases that the late Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, used incessantly as he traveled around the world -- "commercial diplomacy" -- is all but banned in the White House today.
That may be more a matter of semantics than a shift in policy.
"It would be understandable if the Vice President was gun-shy about being identified with a big commercial deal in light of the alleged campaign scandals," said Jeffrey Garten, who was Undersecretary of Commerce for international trade during the first term and has written a book, soon to be published, about what the Commerce Department called "the big emerging markets."
"But it could be wrong to jump to the conclusion that commercial diplomacy is dead," Mr. Garten added. "We are in an intense struggle to win major projects abroad, and Government support will still be necessary. Whatever happens on this trip will not be determinative."

HEADLINE: 4,000 Hearts Full of Hope Line Up for 700 Jobs

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
Gayle Blanding pulled on her best dress, the navy one with the gold buttons, painted her lips cranberry and repeated her mantra: "I have great confidence. I have great skills." But the 38-year-old unemployed woman still trembled as she rode the A train from Harlem to midtown Manhattan yesterday.
"Don't worry, Mommy," whispered her 19-year-old daughter, who accompanied her part of the way. "You're going to get that job." 
Lasidy Honoret, a 33-year-old cook from the Dominican Republic, took an unpaid day's leave from his $5-an-hour job at a Boston Market and practiced his English during the subway ride from Woodhaven, Queens. "A job with benefits," he said.
And Elizabeth Gatling, 55, stuffed her black canvas bag with dozens of multi-colored resumes and certificates from every training program she had ever completed. And as she rode to Manhattan from Crown Heights in Brooklyn, she envisioned a whole new world where she could pay her electric bills on time and permanently erase the stigma of public assistance.
"I'm not asking for no pity," she said. "I just want to get off welfare."
What drew them from their homes before dawn yesterday was a tiny classified advertisement in the local newspapers: the possibility of getting one of the 700 jobs at the soon-to-reopen Roosevelt Hotel in midtown Manhattan. By noon, 4,000 job seekers had formed a a twisting, turning human chain that extended two square blocks and reflected the city's dreams and frustrations.
While Wall Street booms and stock brokers rake in big bonuses, ordinary workers are finding it harder and harder to find jobs, some economists say. Earlier this month, the state announced that unemployment in January had reached its highest level in three years, climbing to 9.9 percent. And some economists fear that in coming years the city may no longer produce the kinds of entry-level jobs upon which so many have historically depended.
"They're making money on Wall Street, but that money and those jobs are not making it down to us, the people," Mr. Honoret said.
There were teen-agers wearing diamond studs in their noses and baseball caps on their heads, bouncing in time to the rhythms of their radios as they waited on line. There were middle-aged men wearing business suits and clutching leather portfolios. There were welfare recipients afraid of losing their benefits, and immigrants still searching for the golden streets of America.
Many job seekers waited as long as eight hours to fill out an application. But they said it was worth it. Behind the hotel's grand doors, which were still covered with plywood, they could imagine a world of steady work, of tuxedo-wearing waiters juggling plates, of uniformed maids making beds, of smartly dressed front-desk clerks welcoming guests and tapping on computers.
"I got a 3-month-old daughter to support, so I'll do anything for a real job," said Martiza Rivera, 23, who lost her job as a supermarket cashier six months ago and arrived at the hotel at 7 A.M. "I just want her to have the things I've never had. A bank account. A college education. It's hard waiting out here for so long. But when I get tired I just think of her, smiling at me."
The 1,033-room Roosevelt Hotel, which sits on the corner of 45th Street and Madison Avenue, is scheduled to reopen in late April after 18 months of renovation. And the classified advertisements, which appeared on two consecutive Sundays, called on housekeepers, managers, maintenance workers and security guards to apply during a four-day job fair, which began yesterday.
The hotel's manager said his staff had expected to interview 1,000 people a day and to pay those hired anywhere from $6 to $15 an hour. But no one anticipated the thousands thatshowed up, some as early as 3 A.M.
"I've never seen anything quite like it," said Ted Knighton, who is opening the hotel for Interstate Hotels, a management company.
Police officers set up barricades to control the surging crowd, which snaked around 46th Street, down Vanderbilt Avenue, back across 45th Street, up Madison Avenue, and back to the entrance on 46th. There were so many people that the officers even started another line on the opposite side of 46th Street, which snaked around another city block, creating the effect of a boxy figure eight of human bodies.
Disillusioned by the deluge of applicants, some job seekers went home. Others waited for hours in the chilly weather, sipping coffee, conducting mock interviews, and shouting down those who dared to cut into the line.
"My brain is frozen," said Ms. Blanding, who waited for eight hours, biding her time by flipping through the book her daughter had borrowed from the library, "Naked at the Interview: Tips and Quizzes to Prepare for Your First Real Job."
"But I'm not leaving until I get seen," she said firmly.
She would not say what caused her to lose her job a year ago. But others were more forthcoming, describing how the restaurants they worked in had failed, how they fell onto welfare, or how they desperately needed the security that their current jobs cannot provide.
"I have work, but I don't have benefits," explained Mr. Honoret, who said he was a lawyer in his own country but had worked in factories and supermarkets since he arrived in the United States five years ago.
At first, he dreamed of saving enough money to attend Harvard University, of sending money regularly to his 70-year-old mother, and of working as a professional. He has not given up on that dream, but sometimes as he mashes potatoes and roasts chicken at Boston Market, he wonders why he ever left home.
"I'm just a cook now," said Mr. Honoret, who wore jeans and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap. "Sometimes, I think I'm just too scared to admit that I can't make it here."
Farther down the line, Mrs. Gatling reminisced about the last real job she had, four years ago. She worked in an office, dumping trash, cleaning bathrooms and sweeping floors, and earned $300 a week. She had a credit card then and bought a brand-new bedroom set from Seaman's. "That was the best I ever had," she said.
When she got laid off, she went on welfare and has been on it ever since. But the classified advertisement gave her new hope.
She started to dream about paying off her bills, buying new boots and maybe even treating herself to a pair of fancy stockings.
"I'm gonna try and sell myself," Mrs. Gatling said as the line inched forward. "I'm gonna look the person in the eye and tell them the truth: I'm honest and reliable and I'm desperate for work."

HEADLINE: Clinton Hopes to Jump-Start Bipartisan Talks on Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
President Clinton sought today to re-energize the stalled effort to balance the Federal budget, laying out steps to get the two sides talking again.
Mr. Clinton said that in particular he was heartened by comments from Republicans suggesting they might delay their demands for sweeping tax cuts and had softened their opposition to the economic assumptions used in his budget plan. 
 Saying the nation is "closer than ever to the point where we can reach an agreement on a balanced budget," Mr. Clinton appealed for a restoration of the bipartisan spirit that marked the early weeks of the budget process this year, and said both sides would need to make politically painful sacrifices to reach a deal.
"No one will achieve everything he or she wants," the President said at a news conference. "Everyone must be prepared to compromise if we're going to break the gridlock and finally balance the budget."
Mr. Clinton said he would meet at the White House on Wednesday with the leaders of the Congressional budget committees to discuss the prospects of forging an agreement that would eliminate the Federal deficit by 2002.
The President said he would follow up on the meeting by instructing his aides to continue discussions with the Republicans during the two-week Congressional recess that begins Friday. And he said he wanted both his own team and the Congressional budget chairmen to report back to him and to the Republican leadership early next month "on the progress they have made and the best means for reaching the bipartisan agreement we all seek."
There has been little substantive contact between the White House and Republican leaders since the President submitted his budget plan to Congress last month. Republicans have criticized the Administration's plan without offering an alternative, and the impasse grew worst last week when the White House abandoned an effort to save tens of billions of dollars by reducing cost-of-living increases for people receiving Social Security benefits.
Republicans said tonight that they were skeptical that Mr. Clinton's initiative would yield any significant progress unless he made some specific concessions.
The President did not specify what compromises he might be willing to make, and it was unclear whether what he called the Republicans' "new flexibility on tax cuts and economic assumptions" would live up to the billing he gave it.
Indeed, Republicans spent much of the day trying to dispel the notion that they were backing off from the party's demands that a big tax cut be part of any budget agreement.
On Monday, Speaker Newt Gingrich said he might be willing to fashion a plan that eliminated the deficit but did not include sweeping tax cuts. Mr. Gingrich said the question of tax cuts could be considered separately after Congress and the Administration locked in the spending cuts necessary to balance the budget.
Today, Mr. Gingrich welcomed Mr. Clinton's efforts. "I am encouraged by the movement on the White House's part toward reopening the budget negotiations," he said in a statement. "I hope the President's words indicate that the Administration is now ready to move beyond partisan politics and work with the Congress in a flexible and positive manner to reach a balanced budget."
Although it was Mr. Gingrich's statement that led the White House to make its effort to get negotiations going again, a number of influential Republicans said that the Speaker was alluding only to a procedural question of when to consider tax proposals, and that neither he nor other Republican leaders were backing away from their demand for a broad-based tax reduction.
Mr. Gingrich's suggestion that balancing the budget should come first further deepened a rift among Republicans over tax cuts, an issue at the heart of the party's agenda for the last two years.
Representative David M. McIntosh of Indiana, who was elected to the House in the Republican sweep of 1994 and is one of those most emphatic about using tax cuts as a means to shrink the size of the Federal Government, sent a letter to Mr. Gingrich today urging him to insist that tax cuts be part of any budget deal.
"It's one thing to give the leadership wide berth to develop a strategy for a budget agreement, but it's something else entirely when the leadership's chief strategy is to capitulate on a fundamental Republican principle," Mr. McIntosh said.
But some Republicans admitted they were in a quandary over their tax cut proposals, which range up to $200 billion over five years. Unless they want to push for deep and politically suicidal spending cuts, there is no way for them to enact their tax cuts while continuing to insist that the budget be built on the conservative economic assumptions developed by the Congressional Budget Office.
In a telling example of what it would take to enact the complete Republican tax plan, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading advocate of deep tax cuts, made a compromise proposal. His plan would require using the more optimistic economic assumptions developed by the White House and would assume billions of dollars in savings from a change in the formula for cost-of-living payments for Social Security, an idea so sensitive that the White House backed away from it last week.
Even with those assumptions, Senator Roth's plan would still require delaying by a year the enactment of the Republicans' main tax cut, an increased credit for families with children.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has said several time in the last few weeks that he would consider a compromise on the economic assumptions employed by the two sides, which could substantially narrow the gap.
But more than anything, it was the White House's decision last week not to pursue reducing cost-of-living increases for benefit recipients that left Republicans scrambling for ways to keep their sometimes conflicting budget goals intact.
The meeting on Wednesday at the White House will include the Republican chairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, as well as the ranking Democrats on those committees, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina.
In addition to Mr. Clinton, the White House team will include Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff; Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary; Franklin D. Raines, the budget chief; John Hilley, the liaison to Congress, and Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council.

HEADLINE: NASA Plans to Study Forests and Global Gravity

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The space agency announced today that it would sponsor two low-cost satellite projects to study the distribution of Earth's forests and provide a detailed map of the planet's gravity field.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the new economical projects, part of the agency's Mission to Planet Earth program, were intended to complement more expensive space missions to study the planet's environment. 
 William Townsend, the NASA official in charge of the program, said the new missions were part of the agency's renewed focus on quickly developing and flying smaller, less expensive spacecraft that have limited objectives rather than concentrating on billion-dollar missions.
After a competition, NASA selected 2 of 12 semifinalist projects to finance and a third project to be sponsored as a backup.
The first to fly is expected to be the Vegetation Canopy Lidar mission, a satellite that would orbit 250 miles above Earth, firing energy pulses from five lasers to the ground. The mission would spend two years accumulating three-dimensional details of 98 percent of the world's forests. The satellite is scheduled for launching in January 2000 on a Pegasus rocket, said Dr. Ralph Dubayah of the University of Maryland, the chief mission scientist.
Dr. Dubayah said the safe, low-power laser beams would scan strips of forests more than 80 feet wide to determine the height of foliage. That would allow more precise measurements of tree heights, the cataloging of information about forest canopies and greatly improved estimates of global biomass, or the number or mass of living organisms in a particular area, he said.
The forest survey mission has a budget of $59.8 million, which includes the price of launchings, as well as data gathering and analysis, NASA said.
The second mission selected is the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which plans to use two satellites, to be launched by a Russian rocket in 2001, to measure gravity fluctuations while flying in formation 280 miles above Earth. A team headed by Dr. Byron D. Tapley of the University of Texas in Austin plans to work with a German group led by Dr. Christoph Reigher of GeoFor schungsZentrum in Potsdam to launch and operate the satellites for up to five years.
NASA plans to spend $85.9 million on this mission for the United States investigators to build the satellites and instruments. The Germans agreed to contribute an additional $40 million to buy a Russian Cosmos launching rocket and to control mission operations, officials said.
The satellites, expected to fly 60 to 250 miles apart in the same orbit around Earth's poles, would be linked by microwave signals to calibrate their distance from each other and changes in movement caused by the gravitational pull of masses like large metal deposits on Earth.
If one of these missions is canceled, NASA said, it will invest up to $500,000 over two years for preliminary work on a backup project to map the movement of 30 types of gases, particles and pollutants in the atmosphere.

HEADLINE: Pact Reported For New York Lilco Takeover

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki plans to announce an agreement today on a multibillion dollar state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, including billions of dollars in debt from the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant, participants in the negotiations said last night.
The move is expected to result in rate reductions of 20 percent or more for customers who pay the highest energy rates in the nation. 
 Under the long-sought-after agreement, the state's Long Island Power Authority would purchase transmission and distribution lines and retail service operations including billing, installation and repairs from Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas, which has a pending merger agreement with Lilco. The deal also includes an option for the power authority to later purchase Lilco's power generation plants.
But most importantly, the state would assume the billions in debt from the Shoreham nuclear plant, which the state would pay for with a tax-free bond issue at a rate much smaller than what Lilco is currently paying.
The Power Authority can pay off the debt more cheaply than Lilco because it can borrow money at lower interest rates. That translates to lower rates for consumers.
The deal must still clear several hurdles, which include obtaining the approval of State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the state's Public Service Commission and obtaining a waiver of capital gains taxes for Lilco shareholders from the Internal Revenue Service.
Lilco, which has a merger with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company pending, and state officials have petitioned the Internal Revenue Service to forgive the capital gains tax liability, or at least postpone it for many years, and the I.R.S. has not ruled on the matter.
The deal would allow Mr. Pataki to claim victory after two years of promising rate relief to a region that will be key to his re-election hopes, and to take credit for the resolution of the Shoreham quagmire, which long eluded his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo.
Long Island's electric rates -- nearly double the national average, with the average household paying about $100 a month -- are a perennial source of fury from residents and businesses and, officials say, a damper on the local economy.
Also included in the deal is a settlement of a lawsuit in which Lilco was awarded a judgment worth as much as $1.1 billion against Suffolk County, the Town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham Wading River School district. The lawsuit alleged that Lilco was overcharged on property taxes since the early 1980's and the judgment threatened to bankrupt the local governments.
Under the agreement reached last night, that case will be settled for $625 million. Electricity customers in Suffolk County will pay a surcharge to cover the cost of the settlement.
Because of this surcharge, Nassau utility customers stand to gain the most from the deal: a 22 percent rate reduction.
Under the agreement, the Long Island Power Authority will hire Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas to run the electrical operations. In addition, the companies would continue to provide natural gas service for Long Island as well as for Brooklyn Union's current customers in New York City.

HEADLINE: As Rents Move Up, Roommates Move In

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
AT age 35, Antonio Da Motta thought he was too old for one particular rite of passage. But in October, pressed by a 30 percent jump in his rent, Mr. Da Motta, a designer and showroom manager, decided to take in a roommate so he could stay in his home of four years, a 700-square-foot loft in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. It was not an option many people would relish, and for a designer it was doubly scary: "The prospect of living with a stranger terrified me," he said, "not just because I wouldn't know how they would act, but because I couldn't be sure of what kind of taste they'd have."
With a new set of duplicate keys, Mr. Da Motta has joined a significant if largely untracked subset of New Yorkers who are coping with the steep rise in rents, especially in Manhattan, by making space for strangers to share their refrigerators, their bathrooms and their lives. 
 These midlife roommates are different from the young college graduates who have always split the rent two, three or more ways until they could establish themselves. Long-term home sharers are "career renters," real estate agents say. For many, sharing is the only way they can stay in New York. Others welcome another presence in the apartment to counter "the only sounds I hear are the high heels upstairs" isolation of city life.
While no one charts exact numbers of roommates, Nancy Packes, the president of Feathered Nest, a real estate agency that regularly surveys trends in Manhattan's rental market, said she suspected that as many as 30 percent of the tenants whose rents are under $2,500 are sharing.
"Starting in 1994, we started seeing the most dramatic increase in rents since the crazy 80's," Ms. Packes said. "There's a tightening of the economy for all but the high rollers. And along with the high rents, budgets are staying the same or dropping, so it's no surprise that the share phenomenon is very, very big right now."
Traditionally, the rule of thumb dictated that monthly rent should not exceed 25 percent of one's gross income. In Manhattan, that can easily go as high as 35 percent, real estate agents say. (Many landlords use a different formula in an effort to assure that prospective tenants can afford their apartments. The formula, which increasingly shows up in leases, requires that gross annual income be 40 to 50 times the monthly rent.)
When the rent starts to creep higher than 35 percent of income, that's when people start to think roommate, said Michael Beltrami, a vice president of the Stribling Wells & Gay agency.
He said that the typical roommate has grown older and better educated in the last 15 years and that the threat of changes in the city's rent stabilization and rent control laws has helped fuel the change. In Mr. Da Motta's case, the 30 percent increase, to $1,940, occurred when his landlord informed him that he was ending a discount in his lease in anticipation of rent deregulation.
Indeed, for Roommate Finders, at 18 one of the oldest agencies in the business, 1996 was a very good year, with business up 22 percent over 1995. The founder, Michael Santomauro, says his typical client is getting older and is as likely to be 40 as 20.
Lisa Wisely, an owner of Roommates N.Y.C., a three-year-old company created to tap into the booming shares market, added: "I've seen people from every walk of life, with every need. People always think that when they're done with their 20's they won't be doing this anymore. That's no longer the case."
Carol Sommers, 59, a travel agent, saw her income drop precipitously two years ago after a business failure and faced the possibility of losing the one-bedroom Gramercy Park apartment where she had brought up two children. Determined to stay, Ms. Sommers installed louvered doors on the 11-by-12-foot room that had served over the years as dining room, nursery and home office. She listed the room at what she calls the "preposterously high rent" of $500, and the phone rang off the wall.
"I saw 17 people in the first week," she recalled. "There were doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs. I never thought there would be so many people out there looking to share such a little space. I had my pick of the best." She chose a young man from Canada who was training to become an architect.
As with more than a dozen other sharers interviewed, coexisting in a small apartment has turned out to be less complicated than she expected, especially as it applies to sharing a single bathroom. The tacit understanding among roommates seems to be, Wait till the bathroom lights are out, and then proceed. Likewise, roommates with similar kitchen habits seem to gravitate to each other, and many prefer tenants who eat out, order in, or otherwise can limit their cooking to the microwave oven.
(Not Ms. Sommers: she always keeps plenty of food on hand. "It's my Jewish upbringing," she said. "I've got to be able to feed 40 people at all times, even if they never show up." She says her roommates are welcome to all the food they want, as long as they replace it with the same brands.)
 FOR many who share their apartments, what began as a financial necessity has evolved into a desirable way of life.
"I like having a kid back in the house without the emotional involvement," Ms. Sommers said. "They can do things that would have made my hair stand on end if they were my children, but I can sit back and enjoy it."
There are even those who don't depend on the additional rent but have become accustomed to the little luxuries that the extra money affords them. A 45-year-old computer graphics manager in TriBeCa said she uses the $700 a month she gets for sharing her four-bedroom loft as mad money for manicures, massages and weekend getaways.
Karen Gerber's motives for sharing are part economic, part esthetic: she loves her two-bedroom apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn. It is roomy, the sun pours in all day and the long views of Brooklyn brownstones are humble but charming. "It's big enough here for two to have privacy," said Ms. Gerber, an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "There's no comparison with the quality of life that having a roommate makes possible for me. I couldn't stand living in a little box of a studio, which is all I could afford on my own."
Andy Velez, 58, a writer, has a rent-stabilized apartment but has watched his rent gradually double in the last 15 years. Three years ago, he wanted to freelance full time and realized the only way he could do it was to share his two-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment. After four roommates that he termed "learning experiences," Mr. Velez now shares his home with an actor who is often away, most recently on tour in "The Phantom of the Opera."
"Ideally, I would rather not have a roommate, and I anticipate the day that I won't need to," Mr. Velez said. But meanwhile, he added, "it's very pleasant to have a friendly face around the house."
"Our lives are complementary but not deeply intermingled, which suits both of us," he said.
Mr. Da Motta, the designer, turned the arrival of his roommate, Web Tysver, 25, into a design opportunity.
He got out the masking tape and outlined a new angled wall near the front door of his long, thin, one-bedroom apartment. With a designer's sense of proportion, he placed the wall to give an improved sense of flow from the entrance into the living room, allowing people to feel enclosed on entering and then, a few steps later, to be treated to a sweeping view of the far end of the apartment and the view through the three eight-foot windows toward a warehouse tiled in terra cotta.
He found Mr. Tysver by canvassing friends. Mr. Tysver filled the bill admirably: he was an acquaintance, and a designer himself.
Mr. Tysver's rent deposit of $800 went toward building the new angled wall. The cocoon-shaped space carved out of the entrance hall had an inoperable window, so Mr. Tysver suggested inserting a small window in the interior wall. It has fluted, hammered glass for privacy, but when opened, it admits a neat shaft of light into the interior of the apartment. The new 12-foot-high wall, made of dry wall on a frame of metal studs, even allows for more storage space tucked into the top three feet.
The new living arrangement has proven a mutual success. After four years of living alone in New York, Mr. Da Motta was surprised to discover that perhaps he had needed a roommate all along. "I was born in a crowd," he said of his large family in Brazil. "I should have known that living alone was not for me. Looking back, I realize that some of the emotional difficulties of those first years here may have had to do with the basic lack of companionship."
Like many others who share apartments, Mr. Da Motta and Mr. Tysver have found that some expected flash points turn out not to be so fraught with tension. Sharing a bathroom, for instance, has never been an issue. Nor have kitchen privileges: "We don't share food generally," Mr. Da Motta said, "but we don't label everything either. The only hard and fast rule is, Don't leave dirty dishes in the sink."
He added that in his view there are two essential amenities to easing the roommate way of life: separate phone lines, and a cleaning service. To that, the design-savvy Mr. Da Motta adds one more sine qua non: a soundproof bedroom. To achieve that, he lined his walls with fabrics: hanging velvets hide the closets, and a large tapestry fills another wall. On the floors, a Japanese sea grass rug is bordered in linen and rubberized on the back to further insulate against noise. For the ceilings, Mr. Da Motta designed an ingenious tentlike web of theatrical muslin affixed with eye hooks connecting to a wood valance running around the walls.
Unlike many other roommates who guard their privacy zealously, Mr. Da Motta and Mr. Tysver have found that they enjoy socializing with each other's friends. "When Web is entertaining, I'm an instant guest," Mr. Da Motta said.
"It's nice to have someone there to help with little emergencies," Mr. Tysver said, adding: "Even if the money weren't a factor, I would consider it. It's much better than having a pet."
 
Deregulation: Ins and Outs
 
THE laws that govern rent regulation in New York will expire on June 15 unless the Legislature in Albany takes action to renew them. Speculation is running high about what might happen to the tenants of rent-regulated apartments if the law is changed or allowed to expire.
Currently, rent regulations can be removed from an occupied apartment if the rent exceeds $2,000 a month and if the occupants make $250,000 a year for two consecutive years.
While real estate watchers acknowledge that no one knows for certain what is going to happen, among the most discussed possibilities is lowering the income threshold for this "luxury decontrol," perhaps to $150,000.
An even more likely possibility, said Ann Snee, a managing director of the Corcoran Group, the Manhattan real estate company, is "decontrol by attrition," meaning that apartments would be deregulated as they became vacant. Current laws allow deregulation only for vacant apartments where rents will be $2,000 or more.
For people considering a roommate, an important caution: The combined incomes of the prime tenant plus the incomes of all roommates will be the figure used in determining whether an apartment is eligible for deregulation. So taking in an investment banker could mean that the rent for your stabilized apartment would be repegged at market value.

Chart: "The High Cost of Living Alone"
After 3 years of significant rental increases throughout the city, what can you afford? The Real Estate Board of New York suggests multiplying the monthly rent that you are considering by 40 to 50. (Some agents average the figure to 45.) The total is what you should be earning annually. If you're not, maybe it's time to get a roommate.
 
For example: to afford a one bedroom rental on the Upper West Side with a going rate of $1,943, here's what you should earn: $1,943 * 45 = $87,435 a year

Aerosmith's 'Nine Lives'
The fact that Aerosmith is still a major force in the music world is one of pop culture's great unsolved mysteries. By all rights, Aerosmith should be nostalgia by now. Since the late 70's, this hard-rock band has been buffeted by drug abuse, in-fighting, musical stasis and all kinds of business problems. It has let its record labels make its creative decisions for it, and it has managed to ally itself with everything that marketing surveys deem cutting-edge -- rap music, the Internet, CD-ROM's -- while hardly changing its boy's-night-out sound (except for maybe increasing the ratio of power ballads to rockers).
The story behind its current album, "Nine Lives," released on Columbia on Tuesday, would seem fantastic even to a soap-opera script-writer: the band laid off its longtime manager, dismissed its record producer, temporarily lost a member to depression, weathered accusations of straying from sobriety (which it denies), underwent group therapy, made a controversial decision to release a promotional album solely to Wal-Mart and remade the entirety of "Nine Lives" because Columbia didn't like it. 
 For Aerosmith, every album is a fight to stay relevant. And at Tuesday night's release party for "Nine Lives" at the newly renovated Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan Center, the band fought hard. It sought to throw the most elaborate and extravagant record-release party of the year, and like most events staged by arena-rock bands of the Aerosmith type, it was a grand but empty gesture.
That's not to say that the party was bad. It was a great spectacle. For the first half of the night, the hall was divided into nine rooms, each representing a different song on "Nine Lives." There was an aquarium room, with a woman dressed in a mermaid outfit and waitresses serving sea breeze cocktails and oyster shots. There was a petting zoo, with women dressed up like animals and a cellist playing Aerosmith songs. There was a pole-dance room, a devil's room and a doctor's office. What tied them together was that each had a different cocktail and a different scantily clad woman wearing fetish apparel.
After a couple of hours, the partitions that separated the rooms were raised to the ceiling to reveal a large stage. There was a trite display of subversive entertainment -- a combination freak show and fetish ball with a sword swallower, an escape artist and many rubber-clad women (perhaps in honor of the new album's couplet, "I want to be your lover/I want to wrap you in rubber"). And then Aerosmith performed the first concert in the remodeled hall, which is to open to the public in May.
The band played mostly new, innuendo-drenched songs, occasionally looking back to the 70's for hits like "Sweet Emotion" and "Walk This Way." Oddly, the band's new album rocks (and rocking is Aerosmith's renewed priority) a lot more than the half-hour show did. Nonetheless, Aerosmith succeeded in disproving one lyric on "Nine Lives": the one where the 48-year-old Steven Tyler sings "I'm no Peter Pan."
 
 
Bruce Odland and Sam Auinger
 In recent years, the sound artists Bruce Odland and Sam Auinger have used as their acoustic canvas a castle in Linz, Austria, ancient ruins in Rome and the entire town of Salzburg in Austria. Last week, they labored on their latest: Manhattan's warehouse district. From the Kitchen performance space, the pair turned the sounds of the city into eerily beautiful music.
Approaching the Kitchen, one could see a long white tube hanging down the side of the building, a parabolic dish spinning on the roof and, on top of the Roxy club, a white tube like a Cyclops gazing across the West Side Highway. The sights of the city were captured on camera by the parabolic dishes while the sounds traveled through the long white tubes (each tuned to a different note) into the second floor of the Kitchen, where they were sent through a battery of digital effects. After this journey, the impatient hum of the West Side Highway filled the Kitchen like ominous music from a horror film while 10th Avenue buzzed like a musical swarm of bees.
"After we first did this installation," Mr. Odland said, "I dreamt all night that I was a bee and couldn't get the honey off my wings. The sounds are from an industrial soundscape generated by the economy of the city that our brains can't decode. It's like a human hive. But instead of being about honey, it's about money."

Dollar Is Up Against the Mark On Rate Bets in the 2 Nations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the mark yesterday for the first time in four days after a report on Germany's money supply reinforced expectations that the Bundesbank would not soon raise German interest rates.
The central bank said that its key inflation gauge, the M-3 money supply, grew at a 9.1 percent annual rate in February from the fourth quarter of 1996, slowing from January. 
 "The M-3 number shows inflation is still low," said Ivar Bjornstad, foreign-exchange chief at Den Norske Bank. "That has people thinking the Bundesbank is on hold, and helped the dollar against the mark."
The dollar was also bolstered by reports on February consumer prices and wages in the United States, which lent themselves to the notion that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates. The Fed's key committee meets next week.
"The U.S. economy is stronger than Germany's, rates are higher, and I think the Fed may tighten in March and May," said Hans Boman, a currency trader at Swedbank.
The premium of American interest rates over German rates makes dollar investments attractive. Foreigners' purchase of dollars has helped push the currency up 9 percent against the mark this year. German 10-year bonds yield 5.91 percent, compared with 6.73 percent for United States 10-year bonds.
"I don't see in the next 12 months how interest-rate differentials could turn against the dollar," said Laura Zimmerman, senior portfolio strategist at Payden & Rygel of Los Angeles, which manages $23 billion.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.6816 marks, up from a three-week low of 1.6727 marks on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 122.82 Japanese yen from 122.43 yen. But it fell against the British pound, which traded at $1.5982 compared with $1.5901 late Tuesday.
A report showing rising business confidence in Germany tempered enthusiasm for the dollar. The Ifo economic institute said its index of western German business confidence rose to 93.6 in February from 93.3 in January. The February reading is the highest since June 1995.
"That takes some of the gloom and doom out of the German economy," said Stephen Flanagan, a currency trader with Credit Agricole.

The New Iron Curtain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If you have any doubts that the cold war is over, I suggest you watch CNN's coverage of Albania.
The CNN reports usually begin by showing a map of the sea off Albania. On this map are little ships, each representing one of the U.S. and other foreign naval vessels that have rushed to Albania's shores. In the cold war, the ships on that map would have been U.S. and Soviet warships competing over who would get into Albania first, fill the vacuum there and thus gain an edge in the worldwide superpower competition. In the new era, an era defined not by the cold war but by globalization, the game is different: The winner is the country whose navy gets its citizens out of Albania first and gets away the fastest. Today, the loser occupies Albania; the winner evacuates Albania. 
 And that's why conflicts like Albania, Zaire, Liberia and Algeria don't spread quite the way they used to. In the cold war, these internal conflicts had a built-in reason to spread. The world was divided into zones of influence, and if pro-Soviet forces rose in Albania or Zaire, the U.S. supported pro-American forces next door. And thus not only did the two superpowers help conflicts to spread, by backing different factions, they funded these factions to carry on the war.
Now flash forward to the new world of globalization -- a world in which the integration of financial networks, information and trade is binding the globe together and shifting power from governments to markets. In the world of globalization there is only one superpower: the U.S. There is no worldwide competition with the Soviets, so there is no automatic impulse for the U.S. to take sides in Albania or Zaire. There's no "our guys" because there's no "their guys."
And no one even pretends today that the war in Albania is Karl Marx vs. Thomas Jefferson. It's more Thomas Hobbes vs. Thomas Hobbes -- the state mafia vs. the street mafia. The Financial Times quoted a woman in Albania dragging away her front door for firewood as describing the political choices like this: "I don't care about the royal family or the President. They are all scum."
In the cold war, all that a third-world government like Albania's needed to do to get funds was to align with a superpower. But today the U.S. is low on cash and Moscow's broke. It is the supermarkets -- the Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Wall Street stock markets -- that pass out the cash now. And the supermarkets don't finance civil wars. Rather, they punish countries for war-making by withholding any investment capital for them to grow. In the world of globalization, the only way Albania or Zaire get financed is if they have a real government, and it's precisely because they didn't that they melted down. Now they get the new Iron Curtain -- the one the supermarkets build around the Zaires and Albanias, to seal them off, so the world can do business around them.
Still, globalization doesn't mean the end of geopolitics. All you have to do is look at China vs. Taiwan or Arabs vs. Israelis to know that competition for territory, resources and identity have not gone away in a market-dominated world. But globalization definitely changes the costs and benefits that countries have to calculate as they play out their geopolitics. The conflicts in Albania or Zaire could spread, but it will be more like a cancer spilling over the border, not something driven from outside.
All of this has become rather confusing for U.S. diplomats, suckled on the cold war. Who are the good guys in Zaire, besides the innocent civilians, and how do we help them? One U.S. diplomat I know who served in Moscow and is now in Africa said to me: "When I joined the Foreign Service, you knew where the goalposts were, and you knew all the plays. But now it's like you're in the huddle and everyone is asking everyone else, 'Which way is the goal line?'
"The more I'm here," my friend added, "the more I feel like I'm in that scene of 'The Grapes of Wrath,' when the banker comes to take away the tenant farmer's home and the farmer threatens to shoot the banker, but the banker says it's not his fault, he's just working for the Big Corporation. The farmer asks, but where does it all stop? Who can we shoot? And the banker says, 'I don't know, maybe there's nobody to shoot.' "

HEADLINE: Price Index Rose by 0.3% In February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February, led by higher costs for fresh vegetables and natural gas, the Labor Department said today.
Still, prices not including food and energy remained tame. The closely watched core rate, which excludes those two categories, increased only two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Analysts had expected today's report to show gains of two-tenths of 1 percent in both the rate over all and in the core rate. During January, consumer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent, the smallest increase since June 1996, and the core rate grew by the same amount.
Technological improvements, competition and an unusual absence of wage inflation -- at least until last month -- have helped contain prices in many industries. Nevertheless, evidence of economic strength -- a rebound in industrial production, relatively robust retail sales and rapid employment growth -- suggests to many analysts that Federal Reserve policy makers will consider raising interest rates to cool the economy and guard against accelerating inflation. They meet next Tuesday.
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, "made it clear that trends in the core rate may not be favorable in 1997," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., before today's report. "That is, if the Fed doesn't act preventively."
Another report issued today could influence the policy makers. The Labor Department said that Americans' weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 2.4 percent in February from January -- the largest increase on record.
Earnings had fallen in January; the decline was revised today to 1.7 percent from 2.1 percent.
Economists are concerned about the potential for accelerating labor costs stemming from the low unemployment rate, which has forced many employers to offer higher wages to attract job applicants. Labor costs, including wages and benefits, account for about two-thirds of consumer prices.
February's report on consumer prices said food prices, which account for about one-sixth of the Consumer Price Index, increased three-tenths of 1 percent as the cost of fresh vegetables rose by the largest amount in almost two years. Beef, poultry and dairy costs were lower.
Energy prices, which account for about one-tenth of the index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Natural gas prices surged for a second month while gasoline prices showed little change and fuel oil prices dropped. Natural gas prices have been running about 14 percent above their levels a year ago.
In other categories, housing costs climbed three-tenths of 1 percent, while costs of clothing, medical treatment and entertainment each rose two-tenths of 1 percent. Transportation costs dropped one-tenth of 1 percent as airline fares continued to fall.
Last week, the Labor Department said producer prices unexpectedly fell four-tenths of 1 percent in February, the largest decline in more than two years.

HEADLINE: Court Opens Species Act To Wider List Of Challenges

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that people can sue the Federal Government not only for doing too little to protect endangered species, but also for doing too much.
The unanimous decision opens the door to lawsuits under the Endangered Species Act by people whose economic interests are affected by restrictions placed on land and water use for the purpose of protecting endangered species. A Federal appeals court had ruled, in a 1995 decision the Court overturned today, that those complaining about overregulation lacked legal standing to sue because they did not fall within the "zone of interests" the Endangered Species Act was enacted to protect. 
 The decision today, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, reinstated a lawsuit brought against the Fish and Wildlife Service by a group of Oregon ranchers and irrigation districts seeking to block proposed limitations on the release of water from the Klamath Irrigation Project near the Oregon-California border.
The wildlife service had issued a report concluding that higher water levels should be maintained in two of the project's reservoirs to protect the habitat of two endangered species of fish, the Lost River sucker and the shortnose sucker.
The ranchers' suit alleged that there was no evidence that the population of the fish was declining in the reservoirs or that higher water levels would help them. The Federal District Court in Eugene, Ore., dismissed the lawsuit in a ruling that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, affirmed.
In reinstating the lawsuit, the Court said today that there was no basis in the Endangered Species Act for concluding that the right to challenge the way the Government enforces the law "applies to environmentalists alone."
Justice Scalia noted that Congress wrote no limitation into a provision of the law authorizing "any person" to bring a suit challenging the way the Secretary of the Interior is carrying out the law. He said there was no reason to interpret the provision as applying only to "underenforcement" but not to "overenforcement."
Most other Federal environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and others, also include similarly worded "citizen suit" provisions that will presumably now be available to those seeking to challenge regulatory actions under those laws.
The case, Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813, attracted considerable attention from business and property-rights groups, which argued in briefs filed with the Supreme Court that the Ninth Circuit's decision had turned the Endangered Species Act into an unfairly one-sided law.
W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest and Paper Association, praised the Supreme Court's ruling in an interview today as restoring balance to the law.
Given the expense of litigation, industry groups would not rush to bring "a rash of cases," Mr. Moore said, "but when it's a question of poor science or regulation gone overbroad, you'll find the law now being used to correct it."
The Clinton Administration defended the Ninth Circuit's decision to dismiss the lawsuit, although the Administration's brief did not adopt the appeals court's reasoning. Environmental groups filed no briefs in the case, because they have most often been on the side of urging the Court to take a more expansive view of the right to sue and so did not want to be on record as urging a more restrictive view of legal standing even for their opponents.
"Citizens ought to have access to the courthouse to make sure the Government doesn't run amok in either direction," William Snape 3d, legal director of Defenders of Wildlife, said in an interview today.
Mr. Snape said the decision would have the positive effect, from the environmentalists' point of view, of removing an irritant that had prompted calls in Congress to overturn the Ninth Circuit's decision legislatively.
Patrick Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School and director of its Environmental Law Center, said the decision could prove to be "a tool for creative environmental litigation" rather than a setback.
In an interview, Mr. Parenteau said the "logic of the decision" would support new kinds of environmental-based legal challenges to Government actions involving energy use, transportation planning, and even tax policy.
"This is the first time in years that the Court has broadened standing in environmental cases," he said.

Price Report Sets Off Fall In Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities slid yesterday, after a report of a bigger-than-expected increase in consumer prices raised investors' concern that inflation will accelerate and that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool down the economy.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 10/32, to 95 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.98 percent, from 6.96 percent on Tuesday. 
 The consumer price report did not appear to change bond traders' expectations -- now roughly equally divided -- of whether there will be an increase in interest rates when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week. But investors were bracing themselves in case Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, provides any hint of the Fed's intentions in Congressional testimony today.
The three-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices in February was a bit higher than the two-tenths of 1 percent rise that was expected, though the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, was up two-tenths of 1 percent, as expected. The core rate was held in check by a 2.6 percent decline in air fares, which analysts expect will be reversed in the spring.
Traders said concerns over coming supply also became a factor in trading, as there was some worry about how the sale of two-year and five-year notes next week would be received.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.24 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.57 percent.
Some analysts said that dealers would have to lower prices and raise yields to more attractive levels if they expected people to buy the securities whent the Fed is deciding monetary policy and the course of interest rates for the next few months.
"Next Tuesday's F.O.M.C. outcome is a tough call, but we still come down on the side of a steady policy stance," said Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco. "The C.P.I. data did not provide a strong signal one way or another, and we're in the same boat we've been in over the last six F.O.M.C. meetings of strong growth with mixed inflation. It is not obvious that the risks to the price outlook are significantly greater now, mandating a tightening at the March meeting. We still expect a tightening at the May meeting."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, also said he did not think that the report made an increase in interest rates necessary.
"Once again we have an economic report that confirms the complete lack of inflationary pressure in the economy," he said. But Mr. McCarthy said that because Mr. Greenspan had talked in the past about having to counter inflation before it got started, an increase in rates could not be ruled out, even if inflation data showed few signs of increases.
Still, "we think this report should keep monetary policy on hold at next week's F.O.M.C. meeting," Mr. McCarthy said.
But Allen Sinai, chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics Inc., an economic advisory firm, in recent market comments said the Fed could not simply sit by and take pride in the strong performance of the economy and the relative lack of inflation. "If no tightening action is taken and the exuberance continues, the Federal Reserve will be taking a big risk that price inflation 6 to 12 months hence will accelerate from current levels," Mr. Sinai said. "If some action is taken, then there is still time, given the lags between monetary policy, the economy and inflation, to prevent a rise in price inflation and with little risk of big damage to the economy."
He said Primark was predicting an increase of one-quarter of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, with further increases later this year.
But even if there is an increase, and despite the strength in the economy and the risk of higher inflation, he said, the yield on the 30-year bond is expected to trade in the range of 7 percent to 7.25 percent in the near term, not much higher than current levels.

HEADLINE: Messinger Proposes 50 Fares For City Children on M.T.A.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, a Democratic candidate for mayor, urged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday to permit children between 5 and 11 to ride New York City subways and buses for 50 cents during off-peak hours.
Children can now ride the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Long Island Rail Road for 50 cents during off hours. Ms. Messinger said the M.T.A. was discriminating against New York City transit riders by not offering the same deal to them. 
 Children 44 inches tall or less -- generally speaking, 5 years old and younger -- are permitted to ride free on the city transit system at any time. About 500,000 children are given passes that allow them to ride free or half price to school.
Ms. Messinger has been looking for issues with which to distinguish herself from the three other Democratic candidates seeking to run against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Her advisers said yesterday that this would be one of them. Ms. Messinger issued a press release and wrote a letter to Mr. Giuliani urging the change in policy.
"The M.T.A. calls this 'good marketing,' " Ms. Messinger said in her letter to Mr. Giuliani. "I call this a double standard. A kid is a kid is a kid, after all, whether they live in Stamford or Stuyvesant Town."
Ms. Messinger was unable to offer an estimate yesterday of how many children her policy might affect, how much it might cost the M.T.A. in lost revenues, or whether the policy should apply to children riding alone or only when accompanied by parents. She said she decided to seize on this policy -- which has existed for rail lines outside the city since April 1990 -- after hearing it promoted in a public service advertisement on a local radio station.
Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Colleen A. Roche, said the Mayor had no comment on Ms. Messinger's proposals. "We'll take a look at the plan," she said. M.T.A. officials also declined to comment.
But M.T.A. officials defended the policy yesterday, saying it had promoted economic activity in the city. "We will review her letter," Tom Kelly, the M.T.A. press secretary, said. "But the program was instituted seven years ago so that people outside of the five boroughs could take advantage of all that the city has to offer, in addition to producing additional economic activity in the city."
"If you're asking why it took so long for her to notice it," Mr. Kelly said, "my response to that is, it's an election year."

HEADLINE: Play It Again, Boris

 BODY:
After comparing surgical histories in Helsinki, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will slip some coins into the diplomatic jukebox and play a few top hits from the cold war. Among the old favorites will be nuclear arms reductions, the balance of power in Europe and the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The agenda of the convalescing Presidents reflects both the enduring importance of the nuclear weapons issue and the misplaced emphasis the Clinton Administration has given to NATO expansion.
The most threatening legacy of the cold war is the nuclear arsenals still maintained by the United States and Russia. Though the number of nuclear warheads is falling, and the two countries no longer target their missiles at one another, the remaining firepower exceeds any reasonable limit. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin need to devote much time to renewing the efforts of both countries to retire and dismantle nuclear warheads and missiles. 
 To that end, Mr. Clinton has sensibly offered to explore the outlines of a future arms reduction treaty to encourage the Russian Parliament to ratify the last accord, which was signed during the Bush Administration. Mr. Yeltsin ought to welcome this offer and work with Mr. Clinton to cut warhead levels in each country to the 3,000-to-3,500 range specified in the last treaty and to set lower limits in a future agreement.
But these vital matters may not get sufficient attention in Helsinki. The reason is that Mr. Clinton has loaded the agenda with European security questions revolving around his determination to expand NATO eastward into Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic by 1999. At a time when American and Russian officials should be talking about ways to consolidate democracy and free markets in Russia, they have been arguing over the number of tanks that can be stationed in Poland.
Under pressure from Washington, Moscow has at least temporarily given up hopes of stopping this expansion into Central Europe and is instead trying to negotiate the best terms it can before NATO officially issues invitations for new memberships this summer. Washington, in turn, has offered a variety of inducements to Moscow, including a pledge not to place nuclear weapons on the territory of new members and a proposal to cut the number of conventional weapons in Western Europe while freezing the number in Central Europe.
Washington has also promised a modest increase in financial assistance to Russia and an enhanced role for Moscow in international economic institutions.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin will no doubt spend considerable time haggling over the terms of a proposed charter that would spell out a new relationship between Russia and NATO. The idea is to make Russia a partner in many NATO activities, including peacekeeping missions like the current one in Bosnia where Russian soldiers are participating. But Russia, at least for now, would not be invited to become a full NATO member.
The rush to enlarge NATO is not justified by any Russian military threat today. Russian conventional forces are weak, and even a government with imperial ambitions would require years of draining expense before it could threaten Europe again. Nor will NATO growth do anything to bolster the economies of Central European countries, which face a substantial cost to modernize and integrate their military forces into the alliance.
The future stability of Europe depends more than anything on stability in Russia. Rather than taking actions that may isolate Russia and encourage a resurgence of Russian nationalism, the United States ought to concentrate on trying to help Russia rebuild its faltering economy, establish a fair and effective tax system and make democracy irreversible. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin cannot advance those interests by debating the balance of power in Europe.

HEADLINE: Jacques Foccart Dies at 83; Secret Mastermind in Africa

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 19

 BODY:
Jacques Foccart, who masterminded clandestine military coups in French-speaking Africa for Charles de Gaulle and three French presidents after him, died at his home this morning. He was 83.
Mr. Foccart's secrecy and preference for operating in the shadows were legendary. He was trusted by France's friends in Africa and remained a powerful influence on his country's African policy almost to his death, serving as an honorary adviser to President Jacques Chirac after his election in 1995. 
 Mr. Foccart's Machiavellian hand was seen in many a coup and manipulation in French-speaking Africa over the years, and lately in Mr. Chirac's policy of indirect support for President Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, despite the crumbling of support for Mr. Mobutu at home.
Gaullist politicians paid effusive tribute to him today. "A great servant of our country has died," said Economic Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain.
Mr. Foccart was born in Ambrieres near Mayenne in west-central France on Aug. 31, 1913. He spent his first six years in Guadeloupe, where his family had property. Drafted into the French Army at the start of World War II, he avoided capture when France fell and, according to his biographer, Pierre Pean, joined the Resistance only after the German occupiers brought a criminal complaint against him for construction work he was doing for them to build fortifications on the Atlantic coast.
For his Resistance work he won an award from the United States Army and friendships in the inner circle of the leadership around General de Gaulle, the leader of the French government in exile.
After the war he started an import-export company called Safiex that did business in many of the French colonies in Africa, although Mr. Foccart said most of its activities were centered on the West Indies.
The company did so well that Mr. Foccart, almost single-handedly, was able to finance the Rally of the French People, the party that de Gaulle, who had served briefly as President after returning to France in 1944, organized to support his political agenda.
Mr. Foccart also became one of the founders of a powerful private police force the movement organized to do battle against the Communists -- the Service d'Action Civique, the "Action Service."
Its school in Cercottes, outside of Orleans, became a gathering place for the keepers of the Gaullist flame in the 1950s. Mr. Foccart forged lasting connections there with a network of army officers and secret service operatives that survived long after de Gaulle's movement disbanded in 1955.
Support for the General did not die with it. With a colonial war raging in Algeria, the men fighting to keep it a French colony thought politicians in Paris were selling them out, and many came to believe de Gaulle could keep Algeria French.
Under the code name "Mathurin," Mr. Foccart masterminded the strategy that brought the General back to power in 1958, using the secret intelligence networks he had forged to create popular fears of a coming coup d'etat led by angry paratroopers from Algeria and to make sure that when the Fourth Republic fell, de Gaulle, not the diehards in Algeria, would get power.
As first President of the Fifth Republic, de Gaulle made the bald, bespectacled Mr. Foccart, who was rarely seen in public, one of his closest aides. He became Secretary-General of the French Community, the vehicle de Gaulle created in 1960 after giving France's colonies in Africa nominal independence. There, Mr. Foccart put his clandestine operating skills to use over the next nine years.
"Foccart was assigned the task of orchestrating an arrangement whereby French interests could maintain the upper hand in her former colonies, for whom she had done virtually nothing to prepare for independence," Douglas Porch, an American expert, wrote in "The French Secret Services," published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1995.
In 1964, Mr. Foccart sent French troops to oil-rich Gabon to keep Leon Mba, a close ally, in power against an American-supported rival, and incidentally to protect the local interests of the French petroleum group Elf, led by another close friend.
Asked by Philippe Gaillard in his first volume of memoirs, "Foccart Speaks," published in France two years ago, who had run Gabon, Mr. Foccart said, "Without question, it was Mba. But I was available, and he consulted me a lot."
There were six military coups in French-speaking Africa at the end of 1965 and the beginning of 1966, but, Mr. Foccart said, France did nothing to foment any of those, including one that brought Jean-Bedel Bokassa to power as President of the Central African Republic.
The threat of calling off a visit by Mr. Bokassa to Paris in 1969 was enough, he recalled, to get the African leader to halt an economic boycott of Chad, another country where France had, and still has, important military interests.
He was a lifelong friend of Felix Houphouet-Boigny , who served in French governments in colonial times and later became President of the Ivory Coast.
"He never caused blood to flow, and he let fewer of his opponents rot in prison than others did," Mr. Foccart later wrote.
De Gaulle left power after a year of tumult in France in 1969, but Mr. Foccart stayed on, first for President Georges Pompidou and later, despite some interruptions, for President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who finally authorized French support for an uprising against Mr. Bokassa after the African leader proclaimed himself Emperor.
"There were chiefs of state who had sent their ambassadors demands for French assistance in case of a coup d'etat," Mr. Foccart told the daily Le Figaro, without revealing details. He wrote a second volume of memoirs to fill in some of the gaps in the first, but delayed its publication. A spokeswoman for the publisher, Fayard/Jeune Afrique, said it would come out on April 9.

HEADLINE: Brokerage Houses Come Out Winners in State Takeover of Lilco

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Analysts on Wall Street expressed some reservations yesterday about the attractiveness of the $7 billion bond issue -- the largest municipal bond issue in history -- that is the central element of the partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company.
But there was widespread enthusiasm among brokerage houses about the chance to sell the bonds. 
 The total fees associated with the sale could reach $40 million for the firms that sell the bonds. And Bear Stearns, which served as an adviser to the Long Island Power Authority, will be competing for some of the business, said Bob Foran, a senior managing director at the firm.
In bidding for the consulting work for the power authority, Mr. Foran said, the firm had made clear it would want to resign at some point to compete for the underwriting.
"We are looking forward to competing," he said. "After all, we are in the bond business."
Selling the bonds is expected to begin after all the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, which is expected to take about 18 months. The first sale will total $4.2 billion, which is larger than the total of municipal bonds New York State has outstanding.
It will be followed by two smaller issues.
Mr. Foran said he expected the sale to go well, but acknowledged that the interest rate LIPA will have to pay will be a little higher than that on other issues with the same credit rating and outlook, mostly because of the enormousness of the issue.
But one veteran of the municipal bond market who grew up in Brooklyn and worked on Long Island will need convincing. "I will have to see a lot of analysis and data," said Austin Tobin, president of Delphis Hanover Corporation in Southbury, Conn. "And so will everybody else."
Analysts said it was not clear how easy it would be over the long term for the authority to meet the principal and interest costs.
"The strength of cash flow over time will be one of the key ratings' hot buttons," said Julia Doetsch, the senior analyst for Lilco at Moody's Investors Service, a rating agency. She said she could not make a judgment now because all the data was not available.
Standard & Poor's, another major credit rating agency, said that it had changed its rating on Lilco to account for the uncertainty that surrounds the deal. The rating went from BBB minus on credit watch with a positive outlook to BBB minus with a developing outlook, which means the rating could go up or down.
S&P said its "initial credit concerns" were that despite the reduction in electric rates, they would still be relatively high and "could politically limit LIPA's rate flexibility." In addition, S&P said a move by municipalities to take over the distribution of electricity locally could "dilute LIPA's ability to raise revenues and repay its debt."
Bill Tilles, a senior analyst at Smith Barney, suggested there was one long-term issue potential buyers of the municipal bonds, which will have a maturity of 30 years, should think about. That is the possibility that Brooklyn Union Gas might eventually decide to go into the electricity business on Long Island, making it a LIPA rival.

New York Created 44,500 Jobs in 1996

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City had its best year in 1996 since the 1980's in creating new private sector jobs, according to revised figures from the city and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The city said that 44,500 new jobs were added, an upward revision of 7,500 from its preliminary count. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, using a slightly different calculating method, said the year-to-year increase in new jobs was 50,000, up 15,000 from its earlier number. 
 By both measures, it was the best one-year total for new jobs since the city began recovering from the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The last year that came close was 1994, early in the economic recovery, when the city added 47,000 jobs. The growth rate fell in 1995, when only 27,000 new jobs were added.
The new job total for January was also very strong, up 16,900 jobs from last January, though economists caution that the monthly number is very volatile and does not necessarily suggest a newly accelerated pattern.
The city added 24,000 jobs in one month last year, for example, as people returned to work after the economic disruption of the winter's blizzards.
And the city's unemployment rate was also up in January, to 9.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, its highest level since March 1994.

HEADLINE: Bell Atlantic, Nynex Merger Set to Advance

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
New York State regulators are expected to give qualified approval today to the $22 billion merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex. And in a victory for Nynex, the chairman of the Public Service Commission indicated that the regulators were reluctant to demand cuts in local telephone rates as a condition for endorsing the deal, according to people who attended the meeting.
Executives at Nynex had expected the commission to rule on the merger yesterday. But after an uncharacteristically freewheeling discussion among the three commissioners, the chairman, John F. O'Mara, put off a final ruling until a special session scheduled for this morning. 
 People who attended yesterday's meeting said the commissioners were likely to attach several strings to their approval, including a commitment by Nynex to improve its customer service and to invest in its aging telephone network. But on the key issue of a rate cut, Mr. O'Mara favored letting Nynex off the hook for at least three years.
That prompted a last-minute blast of criticism from consumer advocates and competitors of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, who contended that New York State was not extracting enough concessions from Nynex.
"Every Nynex customer has a right to immediate rate relief," said Robert Ceisler, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer lobbying group, "I am quite concerned that the economic benefits to consumers will be put off until the year 2000."
If the Public Service Commission approves the deal today, it would be an odd reversal of expectations in what has been a two-track regulatory process. Nynex and Bell Atlantic had regarded the commission as the biggest hurdle to their merger ever since they announced it last April, because of Nynex's troubled customer service record in the state and because of the commission's aggressive reputation.
Yet just as New York seems to be falling into line, the second track of the process is now posing a problem for Bell Atlantic and Nynex. The Justice Department, which has approved other telecommunications mergers, is stepping up its antitrust scrutiny of the deal. Lawyers for the companies met with officials in Washington last evening to discuss whether the merger would eliminate potential competition in the phone business.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex must also receive the blessing of the Federal Communications Commission, but the companies said that would not be a problem if the Justice Department approved the deal.
Executives at both companies declined to discuss either the Federal investigation or the New York proceeding. But one senior executive at Nynex said that an endorsement in New York would increase the pressure on the Justice Department to go along with the deal.
Still, in a similar merger between SBC Communications and the Pacific Telesis Group, California regulators have not dropped their demands in the wake of the Justice Department's approval of that deal.
Fears about the regulatory delays dragged down Nynex's stock yesterday by $1.75 a share, to $47.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Bell Atlantic's shares also fell $1.75, to $68.375. Analysts noted that the shares of other regional Bell telephone companies declined as well.
In New York, the debate over the merger has been linked to more general concerns about Nynex's poor customer service. Last November, the staff of the Public Service Commission harshly criticized Nynex's service record and recommended that Nynex be forced to return some of the savings it would realize from the deal in the form of lower rates.
The staff did not stipulate the size of the reduction, but consumer advocates have argued that Nynex should reduce rates for its 7.5 million residential customers by $1.25 billion over five years. They said that number reflected both the internal savings from by the merger and a calculation the amount of savings customers would have to forgo by not having Bell Atlantic as a competitor to Nynex.
People who attended the meeting, however, said Mr. O'Mara argued that Nynex's rates should be left alone until 2000, when the state could better assess the savings of the merger. That would be the fifth year of a seven-year rate agreement between Nynex and New York State.
In the meantime, Nynex would pledge to upgrade its network, which has deteriorated badly in some New York City neighborhoods. The company would also adhere to more stringent customer service standards. Among the proposals being considered by the commission: a pledge that Nynex would raise its service standards in New York to be in line with the service record of Bell Atlantic in its mid-Atlantic region.
Critics of the merger noted that the commission had planned to review Nynex's rate agreement in three years anyway. So the critics contend that the commission is effectively not asking Nynex to do anything more than honor the deal it already has with the state.
Moreover, they said the commissioners did not address the loss in potential competition that would result when two huge phone companies join forces to dominate a region. "Not a word was mentioned about the anticompetitive issues," said Donna Sorgi, the regional executive for public policy at MCI Communications Corporation.
New York's Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, has opposed the deal because he believes it would be anti-competitive. The loss of potential competition is also a central focus of officials at the Justice Department, who have pored over internal documents at Bell Atlantic that lay out plans for competing for long-distance customers in Nynex's region.
People who attended the meeting said the commissioners noted that the Justice Department was conducting its own investigation -- a gesture some observers interpreted to mean that if the Federal Government were to challenge the deal, New York might reconsider its approval.
On the plus side for Nynex, Mr. O'Mara reiterated his earlier statement that New York's economy would benefit by having the headquarters of the combined company in Manhattan, rather than in Philadelphia, where Bell Atlantic is based. People at the meeting said the commissioners discussed ways to guarantee that the new company would not move its headquarters out of New York later.
In addition to Mr. O'Mara, who was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, the other commissioners are Thomas Dunleavy and Eugene Zeltman, both of whom were also appointed by Mr. Pataki.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Congressional Leaders Lay Out Differences on Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
President Clinton and Congressional budget leaders met today to lay out their differences over how to eliminate the Federal deficit, with both sides having powerful motivations to get a deal but facing intense opposition to possible compromises from within their own constituencies.
"We agree on the goal, we've agreed on a schedule to start discussion," Mr. Clinton told reporters after the meeting. "Now comes the hard work of writing the agreement dollar by dollar, program by program, issue by issue." 
 There were no breakthroughs at the 1-hour, 20-minute meeting in the White House, but both sides said they would continue to talk in the coming weeks in the hopes of bringing Republican leaders into serious negotiations with the Administration during the spring.
"They understand our pain, and we understand theirs," said Representative John R. Kasich, Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee.
Republican pain was particularly acute today, as their latest budget initiative came under intense criticism from one of the most influential allies of their party's conservative wing, Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition.
At issue was the suggestion by Speaker Newt Gingrich earlier this week that Republicans should consider temporarily setting aside their demands for a sweeping tax cut in order to concentrate on getting a balanced budget deal.
In what Republican aides said was an effort to deprive Democrats of an excuse not to agree to a balanced-budget plan, Mr. Gingrich said the Republicans should get Mr. Clinton to agree to lock in deep spending reductions first, and then return to taxes later.
But while Mr. Gingrich's proposal was seen by the White House as an olive branch, and while it holds some appeal to those in the party who put deficit reduction first, it has infuriated his own right wing, where tax cutting is an article of faith that comes behind no other priority. Several dozen Republicans who were first elected to the House in 1994 supporting the tax-cutting pledge in the Contract With America have put their names to a letter telling Mr. Gingrich to "count on our steadfast opposition to any reconciliation bill that turns it back on our promises to cut taxes for American families."
On Tuesday night, Mr. Reed sent members of Congress a letter warning that his group "could be forced to oppose a Republican budget resolution if it does not provide for significant and broad tax relief for American families."
In an interview today, Mr. Reed said his organization could easily produce enough Republican votes to doom any budget plan that does not include the party's proposed $500-per-child family tax credit. And he dismissed Mr. Gingrich's contention that it would be possible to push through tax cuts after securing a budget deal.
"Given the slim margin separating the parties in both houses, saying that we will get to you later is a sure-fire recipe for saying we will get to you never," Mr. Reed said.
Mr. Gingrich's proposal won backing today from moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats.
"We believe that considering tax cut legislation separately from the budget significantly improves the chances for an agreement to balance the Federal budget by 2002," said a letter signed by 40 members of the House, led by two Republicans, Representatives Michael N. Castle of Delaware and Fred Upton of Michigan, and two Democrats, Representatives Charles W. Stenholm of Texas and John Tanner of Tennessee.
But it was unclear whether Mr. Gingrich would be able to withstand the pressure from the right any better than Mr. Clinton was able to deal with the intense opposition from his party's left wing when he backed away earlier this month from another promising but politically explosive compromise, the proposal to save tens of billions of dollars in the next five years by reducing the cost of living increases received by Social Security recipients.
Balancing the budget is the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's second term agenda and is arguably the only issue sweeping enough to distract attention from his partisan woes over campaign financing.
For Congressional Republicans, reaching a budget deal is a chance to eradicate the shadow of extremism that Democrats hung on them in the last election, and to make good, at least partially, on their promises of the last several years to shrink the size of the Government and restore fiscal order to Washington.
The question now is whether it is possible to fashion a plan to balance the Federal budget by 2002 that will appeal to majorities of both parties without so incensing hard-liners on either side that a deal would be impossible.
The one area in which a compromise now seems likely is on the technical but extremely important issue of the economic assumptions that underpin any budget. Republicans over the last several years have insisted that any budget use assumptions generated by the Congressional Budget Office, which tends to use very cautious projections of growth, tax revenues, unemployment and other statistics that determine the gap between government receipts and expenditures. The White House uses more optimistic projections.

HEADLINE: Sowing Preservation;
Towns Are Slowing Invasion of Farms by Bulldozers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Mark Greene's family has been farming in Pittsford, N.Y., since 1812, but until recently the prospects that his 400-acre farm would be in business for another generation looked dim. A local ordinance requires developers to set aside 50 percent of any new project for farming or open space, but even that did not knock land prices down enough to slow the relentless sprawl of Rochester, 10 miles to the northwest.
Last year, though, Pittsford issued $10 million in bonds so it could pay Mr. Greene and six other farmers for promises not to sell their 1,200 acres -- about 60 percent of the tillable land remaining in the town -- to developers. 
 "If we didn't do this," Mr. Greene said, "it would only be a matter of time."
It has long been an iron law of the real estate market that if farmland stands in the path of urban expansion, no crop is valuable enough to keep it out of developers' hands.
As Pittsford's bond issue highlights, though, that iron law can be bent a bit. By arguing that farms provide more than food and fiber -- the list includes environmental benefits, soul-soothing scenery, diversity for the local economy and especially tax savings -- advocates of farmland preservation are forging the political ties and financial tools to steer developers' backhoes away from farmland.
"You are going to see some very interesting alliances evolve," said Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland Trust, a lobbying group based in Washington that for nearly two decades has been charting both farmland losses and the efforts to halt them. He cited a coalition formed last year to channel new growth toward already-developed areas in and around Fresno, Calif., an alliance that includes the local Chamber of Commerce and the regional building industry association in addition to farm groups.
Despite America's unparalleled agricultural abundance, concern about disappearing farmland is clearly on the rise. Numerous states and communities have in recent years experimented with tax and zoning policies to encourage farmers at the urban edge to hang on. And both private and public programs to buy development rights are spreading.
At the Federal level, the Government in 1995 finally began applying a 1981 law that required it to look for alternatives to proposed highways, airports and other public projects that consume prime farmland. And in last year's farm bill, Congress authorized spending $35 million over six years to bolster state and local programs that pay farmers not to sell to developers, the first such Federal payments ever.
Federal officials say saving prime farmland not only has local benefits but also helps the nation's balance of trade and protects against volatility in food prices. "Land is the bank supporting 15 percent to 20 percent of our economy," Dan Glickman, the Secretary of Agriculture, said. "Keeping it in agriculture is extremely important."
So far, though, such talk and the measures backing it up have been too restricted and modestly financed to have much effect. In the 20 years since Suffolk County, L.I., began the first program to buy development rights from farmers, such buyouts have preserved 450,000 acres in 18 states.
But that is a drop in the bucket. In a report to be issued today, the American Farmland Trust says that urban sprawl eats up two acres a minute -- a million acres a year, including 400,000 acres uniquely suited to certain crops.
Some of the best farmland being lost is around heartland cities like Indianapolis and Des Moines that tend to be overlooked because there is so much high-quality farmland in the Midwest.
"We lose a little bit every year," said Anthony Hession, who farms 3,000 acres just west of Indianapolis, most of it rented. Mr. Hession said he had won a statewide corn-growing contest in 1995 on a 160-acre field being torn up this month for a subdivision.
Still, Mr. Grossi said, conditions might be better than ever for slowing the loss of farmland, especially in 20 hot spots highlighted by the Farmland Trust report, like California's Central Valley, the northern Piedmont stretching from Virginia to New Jersey, the region bordering the Florida Everglades and the prairie land around the Illinois-Wisconsin border. The report focuses not just on soil quality but on areas where soil and climate together are uniquely suited for certain crops.
"We have a much better understanding of the cost of losing this land than even five years ago, a lot more examples of good local programs, and the Federal action legitimizes this effort," Mr. Grossi said.
Farmland preservation would be a much easier sell, of course, if the nation seemed in even remote danger of ever being hungry. At current development rates, the worst-case scenarios suggest that the nation's surplus food for export would not dry up until the middle of the next century, when 13 percent of the prime land being farmed would be gone. Some products now produced domestically would become imports, food prices could climb substantially, and other food-short regions of the world would be politically and economically less stable.
But blessed as it is with more than 300 million acres of prime agricultural land, the United States has paid about as much attention to such pessimistic visions as a billionaire to fliers suggesting it's time to open a savings account.
After all, decades of paving over farmland has not stopped farmers from producing such huge surpluses that Americans pay less of their income for food than anyone else in the world. And agricultural goods are the nation's largest export. The Federal Government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on price-support programs intended to prevent the farm economy from drowning in its own abundance.
"We are losing good farmland needlessly, but we don't need it to feed ourselves," said Dennis Avery, an agriculture specialist at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group. Ending excessive losses of American farmland to development might help feed other nations and slow the destruction of rain forests, Mr. Avery said, but not as much as increased spending on agricultural research or efforts to halt urban sprawl in developing countries.
Others note that each acre lost simply increases farmers' incentives to improve output on the remaining land. And biotechnology is very likely to provide previously unimagined opportunities, such as more drought-resistant strains of key crops like wheat and corn that would make marginal land far from cities more productive.
"Our concept of what is prime land has changed dramatically over time," said Philip Raup, a land economist at the University of Minnesota, who noted that pioneer farmers wanted land with exposed salt deposits for livestock nutrition. "Genetic engineering will change it again in the next 30 or 40 years."
Regardless of their long-range accuracy, such assessments encourage political leaders and voters to vastly underrate how much the nation might gain now from paying more attention to farmland, the Farmland Trust and its allies say. In the Central Valley of California alone, where the population is expected to triple by 2040 and today's sprawling development averages three homes an acre, a million acres of farmland will be lost and 2.6 million more will become harder to farm efficiently, according to a 1995 study.
Given the same population growth, the study projected, new laws forcing "compact growth" at an average of six homes an acre would save more than 500,000 acres of farmland, protect a million acres from encroachment, add nearly $70 billion to the agricultural economy and save taxpayers $29 billion that would be spent extending sewers and other services to newly developed areas.
Farmland losses are easy to dramatize. Farmers on the urban edge are often featured in news reports showing how the approach of suburbia can be more disruptive and nerve-racking than the eventual outright loss of the land, which, after all, can make millionaires of them if they are lucky enough to own it.
New homeowners often push local officials to halt normal farm practices, like noisy nighttime harvesting or planting, spreading manure to fertilize fields, importing swarms of bees to pollinate fruit trees and spraying pesticides. Subdivisions can cause crop losses by altering drainage patterns in nearby fields. Dogs chase cattle and other livestock. And vandalism of machinery and crops becomes commonplace.
"There was one kid who drove around in my alfalfa one night, got stuck in a creek and had the gall to come ask me to get my tractor to pull him out," said Jim Lehrer, a dairy farmer in Kaukauna, Wis. "He said he was just having fun."
Mr. Lehrer said he pulled the vehicle out after first demanding the teen-ager's address, then drove his tractor to the offender's home and rode around on the lawn until the teen-ager's father burst out furiously demanding to know what he was doing. Mr. Lehrer said he told him he was "just having fun like your son," and then took a spin through the backyard before going home.
Most farmers never catch the vandals, though, and in many cases, they say, there are burdens even well-intentioned suburbanites do not perceive. Sayre Miller, co-owner of 300 acres of almond groves outside Clovis, Calif., said that suburban horse riders and the cross-country team from a new school to the west had worn enough of a trail through the groves to disrupt the path of her unmanned harvesting machines.
Such problems give a human dimension to issues of urban sprawl. But cataloguing such conflicts provides no rationale for treating farms differently from any other business. That leaves it to groups like the Farmland Trust and various national agriculture and environmental groups to assemble the larger arguments for zoning and tax changes that could limit the farmland losses.
Often the actual quality of the farmland is not decisive. In Pittsford, the cost of development was what impressed voters most. Pittsford planners calculated that providing services and schools to subdivisions on the 1,200 acres would have a net cost of $200 a taxpayer indefinitely, compared with $67 a year for 20 years to pay off the bonds.

HEADLINE: Enron Wins Pact to Supply Power From Wind Turbines

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 19

 BODY:
The search for cheap, renewable sources of en ergy although slowed by the pressures of electricity generation -- advanced significantly today as the Enron Corporation announced the world's largest project to generate power from wind.
Enron's wind-power subsidiary agreed to build 150 propellered wind turbines to supply the MidAmerican Energy Company, Iowa's largest electric utility, with a peak of 112.5 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 50,000 homes. Standing on masts about 15 stories tall, the turbines' 25-ton fiberglass and epoxy rotors will have about the same wing span as a Boeing 747. 
 The Iowa project, in the northwestern part of the state, will cost about $100 million and is expected to go into operation by the end of 1998. Because the winds do not always blow strongly, MidAmerican, which serves 642,000 electric customers, anticipates receiving an average of about 45 megawatts, under a 20-year contract.
Enron, which is based in Houston and is the nation's largest independent natural gas company, said that this project and others would provide power at rates competitive with fossil fuels. "Enron believes that renewables are going to play a more significant part in the United States' and the world's energy picture," said Kenneth C. Karas, chief executive of the Zond Corporation, the wind-power subsidiary of Enron.
"The cost of some of the renewables, wind in particular but also solar, has declined and will continue to decline."
In a deregulating, cost-cutting industry, some companies have pruned their renewable energy programs. But Enron, an advocate of deregulation, says that as renewable power becomes more economical, providing it will be a competitive advantage. Some smog-bound regions want nonpolluting energy, and some customers have said that they would pay a premium for it.
"As customer choice arrives, that will be good for renewables," said Randall Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association.
MidAmerican Energy, he said, has spent 14 years fighting a 1983 state law requiring the state's utilities to generate a portion of their power from alternative sources. But having persuaded Federal regulators that the state could not mandate the purchase at relatively high costs, the company was still left with an obligation to seek new sources. Enron's bid was selected from the 18 bids MidAmerican received late last year.
The cost of generating wind power has fallen sharply from about 12 cents a kilowatt-hour a decade ago. The new project will provide power for 4 cents to 4.5 cents a kilowatt- hour, Mr. Karas said, before tax benefits worth about a penny a kilowatt-hour over the long run.
The wind turbines will therefore be more efficient than most nuclear, coal and oil-fired plants, but not as efficient as the latest, which use natural gas. The largest operating wind project currently is owned by Zond and is near Bakersfield, Calif. It was completed in 1991 and uses 342 turbines to generate 77 megawatts, Mr. Karas said. His company expects to break ground on a 107-megawatt project in Minnesota in May.
Enron is rapidly moving into the electricity business, with a $2.1 billion acquisition of the Portland General Corporation pending.
Daniel Barcelo, an analyst at Paine Webber, said that although renewables, including solar power, accounted for only a small portion of Enron's revenues, the company's investments helped secure its future in case the markets for these energy sources became larger.
"They have mastered electricity; they have mastered natural gas, and this is another arrow in their quiver," Mr. Barcelo said.
Providing alternative energy can be risky. Technology and management problems, analysts have said, have forced one of Zond's major competitors, the wind subsidiary of the Kenetech Corporation, to seek bankruptcy protection. Mr. Karas said, however, that slightly smaller versions of Zond's new wind turbines are operating in Vermont, Texas, Northern Ireland and China.

HEADLINE: Hard to Say No

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 19

 BODY:
In announcing a deal today that promises to lower Long Island's high electric rates, Gov. George E. Pataki may have found a way to cut the Gordian knot of Island politics, a problem with important political and economic implications, and one that the Governor has invested heavily in solving.
But as with so many of Mr. Pataki's initiatives, he needs the cooperation of his nemesis, Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly, and that could mean trouble for both men. 
 Mr. Pataki, whose 1998 re-election chances rest heavily on retaining the high level of support he got from Long Islanders in 1994, has staked his credibility on lowering the Island's electric rates, which are more than double the national average.
As a candidate, he criticized Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for pursuing, to no avail, a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, including its crushing debt from the never-used Shoreham nuclear plant. In the end, Mr. Pataki has resorted to much the same mechanism, a reversal that will no doubt be forgiven if the promised rate savings take effect.
Now, the Republican Governor has positioned himself as the hero of the hour, his administration having negotiated a deal with Lilco that he said would reduce rates by more than 20 percent, but Mr. Silver can take that victory away from him. The Speaker, a Democrat from Manhattan, sits on the state's Public Facilities Control Board, whose unanimous approval is required for Mr. Pataki's plan to proceed.
And Mr. Silver, whose relations with Mr. Pataki are notoriously uneasy, is not about to rubber-stamp anything the Governor wants. In addition, the Assembly will hold hearings on the plan before the control board acts.
"I don't intend to stand in the way of a deal that produces all the things this deal is supposed to produce," Mr. Silver said. "I just want to make sure it's as advertised."
But Mr. Silver can ill afford having Democrats seen as the bogeymen who robbed Long Islanders of their chance at cheaper electricity.
"It becomes very difficult for him to turn this down, and not have his Long Island members bear the brunt of that," said Martin Connor of Brooklyn, the leader of the Senate's Democratic minority. "The politics of Long Island are such that you can't afford to turn your back on this issue of electric rates."
Mr. Silver insisted that he was untroubled by such concerns. "If the deal doesn't do what it's supposed to do, the public will know it," he said. He remained cautiously neutral on the pact, turning down an invitation from the Governor's office to join Mr. Pataki in announcing it.
The administration has assembled a deal that could be hard to oppose, offering something to please all the parties directly involved. Lilco, once and for all, sheds the burden of the Shoreham debacle, making it more attractive to its merger partner, Brooklyn Union Gas.
Suffolk County and some local governments escape a billion-dollar tax rebate judgment against them in a suit brought by Lilco, which threatened them with bankruptcy. Nassau County gets greater rate reductions and rebates than Suffolk, just to even the scales between the two. And customers, of course, get lower rates.
If the agreement holds firm, it could be of great political benefit to Mr. Pataki, who could be seen as the politician who succeeded where a generation of others had failed. If, as Democrats and Republicans alike have predicted, lower rates mean more businesses and more jobs on Long Island, Mr. Pataki will be in a position to take credit.
New York's political geography magnifies the importance of the deal. With rural upstate regions solidly Republican and New York City solidly Democratic, the downstate suburbs -- particularly Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties -- are the state's true battleground. And Mr. Pataki's slim margin of victory over Mr. Cuomo came largely from a better-than-expected showing in Suffolk.
Some Democrats in the Legislature, including Mr. Connor, are already taking shots at the deal, saying that it shows the administration favoring Long Island over the rest of the state, and that it does not force Lilco to swallow a large enough share of the Shoreham debt.
Under the agreement, the utility would be responsible for about $900 million, or 20 percent of that debt. The remaining $3.6 billion would be paid off with bonds issued by the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, to be repaid by electric customers over the next 30 years.
Mr. Pataki's plans for the state's six other regional power companies also include heavy borrowing to pay off debts and reduce rates, but the savings would be far smaller than those for Lilco, for two reasons. First, the debt would be incurred by the utilities, not by a tax-exempt state agency, so the interest rates would be significantly higher. Second, no other utility has a debt load nearly as large as Lilco's.
Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat from Schenectady County, assailed the Lilco agreement today, calling Suffolk and Nassau "affluent New York City suburbs singled out to receive the benefits of lower electric rates."
Such remarks do not bode well for the accord. It is Mr. Tonko, the chairman of the Energy Committee, who will head the Assembly's hearings on the deal.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Praising the Wonders of Workfare, Giuliani Finds a Campaign Theme

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
For all of the traditionally Democratic programs Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed in this election year, there is one subject that can instantly bring out the old-fashioned Republican in him: the value of work.
Whenever his critics suggest that he is demeaning or intimidating welfare recipients by putting them to work sweeping streets or cleaning parks, the Mayor breaks into an exasperated speech about how any kind of work can restore a sense of dignity to those receiving public assistance. In what is becoming one of his signature campaign themes, repeated before a variety of audiences, he regularly invokes his father's New Deal-era advice to him: that there is no such thing as a menial job if it supports one's family. 
 But in doing so, Mr. Giuliani has stepped squarely into an intense national debate over education and work, and in a series of remarks last week, his positions on the issue seemed to go a bit beyond the national political mainstream now supporting workfare programs. In Mr. Giuliani's view, the experience gained by those in workfare is actually more valuable than education in leaving public assistance.
He has repeatedly cited the rise of Sanitation Commissioner John J. Doherty -- a former street sweeper who was never on welfare -- as proof of how far one can go from humble beginnings.
"What Martin Luther King said about sweeping streets was, if you do it better than anybody else, then you're doing God's work, which is the way I look at it," he told a group of applauding small-business owners at a meeting of the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce in Queens. "So I think buying into this philosophy that work is demeaning is very, very damaging. And it has a lot to do with what was wrong with our city."
The Mayor said that he had "turned around welfare" in New York City even more than he had reduced crime, but that he did not get credit for it because of a rigid, "politically correct" thinking in the city that prefers government programs -- including the city's community colleges, with their low graduation rates -- to hard work.
Mr. Giuliani's repeated discourses on the subject run contrary to much of the social research on welfare, which experts in the field say continues to show that a good education remains the best way out of a life of dead-end jobs and dependency. Researchers say that in a global, post-industrial economy, the advice of Mr. Giuliani's father is no longer as valid as it was in the 1940's and 50's.
"The Mayor's views are contrary to the research findings," said Dr. Mary Ann Quaranta, dean of the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University, who is now working with the Giuliani administration to develop better child welfare procedures.
"There is compelling research that welfare recipients who go to college, even if they don't finish, tend to be more likely to get a job and keep a job than their counterparts without that education," she said. "These jobs sweeping streets are dead-end jobs, not stimulating, not interesting and with no upward mobility or security. And they're certainly not good role models for kids."
Mr. Doherty's personal history shows how much the economy has changed and how different his experience was from that of the people now sweeping streets for their welfare benefits in a climate of downsizing. When Mr. Doherty joined the Sanitation Department in 1960, he said in an interview this week, he did so after taking the civil service test, having been advised by his father that civil service jobs were among the best paying and most secure.
Although he did sweep streets when asked, he said, his job duties also included hauling garbage, operating a mechanical broom and doing clerical tasks. After nine years of steady work, he said, he took the civil service test again and was promoted to assistant foreman.
By contrast, participants in the city's workfare program technically do not even have jobs, let alone the security and potential for advancement that come with a civil service position. Mr. Doherty said he had yet to hire a single workfare participant in the Sanitation Department, because the department had no openings and about 15,000 people were on the waiting list.
"I still think there's opportunity in the department," said Mr. Doherty, who never received a college education. "Back then, nobody pushed us to get an educational background, but now I tell all the guys to get some more education, some computer training, because the job is more demanding than it used to be."
Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a national nonprofit group that evaluates welfare experiments, said welfare programs that offered useful vocational training had the greatest success in moving recipients to better jobs. Programs that offer high school equivalency education have not led to substantial increases in employment, he said, and neither have pure workfare programs like New York's.
The Mayor's own workfare program, the largest in the country, has yet to show a proven record of finding permanent jobs for those who leave the rolls. According to city records, fewer than one-tenth of the 125,000 people who have passed through the program have reported finding permanent jobs; nearly two-thirds have left the program and given up their benefits without any indication of employment, and the city has made no effort to track their progress after leaving welfare.
In combination with a tough screening procedure, workfare has, however, reduced the city's welfare rolls by 240,000 people in the last 24 months; that is the figure which Mr. Giuliani cited often in his remarks last week and will be taking with him on the campaign trail later this year.
The Mayor's remarks on the subject came in response to an article in The New York Times of March 10, the first in a series about how a neighborhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has reacted to the overhaul of welfare at the national and local levels. Mr. Giuliani has cited quotations from the article that he says show how people in the neighborhood believe workfare to be beneath them. That attitude, he says, flies in the face of what made this country great.
But in the last two years, many of the criticisms of the city's workfare program have centered not on the nature of its work, but on its operation. Many of those who have participated in the program have criticized the working conditions, the quick imposition of sanctions for those who are late or absent, and the inability to get training that might lead to a more productive, fulfilling life.
The Mayor has compared the program to the Works Progress Administration jobs program of the 1930's and 40's. But the voters he must convince are entering the economy of a new century.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Sea Change in Policy by the Trustbusters

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Observers were quick to note the irony of the brouhaha over the proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot. This union, like the blocked merger of the Rite-Aid and Revco drugstore chains last year, would never have been contested by the Federal Trade Commission if the two companies did not offer rock-bottom prices and superior service.
But there is more to the tale than the clash between hard-driving superstores and Federal bureaucrats suspicious of their success. Both cases are evidence of a long-brewing sea change in antitrust, one in which the focus of merger policy has shifted to the nitty-gritty of what's in a deal for consumers. 
 Where once the antitrust watchdogs would measure market shares and -- if they were Democrats -- rumble about the rising tide of corporate power, they now measure what will happen to prices. "The economists have triumphed over the lawyers," concludes Joe Sims, a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, who was a deputy assistant attorney general in the Carter Administration.
This is not unalloyed good news, however, even to those with no patience for the Naderesque view that big is inherently bad. The abandonment of relatively simple rules for weighing the merits of mergers in favor of sophisticated economic analysis has increased the trustbusters' discretion in deciding where to intervene. That makes it harder for businesses to know what to expect from Washington when they propose a deal. And paradoxically, it invites bureaucrats to meddle in the name of maintaining free markets.
Legal theorists have been gnawing on the issue of what makes a merger good or bad since the first great wave of industrial consolidation late in the 19th century. Initially, bigness itself was presumed evil. In 1955 the Supreme Court backed the Justice Department in opposing the merger of Brown Shoe, the country's third-largest shoe maker, with Kinney, a shoe retailer with just 2 percent of the nation's sales. And in 1966, Washington shot down the merger of two Los Angeles supermarkets that shared just 8 percent of the market.
But since the mid-1970's the Supreme Court has been following the lead of the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which have been increasingly inclined to give business the benefit of the doubt. William Baxter, the Reagan Administration's free-market-minded antitrust chief, codified the idea in guidelines that transformed merger policy into a numbers game, one that green-lighted all mergers that did not concentrate the market beyond a predetermined limit. The result was a virtual free-for-all.
By the 1990's, trustbusters were busily refining the still-crude effort to link antitrust to modern economics. And now, Robert Pitofsky, the current chairman of the F.T.C. and a one-time believer in the big-is-bad doctrine, has eliminated the intellectual disconnect. For Mr. Pitofsky and his staff, the key question is identical to those that concern economists: How will a merger affect costs? And how will it affect prices?
The only practical way to answer the latter question is product by product and market by regional market. Hence the F.T.C.'s staff now estimates whether increased concentration will allow the combined companies to raise prices.
More often than not, this makes it as easy to obtain antitrust blessing in the Clinton 90's as it was in the Reagan 80's. Washington no longer blocks links where efficiency gains are likely to overwhelm anticompetitive effects -- for example, the merger of Chase Manhattan and the Chemical Bank. Indeed, the Clinton Administration is encouraging consolidation among military contractors. Nor will it block mergers between companies specializing in different segments of the same market -- for example, Dean Witter and Morgan Stanley.
But the rise of economist-think does imply more micromanagement of mergers in new industries created by technology and marketing.
Take the Staples-Office Depot deal. Together, the two chains sell only 4 percent of the $170 billion worth of office supplies in America -- less than Wal-Mart. Even in regions where they are strongest, their combined market share would hardly make a traditional trustbuster blink.
The F.T.C.'s staff argues, however, that the office superstores have created a new market, offering service and pricing previously unavailable to small-business purchasers. As a consequence, the F.T.C. estimates, most of their customers would have nowhere better to turn if the merged chains took advantage of their new position and raised prices by as much as 15 percent.
It was by the same token that the F.T.C. voted to block the merger of Rite-Aid and Revco. While that combination would not have controlled a very high proportion of the total market for prescription drugs, the commission worried that it would reduce the bargaining power of insurance plans that negotiate retail markups on behalf of millions of individuals.
So what's the problem? For one thing it leads to messy disputes over details in which dueling economists fight for the technical high ground. In the Staples-Office Depot case, Jerry Hausman, an economist at M.I.T. and a consultant to Staples, contends that the F.T.C. misread the evidence by comparing prices in markets where the chains currently compete with markets where they don't. Those with just one superstore today may well have higher prices for office supplies, he argues, but only because retailing costs are higher in those markets.
The subtler qualm here is that the new approach is transforming trustbusters from policemen to regulators -- a perverse consequence for a policy driven by the idea that markets can make decisions more efficiently than people. Rather than give a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down to proposed mergers, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. are inclined to identify the anticompetitive aspects, then negotiate spinoffs, pricing rules or reporting requirements that offset their concerns. In the Staples-Office Depot case, for example, it seems likely that the commission will settle for the sale of some choice stores to a competitor, Officemax.
Note, too, that the bargaining power of corporations is very limited. If the Government contests a merger, the resulting delay and uncertainty typically K.O. the deal. As a consequence, "we've entered the 'fix-it' era of merger policy, with lots of negotiated settlements and few court cases," says Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was a senior adviser to the Clinton Justice Department.
Is micromanagement the inevitable price of a merger policy based on sophisticated economics?
There are ways to reduce the arbitrariness of enforcement without eviscerating it. Mr. Sims would streamline review procedures to give thwarted merger partners a practical way to challenge the Government in court. Mr. Hausman would like to set formal thresholds for Government intervention: If a merger would raise prices by less, say, than 5 percent, he would substitute the presumption that the social virtue of efficiency gains outweighed the vices. But nobody sees a way to eliminate the inherent tension. "There is simply no substitute for hands-on antitrust vigilance," says Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business.

HEADLINE: Sleeker Design for Staten Island Ferry Terminal Is Unveiled

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The gigantic clock is out. The electronic message board, no more. Instead, the city's Economic Development Corporation has proposed that the new Staten Island Ferry terminal in lower Manhattan be a sleek, simple glass-walled building.
The new design calls for a 19,000-square-foot structure to replace the existing building, which in turn replaced the terminal destroyed in a 1991 fire. The waiting room would be about 50 percent larger than the current one. With a 90-foot-high entry hall, the $81 million terminal would have views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan. 
 The project is still in the preliminary stages: before the construction contract can be awarded, additional design work still needs to be done, public hearings held and approvals from various city agencies obtained. All told, the project may not be finished until 2003.
But if approved, the design will cap a project that has been plagued by years of false starts, including rejected proposals to affix a big clock and an electronic message board to the facade. The design would also be a modern touch for an old-fashioned institution: the chugging boat which, at 50 cents a round trip, means cheap commuting for 60,000 Staten Islanders, and an inexpensive nighttime cruise.
"We're very enthusiastic about the project," said Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, "and we're glad that the community seems to be, too."
The original terminal, called the Whitehall Street Ferry Terminal, was a squat, washed-out green hulk in which function vanquished form; the American Institute of Architects once called it "the world's most banal portal of joy." A fire destroyed the old terminal in 1991, forcing the construction of a temporary station.
In 1992, the Economic Development Corporation selected a design for a new terminal from a team led by the architectural firm of Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates. But that design, with its clock, and another one, with an electronic message board, were torpedoed by public criticism and budget constraints.
Last October, Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates bowed out of the project, leaving Anderson/ Schwartz Architects to work on it. Last week, Anderson Schwartz unveiled the newest design at a meeting in Staten Island Borough Hall.
Under the plans, the terminal would include 8,000 square feet of concessions, including cafes and newsstands. It would redesign the outdoor Peter Minuit Plaza, currently a group of traffic islands, to accommodate pedestrians, markets and cultural performances, as well as vehicles.
It would also offer improved mass transit links. The entry hall would include an entrance to the No. 1 and 9 subway lines at the South Ferry Station. There would also be a covered walkway to the Whitehall Street Station and the N and R lines.
The city has already earmarked $31 million and the Federal Government $12.35 million to the project, according to the Economic Development Corporation. And the city and Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island are lobbying the Federal Government to dedicate an additional $37.65 million in Federal transportation funds.
The new design follows last month's announcement of a plan by Staten Island officials to replace the aging St. George Ferry Terminal with a $100 million building.
"Clearly, we need a new terminal badly, and I think the net impact of what will happen is that you'll have more people using the ferries," said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President. "But frankly, almost anything would be an improvement over what was there before the fire."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Unlike previous, rejected designs, the new plan for the facade of the $81 million Staten Island Ferry terminal, left, has no giant clock and no electronic message board. But the 19,000-square-foot waiting room, above, on the site of the temporary station, would be 6,500 square feet larger than the current one.

Tentative Deal Reached In American Airlines Talks
American Airlines and negotiators from its pilots' union reached an agreement in principle on terms of a new contract, making another strike by the pilots somewhat less likely.
But two significant hurdles remain to reaching a final agreement, and those uncertainties may give pause to travelers making plans to fly on American in late April, when a strike can still occur. The agreement remains subject to votes by the board of the union and then by its members. [Page A1.]
 
Plan for Cut in Power Rates
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York announced details of a plan to cut Long Island's high electric rates by as much as 23 percent through a partial state takeover of Long Island Lighting. Wall Street applauded the deal, which would entail the largest municipal bond issue in history. [A1.] 

Price Index Rises 0.3%
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent last month, led by higher costs for fresh vegetables and natural gas. [D4.]
 
Treasury prices fell because of concern about inflation, with the yield on the 30-year bond climbing to 6.98 percent from 6.96. [D18.]
 
With Technology Weak, Stocks Fall
The Nasdaq index fell 20.05 points, closing at 1,249.29, hurt by a sharp selloff in computer stocks. The Dow industrials fell less, slipping 18.88 points, to 6,877.68. [D8.]

HEADLINE: Pataki Outlines Accord to Cut Electric Rates for Long Island

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., March 19

 BODY:
A jubilant Gov. George E. Pataki flew to Long Island today and announced details of an agreement to cut the Island's electric rates up to 23 percent through a partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company.
Flanked by enthusiastic politicians of both major parties, the Republican Governor said the plan would bring a new era of prosperity to an area that now pays the highest electric rates in North America. As part of the deal, homeowners, who for more than a decade have had their rates inflated by the cost of building and abandoning the $6.5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant, would receive rebate checks averaging $100 to $232. 
 If the deal is completed on the current schedule, those checks will be mailed out in the fall of 1998 while Mr. Pataki is campaigning for a second term.
"By dramatically cutting electric rates," Mr. Pataki said, "we will allow the economy to grow and create new jobs for years to come."
The deal would entail the largest municipal bond issue in history -- $7 billion -- to be sold by the state's Long Island Power Authority. In the stock market, investors pushed up the closing price of stock today in both Lilco, which climbed to 24 1/2, up 1 1/8, and its merger partner, Brooklyn Union Gas, whose shares rose to 29 3/4, up 5/8.
The deal still faces several regulatory and political hurdles, and final approval is expected to take 18 months.
Still, the plan is a major political achievement for Governor Pataki, fulfilling a promise that he made more than a year ago to reduce Long Island's electric rates by at least 10 percent.
In his 1994 election campaign, Mr. Pataki attacked a state takeover plan proposed by his Democratic opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. But he soon learned that few issues are more important to Long Island's residents -- and its Republican politicians -- than Lilco's burdensome rates. Many of the Governor's strongest allies, including United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, are Long Islanders and pushed for the deal to cut rates.
After last week's announcement of a state plan to overhaul utility service in Consolidated Edison's territory, the Lilco plan would further revamp the New York region's electric service in an era of energy deregulation and increased competition.
The state's agreement with Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas would create a potentially powerful new entity. The new company would continue to run Long Island's electric system under a contract with the Long Island Power Authority, which would own Lilco's former transmission and distribution lines and customer service. Company executives also have their eyes on expansion to other parts of the state.
But the deal faces at least two potential pitfalls.
First, it needs the approval of the Democratic Speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, who has veto power with one of the three votes on the state's Public Authorities Control Board. While Mr. Pataki said the Speaker's initial reactions were positive, Mr. Silver said he had not made up his mind.
"I don't intend to stand in the way of a deal that produces all the things this deal is supposed to produce," he said. "I just want to make sure it's as advertised."
Second, the plan needs a waiver from the Internal Revenue Service to avoid about $2 billion in capital-gains taxes on the state's payments to Lilco. The Long Island Power Authority's chairman, Frank G. Zarb, said that "an adverse ruling from the I.R.S. would cripple this solution" and force officials to try other strategies. But he said he felt strongly that the proposal would meet I.R.S. standards.
The plan is also subject to review by the State Public Service Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Lilco-Brooklyn Union Gas merger is subject to approval by the companies' stockholders.
Longtime critics of Lilco expressed skepticism about the plan.
Larry Shapiro, a senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group said, "It looks like a bailout of Lilco and a deal to send a check to every ratepayer in an election year, then worry about it the next 29 years."
But the plan's political appeal was evident as local officials jockeyed for position today next to the Governor and competed to outdo each other in praise for one another and the agreement.
"Governor, today, you have lit up the lives of Long Islanders -- and at less cost," said Bruce Blakeman, presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature. His Democratic counterpart, Bruce Nyman, the minority leader, said: "When Democrats thank a Republican governor, you know there's a story here. It's the greatest day for Long Island I can remember."
Mr. Pataki lauded Richard M. Kessel, a Democrat and minority member of the Long Island Power Authority, who worked closely with the authority's chairman, Mr. Zarb. For his part, Mr. Kessel praised Mr. Pataki and another Republican adversary, Senator D'Amato. "Behind the scenes, Al D'Amato brought this together," Mr. Kessel said.
Under the agreement, the power authority would buy Lilco's transmission and distribution lines and customer services like billing, installation and repairs, and would reserve the right to buy Lilco's power generating plants after three years. The authority would also assume $3.6 billion of the remaining $4.5 billion Shoreham debt and Lilco's share in the troubled Nine Mile Point 2 Plant.
The holding company for the merged Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas would absorb the remaining $900 million in Shoreham debt.
The Long Island Power Authority bond issue would pay for the purchase, and the authority's tax-exempt status would allow for lower interest rates. The authority would also save money because it would not pay Federal corporate income taxes or stock dividends.
The merged Lilco-Brooklyn Union company would run the operation, under a contract with incentives and penalties based on performance. After the fifth year, the authority would require competitive bidding for the contract to run the electricity operation.
Although the authority would buy power from Lilco's generating plants, it would be free to buy cheaper power elsewhere as demand grows, and would gradually be allowed to switch to other suppliers for all the electrical power.
Because of the high cost of power produced on the Island, the authority would work with Suffolk County on a project to install a new transmission line under Long Island Sound to enable the importing of cheaper power. It would also work with Nassau and Suffolk Counties to distribute cheaper power.
The authority would gradually give customers the right to choose their source of power as the industry becomes deregulated.
Another key issue in the agreement was the potentially devastating $1.1 billion refund owed to Lilco by Suffolk County, Brookhaven Town and the Shoreham-Wading River School District for excessive property taxes. In the negotiations, that amount was reduced to $625 million. The payment will be financed by the bond issue, and repaid by a surcharge to Suffolk electric customers. As a result, they would receive less of a rate reduction than Nassau customers.
The initial rate reductions under the plan would be 18.2 percent in Nassau and 16.4 percent in Suffolk. After five years, the reduction would reach 23.2 percent in Nassau and 20.5 percent in Suffolk.
Critics accused Mr. Pataki of failing to provide in the plan as much competition as he originally promised, but he said the agreement represented a practical compromise.
Much stronger praise came from the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, who was delighted to have the property tax refund resolved.
"This is as close to a perfect solution as I have seen in my years of government," he said.

HEADLINE: Trade Group Backs Effort To Ship Bananas to Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
After spending years trying to get leaders of both political parties to pay attention to his trade problems around the world, Carl H. Lindner, who controls Chiquita Brands International, has finally won a victory: The World Trade Organization has backed his right to ship bananas to Europe.
Mr. Lindner, a Cincinnati businessman, is well-known in Washington. Since 1993, he and his American Financial Corporation have contributed more than $1 million to the two major political parties. Bob Dole, the former Republican Presidential candidate, used a jet belonging to the Lindner family empire during the 1996 campaign, and Mr. Lindner, sharing in what has become a perquisite for Democratic donors during the Clinton Administration, spent a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Bananas became one of Mr. Dole's most intense trade interests, and the Administration, while declining to impose unilateral sanctions against Europe, pressed his case with the World Trade Organization in Geneva. 
 But until Tuesday, when a preliminary decision was handed down in that case, he had yet to win a single round of his banana battles with Europe. Now, said diplomats familiar with a still-confidential opinion written by a three-judge panel of the trade organization, Europe's regulations have been found to unfairly favor fruit from African, Caribbean and Pacific states, chiefly former European colonies.
The European Union said that those rules were designed to support the Caribbean economies that depend heavily on their banana crops, and that those economies would be destroyed if they had to compete with lower-cost producers in Latin America who sell huge volumes of bananas through Chiquita and other brands. Chiquita contends that the European policy has cost the company more than $400 million over the last five years.
European officials said yesterday that they intended to appeal.
"Many of the conclusions of the report appear to be unfavorable but we need to analyze this further," said Peter Guilford, spokesman for the European Union's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan. Appeals are common in World Trade Organization rulings, but rarely successful.
It is unclear, however, whether Mr. Lindner will be entirely satisfied with his victory. When the ruling is completed, the European Union will have the chance to rewrite its rules, or to pay compensation to the United States, Mexico and the other countries that challenged the banana import restrictions.
"There are ways for the Europeans to blunt the effect of this," one American official said today.
For that reason, Mr. Lindner had sought stronger action from Washington. On his behalf, then-Senator Dole introduced amendments to budget bills in Congress that would have imposed sharp sanctions on Costa Rica and Colombia for going along with the European banana-trade system. Those amendments failed.
Mr. Lindner also pressed the White House, seeking unilateral sanctions against Europe. The Administration balked at that request, but agreed to take his case to what Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative, called an "impartial review" by the trade organization.

HEADLINE: In Helsinki, U.S. Wants Yeltsin Nod On NATO

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 19

 BODY:
The summit meeting that begins here on Thursday caps a month of intensive bargaining and diplomatic courtship that American officials hope will lead to grudging Russian tolerance of a plan to expand the NATO alliance eastward.
As advance parties awaited the arrival on Thursday of Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin for two days of talks, Americans today described a campaign of military reassurances and economic inducements that they predict will allow Mr. Yeltsin to leave Helsinki declaring that he has fully defended Russian honor. [President Clinton left Washington shortly after 9 P.M. Wednesday.] 
 Most of the Western sweeteners have been presented to the Russians over the last month. They include promises not to station nuclear weapons or foreign troops in new members at Russia's edge as long as there is no clear threat.
The Americans do not expect Mr. Yeltsin to make any final decisions on NATO when he meets Mr. Clinton for the first time in 11 months. But they hope for signals that the Russian leader is prepared to live with the new military arrangement in exchange for a closer political and economic integration with the West.
The Americans hope Mr. Yeltsin is setting up Helsinki as a great battle from which he will emerge declaring ultimately that he had protected Russian security, drawn the sting from NATO expansion and made the new Europe safe for a Russia that will take its place once again as a great nation.
American officials said that Mr. Yeltsin would be able to highlight NATO's pledge, "in the current or foreseeable security environment," not to station nuclear weapons or alliance troops on the soil of new members, which are expected to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and possibly Slovenia.
He could also point to NATO's offer to slash the limits on the size of conventional forces in Western Europe and to freeze them in Central Europe.
And he could cite NATO's offer of a permanent council for consultation with Russia, providing it special status, as well as special access to military planning and exercises.
As a measure of American good will, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Secretary William Cohen gave Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov a two-and-a-half-hour briefing last Sunday at the Pentagon.
In Helsinki, Mr. Clinton will also offer Mr. Yeltsin guidelines for a new strategic arms reduction treaty, Start 3, which would save Moscow the expense of building up to Start 2 limits and still preserve its cherished "nuclear parity" with Washington.
American officials are also hoping that increased economic aid will appeal to Mr. Yeltsin, particularly now that he has placed young market reformers like Anatoly B. Chubais and Boris Y. Nemtsov in charge of the economy. Mr. Clinton will ask Congress for increased economic aid of $242 million, up from $95 million last year. While relatively small -- and Congress could cut the amount -- the aid will promote Russian goals of economic growth, improved taxation and more foreign investment.
To meet Russia's desire to be welcomed into the larger club of important countries, Mr. Clinton will also promise Washington's support for Russian membership in several major organizations. These include permanent membership in the political sessions of the Group of seven major industrial countries; in the World Trade Organization, and in the Paris Club, which renegotiates the terms of government-to-government debt.
Russia does not now qualify for full membership in the G-7, but Mr. Clinton will pledge to support its membership once its economy and legal systems improve.
While hoping that Mr. Yeltsin will "take yes for an answer," the Americans acknowledge that Russia may be trying to make the process so painful that the West will not try to expand NATO further after the first round.
The Russians are working to limit NATO's expansion and insure that former Soviet republics like Ukraine, Belarus and especially the Baltic nations never join. April 2 is the anniversary of Russia's agreement with Belarus to create some form of union, and some Americans think those talks may accelerate, putting more pressure on Ukraine and the Baltic nations not to join NATO.
Mr. Primakov did manage last weekend to irk some American officials, part of a time-tested Moscow strategy when playing a weak hand. But today's Russia is not the mighty Soviet Union.
As Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright insists, Russia's consent to NATO expansion is unnecessary. But she says Russia should understand its own interest in cooperation and stability.
"We know it will take time," she said, "for the progress of trust to catch up with the process of change."

HEADLINE: Mexican Drugs: A Semi-Censure Reported Near

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and Senate negotiators agreed tonight to a resolution that criticizes Mexican anti-drug efforts but does not bar the President from certifying Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs.
Administration and Senate aides said they had found a way to defuse a confrontation that has been building all month over how to chastise Mexico but avoid the embarrassment of declaring a close trading partner to be delinquent in fighting drugs. 
 The resolution gives President Clinton until Sept. 1 to report to Congress on what progress has been made in a number of specific areas, including extradition of drug merchants, efforts to curb money laundering and measures to protect United States drug agents in Mexico.
Complicating the prospects for such a report are persistent assertions that Mexico is allowing drug traffickers to accumulate millions in local accounts. [Page A10.]
Even some senior Administration officials agree that drug corruption is so endemic throughout Mexican law enforcement that cooperation is difficult if not impossible. The President must notify Congress every year which countries are cooperating in fighting drugs. Those that are not face economic sanctions.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who has led the effort to overturn President Clinton's declaration on Feb. 28 that Mexico had "cooperated fully" in efforts to halt the drug trade, said she was satisfied with the language. "This is a definitive statement by the Senate that the status quo is not acceptable and that both countries need to redouble our efforts," she said.
An Administration official agreed, saying, "Rather than a confrontational approach, this amplifies our ongoing joint efforts and holds the promise of even greater results on the war on drugs."
The resolution, which is likely to come to a Senate vote on Thursday, does not provide for any further automatic action. If Congress is dissatisfied with Mr. Clinton's report and wants to take action against Mexico, it would have to start from scratch legislatively.
Mr. Clinton's declaration that Mexico had cooperated fully was necessary to avert formal "decertification," a step that would have required reductions in aid to Mexico.
Mrs. Feinstein and other legislators had attacked that declaration, but Administration officials warned that decertification could erode confidence in the Mexican economy and would almost surely reduce -- not increase -- Mexican efforts to combat the drug trade.
Then last week the House approved a resolution that would extend certfication for only 90 days unless the President reported specific progress by Mexico.
The Administration official said the new resolution, unlike previous versions in both the House and Senate, was less focused on blame and more on what needed to be done.
The language is indeed gentler toward Mexico. For example, its references to safeguarding United States agents are less speciifc than the earlier demand that they be allowed to carry firearms in Mexico, a demand Mexican officials publicly rejected last week. It also acknowledges, at least in passing, Mexican anti-corruption efforts.

The Betrayed Maori Are Calling for a Reckoning

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, March 19

 BODY:
Solid as an anvil in a well-worn buff jacket, granite-eyed behind bristles of beard, Mike Smith is one of the urban Maori called "nga tamatoa," or "young warriors."
A high-school dropout, he is at home in the city's jails, quotes Noam Chomsky and the American Indian advocate Russell Means, rails against privatization, economic cutbacks and foreign investors and for 16 years has been at the sharp edge of the movement to redress the wrongs of the British colonizers of New Zealand. 
 Although the Government is now trying to address claims by the Maoris, who were cast into second-class status after confiscation of their lands in the last century, he warns that too little is coming too late.
Asserting that "younger people really feel betrayed," he said: "The mood is no longer to tug at the forelock and say, 'I'll be a good nigger, master,' which was very much the attitude of our parents and grandparents. They had the boot physically on their necks. It's now ratcheting up. Expect more and more acts of destruction."
Not all Maori share the radicalism of Mr. Smith, 38, who last tangled with the authorities 17 months ago when he hacked at a symbolic ponderosa pine planted by white colonizers in a place known as One Tree Hill and was jailed overnight.
The sledgehammer attack that badly damaged the America's Cup last week, carried out by a 27-year-old Maori protester whose name has not been disclosed, horrified not only the yachting world but also many other Maori, some of whom apologized to an American visitor.
"Smashing things is not the answer," said Keri Neilson, 23, a teacher and member of the Nga Puhi tribe north of here. "We need more educated Maori people and a wide range of jobs."
"I don't know whether we're ever going to find an equitable balance with the Pakeha," she said, using the Maori term for whites.
Tuariki John Delamere, 45, one of 15 Maori in the 120-seat Parliament in Wellington and one of three Maori ministers in the Government, said, "All the educational attainment in the world will not change the fact that when a Maori attends a job interview, as things now stand, he or she will most likely be judged by a person from the majority culture who will see them first as a Maori -- with all the negative connotations that may include."
Archeological remains suggest that Maori ancestors emigrated here by canoe from Eastern Polynesia more than 1,000 years ago. Today the Maori represent 15 percent of the 3.5 million New Zealanders.
Until the first quarter of this century they lived almost exclusively in rural areas. Four out of five Maori today are in the bigger cities and towns.
Poverty, worsened by severe cutbacks in Government services after years of fiscal retrenchment, has generated what scholars here call a rootless and alienated Maori underclass subject to unemployment at rates above 50 percent in some urban pockets and high consumption of alcohol and drugs.
But with so much intermarriage between the Maori and whites, few here fear racial clashes. "I don't know a single Maori who doesn't have Pakeha cousins," Mr. Delamere said.
While denouncing acts of violence, even the more conservative and better-off Maori share with the radicals a deep sense of grievance over what the New Zealand Government has finally recognized are a series of broken promises by whites.
Ranginui Walker, 65, is the head of the Maori Studies Department at Auckland University and the author of books including "Years of Anger" and "Struggle Without End." A member of the Whakatohea tribe, he sees the history of the last 150 years "in an extremely personal way."
"Our tribe had all its land confiscated in 1864-65, 35,000 acres of prime farming land, and our people were pushed up into a reservation, up against the hills.
"So that's got to be a pretty definitive experience when you're living in poverty, no employment, and when you go into town you see white people, descendants of military settlers, control all the businesses and you see a beautiful golf course and you know that is confiscated land, and so the insult is there for your whole lifetime."
Mr. Walker succeeded academically, became upwardly mobile, then jumped into the cauldron of cultural politics and was considered extremist back in the 1970's as he railed "openly and vehemently," as he put it, "against monocultural Pakeha dominance and Maori subjection."
He calls the chopping down of trees, earlier defacement of British statues and now the battering of the America's Cup "quixotic acts" of a new generation of radicals, expressing "an anger and frustration that has to be taken into account -- rather than eliciting a knee-jerk reaction to them."
He adjusts thick glasses as he sits at a cluttered desk in his book-stuffed office. Towering Maori totem poles dominate spaces of the atrium outside.
"White people regard me as an elder statesman," he said. "They come up to me and say, 'You've mellowed in your old age.' 'Oh, is that right?' I say. 'I'm still the same old person. Perhaps it's your perceptions that have changed.' "
While the Maori always insisted that the Government had in effect stolen their land, the Government's acknowledgment of responsibility has come about in recent years after a series of protests and court rulings. Negotiations have been under way since 1991 over specific claims.
The story of Maori disaffection goes back to a charter signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and 500 Maori chiefs, the so-called Treaty of Waitangi. It guaranteed that the Maori would retain their lands and other material and cultural treasures and enjoy equal rights of citizenship.
"A big rip-off occurred," Justice Minister Douglas Graham conceded in an interview. Mr. Graham, who is also Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, forecast that at least the major Maori claims would be settled by the year 2000. More than 400 claims have come from 37 tribes and hundreds of subtribes and even individual families. Not everyone wants money. Some families simply want burial grounds protected.
But for most it is a question of getting assets back. So far the Government has agreed to return the equivalent of $450 million, and is hoping to cap total outlays at $750 million.
"We have to be realistic," Mr. Graham said. "The rest of the country and the tax base won't allow us to do more." But he emphasized, "We are committed to working with the Maori to achieve their full and active participation in New Zealand society."

Senate and White House Agree on Faulting Mexico
The Senate and the White House reached agreement on language to criticize Mexico for what legislators see as its failure to fight drug trafficking diligently, without taking any steps that might undermine the Mexican economy. A1
 
A new dispute between Washington and Mexico erupted over Mexico's failure to seize $160 million the United States asserts was deposited in Mexican banks by a drug suspect. Mexican officials contended that the amount was misunderstood. A10
 
Clinton Heads to Helsinki
President Clinton departed for Helsinki, Finland, and a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. United States officials hope Mr. Yeltsin will find the political cover he needs to accept a plan to expand the NATO alliance eastward. A6
 
Egypt Warns Against Har Homa
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt warned that Israel's decision to build Har Homa, a Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, could set off a new cycle of violence in the Middle East.

Israeli Proposal Elicits No Trust
Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had revived a proposal to bypass interim steps of the Mideast peace accords and go straight to talks on a final settlement. They said that since Mr. Netanyahu had to extend so much political capital to get his right-wing supporters to accept each step, he might as well go all the way at once. The Palestinians rejected the notion as a "media trick." A12
 
New Tuberculosis Treatment
Millions of lives could be saved through a tuberculosis treatment that has been used successfully from New York City to Tanzania, the World Health Organization said. The treatment hinges on insuring that patients continue to take four inexpensive drugs for a full course lasting six to eight months. A5
 
Protests Over Polish Shipyard
Hundreds of laid-off workers in Poland chanted anti-Communist slogans in protesting the closure of the bankrupt shipyard in Gdansk where the Solidarity movement was born. The Government, whose refusal to guarantee loans to keep the shipyard afloat was seen by workers as politically motivated, blamed the Solidarity-led management for overemployment and excessive benefits. A7
Italy Calls Refugee Emergency
Italy declared a national state of emergency that allows the immediate expulsion of Albanian refugees whom the Government deems undesirable. The decree was Italy's first comprehensive response to a crisis that has brought more than 10,600 Albanian refugees to its shores in the past week. The decree also called for at-sea inspections of boats carrying refugees and the seizure of any vessels that arrive in Italy. (AP)

New Facts on Hubbell Deal
Less than a week after the Indonesian businessman James T. Riady saw President Clinton at the White House in 1994, one of his companies paid $100,000 to Webster L. Hubbell, people familiar with the arrangement said. Mr. Hubbell, a friend of Mr. Clinton, was facing a criminal investigation, and investigators are trying to learn whether Mr. Clinton or other officials helped line up financial assistance for him. Mr. Clinton's lawyer said that neither the President nor his wife had asked anyone to hire Mr. Hubbell. A1
 
Suits on Species Law Allowed
People can sue the Federal Government for doing too much, as well as too little, to protect endangered species, the Supreme Court ruled. The decision will allow developers to challenge Endangered Species Act restrictions. B10
 
The Court heard arguments on whether the Government can regulate indecency on the Internet. B10
 
Compensatory Time Wins Vote
The House voted to let employers give workers compensatory time off instead of paying them overtime. President Clinton has said he will veto the measure, and Democrats in the Senate may prevent a vote in that body. B11

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A Fair That Travels Through Centuries Of Asian Creativity

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
THE debut of the International Asian Art Fair in Manhattan last spring was an undisputed hit. Top-flight dealers were on board; the art was spectacular. The swell of foot traffic from Park Avenue surpassed even the most optimistic expectations: New York had clearly discovered Asian art in a major way.
This year's fair gives every indication of repeating that success, even without an extravaganza like the Met's 1996 "Splendors of Imperial China" fanning the flames. Many of the dealers are back; a few new ones have been added. (Europeans outnumber Americans this time around.) And one would have to travel far indeed to encompass the sheer range of material -- Indian bronzes, Chinese funerary figures, Japanese screens, Persian carpets -- filling the Seventh Regiment Armory from tonight through Wednesday. 
 Why the interest in Asian art now? Politics and economics play their part. The uncertain future of Hong Kong with its crucial art market and the increased attention to art poaching internationally seem to have inspired a buy-while-you-can urgency. And in the West, where a nothing Picasso can fetch millions, great Asian objects are a comparative steal.
But does the interest go beyond the practical? One can only speculate, of course. But maybe an art with a reputation for being infused with spiritual traditions sustained over centuries has come to have a talismanic presence at this jittery, fragmented, millennial moment.
All these factors -- commerce and connoisseurship, scholarship and poetry -- are in the air at the Asian Art Fair, and their undisguised, often unholy alliance helps explain the show's magnetism.
As was the case last year, Chinese art is predominant. In fact, it is so plentiful and varied that, with a little legwork, a rough chronological survey of the field can be worked out. The Gisele Croes Gallery is a place to start, with its great bronze vessels from the Shang period (circa 1600-1027 B.C.) and a svelte female dancer, meant to enliven a tomb of the Han dynasty (202 B.C-A.D. 220).
A leap to an exquisite swatch of floral patterned silk from the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907) at Francesca Galloway could be next. (The same design in hushed blues and beiges ornaments the Buddhist caves of Dunhuang.) And this can be followed by a visit to the imposing set of 13th-to-14th- century polychromed stucco temple sculptures, near life-size, at A. & J. Speelman.
From here one might make a nod to the recent craze for Ming furniture (M. D. Flacks shows almost nothing else) and take a quick but bracing dip into ceramics (Spink & Son has a pair of jars from the late 17th century, in Dufy yellows and reds).
Finally, the booths of L. J. Wender and Michael Goedhuis make logical end points, the one with a painting by a Buddhist-pacifist artist, Feng Ze Kai (1898-1975), which includes a cartoonlike image of Mao Zedong as a child's doll; the other with stainlike ink and pigment paintings of flowers by Yang Yanping, a Chinese-trained artist who lives on Long Island.
Devotees of Korean art will want to sample the wares at Kang Collection and Lea Sneider. Ariane Dandois again offers an entrancing display of Japanese screens: in one, deer gambol through a landscape composed of dusted gold. Islamic art shines at Oliver Hoare's booth, with a pocket-size 14th-century Moroccan astrolabe and a piece of 16th-century Ottoman silk whose rippling, surreal-looking organic forms are woven in metal thread.
In terms of both quality and rarity, however, the art of India is the star attraction this year, and it finds a stunning showcase at John Eskenazi. The lineup here includes the streamlined figure of a nude Jain saint and the gorgeous head of a bodhisattva, his eyes half closed, his flowing hair caught up into an elegant chignon.
But the centerpiece is a relief panel, carved around the second century A.D., from the fabled Buddhist stupa at Amaravati. The stupa itself -- an immense, solid reliquary mound covered with carvings -- was destroyed long ago, but this sculpture, worn smooth with time, touch and weather, pulses with peculiar devotional energy that distinguishes the Amaravati style.
Such dynamism is the hallmark of Indian art throughout its history. It is there in two stone female figures, as grave as Roman matrons, at Rossi & Rossi; in the gorgeous sixth-century stone figure of Sarasvati, goddess of music, surrounded by her celestial court at R. H. Ellsworth; and in the ravishing South Indian bronze dream team of Krishna and his consorts at the Chinese Porcelain Company, with their rapt, confident faces and hands like flowers.
There is no greater art than the art of India, though it has never found a wide audience in the West, and perhaps never will. Its apparently contradictory blend of spiritual enthusiasm and repose, its reluctance to draw firm lines between the natural and the supernatural, its preference for gods who dance, for joy over tragedy, may always stand as a distant challenge to Western taste.
But it is a challenge well worth considering. And the Asian Art Fair, with its exotic versions of the familiar (ceramic pillows, a chic little tunic painted with gold) and its eye-opening embodiments of the transcendent, is, this year again, an ideal place to do so.
The International Asian Art Fair is at the Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street, through Wednesday. There is a benefit preview tonight at 6 for the Asia Society; tickets: (212) 288-6400, extension 235 or 360. Fair hours: 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday; 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Sunday and Wednesday. Admission: $15. Information: (212) 642-8572.

How to Go to Extremes To Tart Up 'Rigoletto'

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
Tito Capobianco's 1988 staging of Verdi's "Rigoletto" returned to the New York City Opera for the first time this season on Wednesday evening with its broad, magnifying strokes intact. For Mr. Capobianco, the Duke was not merely decadent; he and his courtiers, dressed in gold, red and black, cavort in a chamber that looks more like a brothel than a ducal court. Cushions are conveniently strewn in every corner, even though the bedroom is just through the double doors, and half-naked dancers weave among the revelers.
Nothing is left to suggestion in this production, which is now directed by Cynthia Edwards. The Duke sings "Questa o quella" with women draped around him, and he rolls on the cushions with several women while Monterone delivers his stinging lament. Esperanza Galan was clearly given a free hand to choreograph: nothing occurs without elaborate movement. And Carl Toms, the stage and costume designer, seemed intent on showing the economic hierarchy. The wasteful opulence of the court gives way to Sparafucile's lair, a lattice of rotted timber that looks as if it might crumble at any moment. Between those extremes, Rigoletto's home seems comfortably bourgeois. 
 Of the singers who inhabited this world, only Mark Delavan, in the title role, successfully climbed into his character's skin. He was consistently commanding, not a quality normally associated with the hunchbacked jester but one that worked in Mr. Delavan's portrayal. And if his timbre was slightly boxy at times, he sang with power and clarity. He also proved a fine actor who captured the full range of Rigoletto's complex, twisted emotional world.
Good acting was at a premium on Wednesday. After Mr. Delavan, one had to move well down the cast list -- to Brian Matthews's finely etched Sparafucile, Angela Horn's energetic Maddalena and George Cordes's dignified Monterone -- to find singers whose vocal and dramatic abilities were fully in sync.
Vocally, Vladimir Grishko was a better than passable Duke. His light tenor was uneven at first but grew in power and warmth though not in subtlety as the evening progressed. Yet his quintessentially Russian body language, including grand hand and arm gestures, were not for the world of "Rigoletto."
Olga Makarina has the timbre and range for Gilda, and she produced lovely sounds throughout the evening. But her "Caro nome" was unduly cautious, and even by operatic standards, her acting was awkward and stiff. At key moments -- when Rigoletto leads her away at the end of the second act and when she walks into Sparafucile's dagger in the finale -- Ms. Makarina seemed not to have a clue what to do with herself.
Joseph Colaneri led a brisk but by no means rushed performance. He made the most of key moments, like the sudden change of mood when Monterone pronounces his fateful curse, and drew a rich, nicely balanced sound from the orchestra.

Dollar Finishes With Surge After an Up-and-Down Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, strongly hinted that the central bank would raise interest rates next week.
The dollar overcame early weakness caused by the release of data showing that the United States trade deficit rose to a record in January. 
 In an appearance on Capitol Hill, Mr. Greenspan's repeated references to the need for preventive efforts to thwart inflationary pressure in the economy were interpreted by currency traders as the most persuasive evidence yet that the Fed's policy-making committee would increase rates at its meeting on Tuesday.
Rising rates tend to bolster the value of a currency because they increase the returns of securities denominated in that currency.
The dollar settled at its high point of the day in New York at 1.6935 German marks and 123.75 Japanese yen, up from 1.6816 marks and 122.82 yen on Wednesday. The British pound weakened to $1.5881 from $1.5982.
Many traders said they expected the Fed to raise the Federal funds short-term lending rate next week by at least a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent.
Even before Mr. Greenspan spoke, the dollar was beginning to rebound as traders reassessed the selloff caused by the Commerce Department report in the morning that showed the United States trade deficit rising 21.1 percent in January, to a record $12.7 billion.
The report suggested that the dollar's recovery from postwar lows against the yen and mark two years ago was hurting United States exporters by making their goods more expensive overseas.
But a closer look at the trade report showed that the dollar's strength against the yen and the mark played only a minor role in the increased deficit. Most of the shortfall came from a surge of imports from China.
"People sold the headline and then looked at the details, and everyone started scrambling to buy the dollar back," Ben Strauss, a senior currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York, said.
"Then," he added, "Greenspan added fuel to the fire."

HEADLINE: A.C.L.U. Is on Wrong Side of Campaign Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having enthusiastically paid dues to the American Civil Liberties Union since the age of 17, 50 years ago, I never expected to resign from the organization in disgust. But the A.C.L.U.'s opposition to limits on huge campaign contributions did it (news article, March 15).
To continue to support an organization that is on the wrong side of the most fundamental issue facing our country -- the swamping of American political life by increasing, highly motivated millions of dollars -- should be abhorrent to any "small-d" democrat. 
 The Jeffersonian principle of decentralization of economic and political power is as vital to the future of democracy as the First Amendment principle of free speech. To claim that the right of a few to throw millions of dollars onto the scales of political decision-making should take precedence over the rights of all to an equal voice in those decisions is a tragic error.
Thousands of members of the A.C.L.U. know better, even if its paid lobbyists in their myopia do not.

HEADLINE: Bond Act Spending Is Legislature's Purview

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A March 16 editorial argues correctly that the proceeds of New York's Clean Air-Clean Water Bond Act must be spent fairly and wisely. But your conclusion that Gov. George E. Pataki should have final authority over the spending is inconsistent with this objective and with the essence of representative democracy.
Virtually every state constitution, including New York's, has language that closely resembles the power-of-the-purse provision the Founders included in the Federal Constitution: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." 
 A 1927 amendment to the State Constitution gives a governor the power to propose appropriations bills, but the power to adopt them still rests with the Legislature. This was made clear by the state's highest court in 1981 when it ruled that the governor could not avoid this requirement by claiming that certain funds (in that case, Federal grants) were not part of the state treasury.
If the Legislature isn't working as well as it should, the solution is to make it work better, not to abrogate the concept of majority rule by ceding essential legislative powers to the executive.

Condominium Offering Plan on Upper West Side

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
One of the West Side's largest landlords has begun the process, rare in recent years, of converting a 48-unit prewar rental apartment building on the Upper West Side into condominium apartments.
The sponsor of the 12-story, rent-regulated building at 650 West End Avenue, at 92d Street, filed a condominium offering plan with the State Attorney General's office in January. The proposal's sponsor is a partnership in which the general managing partner is Henry Moskowitz, the chairman of the family-owned Argo Corporation, which manages 6,300 apartments in the city, including rentals, co-ops and condominiums. 
 This company's inventory includes 2,300 apartments in rental buildings owned as well as managed by Argo. Almost half of these rentals, 1,020 apartments, are in 14 Manhattan buildings, 10 on the Upper West Side.
Under the conversion plan, the per-square-foot asking price for tenants to buy their units, as is, will be $170, but the bargaining that typically goes on between renters and sponsors has not yet started. For outsiders, the asking price will be $360.
At those prices, a 1,576-square-foot two-bedroom would cost current residents $259,000; those living elsewhere would pay $575,500. The projected monthly charges, including real estate taxes, range from $308 to $1,730.
Mark Fessel and his wife, Sherry, seven-year tenants of the building, are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
"If the price is right for us and our neighbors, and the matters relating to the building are addressed, we would consider purchasing our apartment," Mr. Fessel said.
If the Attorney General's office decides the conversion plan complies with all applicable laws and regulations, sales of the units could begin by summer. The apartments, from studios to five-bedroom units, are from 309 to 2,594 square feet.
The sponsor would have 15 months after state acceptance of the plan to sell at least 15 percent of the units for the conversion to be approved. Tenants who did not buy could stay in their apartments and remain under rent regulations.
In recent years, such conversions have become increasingly rare in Manhattan. There were 278 building conversions at the peak in 1986. Last year, five condominium and co-operative conversion plans were submitted to the state, according to the Attorney General's office.
Most conversions in recent years have been buildings that had been built as condominiums, but, after failing to sell in the lackluster market early this decade, were operated as rentals and are now being offered for sale again.
Real estate professionals say the planned conversion of 650 West End Avenue shows that the trickle of conversions will continue, given the robust market for co-ops and condominiums in the city. But it does not signal a trend, they said, pointing to contradicting market forces.
"Even in today's up real estate cycle I just don't see a strong rush to convert," said Richard Siegler, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a law firm that specializes in real estate.
Mr. Siegler cited the prospect that rent regulations might be substantially weakened, particularly on luxury apartments. That possibility encourages landlords to hold on to rental units, since rents might increase.
But the uncertainty surrounding rent regulations has also made co-ops and condominiums more attractive, as some renters decide to buy. That encourages building owners to convert their properties to sell them.
"Conversions are not dead, but they depend on the specific finances of the deal," said Adam R. Rose, executive vice president of Rose Associates Inc., which is controlled by one of the city's large real estate families. "Owners have choices."
Last summer, a partnership led by Rose had its condominium conversion plan approved for the Allegro, a 121-unit tower at 62 West 62d Street, built as a condominium, that opened as a rental in 1989 when the market was sputtering. Mr. Rose said 93 units have been or are under contract to be sold, 44 to tenants.
Mark Moskowitz, Henry Moskowitz's son and the president of Argo, said he has not "contemplated long-term plans to convert other buildings," but said he would "consider the situation in particular buildings on a case-by case basis."
Argo converted 14 properties to 2,048 cooperative units from the 1970's through 1990, but 650 West End Avenue would be the company's first condominium conversion.
"Condos are more marketable," said Karen A. Berman, vice president and director of sales at Argo. Whether the rent regulation laws change or not, "this building makes more economic sense as a condo," she said, and would generate more profits. Rents for the units, most with two bedrooms, are $1,000 to $2,000 a month, but six lease for more than $2,000.
There is a demand for and a limited supply of two- and three-bedroom prewar condos on the Upper West Side, she said, adding, "The hope is that many tenants will buy."

Long Bond Moves Higher, but 2-Year Treasury Is Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the longer maturities outperforming the short end of the market, where the Fed would have the most impact should it increase rates to slow economic growth.
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue briefly moved above the 7 percent level that analysts consider psychologically important early in the session after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. He again touched on the possibility of a pre-emptive policy move to keep inflation low. Analysts said the tone and content of his testimony were no different than his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony a fews weeks ago, but the markets are becoming believers. 
 The price of the 30-year bond gained 12/32, to 95 29/32, sending its yield down to 6.95 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. On the short end of the market the two-year was down 2/32, to a price of 99 11/32 to yield 6.24 percent.
Dave Shabelman, a market analyst with MMS International, San Francisco, said, "The F.O.M.C. will weigh the benefits of an appropriate policy action against the costs of being wrong." He added that it looked as though Mr. Greenspan had become more concerned about inflation and the risk of not tightening at this point.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research for Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said he, too, had reluctantly joined those who expect a 25-basis- point, or quarter of a percentage point, rise in the Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent on Tuesday when the F.O.M.C. meets, "although we certainly concur with those who argue that such an increase is not really warranted at this time."
"But given Mr. Greenspan's desire to avoid another stock market debacle like the one which ushered him into his job in 1987," he continued, "we believe he will successfully generate enough political-economic cover to persuade his F.O.M.C. colleagues that a 25-basis-point hike is in everyone's best interest." Furthermore, he said, Mr. Greenspan's "credibility will suffer immeasurably this time, if we get yet another no-action verdict, in which case the market's reaction would certainly cause substantially more damage to the long end."
Assuming the quarter-point increase, Mr. Delaney foresees Treasury yields something like this: a one-year maturity around 6 percent; two-year, 6.35 to 6.40 percent; three-year, between 6.50 and 6.55 percent; five-year, 6.70 to 6.75 percent; 10-year, between 6.85 and 6.90 percent, and the 30-year bond between 7.05 percent and 7.10 percent.
"The tendency may be for the yield curve to attempt further flattening, that is, the yield spread between a two- and 30-year maturity," Mr. Delaney said, "but we believe that the formidable historical resistance at between 68-70 basis points will hold without serious indications of additional Fed tightening down the road." He further suggested that those who bought on that premise would be unprofitably premature.
Mr. Shabelman of MMS International called yesterday's rebound in the longer maturities on no fresh news impressive. "After busting through 7 percent on the long bond yield, many traders felt that level would now represent resistance and were eager to set up short positions," he said. "Those shorts had to cover when the bond market rebounded and stayed below 7 percent. There also was a feeling among traders that all of the bad news was priced in."
Also weighing on bond prices yesterday was the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's monthly manufacturing index, which climbed to 21.1 this month from 17.4 in February. Economists had predicted that the index would register 15.6 this month.
And while the supply of new Treasury issues is not yet a factor, it is likely to be next week when the Treasury plans to sell $29.7 billion of new two-year and five-year notes, as well as the $23 billion of new three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.28 percent, up four basis points from Wednesday, while the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.60 percent, up three basis points.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Banc One uses promotional tie-ins to a movie about Selena to reach out to the Hispanic market.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A BANKING powerhouse is proclaiming "Hooray for Hollywood" with a Spanish accent.
The Banc One Corporation, the country's 10th-largest bank, has become the financial services sponsor of "Selena," a biographical film about Selena Quintanilla Perez, the South Texan singer who died in March 1995. Banc One is spending more than $1 million on a series of extensive marketing tie-ins with the movie, which is being released nationally today by the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner Inc. 
 The bank's efforts to link with "Selena" are its first in the realm of entertainment marketing. They include the placement of Banc One logos in scenes featuring the actress Jennifer Lopez, who portrays Selena; kiosks in bank branches promoting a sweepstakes giving away tickets to screenings of the film; screening parties in local markets with high concentrations of Spanish-speaking consumers, and donations to the Selena Foundation.
There are even plans for Banc One check cards and imprinted checks to bear the image of the singer, who specialized in a style known as Tejano that mixes elements of country, polka and pop music with tunes popular in Colombia and Mexico.
"We think of ourselves as being in the retailing business, with our products being financial services," said Kenneth T. Stevens, chairman and chief executive of the Banc One Retail Group in Columbus, Ohio, a former executive of Taco Bell and General Mills who is responsible for Banc One businesses like consumer banking and loans.
"Like any good marketer, we want to generate interest in what we have," he added. "And the story of Selena's life has universal appeal."
At first glance, it seems incongruous for a financial institution to latch onto a singer whose success came in a niche segment of the music industry and whose life ended at the age of 23 when she was shot to death by a disgruntled fan. But because of the increasing appeal of sales pitches pegged to the glitz and glamour of the movies -- and of addressing fast-growing ethnic markets like the Hispanic one -- popular culture is spurring the Ohioans of Banc One to look South and West.
"People think of banks as staid and traditional and as interesting as watching paint dry," said Victor Ornelas, president and chief executive at Ornelas & Associates in Dallas, which handles Banc One's advertising aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers. "So banks are saying, 'Hey, we've got to shake it up a little bit.' "
"Banc One is all about building their brand," he added, "and they're a trailblazer in marketing to the Latino community. So when this came up, they jumped all over it."
Nanci McMenamy, relationship manager at the John Ryan Company in Minneapolis, a retail marketing agency responsible for aspects of the "Selena" campaign that include the kiosks and sweepstakes, said: "Banc One is showing its empathy, reaching out by saying, 'We understand that Selena is an icon in the community and important to Hispanic culture.' "
Selena is joining the ranks of dead celebrities like James Dean, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Babe Ruth as the focus of advertising and promotional campaigns. Like them, she has also become the subject of a book -- "Selena's Secret: The Revealing Story Behind Her Tragic Death" (Simon & Schuster) -- that paints a portrait at odds with the flattering, reverential tales told by their families and films.
"That is a risk you always run when you affiliate with a personality," Mr. Stevens said. "You just have to live with it."
As for the violent end to Selena's life, echoing the finale of "La Bamba" -- a decade-old biopic about another Hispanic singer, Ritchie Valens -- Mr. Stevens said: "We all know what the story is. Obviously, she dies. But it's really a celebration of her life."
Mr. Ornelas agreed.
"Selena means so much to us," he said, "because she's a great symbol of someone who has a dream and is not going to be stopped by barriers like her youth and ethnicity."
Indeed, the Warner Brothers campaign for "Selena" is imbued with upbeat, uplifting language meant to capitalize on a belief that Selena was, as Yxta Maya Murray writes in the April issue of Buzz magazine, "the Great Brown Hope" who was "poised to grab the brass ring of crossover success."
Print ads, for instance, call the film "the story of a girl who had the spirit to believe in a dream and the courage to make it come true." In other words, the goal is to glorify her life, though her greatest fame came after her death.
Banc One, which developed its tie-ins through the efforts of Judy Chapa, its director for Hispanic marketing, is one of several mainstream marketers involved with "Selena." The American Honda Motor Company and the J. C. Penney Company sponsored 13 benefit screenings in cities including Chicago; Corpus Christi, Tex., Selena's hometown; Dallas; Los Angeles, and San Antonio. Latina, a magazine for Hispanic women owned by Latina Publications L.L.C. -- a joint venture of Alegre Enterprises Inc. and Essence Communications Inc. -- also sponsored those screenings.

HEADLINE: A Summit That Blurs Strength and Weakness

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 20

 BODY:
The 66-year-old Russian President strode down the gangway of his shiny new $50 million Ilyushin 96-300 presidential jet with the relish of a man back from the dead.
The 50-year-old American President, in a wheelchair after a brush with his own vulnerability, was lowered from Air Force One on a food catering truck. 
 Milking the irony, the Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Aleksandr Shokhin, coyly suggested that in return for America's generosity in sending heart surgeons to help President Boris N. Yeltsin during his operation, "we would be happy to lend him the services of the Kremlin doctor, Sergei Mironov."
All summit meetings begin with tactical feints and psychological game-playing. But once the doors to the meeting room close, the real state of mind of each leader inevitably rears up to color the negotiations.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, alluded to President Clinton's psychic burden when he told reporters today that Mr. Clinton was "adjusting to the reality of holding a summit in a wheelchair."
Out of the hospital and on his first foreign trip since he underwent quintuple bypass surgery, Mr. Yeltsin has presented himself as a man reborn and ready to take bold, new risks.
What that new confidence means for the future of NATO expansion depends on the eye of the beholder. Americans hope it is a signal that Mr. Yeltsin will have the political courage to accept the inevitability of NATO expansion and agree to move the process forward. Russians read it as a sign that their President may be prepared to hang tough and defy the West.
Mr. Yeltsin has blurred his true feelings, talking belligerently at home for a purely domestic audience, and sounding statesmanlike as he addressed a Western audience from the airport tarmac today in Helsinki.
He told awaiting journalists, "I do not want to lose the partnership we have built up over the past few years." He left it to "Bill Clinton and his team" to find a suitable "compromise."
Public statements, moreover, are clouded by a fierce war of nerves and public relations as the two sides maneuver before the talks begin in earnest on Friday.
While American officials in Washington and Helsinki have quietly laid out the set of inducements and compromises they believe should allow Mr. Yeltsin to agree to in order to move the process forward, Russian officials have been hotly voicing their outrage over the threat to Russian security and European security that they say NATO expansion will inevitably bring.
American officials say they trust that much of the heated language is a bluff, a tactic to force the Americans into greater flexibility, and a few Russian officials privately agree.
"We have to holler first," a Foreign Ministry official said, "then we'll take what we can." But there are also signs that many Russian officials -- and perhaps even Mr. Yeltsin -- are beginning to persuade themselves with their own rhetoric.
"The ordinary Russian public doesn't understand or care about NATO," said Boris A. Beresovsky, a tycoon who is now deputy chairman of the National Security Council and part of the Kremlin lobbying team that followed Mr. Yeltsin to Helsinki.
"But public opinion in Russia flows from the top down. There has been an amazing consolidation of the political elite -- reformers, Communists, bureaucrats, businessmen, everybody -- that this is wrong and that our national security interests cannot be bought at any price."
There are advisers to Mr. Yeltsin who fear that his recent decision to appoint a new Cabinet filled with young reform-minded economists looks too much like a concession to the West. Preoccupied with the domestic agenda, they openly hope he can combat that image by confounding American expectations and refusing to compromise.
"Of course he can work for the best deal he can get and try to present that back home as a victory," a top adviser said. "But it would be a lot easier to say no and tell the Russian people he refused to give in to the Americans."
Psychology -- or at least Russian insecurity -- is a card that Mr. Clinton hopes he can turn in his favor. American officials in Helsinki say that if Mr. Clinton can offer enough inducements on arms control and bilateral aid to appease some of Mr. Yeltsin's security and economic concerns, the pomp and ceremony of the summit meeting itself could pump up the Russian President's image enough to ease his anxieties about his standing back home.
"He likes being seen by the world on an equal par with Bill Clinton," said an American official who helped prepare the trip. "He wants to show his people that he is taken seriously as a world leader."
But Russian advisers say Russians have tired of the "Bill and Boris" show and are expecting him to stand up to the American President, not renew their friendship.
Before he left Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin gave a trial display of toughness by telling Russian newspaper editors that Mr. Clinton had called him up and offered him $4 billion in bilateral aid, and that he had sharply turned it down as a "bribe." His version of the conversation went over very well.
At the Russian press center, located by the docks of the Gulf of Finland and far from the American and Finnish press centers, the Russian delegation has been holding a series of news conferences that are actually seminars on Russian opposition to NATO expansion.
A discussion of freedom of the press on Wednesday that featured prominent Russian newspaper editors and a television executive turned into a full-throttle assault on the perils of isolating Russia.
Otto Latsis, editor of the daily Izvestia, noted the irony of talking about the independence of Russian journalists "when we are here at the request and expense of the Kremlin." But he too argued against NATO expansion.
The Americans have taken the Russian propaganda blitz in stride, hopeful that it will at least help Mr. Yeltsin appease his domestic opposition.
But in the war of imagery, the Americans were not prepared to roll over completely.
When the two Presidents sat for photographers in the presidential palace before dinner, the American advance team insisted that they both be seated in chairs, to minimize Mr. Clinton's injury. They ushered photographers out before they could film him being lifted by three aides out of his armchair and into his wheelchair.
On the substantive issues, the United States, which can proceed with NATO expansion without Russia's assent, is dealing from a position of strength.
Russia, weak, isolated and ornery, is seeking whatever psychological advantage it can find.
Advance teams were able to agree on many fine points of protocol -- from placement of chairs to flower arrangements -- but as the summit meeting began today, they remained blocked over a seemingly minor point: who, in the final news conference, would speak first.
The Americans argued that since Mr. Clinton is technically the host of the summit meeting -- the site was moved from the United States to Finland last January to accommodate Mr. Yeltsin's poor health -- protocol required Mr. Clinton to begin.
The Russians vehemently disagreed, insisting that Mr. Yeltsin, who has been in office longer, should take precedence.
Unable to resolve it, the advance teams left that detail to Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton to work out themselves.

HEADLINE: With Aid, Staten Island to Get a Banana Warehouse

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
To prevent the area's last banana importer from leaving, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey each promised yesterday to contribute $2 million to help build a new warehouse on Staten Island for the company that distributes Bonita bananas.
That $4 million, coupled with an earlier $1 million pledge from Staten Island Borough President Guy V. Molinari's office, will allow the importer, Ecuadorian Line, to move from its outmoded warehouse in Port Newark to a new building with temperature and humidity controls in Howland Hook -- and not to Gloucester, N.J., near Camden, as it had threatened to do a few months ago. The company had said that moving would be cheaper than renovating its existing warehouse. 
 "I'm very happy with the results of the two board meetings," said Chuck Schwarz, vice president for operations of Ecuadorian Line, which is based in Miami. "We will be staying in New York."
A decade ago, the Dole, Chiquita and Turbana companies shipped their goods into New York Harbor. But they later moved their operations, citing rising costs.
By November, when the Bonita warehouse is to be completed, at least 150 jobs are expected to move to Staten Island. The 64,000-square-foot building will hold bananas, mangoes and other fruit.
"We create jobs in New York City and we continue the Mayor's effort to revitalize the waterfront," Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said. He added, "Yes, we will have bananas."

First Bank Agrees to Buy
U.S. Bancorp for $9 Billion
First Bank of Minneapolis agreed to buy U.S Bancorp of Portland, Ore., for $9 billion in stock, in a deal that will create the nation's 14th-largest banking company, with $70 billion in assets. 
 First Bank, which will assume the U.S. Bancorp name, is paying a significant premium for the company, though it said it expected the deal to quickly lift its earnings. But 4,000 employees are expected to lose their jobs because of cost cuts. [Page D2.]
 
Liggett to Settle Tobacco Cases
In a first for the tobacco industry, Liggett Group, the maker of Chesterfield cigarettes, acknowledged that smoking is addictive and causes cancer, and disclosed that tobacco companies have for decades consciously marketed their products to children as young as 14. Liggett agreed to settle lawsuits filed by 22 states accusing the industry of hiding its knowledge of the adverse health effects of tobacco and seeking compensation for health care costs tied to smoking.

Nynex-Bell Atlantic Deal Advances
New York State regulators approved the $22 billion merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, clearing a significant hurdle for the deal. But as a condition, Nynex was ordered to spend $500 million and hire additional employees to improve its customer service. [B1.]
 
Dow Falls 57.40 to 6-Week Low
The Dow industrials fell to their lowest level in six weeks, losing 57.40 points to close at 6,820.28, as traders worried that higher interest rates and a stronger dollar could weaken earnings. But technology stocks rallied, sending the Nasdaq up 9.97, to 1,259.26, its first gain in eight sessions. [D10.]
 
Despite those results, the trend has been for investors to flee small stocks in favor of big ones like those in the Dow, which are perceived as less risky. One measure of the relative value of big stocks compared with the broader market has reached levels not seen since 1973 -- right before the last big bear market.

2d Strike by Pilots Seems Unlikely
Pilots at American Airlines have shown an unpredictable streak before. But for reasons that have as much to do with image and perception as with the terms of their tentative agreement with the airline, another strike seems unlikely. News Analysis. [D2.]

Delta to Order Only Boeing Jets
Delta Air Lines said that it would buy only Boeing jets, like the 767, for the next 20 years, ruffling Boeing's rival, Airbus. Delta announced an initial order for 106 aircraft, worth $6.7 billion, and options to buy an additional 124 jets, worth $8.3 billion. [D2.]

HEADLINE: Democrats Propose Spending On Police Instead of Jail Cells

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 20

 BODY:
Rebuffing Gov. George E. Pataki's prison construction proposals, the Assembly's Democratic leaders today proposed making large investments instead in hiring new police officers, expanding drug treatment programs and providing shelter for domestic violence victims.
Taking a cue from New York City's hugely popular -- and, by most accounts, successful -- police force expansion of recent years, the Democrats proposed a 2,500-officer increase in the size of local police departments outside the city, with three-quarters of the cost to be paid by the state. 
 They also called for 6,000 new residential drug treatment slots, a 46 percent increase, and new shelter space for 1,100 victims of domestic violence, a 69 percent increase.
Over all, the Democrats' program would spend $650 million a year when fully in effect, in five years.
"I'd much rather deal with prevention than lock someone up after they've committed a crime," said Assemblywoman Helene E. Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee.
The Governor has proposed building prison space for 7,000 inmates, at a cost of $635 million, to relieve overcrowding in a prison system that has nearly 70,000 inmates. The Democrats proposed building 400 new cells and contracting with counties to use up to 1,000 vacant beds in their jails to house state inmates.
"The Assembly's failure to support Governor Pataki's initiatives would be a major step backward," said Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for the Governor. But he added that "there are positive aspects to the Assembly's plan."
Today's proposal may just be the Assembly Democrats' opening gambit in a long bout of wrangling with Mr. Pataki and the Republican leaders of the Senate. Many Republican senators represent small upstate towns where prisons are the foundations of the local economies and might be willing to horse-trade for new construction.
Some Democratic lawmakers would like to see mandatory sentences for drug offenders eased, but will not propose it for fear of being tarred as soft on crime. Mr. Pataki himself has talked about relaxing those laws.
"The fact is that 61 percent of our prison population today is nonviolent," Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, said today. "The question is, with the crime rate dropping, do we have to go out and spend a lot of money to build more prisons?"
The Correctional Association of New York, a private group that studies prison issues, lauded the plan, but said it did not go far enough. "Six thousand drug treatment beds is good," said Robert Gangi, executive director of the group, "but there are 860,000 drug addicts."

HEADLINE: Zaire Rebels Try to Find Way to People's Hearts

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KISANGANI, Zaire, March 20

 BODY:
The meeting hall was packed with civil servants and small-time politicians, the leftovers from President Mobutu Sese Seko's Government. On a dais above sat three civilian officials from the rebel alliance that captured this city last weekend. The heat was unbearable as a local lawyer got up and gave voice to what was on many minds.
"I'm afraid of what happened in 1960 after we got independence," he said. "We were promised democracy, but we got dictatorship. Is it going to be the same thing now?" 
 The rebels' political affairs minister, Deogratias Bugera, listened intently.
"President Mobutu didn't ask the people to vote for their leaders," he said. "We are. A few days ago there was a curfew in this town. Now you can go wherever you like without problems. Government soldiers used to rob everyone. Our soldiers go shopping and pay their own way. Now we are giving you the power to elect your representatives."
A murmur of approval coursed through the crowd.
Having won the battle last weekend for this strategic city on the Congo River, the rebels set about today to win the hearts and minds of the people here, holding meetings with political officials and promising elections at once to choose a local government.
With the Zairian Army retreating and looting on every front, it is looking more and more as if the success of the rebellion depends less on military strength than on the ability of its civilian ministers to capitalize on their political gains, reform the civil service, weed out corruption and jump-start the nation's moribund economy.
That effort started here today in a sweaty meeting hall with the kind of grass-roots, town-hall-style politicking any mayor or governor in the United States would recognize. Three ministers from the inchoate rebel government, which has headquarters in the city of Goma, spent two hours fielding sharp questions from the civil servants, many of whom have not seen a paycheck in years.
The questions came fast and furious. When would the rebels start paying civil servants? What would be done about higher education with the country split in half? How would the local elections for the provisional government be held? Would former Mobutu supporters be allowed to stand as candidates? How could they hold elections with so many illiterate voters? When would a legislature be formed?
While alliance officials insist that the elections will be free, it is not clear precisely how delegates will be chosen. In at least one other town where the rebels have assumed control, members of Mr. Mobutu's ruling party were excluded from the elections.
At the meeting, one professional bureaucrat said he was afraid open elections would bring uneducated and unqualified people to power.
"The people who are elected should be the people who understand administration," he said. "I'm afraid to see someone who hasn't studied to be an administrator being elected."
The finance minister, Mwana Nanga Mawampanga, pounced on the question with the skill of an American spin-doctor.
"To have a university degree does not guarantee you are qualified to be elected as a representative," he said. "The former governor of this province was a professor of the university, but you know what he did." The crowd burst into long applause.
Besides holding meetings with bureaucrats, the civilian arm of the rebels, who are known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, flew in 117 young converts to their cause today to begin spreading their message of the rebellion among the citizens in the city's six boroughs.
These civilian supporters of the rebel government have all attended a series of seminars indoctrinating them in the new philosophy of Laurent Kabila, the 63-year-old former Marxist and longtime Mobutu foe who is leading the rebellion.
Mr. Kabila has changed his tune since the Lumumbist rebellion of the 1960's, when he styled himself a leftist on the Maoist or Che Guevara model. The ideology of the alliance now reads more like an American civics course: free and fair elections, basic civil rights, freedom of speech, a free press, lower taxes, clean government and a military under civilian control.
To prove they are serious about democracy, rebel officials are planning to hold elections of a sort this weekend to chose a governor and a mayor. The plan is to have local political and community leaders choose delegates from their neighborhoods, as well as candidates for borough leader, mayor and governor, who will serve in a provisional government that would hold office until after the war is finished. A randomly chosen group of delegates will then vote on the candidates.
"It's not perfect," Mr. Mawampanga said. "But it's the best we can do with the time and money we have."
Moving quickly to install a local civilian government appears to be a strategy to avoid appearing like a conquering army rather than liberators. The rebel soldiers are widely perceived here as being outsiders. The core of the force are Tutsi men of Rwandan ancestry from the eastern edge of the country. Some of the other front-line units are made up mostly of soldiers from tribes in the Kasai and Shaba provinces, which have always been hotbeds of anti-Mobutu sentiment, but are a long way from Kisangani in the province of Haut Zaire. On the streets of Kisangani, people point out that the Government army has been dominated by people from Mr. Mobutu's tribe, as well as by foreigners, and was so undisciplined and underpaid that soldiers spent most of their time robbing citizens. Most people here say they are willing to give rebel soldiers from other regions the benefit of the doubt.
"That's not a problem," said Musa Kombo, a 34-year-old unemployed graduate student. "They are liberators. It doesn't matter if they are Tutsi, people of Rwandan ancestry or Ugandan background. They came to liberate us and we will treat them as friends."
But many people also say that no government would gain popular support in Kisangani without local ethnic groups being heavily represented. Of course, this is an axiom of politics everywhere.
"We are not going to accept the Tutsi because the Tutsi are not local Zairians," Bernard Afata Botikotiko, a evangelical pastor, said. "When Kabila comes, we will see. It must be a native of Haut Zaire who becomes the governor. It must be a native who becomes the head of each zone."
There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Zaire, with the largest in Kisangani being the Lokele.
The issues driving many to support the rebellion are closer to the pocketbook and hearth. These potential voters say any government that brings peace and prosperity would be welcome, whatever its ethnic balance.
Alliance officials are trying to build on that sentiment, arguing that an expanding economy and a responsible government will erase much of the tribalism that has infected this country's politics for the last 32 years of Mr. Mobutu's stewardship.
"Tribalism was used by Mobutu to consolidate his power by dividing people," the finance minister said. "What we need to do is develop this country. Then there won't be any Nande, or Hunde, or Tutsi. People will just look for economic opportunity."
Perhaps to avoid the accusation of being a Tutsi-dominated rebellion, Mr. Kabila has chosen a ethnically diverse group of civilian ministers. Mr. Kabila is a Luba from Kasai, not a Tutsi, and of the seven top civilian officials in the alliance, only Mr. Bugera comes from a Tutsi background.
But for many of the political professionals in Kisangani, the proof will be in the government Mr. Kabila assembles. For years, they lived with the hegemony of Mr. Mobutu's Ngandi tribe from the north. Now, some wonder if they will face a government dominated by Tutsi from the east.
"Right now, people are just observing Mr. Kabila," said Momoty Lemand'Azuato, a news writer for the state-run television network. "We are watching carefully to see what will happen. We don't want to trade St. Paul for St. Peter. What we really want is real change. We lived a long time with a dictatorial system."

HEADLINE: Home-Grown Pension Alternative to Social Security

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: OXFORD, Ohio

 BODY:
For 28 years Bill McKinstry taught economics at Miami University here, including a course on Social Security in which he warned that the system faced an inevitable crisis.
Now retired, Professor McKinstry considers himself fortunate that most of his pension money comes from the Ohio Teachers' Retirement System, one of the few pension plans in the country that operate apart from Social Security. 
 You don't have to go as far away as Chile to find alternatives to Social Security. Nearly two million state and local government employees are exempt from paying Social Security taxes. Along with several hundred thousand retirees, they are eligible for benefits that -- while more costly -- almost always provide a better deal than the Federal system.
"There is a general conception that everyone in the United States pays Social Security taxes," said Richard Thau, executive director of Third Millennium, a nonprofit advocacy organization for people under 35 that is about to release a study extolling plans that exempt employees from Social Security. "But several million people have managed to escape the Social Security tax. They are all government employees and we think their experience is an interesting model for considering alternatives to Social Security."
The Advisory Council on Social Security, which issued three separate proposals early this year to overcome the retirement system's financing problems, agreed on at least one thing: All 1.9 million workers currently in exempt plans should be brought into Social Security, providing a shot-in-the-arm to Social Security revenues.
But Mr. Thau disagrees. "Folding these plans into Social Security," he said, "is akin to chopping down a rain forest without determining first the prospects that within the forest is the cure for cancer."
The study, which looked at seven plans outside Social Security covering 1.3 million government employees, was conducted by William Even, an economist at Miami University, and David A. MacPherson, an economist at Florida State University. It concluded that the vast majority of people now paying Social Security taxes would receive less in retirement benefits than they and their employer paid, while those outside it could expect to earn annual returns, after inflation, of 1.6 to 3 percent.
Only one-income couples who make less than $40,000 will receive more from Social Security than was paid in, the study says.
But supporters of Social Security, which is tilted to help low-wage workers more than those with higher incomes, say that is exactly why it is so important to preserve the system.
Karen C. Burke, a legal scholar at the University of Minnesota, said that redistributing income "is an explicit and important goal" of Social Security, while in contrast, private pension plans "are distinctly skewed in favor of high earners."
Professor Even agreed that providing a more generous payoff to lower-wage workers made sense, but complained that Social Security's rules, largely written when the vast majority of wage earners were men, created all kinds of anomalies. "Two-earner couples subsidize one-earner couples with the same income," he said. "Now what sense is there in that?"
Even for those with modest earnings, the government pensions are often a better deal. The study looked at what would happen to people who start their careers at age 25, retire at 62, and enjoy real wage gains averaging 1 percent a year better than the inflation rate. A worker who retired with an income of $20,000 would get $7,468 from Social Security, but the average benefit from the seven alternative systems would be $18,951, or 2.5 times as much.
But they are even better for more affluent workers. Those earning $100,000 under an exempt system would retire with 7.5 times more than Social Security alone would pay.
The most significant difference is in how the systems are funded. Social Security is primarily a pay-as-you-go system, in which today's workers pay the benefits for today's retirees. Only a small portion of Social Security revenues are invested -- in Treasury bonds; the plans rely largely on money set aside by the workers earlier in their careers.
The state and local government pension systems then invest a large portion of that money in the stock market.
Still, the local alternatives, since they are intended to serve as a full pension, cost more. Compared with the combined 10.5 percent of wages, up to $64,500 this year, that are designated for retirement benefits under Social Security, the plans range from 18.6 percent of payroll for one covering Colorado state workers, to 24 percent for civil servants in Los Angeles. Taxpayers pick up all or most of those costs. Government workers in Los Angeles, for example, paid only 4.7 percent of their paycheck directly.
Mr. McKinstry, the retired professor, likes his pension just fine, but is worried that those citing arrangements like his as a justification for abandoning Social Security are going too far in advocating a system where workers would mostly rely on their own retirement accounts.
"I certainly hope we are not going to turn people loose with their retirement savings," he said, "so they can lose it with some broker who has a hot stock tip."

HEADLINE: How Chile Farms Out Nest Eggs;
Can Its Private Pension Plan Offer Lessons to the U.S.?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"It's such a difference," bubbled Isabel Margarita Perez Moore, a 45-year-old secretary in Santiago. "I love my pension plan."
So apparently do most Chileans, who have enjoyed spectacular returns on their nest eggs since the country dumped the national pension system in 1981 for a savings plan that makes individuals responsible for financing their own retirement. And so do the Governments of Argentina, Mexico and Peru, which are all following Chile's lead, switching to private -- though heavily regulated -- pension accounts. 
 Indeed, what began as a model for born-again free marketers in stagnant Latin American economies is inspiring policy makers in the high churches of capitalism. Earlier this month, Prime Minister John Major announced plans to privatize Britain's pension system. And here in America, where many younger people doubt that Social Security will provide even a modest pension when they retire unless it is overhauled, a variety of similar proposals have been floated as the answer to low savings rates and high Social Security payroll taxes.
Over the years, "the gains from privatization would be worth $10 trillion to $20 trillion," argues Martin S. Feldstein, an economist at Harvard who was the chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.
For all its apparent success in Chile, though, the question remains whether what works for a poor but rapidly developing economy would work in America and Europe -- which cannot hope to pay for the retirement of aging populations with the dividends from growth.
Advocates of privatization in rich countries do not see it as a miracle cure. But, like Mr. Feldstein, they do say it is a way to spur growth and a means of distancing the national pension system from the rough and tumble of entitlement politics.
For their part, skeptics focus on the drawbacks to privatization -- the relatively high costs of operation and its potential for unraveling support for a social safety net. They also caution that in the event investment returns go south in a privatized system, the government may still be on the hook -- a debacle that could shake an economy unprepared for it.
Given such concerns, the skeptics see no compelling case for leaping into the unknown. "Chile couldn't fix the system they had," argues Peter Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Ours ain't broke."
Chile's pension reform was driven by a mix of ideology and necessity. In 1973, after he brought down the elected Socialist Government in a bloody coup, Gen. Augusto Pinochet was left to cope with a moribund economy. He turned to a group of economists later known as the "Chicago boys," American-trained Chileans who shared a commitment to the libertarian ideas of the University of Chicago's Milton Friedman. One of them, Jose Pinera (who earned his Ph.D. at Harvard), pushed tirelessly to change Chile's pay-as-you-go national pensions to a system of privately funded individual retirement accounts.
Mr. Pinera, then minister of labor and social security, was pushing on an open door. The existing hodge-podge of industry-based social insurance plans was unpopular, in no small part because it exacted payroll taxes in excess of 25 percent.
Today, workers deposit 13 percent of their wages in the retirement accounts. The accounts, which move from job to job with their owners, are managed by some 20 private mutual fund groups, known as Administradora de Fondos Pensiones, or simply A.F.P.'s.
To achieve what Mr. Pinera, who is now associated with the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, calls "radical reform with a conservative execution," the Government strictly limited the A.F.P.'s discretion to take investment risks. At the end of last month, the A.F.P.'s held 40 percent of their assets in Government-backed debt, 24 percent in interest-bearing bank deposits and 35 percent in Chilean stocks.
Buoyed by high interest rates and phenomenal gains on Chilean stocks, the A.F.P.'s have delivered a stunning 13 percent average annual return after inflation over the last 15 years. Equally important, Mr. Pinera argues, the switch to "defined contribution" accounts has ended the Government's discretion to raise pensions at the expense of future generations of taxpayers. But what intrigues observers most is the way the pension reform has meshed with Chile's goal of moving the economy to the fast growth track.
The economist's prescription for growth these days invariably includes prudent fiscal policies, high savings rates, tax reform and the development of liquid financial markets. Chile's pension makeover, Mr. Pinera argues, helped to accomplish each.
For starters, he notes, privatization made it impossible to paper over Government budget deficits with current cash flow from the pension system. The resulting fiscal austerity (combined with increased confidence that personal savings would not be taxed or inflated away) raised the savings rate from 16 percent in 1980 to an astonishing 28 percent. Mr. Pinera also argues that the substitution of mandatory pension savings for the 25 percent social security tax on wages sharply increased incentives to work.
Last but hardly least, the reform guaranteed a flow of savings to jump-start the small domestic capital market. The assets in A.F.P.'s now exceed $30 billion.
Mr. Diamond suggests that Mr. Pinera confuses cause and effect. The political will to contain Government spending, control inflation, reduce tax distortions and put out a welcome mat for private enterprise made pension privatization work, he suggests -- not the other way round. Mr. Pinera meets him halfway: "Pension privatization was part of a virtuous circle of economic reforms," in which successes built on successes, he argues.
A closer look at the Chilean system does disclose some weaknesses. With regulation effectively forcing the A.F.P.'s to pursue me-too investment policies, competition is driven in wasteful directions. Just as American banks used to give away toasters to attract new accounts, A.F.P.'s employ armies of salesmen and pour on extraneous services. Provida, the largest A.F.P., with some 1.7 million accounts, "never forgets my birthday or Christmas," said Ms. Perez Moore, the secretary from Santiago.
And while the resulting costs are not absurdly high -- about 1 percent -- customers are paying for annual turnover exceeding 30 percent.
More important, there is an inherent tension between the private pension approach and the Government's guarantee of a minimum pension. Since their contributions will not increase the size of their retirement checks, Chileans with low wages have strong incentives to hide income.
Finally, the jury is out on how the Chilean system would fare in hard times. If returns on pension assets fell to disappointing levels, there would surely be pressure on the Government to subsidize pensions from other sources.
Back in the United States, the debate over Social Security continues. Earlier this year, a sharply divided advisory commission recommended that the system needed an injection of funds to restore its balance and a majority favored allowing investments in the stock market. For now, though, little action is expected from lawmakers.
The question preoccupying American pension specialists is what lessons they should draw from the Chilean experience. One of the benefits of Chile's privatization -- the nurturing of nascent capital markets -- obviously does not apply. But as in Chile, private accounts might inhibit politicians from using the cash surpluses of Social Security to balance the budget.
"Might" is the operative word, Mr. Diamond counters. Congress might not dare to use private assets to offset budget deficits. But it might deny Government benefits -- unemployment payments, food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid -- to those with substantial pension accounts.
Another question is the relevance of Chile's relatively painless transition from an underfunded public system to a fully funded private one. The unfunded liability of Chile's system in 1980 was roughly the same percentage of national income as Social Security's unfunded liability in 1997, Mr. Pinera says. But Chile had one giant advantage: the potential to pay off the liability very rapidly since undeveloped economies have the potential to grow so fast.
The biggest issue is whether privatization would distance the national pension system from interest-group politics in Washington, as it has in Chile. On the one hand, Washington would lose the discretion to set benefits. On the other, there is nothing to stop retirees from turning to Congress for help if the return on their savings was disappointing.
"One thing you don't want," cautions Carolyn Weaver, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, is to replace the unfunded Government liabilities of Social Security with ill-defined liabilities to pensioners who, deep-down, believe the Government owes them a comfortable retirement. She sees less political risk in a two-tier approach that layers a private account on top of a modest basic benefit funded from tax revenues.
For his part, Mr. Feldstein estimates that the most likely consequences of privatization -- higher national savings rates and lower payroll taxes -- would ultimately raise national income by 5 percent, or about $350 billion a year.
In the end, suggests Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School, Social Security privatization fits neatly into the parable of the three blind men and the elephant.
"Each touches a different part of the elephant," she says, "and feels something different."

A "DEFINED CONTRIBUTION" SYSTEM in which mandatory deductions from each worker's salary go into individual, privately managed accounts, with the assets invested in stocks and bonds. At retirement, a Chilean can draw down the savings or use them to purchase an annuity. The Government guarantees a minimum pension to those who fail to accumulate sufficient savings to cover subsistence after retirement.
 
"U.S. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM"
A PAY-AS-YOU-GO "DEFINED BENEFIT" SYSTEM in which payroll taxes are used to pay pensions of current retirees. While the system is supposed to be self-supporting, there is no relationship between revenues collected from individuals and how much is paid out in benefits. Current revenues far exceed outlays, but the system is expected to go bankrupt by 2030 when it will be paying out huge benefits from the baby boom generation. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Rise Hinted By Greenspan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Faced with an economy that by all rights should be generating inflation but is not, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted today that he would raise interest rates next week as a precautionary measure to keep the nation's six-year expansion on track.
Mr. Greenspan was, as always, equivocal about his intentions, and he stressed that the outcome of the central bank's policy-setting meeting on Tuesday remained uncertain. Indeed, with the economy enjoying an almost perfect combination of strong growth, low unemployment and stable prices, the decision is shaping up as one of the most difficult of Mr. Greenspan's nine-and-a-half-year tenure as chairman and a test of his resolve that monetary policy must anticipate inflationary pressures rather than react to them. 
 The Federal Reserve has not changed policy in nearly 14 months, since it reduced the two short-term rates it controls by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent. It last tightened monetary policy more than two years ago, when it pushed the more important of the two rates, the Federal funds rate, for overnight lending between banks, to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.
But economists said Mr. Greenspan's testimony today before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, including statements that growth remained strong and that the Fed was committed to moving pre-emptively to attack inflation, was a clear warning that the period of policy stability was about to come to an end.
Many analysts have predicted that the central bank will nudge rates up by the minimum increment, a quarter of a point, and follow up with another quarter-point increase in the spring or summer just to make sure the specter of inflation remains buried.
"I don't know how Chairman Greenspan could have made it clearer than he has about tightening monetary policy without actually saying he's going to hike interest rates," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Because investors have been anticipating an eventual rate increase by the Fed, Mr. Greenspan's testimony had only a modest effect on stock prices, which were also dragged down by a fall in tobacco company shares. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.40 points to close at 6,820.28. Bond prices fell and then rebounded, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond seeing its yield fall to 6.95 percent from 6.98 percent by the end of the day.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the economy had displayed "a great deal of vigor" since the beginning of the year, with demand "growing quite strongly in recent months." He termed the current balance among strong growth, low unemployment and stable prices "close to unprecedented." And he stressed the importance for the Fed of "acting promptly -- ideally pre-emptively -- to keep inflation low."
Yet Mr. Greenspan laid out the conundrum facing policy makers, saying the economy's performance "is really quite impressive" but adding that current conditions should not be seen as a basis for monetary policy, only as an indicator of whether inflationary pressures might be starting to build in the form of rising wages that could lead employers to raise prices.
What the Federal Reserve will have to judge, he said, "is not so much the question of where prices are or have been, but rather what is the state of the economy later this year and into 1998 when any actions we may or may not have taken would become effective."
Despite surges of growth and an unemployment rate, currently 5.3 percent, that is well below the level that most economists believe should lead to rising wages and prices, wage increases so far have been muted and inflation has remained dormant.
The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that retail prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February, or just 3 percent over the last 12 months. The Government's report last week on producer prices was even more benign, showing that prices on many levels of the production chain were actually falling last month.
Economists are divided over whether the economy has been changed so fundamentally by forces like corporate downsizing and global competition that strong growth, low inflation and low unemployment can coexist indefinitely, or whether the nation is simply benefiting from a temporary deviation from the long-established pattern of low unemployment leading inevitably to surging prices.
By leaving rates unchanged for more than a year, the Fed has tolerated the coexistence of strong growth and low unemployment since those conditions became pronounced last spring. In doing so, it was effectively engaging in an experiment about the economy's ability to tolerate inflation, though not without some internal dissent from inflation hawks among the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.
They have argued that the same historical pattern that has marked business cycles in the past would ultimately assert itself, with employers being forced to raise wages and push through price increases to offset their increased costs.
If Mr. Greenspan comes down in their camp next week and leads the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee into a rate increase, he is likely to face a barrage of criticism for risking the continuation of the expansion to fight the theoretical possibility of inflation. But analysts said that Mr. Greenspan's experience in doubling rates to 6 percent from 3 percent over a year starting in February 1994 had given him confidence that he could move pre-emptively against inflation without sending the economy into recession.
Although the economy slowed markedly following those rate increases, it continued to expand throughout 1994 and 1995, and inflation never took root.
Having said repeatedly in recent months that stock prices might be overvalued, Mr. Greenspan seemed to acknowledge today that the markets might fall if the Fed tightened monetary policy, even if the investment climate ultimately benefited from an eradication of inflation.
"Should we choose to alter monetary policy, we know from past experience that although the financial markets may respond immediately, the main effects on inflationary pressures may not be felt until late this year and into 1998," he said.
But analysts said that today's relatively muted reaction in the stock market suggested that investors had already factored in the likelihood of a quarter-point rate increase next week.

HEADLINE: Executives Praise Lilco Deal As Likely to Save L.I. Jobs

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., March 20

 BODY:
Charles A. Gargano started reeling off a list of companies forced off Long Island by high electric bills.
"MSC Industrial of Hauppauge: they had 200 jobs and moved to Pennsylvania," said Mr. Gargano, Gov. George E. Pataki's chief economic development official. "Pass & Seymour, they had 300 jobs and made electrical outlets. They left Glen Cove and went to the Carolinas. Quoizel, 150 jobs, moved from Islip to Georgia. These are concrete examples." 
 Critics say the Long Island Lighting Company's rates -- the highest in the continental United States -- have cost the region thousands of jobs in recent years. But Mr. Gargano says he hopes that will stop, once regulatory agencies approve the Governor's plan to cut rates up to 23 percent in a $7 billion partial state takeover of Lilco. State officials began promoting the plan to business executives at a briefing this morning, and the cuts were welcomed by many.
"It's good news," said Scot Zimand, vice president of the Plascal Corporation of Farmingdale, L.I., which makes vinyl sheeting. He said he wished the cuts were even bigger and said full energy competition was the ultimate answer.
His company, which stands to save thousands of dollars a month under the plan, has considered moving. "That thought has gone around many times," he said.
Mr. Gargano said he was proud of another list: companies that were induced to stay, like Nature's Bounty of Islip, L.I., which had been tempted to expand to Atlanta with 300 jobs. But those success stories involved a variety of incentives, including discounted electrical power through economic development agencies.
One example is Symbol Technologies, a manufacturer of bar code data collection systems that employs 1,700 people in Holtsville, L.I. Tax breaks and other incentives kept Symbol from moving in 1992. Now the prospect of lower electric rates is keeping the company in place again.
"There was a high degree of potential for us to leave," said a company vice president, Brian T. Burke. "Not only will we remain, but hopefully we will expand over time as well. We are a significant user of electricity. Consequently, we see this as a tremendous opportunity for cost savings," at an estimated $300,000 a year.
Retailers may be the most immediate beneficiaries. "Any time you have a rate reduction, you are making available additional money that will be spent in the region," said Thomas Conoscenti, an economist from Nesconset, L.I.
Louis W. Fortunoff, executive vice president of Fortunoff, the family's jewelry and department-store chain, which is building a major new mall in Westbury, L.I., near the Roosevelt Field shopping center, said lower rates would reduce his company's costs. "But the much greater impact would be the effect on the economic climate on Long Island," he said. "Every consumer would have more disposable income. That's what we're looking at."
Lower electric bills could also help businesses recruit workers. At Servo Corporation of America in Westbury, which makes infrared detectors, the president, Stephen A. Barre, said: "We need to be able to attract engineers from off the Island, and anything we can do to reduce the cost of living is helpful to us."
Lilco's bills have been a hurdle to enticing new companies to Long Island. "For all of them, almost the first thing out of their mouth is, 'How are we going to be assisted in energy costs?' " said Suffolk County's Commissioner of Economic Development, Thomas J. Junor. "It's right up there in the top three, with taxes and the cost of building space. This rate reduction puts it further down the list."
William S. Bruno, Nassau County's deputy commissioner for commerce and industry, said, "If rates go down, it will definitely be an attraction to companies to come here."
He said he was especially interested in companies with heavy computer use. "Those data centers operate 24 hours a day," he said, "and they eat a lot of juice."
Even with the proposed reduction, the Island's electric rates would still be among the nation's highest. Matthew T. Crosson, president of the leading local business group, the Long Island Association, cautioned that the Island could not match regions with low-cost energy.
"The plan would shrink the gap, and that is good, but it won't eliminate it," Mr. Crosson said. "It's still not competitive with Tennessee or Florida and places like that. It may, however, make a marginal difference in a company's decision to stay or leave." The association has not taken a stand on the proposal.
One favorable forecast of the rate reduction's effect came in a 1995 study by Mr. Conoscenti, the economist, premised on a 20 percent cut. He projected 10,000 new jobs and $218 million more in annual wages.
Mr. Gargano, who is New York State's Commissioner of Economic Development, said he viewed the rate cut as part of the Pataki administration's pro-business policies of reducing taxes, workers' compensation insurance rates and regulations.
"Any time you can lower the cost of doing business, it's a good thing," Mr. Gargano said. "It really sends a very important signal that New York and Long Island are places where you can do business."

HEADLINE: White House Is Taking a Look Around Town

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
On Monday, Dr. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, visited a high school here to talk about careers in health care. On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, visited another high school to talk about computer skills.
Today, Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater gave out children's automobile-safety seats at a day-care center, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman spoke at a food bank, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen visited a Young Marines program, and Acting Labor Secretary Cynthia Metzler went to a bank to announce a $3.4 million program to create 4,400 summer jobs for youngsters. 
 And on it goes, this week into next. Cabinet officials and other senior Clinton Administration officials are fanning out to unlikely corners of the capital in a White House effort to show concern for the city. Their appearances follow President Clinton's announcement in January of a $3.9 billion economic revitalization plan for the District of Columbia.
But some city officials, while applauding the visits this week, wondered why it had taken the Administration so long to step up its involvement, since the city had been struggling for years with financial stress and municipal mismanagement.
The answer, many have concluded, is Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., whose previous three terms in office effectively ended in 1990, when he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge for smoking crack cocaine and sent to prison for six months. In an extraordinary comeback, he was re-elected in 1994, the year the Republicans won control of Congress.
"This is totally political," said Councilman Kevin P. Chavous, a Democrat like Mr. Barry, whom other politicians expect to seek re-election next year. "So much of what drives the President's plan and folks in Congress is that Marion Barry is our Mayor. That still holds us hostage. It is a pervasive issue that hangs over our city."
Carol Schwartz, the only Republican on the City Council, said that "distancing himself from Barry" might have been part of the reason for President Clinton's lack of action earlier. But referring to Sharon Pratt Kelly, a Democrat who was Mayor from 1990 to 1994, Ms. Schwartz said Mr. Clinton "didn't do anything" for the city when Mrs. Kelly was in office either.
Administration officials discount the notion that Mr. Barry's experiences influenced Presidential strategy for the city, including Mr. Clinton's decision to wait until after he had been elected to a second term before intensifying aid to the District. They contend that the Administration was fully engaged in helping the city in Mr. Clinton's first term, playing a particularly active role in drafting legislation that led to the creation of a financial control board in 1995.
In addition, a White House District Task Force, which includes leading civic and business leaders, has been at work for three years, although largely behind the scenes. That, said Mr. Clinton's special adviser on the District, Carol Thompson Cole, was "partly by design," to give the control board and city government a chance to work.
Privately, however, some Administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Clinton had little to gain in his re-election campaign if he posed as a strong ally of a city led by a former prison inmate. One person familiar with the White House's thinking on the city alluded to Mr. Barry and the November elections and said that "it's not any great mystery" why the Administration had only recently increased its visibility around the city.
Mr. Barry denies that his past has had any bearing on White House initiatives. In a brief interview on the subject this week, he expressed his appreciation for Mr. Clinton's interest, saying, "Don't deprecate" the White House efforts.
"We'll take aid from whatever source, wherever it comes from," he said.
In recent months, the Mayor has had much to appreciate. Besides Mr. Clinton's economic plan, which includes a proposal for a Federal takeover of some of the city's state functions like operating a prison system, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have visited a public school, and Federal agencies have donated to city schools and agencies a wide range of expertise and equipment.
These community visits by high-level officials are intended to be the start of a continuing relationship.
"I don't think this is only going to be a one-shot deal," a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, Lawrence J. Haas, said. "Clearly we have stepped up the involvement of the President and his team here in the District. The Cabinet members and the others will be back."

HEADLINE: Afraid to Compromise

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, took a chance last week when he called for a commission to reduce cost-of-living adjustments, an act that would lower Social Security benefits and raise income taxes. This would be a sensible, fair way to cut the deficit. President Clinton and Vice President Gore dismissed the idea, afraid to take on factions of their party that want no part of slowing Social Security increases.
Mr. Clinton had a second chance to forge a budget compromise this week when the Republican leaders Newt Gingrich, Pete Domenici and Tom DeLay broke with the conservative wing of their party by offering to drop for now the G.O.P.'s huge proposed tax cuts, the centerpiece of the Republican economic strategy. Again, Mr. Clinton made no equivalent concession. 
 This is a sorry turn of affairs. The Republicans are unlikely to take any more risks if the White House refuses to back their initial, timid steps toward a responsible budget this year.
Until Mr. Lott's move, budget negotiations were at an impasse. Both parties knew they could never fulfill their pledge to balance the budget in five years -- a regrettable pledge, in this page's view -- unless they chipped away at entitlements through a cut in cost-of-living adjustments.
Such a cut is justified because many economists believe the adjustments overstate the actual increases in the cost of living. But neither side would say so first, fearing a backlash from the elderly and other taxpayers. The deadlock appeared unbreakable until Mr. Lott spoke up. Sadly, Mr. Clinton refused to align himself with Mr. Lott, blaming the lack of bipartisan support. But the best way to create support is for the President to make the case for change.
The White House missed a similar chance to back away from harmful tax cuts. For months now, Democrats have criticized the G.O.P.'s proposed $200 billion tax cut that would be offset by equally huge cuts in welfare and other spending programs for the needy. Mr. Clinton knew that tax cuts have no logical place in a deficit-reduction plan, yet he felt politically compelled to offer his own, smaller tax-cut proposals during an election year.
This week Mr. Gingrich and friends offered the White House a risk-free way to drop tax cuts completely. The speaker suggested that the Republicans forgo tax cuts until after Congress passes a balanced-budget plan. Then the G.O.P. would reopen a fight for tax cuts, along with spending reductions to keep the budget balanced. Instead of embracing the idea and dropping his own tax-cut plan, Mr. Clinton merely called Mr. Gingrich's comments "a positive sign" and sought bipartisan talks.
Voters have a right to expect their President to lead Congress out of budgetary gridlock. Mr. Clinton ought to recognize the Republican offers as a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Grows, Complicating Visit By Gore to Beijing

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
America's global trade deficit soared to $12.7 billion in January, the largest gap between imports and exports since the Commerce Department adopted a new method of measuring international trade in 1992. The figures included a 36 percent increase in the deficit with China that will further complicate the politics of Vice President Al Gore's trip to Beijing next week.
Mr. Gore's aides have made clear that they want to steer away from economic issues during his visit, in large part because questions of trade policy have lurked just beneath the surface of the investigations into Asian donations to the Democratic Presidential campaign. 
 But the figures today showed a $3.7 billion trade deficit with China for the month, compared with $2.7 billion a year ago. The widening disparity continues a trend suggesting that the trade gap with China this year will rival the one with Japan. That puts further pressure on the Administration to force China into lowering a vast array of trade barriers in negotiations, now under way in Geneva, concerning China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Gore had hoped to make only glancing references to that subject during his meeting with China's leaders next week. But as one senior Administration official said today, "This is not the time to appear soft on Chinese trade issues."
C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, who has been deeply involved in Asian trade issues, noted today that "there's no question now that Gore will have to go harder on market access issues."
The pressure on the Administration also increased today because three leading Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, introduced legislation that would require a Congressional vote before the Administration could agree to let China join the World Trade Organization.
White House officials have said in the past that they would "consult" Congress, but they want to avoid a lengthy debate that could link China's human rights record or arms proliferation to its membership in the club of trading nations.
"This is not a garden-variety entry into the W.T.O.," said Mr. Gephardt, who is widely considered a potential competitor with Mr. Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in three years. "There are enormous implications of how this is done, for every worker in America and every major company in America."
At the White House today, Mr. Gore's aides changed course on one element of the trip, saying that the Vice President would attend the signing of a deal to sell roughly $1 billion in Boeing aircraft to China, if the deal is sealed in time for his visit. Earlier this week, when the Chinese offer was first made known, Mr. Gore's office said he would "consider" attending the signing.
In the past, that would have been just the kind of event that Administration officials would have unhesitatingly jumped at to make the case that exports and economic engagement with China were sustaining high-paying jobs in the United States. But recently there has been a rethinking of how deeply President Clinton and Mr. Gore should involve themselves in individual transactions. In part, that is in response to the Administration's critics, who say that it has been too close to business executives with interests in China and too mercantilistic in relations with Beijing.
The figures released today contained other complications for Mr. Clinton. The deficit with Mexico was flat compared with January 1996 but rose sharply from the end of last year, just as the Administration is seeking approval from Congress to negotiate an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement, to embrace Chile and, ultimately, other Latin American nations.
Reading too much into one month's trade figures is always risky, because a few major sales -- especially of aircraft or computers -- can send the monthly numbers sharply in one direction or another. Over all, the decline of six-tenths of a percent in exports, to $70.8 billion, reflected a drop in military shipments and a slowdown in aircraft deliveries. Imports of goods and services rose 2.2 percent to $83.5 billion, due in part to increased auto shipments from Canada as well as higher prices and greater demand for imported oil. Using the old method, the Commerce Department said January's deficit of $19 billion for goods alone was the largest ever.
The widening trade deficit also reflects broader trends, including the fact that America's economy is growing at a faster pace than most of its major trading partners, sucking in imports and drying up markets abroad. The rise in the value of the dollar in recent months also appears to be starting to cut into America's exports.

Bargain Ticket Is Becoming A Luxury

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
IN the TKTS booth line in Duffy Square, the theater district's tempest du jour produced no fears that the age of discount tickets may be nearing an end.
Word was out that Broadway producers were thinking about setting up their own one-stop-shopping ticket booth: an indoor box office for all their shows. If such an operation does get going, it is not hard to imagine that TKTS, a Broadway institution run by the Theater Development Fund, may be forced to fold its tent. 
 But nothing has been decided, and, for all anyone knows, Broadway's status will remain quo. So it is understandable that no one in line was in a panic about possibly being deprived soon of generous ticket discounts of as much as 50 percent. Still, the TKTS issue was a springboard for some to reflect on how important such discounts have become for enjoying life in a city where high costs can make even relaxing stressful.
"For a lot of people, this is the only way they'll go to the theater," said Bernadette Artus of Manhattan. Her companion, Bo Fritz, disagreed. "You can't really put a price on satisfaction," he said. "If it's something I want to see, I'll pay for it."
Ms. Artus held her ground. "My parents would never go unless the tickets are half-price," she said.
She hit the mark on a big problem with New York's entertainment industry, which is, after all, the soul of the city. Whether entertainment means "Carmina Burana" at the City Opera or Patrick Ewing at the Garden, it is often priced beyond the means of even those graced with incomes well above average.
FOR the premiere of "Faust" at the Metropolitan Opera tonight, tickets come in two prices: $400 and $250. The cheapest seats for the New York Philharmonic's program at Avery Fisher Hall tomorrow night cost $32.
Broadway shows run to $75 a ticket. At major rock concerts, so many seats are snapped up early by brokers or scalpers (the distinction between the two being lost on many) that people who are neither rich nor well connected often have no chance to go. Movies may seem like a relative bargain. But at $8.50 each, many families are forced to think twice about an evening out.
Sports? Let's not talk about the $1,000 a seat in Spike Lee territory at Knicks games. While $17 seats do exist upstairs, an average ticket goes for $55, assuming you can find one. The Rangers have raised prices for the opening playoff rounds by 16 percent over last year. Yankees and Mets tickets this season are up by 10 percent or more for many seats. This at a time when inflation is at 3 percent.
There are good reasons for some increases, notably the economics of accommodating the likes of Cecil Fielder, the Yankee hitter who acts as though life has dealt him a bad hand while he makes $7.2 million a year. And yes, Broadway offers group and student rates. There are "senior citizen" discounts, and the two baseball teams, as ever, provide low-priced tickets to nonprofit organizations. "They do try to reach out," said Jim Dolan, sports director of the Police Athletic League.
But that does not alter the fact that the cost of entertaining oneself in New York is reaching the ionosphere and is sure to keep going higher.
One person who has given the matter careful thought and does not like what he sees is Doug Logan, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, whose average ticket price is a more proletarian $13.
TIME was, he said, when movies and baseball were "the great democratizers," with mogul and riveter sitting side by side and sharing a common experience at more or less similar prices. Sports and entertainment, Mr. Logan said, were "the glue that held us together as a society."
"Unfortunately," he added, "they are not only getting away from trying to erode classism but they're actually perpetrating it, separating people by class."
He was referring specifically to the luxury "skyboxes" that sports franchises feel they cannot do without. "They're creating a living-room environment so that 'we' don't have to hang out with 'them,' " Mr. Logan said.
That situation is likely to get only worse, and soon, now that a new baseball season is upon us. Once again, we are certain to hear about the unwhetted appetite of George M. Steinbrenner 3d for a Yankee stadium with ever-more skyboxes.
Does anyone believe that building a new ballpark, or refitting the old one, to enable New York's privileged to watch ball games insulated from the masses can be accomplished without requiring the masses to pay for it in part with their own tax money?

HEADLINE: Bonds Slip as Investors Await Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices were generally lower yesterday, as market participants settled in to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week that will determine monetary policy for months ahead. Also adding to the negative tone in trading was weakness in the dollar, which makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors.
The spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bond has narrowed to 69 basis points, from 77 basis points before testimony Thursday by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the Joint Economic Committee persuaded more market participants that an interest rate increase is more likely now at the March meeting of the F.O.M.C. than at the May meeting. 
 The 30-year bond slipped 4/32, to a price of 95 25/32 to yield 6.96 percent, up from 6.95 percent on Thursday.
A market news service, Bridge News, had a report yesterday on a speech in Lincoln, Neb., on Thursday by Alice M. Rivlin, the Fed vice chairwoman, under the headline "Rivlin Says Rubin Has Set 'Limits' to Strong-DLR Policy." Although the Fed later denied that she had said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin had set limits to the strong-dollar policy, the report "gave the market something to ponder," said Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He said that the report could cause the dollar to drop, creating a drag on Treasury securities in the absence of any other fresh news.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, said, "If we take Greenspan at his word, the Fed is certain to move short-term rates up by 25 basis points."
Referring to Mr. Greenspan's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on Thursday, he said: "Clearly we learned this week that Mr. Greenspan has begun to exhibit significantly more signs of urgency than he espoused at his last set of Humphrey-Hawkins presentations. However, if we look at the economic fundamentals, it's fair to say that the early warning signs of inflation have actually turned somewhat favorable as evidenced by the year-over-year changes in the P.P.I. and even C.P.I. relative to the levels that they were hovering in over the last several months." The reference was to the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
Responding to the argument that any lack of a move next Tuesday would cause the Fed to lose credibility, Mr. Chan said: "I would argue that they will also lose some reverence if they move on the back of no real deterioration in either the P.P.I., C.P.I. or even the average hourly earnings data, because investors are going to ask themselves if Greenspan sees fit to move now, why didn't he move earlier when the inflationary warning signs were just as bad. For this reason, I would argue that the Fed is better off waiting until May." By then the economic data might make a stronger case for a rate rise, he added.
In when-issued trading late in the day the two-year note to be auctioned on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 6.29 percent and the five-year note going Wednesday, at 6.60 percent.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN HELSINKI: THE OUTLOOK;
New Yeltsin, Old Problem

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 21

 BODY:
A thinner, rejuvenated Boris N. Yeltsin has given a boost to an American-Russian relationship that had seemed to stagnate with Mr. Yeltsin's health until his heart bypass operation last year.
Not many months ago, President Clinton was excoriated for sticking with an enfeebled Mr. Yeltsin, who at the very start of his second term seemed helpless to manage a Russia drifting into political and economic paralysis. A former general, Aleksandr M. Lebed, called openly for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation and new elections, and some American officials were looking past Mr. Yeltsin to possible successors. 
 Today Mr. Yeltsin looked and acted confident and in charge, to the relief of American officials, who did not try to disguise their happiness at the outcome here. He did "my friend Bill" a tremendous favor, not just by repaying past loyalty, but by looking past the awkwardness and embarrassment of NATO expansion to put down a bet on Russia's future.
While Mr. Yeltsin continues to insist that NATO expansion is "a grave mistake," as he repeated today, he has also decided that Russia has no choice but to live with it in the interests of a larger cooperative relationship with Europe and the United States that promises important benefits to ordinary Russians.
Still, Mr. Yeltsin's new confidence in his political rejuvenation may be tested when he faces questioning by the Russian parliament on his bargaining at the summit talks.
Not only will Russia sign a charter with NATO governing its security relationships and its access to NATO planning and counsels, Mr. Yeltsin said, but he expects the charter will be signed before July, when NATO meets in Madrid to invite its first new members from the former Warsaw Pact.
Mr. Yeltsin knows that Russia needs foreign investment, that it must be a part of the larger world and try to share in its technological and managerial advances. If Mr. Yeltsin gave in to the idea of this first NATO expansion, American officials suggested tonight, it was for this larger aspiration.
The price of stopping or slowing NATO expansion would be threatening, blustering politics -- backed up by a much weakened army and central Government -- that would only isolate Russia further, doing more damage to Russia's future than, for example, Polish membership in NATO.
In Russia's fractious politics, where nationalists and Communists dominate parliament, the Duma, it cannot be assumed that the deputies will make the same bargain. Asked if he could get parliament to ratify Start 2, the pending strategic arms reduction treaty, Mr. Yeltsin said firmly, "As far as Russia is concerned, I expect that the Duma will make a decision based on my advice."
But if a weakened Russia is not the Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin is not the Communist Party boss either, and parliament rarely does him political favors.
Even bolstered by an agreement about missile defenses that seems to answer some of the Russian legislators' concerns about potential American defenses against strategic missiles, Start 2 may be a hard sell.
Some lawmakers have also linked Start 2 ratification to NATO expansion, and Mr. Yeltsin himself said today that even if the NATO countries did not have to have their parliaments ratify the proposed NATO-Russian charter, he intended to have the Duma do so.
In previous confrontations, Mr. Yeltsin has threatened to disband parliament and call new elections, or has resorted to a national referendum.
And every time he has gone over the head of his legislature to the Russian people -- who do not much care about the intricacies of European security -- they have supported him.
In any event, American officials insist, NATO enlargement will proceed, though the first countries expected to join -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and possibly Slovenia -- will not do so before April 1999.
Mr. Clinton's aides were especially relieved that despite the sharp disagreement over NATO, Mr. Yeltsin was willing to discuss important bilateral business on economics and arms control, agreeing in principle to a deeper cut in strategic nuclear warheads than most people thought possible five years ago, agreeing that planned American missile defenses were allowable under an earlier treaty and trying to help Mr. Clinton get a chemical weapons treaty through the Senate.
The talks here, American officials said, was a kind of answer to those American critics of NATO enlargement who said it would alienate Russia, strengthen anti-reform forces there and undermine the bilateral relationship.
Not only has Mr. Yeltsin put market reformers back in charge of Russia's economy and not "on the ash heap of history," one senior American official said; he has also set Russia firmly on the path toward a cooperative partnership that can only benefit both countries and stabilize Europe.
If, that is, Mr. Yeltsin stays healthy and is not undermined himself by the bargain he has set in motion here.

Clinton and Yeltsin, and How They Faced 'Three Fundamental Challenges'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of statements by President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin at a news conference yesterday after their meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Yeltsin's remarks were translated by his interpreter.
By President Clinton
I would like to begin by thanking President Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen, all the people of Finland, for their very gracious hospitality to -- the extremely constructive role that Finland plays in a new era for Europe.
This is my first meeting with President Yeltsin in each of our second terms, our 11th meeting overall. At each meeting, we have strengthened our nations' relationship and laid a firmer foundation for peace and security, freedom and prosperity in the 21st century. 
 Here at Helsinki, we have addressed three fundamental challenges: First, building an undivided democratic and peaceful Europe for the first time in history; second, continuing to lead the world away from the nuclear threat, and third, forging new ties of trade and investment that will help Russia to complete its remarkable transformation to a market economy and will bring greater prosperity to both our peoples.
A Europe undivided and democratic must be a secure Europe. NATO is the bedrock of Europe's security and the tie that binds the United States to that security. That is why the United States has led the way in adapting NATO to new missions and opening its doors to new members, in strengthening its ties to non-members of the Partnership for Peace, and seeking to forge a strong, practical partnership between NATO and Russia.
We are building a new NATO, just as the Russian people are building a new Russia. I am determined that Russia will become a respected partner with NATO in making the future for all of Europe peaceful and secure. I reaffirmed that NATO enlargement and the Madrid summit will proceed, and President Yeltsin made it clear that he thinks it's a mistake. But we also have an important and, I believe, overriding agreement.
We agreed that the relationship between the United States and Russia and the benefits of cooperation between NATO and Russia are too important to be jeopardized.
We didn't come here expecting to change each other's mind about our disagreement, but we both did come here hoping to find a way of shifting the accent from our disagreement to the goals, the tasks and the opportunities we share. And we have succeeded.
President Yeltsin and I agreed that NATO Secretary General Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Primakov should try to complete negotiations on a NATO-Russia document in the coming weeks. It would include a forum for regular consultations that would allow NATO and Russia to work and to act together, as we are doing today in Bosnia.
It would demonstrate that a new Russia and a new NATO are partners, not adversaries, in bringing a brighter future to Europe. We also agreed that our negotiators and those of the other 28 participating states should accelerate their efforts in Vienna to adapt the C.F.E. [Conventional Forces in Europe] treaty to the post-cold- war era by setting new limits on conventional forces.
The second area of our discussion involved our obligation to continue to lead the world away from the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. We have already taken important steps. We signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We extended the Nonproliferation Treaty. We stopped targeting each other's cities and citizens. We put Start 1 into force.
And we're both committed to securing ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention before it goes into force next month so that we can finally begin to banish poison gas from the earth.
Today President Yeltsin agreed to seek the Duma's prompt ratification of Start 2, already ratified by the United States Senate. But we will not stop there. The United States is prepared to open negotiations on further strategic arms cuts with Russia under a Start 3 immediately after the Duma ratifies Start 2.
President Yeltsin and I agreed on guidelines for Start 3 negotiations that will cap at 2,000 to 2,500 the number of strategic nuclear warheads each of our countries would retain and to finish the reductions of Start 3 by the year 2007. Now think about it: This means that within a decade, we will have reduced both sides' strategic nuclear arsenals by 80 percent below their cold war peak of just five years ago.
We also reached agreement in our work to preserve the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of our arms control efforts. Distinguishing between ballistic missile systems restricted by the ABM Treaty and theater missile defenses that are not restricted has been a very difficult issue to resolve. Today, after three years of negotiations, we agreed to preserve the ABM Treaty while giving each of us the ability to develop defenses against theater missiles.
Finally, we discussed our economic relationship and the fact that the strong and secure Russia we welcome as a full partner for the 21st century requires that the benefits of democracy and free markets must be felt by Russia's citizens.
President Yeltsin recently demonstrated his determination to reinvigorate economic reform in his State of the Federation Address and with the appointment of a vigorous new economic team. His bold agenda to improve the investment climate and stimulate growth includes comprehensive tax reform, new energy laws and tough anti-crime legislation.
To help American companies take advantage of new opportunities in Russia, we will mobilize support to help finance billions of dollars in new investment. We will work with Russia to advance its membership in key international economic institutions like the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], the Paris Club, and the O.E.C.D. And I am pleased to announce, with the approval of the other G-7 nations, that we will substantially increase Russia's role in our annual meeting, now to be called the Summit of the Eight, in Denver this June. Here in Helsinki, we have proved once again that we can work together to resolve our differences, to seize our opportunities to build a better future.
Before I turn the microphone over to President Yeltsin, let me say one word about the bombing today in Tel Aviv, which we have both been discussing in the last few minutes. Once again, an act of terror has brought death and injury to the people of Israel. I condemn it, and I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of those who were killed or injured.
There is no place for such acts of terror and violence in the peace process. There must be absolutely no doubt in the minds of the friends or of the enemies of peace that the Palestinian Authority is unalterably opposed to terror and unalterably committed to pre-empting and preventing such acts. This is essential to negotiating a meaningful and lasting peace. And I will do what I can to achieve that objective.
 By President Yeltsin
Our meeting was quite frank, and on the whole it was successful. And I am completely in accord with what the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, just said.
We have opened a new stage of Russian-American relations. We discussed in detail the entire range of Russian-American issues -- issues of Russian-American partnership, which is quite broad in scale. After all, our countries occupy such a position in the world that global issues are the subject of our discussions.
Both sides defended their national interests, and both countries did not abandon them. However, our two great powers have an area, a vast area of congruent interests. Chief among these is the stability in the international situation. This requires us to develop our relations, and there has been progress in that direction.
Five joint statements have been signed as a result of our meeting. President Bill Clinton and I just concluded signing these: on European security, on parameters of future reductions in nuclear forces, concerning the ABM missile treaty, on chemical weapons, and we also signed a U.S.-Russian economic initiative.
But we have not merely stated our positions; we view the signed statements with the U.S. President as a program of our joint action aimed to develop Russian-American partnership. I would say that emotions sometimes get the upper hand in assessing Russian-American partnership. This is not the approach that Bill and I have. Let's not forget that establishing the Russian-American partnership relations is a very complex process. We want to overcome that which divided us for decades. We want to do away the past mistrust and animosity. We cannot accomplish this immediately.
We need to be decisive and patient, and we have both with Bill Clinton. I firmly believe that we will be able to resolve all issues which for the time being are still outstanding. Today's meeting with Bill convinced me of this once again. We will be doing this consistently, step by step. We will have enough of both patience and decisiveness.

Dow Loses 15.49 Points; Nasdaq Index Is Off 5.19
Stock prices declined, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 15.49 points, at 6,804.79, depressed in large measure by three stocks: Eastman Kodak, Philip Morris and I.B.M. For the week, the Dow lost nearly 2 percent. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, up early in the day, slumped at the end, falling 5.19 points, to 1,254.07, with Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems losing ground. After peaking in late January, the Nasdaq has lost nearly 10 percent, largely because technology stocks have been in their worst downturn since early last summer. [Page 36.]
 
Bond prices generally fell, with investors reluctant to take positions ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which many expect to raise interest rates. The 30-year bond slipped 4/32 , to a price of 95 25/32 to yield 6.96 percent, up from 6.95 percent on Thursday. [40.]
 
Smokers Likely to Ignore Warning
Liggett Group Inc.'s decision to warn all its cigarette buyers that smoking is addictive breaks new ground in the long-running tobacco wars, but is unlikely to affect many smokers' decision to light up, according to experts on both sides of the issue. Tobacco use has recently shown a striking increase among young people, despite the Government's 30-year history of requiring health warnings on cigarette packages. [9.]
 
Healthdyne's Capitol Friendships
Healthdyne Technologies, a medical equipment maker based in Marietta, Ga., which is facing a hostile takeover offer from Invacare, an Ohio company, may have an ally in the state government of Georgia. The State Senate approved a proposal to require that Georgia-incorporated companies have staggered boards, which would prevent opposition directors, even if elected, from commanding a board majority straightaway. Senators of both parties spoke of the need to take care of Georgia. [38.]
 
Deal Off, Ivax Shares Plunge
Shares of Ivax plunged 14 percent after the collapse Thursday of a plan for the troubled generic drug maker to merge with Bergen Brunswig in a stock deal originally valued at $1.66 billion. Each company blamed the other, and both said they would seek new partners. Some analysts had disparaged the deal. [40.]
 
A Merrill Executive's Mixed Feelings
E. Stanley O'Neal, who becomes one of the top executives of Merrill Lynch, as an executive vice president and co-head of the firm's corporate and institutional client group, is now one of the most senior African-Americans on Wall Street -- and he expressed mixed feelings. Mr. O'Neal said he found it "bothersome" when people focused on his race. "I never asked for any quarter, and I don't think I have received it," he said. Still, such recognition is important because it allows "young people to have role models." [39.]
 
Icahn to Lead Marvel Effort
Bondholders led by Carl C. Icahn said that they would elect a new board to take control of Marvel Entertainment Group, a comic book and sports card company, on Tuesday. The move reflected the failure of negotiations between the bondholders and the banks that lent money to Marvel when it was controlled by Ronald O. Perelman. To reorganize Marvel, Mr. Icahn and the others will either have to reach an agreement with the banks, led by Chase Manhattan, or persuade a bankruptcy court to force the banks to accept the plan. [39.]
 
Bre-X Says Freeport Studies Gold
Bre-X Minerals of Calgary, Alberta, responding to speculation that an Indonesian gold deposit might not be as big as reported, said that Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold, a partner in the deposit, was still examining it and had not yet commented. [38.]
 
Steel Collapse Hurts Seoul Banks
In South Korea, the collapse of Sammi Steel, following the filing for receivership earlier this year by Hanbo Steel, has worsened problems for the nation's banks, which have been hobbled by bad loans, weak management and shrinking stock investments. South Korea's central bank has promised to support Korea First Bank, Hanbo's prime creditor, which also lent money to Sammi. [38.]

Unemployment Rate Drops

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate for February fell to 5.5 percent, its lowest level in more than six years. But the rate is still slightly higher than the national rate of 5.3 percent, the State Department of Labor reported yesterday.
Labor Department officials attributed the improvement over January, when the unemployment rate was 5.9 percent, to the addition of 5,900 retail jobs and to relatively warm weather, which led to 700 new construction jobs. 
 But in the last month, the state has lost 500 financial services jobs and 1,800 manufacturing jobs, said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the department.

An Antidrug Journalist Is Killed in Colombia

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, March 21

 BODY:
A gunman has killed the chief editorial writer of Cali's main newspaper, who was a harsh critic of Colombia's drug corruption.
The editorial writer, Gerardo Bedoya, 55, was killed on Thursday night by six or seven shots after leaving a condominium in southern Cali, home of the country's leading drug cartel, said an executive of El Pais, Mr. Bedoya's employer. The gunman fled on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice. 
 A lawyer, economist and former congressman, Mr. Bedoya had recently written stinging criticisms of the drug corruption that has plagued the Government of President Ernesto Samper.
In a Feb. 27 column entitled "Though they may call me Pro-Yankee," Mr. Bedoya wrote, "I prefer the pressure of the U.S. Government to the pressure of the narcos."
Mr. Bedoya was the most prominent journalist killed since the 1986 assassination by drug cartel hitmen of Guillermo Cano, publisher of the Bogota newspaper El Espectador.

Mandela the Pol

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis; Anthony Lewis is a columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
When I began visiting South Africa 30 years ago, it was a police state that enforced official racism with a mad logic. Government employees classified people as white or colored (mixed race) by testing the curl in their hair. Hundreds of thousands of blacks were arrested every year for being in a "white area" without the right pass. Sex across color lines was a crime. A teen-age boy was sentenced to five years in prison under the Terrorism Act for writing an anti-white poem and "publishing" it by showing it to his girlfriend.
I thought then, and on many later visits, that South Africa was the most fascinating country on earth. There were exceptional human beings -- bishops and writers and lawyers and political thinkers -- whose struggle against the system seemed to deepen their characters. And there was a great unfinished drama. How long could whites, then 16 percent of the population, continue to hold all political and economic power? Would it end in an explosion, or would there somehow be a peaceful transition to majority rule? Richard Rive, a colored literary soholar, put it in a sentence to me in 1975: "The end is inevitable, but not predictable." 
 To revisit the country now is a dazzling experience. The old sense of entering a vast prison is gone. There are no restraints on what political creed one may espouse. No one is "banned" or held in detention without trial. Life in South Africa is a human kaleidoscope of colors: in shops and business offices and not least in Parliament, that former bastion of whiteness. And at the center, where for two generations stern Afrikaner leaders enforced the ideology of racial separation, stands the benign, all-embracing figure who brought about the peaceful transformation, President Nelson Mandela.
Mandela is probably the most widely known political leader in the world, and without doubt the most revered. In an age of ethnic, religious and racial conflicts, societies of a very different character and history wish they had someone of his unifying qualities and unassailable standing; I have heard that from, among others, Israelis and Palestinians. He is one of the most written-about figures anywhere. Sidney Poitier portrayed him in a television drama last month, and a full-length documentary on his life has just opened in United States theaters.
Yet in profound respects Mandela remains a mystery. What exactly is the magic of his leadership, the means by which he persuades diverse people in what was a riven country to join with him? What enabled him to survive 27 years in prison without disabling bitterness? What makes him Mandela?
The South African drama continues, the fascination of its central character undiminished. Now Mandela is coming under criticism for his Government's performance; people are asking whether the qualities that enabled him to lead the country peacefully to freedom are right for the fretful business of governing. So I found on a visit last month to explore the Mandela mystery.
I first interviewed Mandela in March 1990, a month after he left prison. My wife and I -- she comes from South Africa, where she was an anti-apartheid student leader -- saw him in the temporary offices of the African National Congress in downtown Johannesburg. The place was in turmoil, people rushing in and out, going from meeting to meeting. Joel Joffe, a lawyer who had not seen Mandela and his fellow prisoners since the end of their trial in 1964, was there visiting from his home in England, hugging and being hugged. But when we sat down with Mandela in his office, there was serenity. It was as if he had nothing to do but talk with us. There was a profound courtesy, almost a courtliness, in his manner.
In the middle of our meeting he had a telephone call from Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the KwaZulu-Natal leader whose supporters in the province were fighting A.N.C. members. We rose to leave; Mandela motioned us to stay. Buthelezi was upset about the cancellation of what he thought was an agreement for the two of them to meet at a rural spot in KwaZulu-Natal. Mandela explained that it had not been finally agreed because his advisers thought the place was not safe. He tried to mollify Chief Buthelezi, deferentially. But Buthelezi was not mollified.
When the phone call ended, Mandela said it was "pointless to apportion blame" for the cancelled meeting. The need, he said, was "to unite all the anti-apartheid forces in the country" to win "basic human rights. We can't afford to be killing one another." There was not a word of recrimination toward Buthelezi.
Later in that interview he sounded the note that was so startling in those early days but became the received view: that there would be no revenge for the crimes committed in the maintenance of apartheid. The reason again was the need for unity, now on a national scale. If there was to be a negotiated settlement, he said, it must "involve the entire community in its suport. Otherwise it will be an intolerable situation."
I talked with President Mandela last month in the presidential residence outside Cape Town. The house used to be called Westbrooke; a year ago he renamed it Genadendal, as a symbol of South Africa's diversity and unity. Genadendal was a Christian mission established in 1738, the oldest in South Africa; 1t was a sanctuary for former slaves after the abolition of slavery, and in Genadendal the Dutch dialect arose that helped to form the Afrikaans language.
At 78, Mandela is still erect and slim, though a knee injury slows his walking. A physiotherapist gives him massages to help the knee, and he works out on an exercise bike. He gets up at 4:30 or 5 in the morning -- prison routine -- then waits until 6 or 6:30 to telephone friends. If he can, he comes home at 4 P.M. to sit in the garden, take off his shoes and put up his feet. He works late but, I was told, needs only a few hours of sleep. He does not like to eat alone, so he will often invite friends for breakfast or supper: Walter Sisulu and Ahmed Kathrada, for example, comrades from Robben Island; Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel Prize-winning writer; George Bizos, a lawyer who has been his advocate and friend for 40 years, and Amina Cachalia, widow of a leader of the Transvaal Indian Congress.
Home is not really Genadendal, a place of large, empty rooms and overstuffed furniture, or the equally barren president's house in South Africa's other capital, Pretoria. He lives in a private house in Houghton, a suburb of fine homes and gardens north of Johannesburg. Sometimes he slips away to Qunu, the village where he grew up in the Transkei. A small house has been built for him there: a replica of the warden's cottage at Victor Verster Prison, where the authorities installed him in transition from prison to freedom.
His loneliness has been overcome, in the last six months, by his love affair with Graca Machel, the 51-year-old widow of the former President of Mozambique. They have decided not to marry, and she continues to live mostly in Maputo. But she comes to Houghton or Qunu or Cape Town to stay with Mandela, and recently she accompanied him on a state visit to Asia.
I aaked friends what he does for leisure. The answer was that he does not have much. He expressed regret to a friend that he no longer has time to read. His life is largely official. He is driven around (in a sedan, not a limousine) in a security convoy. He has meetings in his office or at home. He travels on state business. But he does not complain. He never has complained. It has been a life of duty.
The personal cost of that life is indicated, tellingly, in a story from "Every Secret Thing," a new book by Gillian Slovo, Joe Slovo's daughter, to be published in the United States in May. Joe Slovo, who had been the commander-in-exile of the A.N.C.'s guerrilla force and then Minister of Housing in the Mandela Government, died on Jan. 6, 1995. A few hours after his death, in the early morning, President Mandela appeared at the house. He sat across from Slovo's daughters and somehow sensed their feeling that their father had abandoned them for politics. Gillian Slovo writes: "He told us how one day when he had gone to hug his grown-up daughter she had flinched away from him and burst out, 'You are the father to all our people, but you have never had time to be a father to me.' This, he said, was his greatest, perhaps his only regret: that his children, and the children of his comrades, had been the ones to pay the price of their parents' commitment."
But Mandela is not a melancholy person. Nor, for all the burdens on him, does he seem under stress. He still radiates calm, seeming so relaxed that he puts a visitor at ease. He tells little jokes on himself, for example mentioning when a photographer comes in during our talk that he was so unaware of technology when he came out of prison, he did not know what a fleece-covered microphone was when it was thrust at him.
The interview took place at 7 in the morning, in an alcove looking out across beautiful lawns and trees down the hill toward Rondebosch, a suburb that is the home of the University of Cape Town. The President came down after having breakfast in his room upstairs. No security men were in sight until an hour later.
I began by asking about the future, about where South Africa was headed. But seven years after his release from prison, with a new Constitution in place and himself in office after the country's first democratic election, he was still concerned about national unity. He wanted to talk first about the peaceful transformation. South Africa, he said, had avoided "tragedies such as Bosnia."
What lessons, I asked, did he think the South African story had for Bosnia and other conflicted societies? "It would be presumptuous of me to lecture" Bosnian leaders, he answered. But then he added:
"They thought through their blood and not through their brains. In countries where innocent people are dying, the leaders are following their blood rather than their brains."
It was a rare piece of self-revelation, I thought. The world sees Nelson Mandela as a man of extraordinary magnanimity, eschewing revenge for the cruelties of apartheid, reaching out to enemies: the nearest thing politics has to a saint. True, but not the whole truth. When you talk to those who know him best, you come to understand that Mandela is anything but benign. He is a map of powerful emotions, but even more powerful discipline. If he is saintly, he is saintly for a purpose. Through 27 years of prison and now 7 of public leadership, he has disciplined himself to suppress his feelings: to think with his brains and not his blood.
"He has a much keener sense of power than appears in that benign image," an official close to him said. "He has a purpose even in gestures of reconciliation." As an example, the official described what happened at the rugby World Cup final, played in Johannesburg in 1995.
Rugby has been a sport for whites, especially Afrikaners. Hence blacks scorned South Africa's Springbok rugby team. Before the World Cup matches, President Mandela urged blacks to support the national team. When I asked him about it, he laughed and said he had worn a Springbok cap to black political meetings. "I told them, 'We wish our boys success,' " he said, "and they would clap politely -- not so enthusiastically."
Against the odds, South Africa made it into the final, against New Zealand. Mandela went to the match and astonished the Springboks by appearing in their locker room before it started, wearing the No. 6 green jersey of their captain and wishing them luck. In a great upset, the Springboks won, 15-12. ("It almost shattered my nerves because of tension," Mandela said when I interviewed him. "I'm still recovering.") When the President walked out on the field to present the trophy, still wearing the green jersey, the Afrikaner crowd broke into a chant: "Nelson, Nelson, Nelson."
A great emotional moment. But it was more than that. The official who told me about it said: "It had a devastating effect on the far-right white groups, the people who had refused to vote in 1994 or to recognize the new Constitution, saying, 'It's not our country.' The groups simply disintegrated. Their people stopped using the symbols of the past, the old flag, the songs. Mandela became the symbol of the whole country."
Symbols matter in the politics of any society, any culture, and Mandela is a master of them. That is one key to his leadership. There is a calculating aspect to what he does, of course: the sense of power that his official mentioned. But he puts so much into a gesture that people accept its good faith. He did not just casually support the rugby Springboks; he touted them to black audiences, he wore the jersey, he went to the locker room, he visibly cared.
Here is another example, a current one. Last month Mandela and the Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, went to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The country was going to be without a head of state for a day. To act in that role Mandela designated Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom Party is in the coalition Government and who also serves as Minister of Home Affairs. But since 1990, Inkatha has led violent marches, carried out deadly conflict with the A.N.C. and boycotted the writing of the permanent new Constitution. Everyone was astonished at Buthelezi's designation. I asked the President to explain it.
"Actually our relations have been on a sound basis ever since I knew him as a young man," Mandela said. "And that relationship grew when I was in jail, because he was one of the few public figures who were allowed to write to me whilst I was in prison. And he wrote me beautiful letters. Not only that. He was able on my birthdays to call large meetings to celebrate my birthday.
"And in the Cabinet, Buthelezi is one of the most supportive, the most constructive. The problem, of course, is when he leaves the Cabinet and appears on public platforms. Then he behaves like any other politician.
"The reason, therefore, why I appointed him to be President is that he is a capable person. He is experienced. And if that opportunity would also promote the spirit of reconciliation, I'll be happy. But the real reason was merit. I appointed him on merit."
Well, fine. But one does not have to be cynical to believe that the designation served a larger political purpose. Chief Buthelezi is a man with a fragile ego, always conscious of perceived slights. Here was a gesture that in the grandest way said he was respected. The result was to make it harder for him to pull Inkatha out of the Government if things get dicey -- an eventuality that the unity-minded Mandela wants to avoid. Some saw an even broader purpose in the gesture. President Mandela has been trying to help settle the intractable conflict in Angola, where the ego of the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi has so far kept him from fulfilling an agreement to join the Government of President Eduardo Dos Santos. Mandela's gesture was one those two could not miss: a sign that a great leader can gain by being generous toward a prickly antagonist.
To carry out the Mandela theme of reconciliation, not revenge, his new Government as one of its first acts set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission with power to grant amnesty to individuals in return for full confession of a political crime. When I talked with the President, the commission had just received amnesty applications from five former policemen involved in what was probably the single most notorious apartheid killing: the murder of Steve Biko, the young Black Consciousness movement leader who died of brain damage while he was in jail in 1977. At the time, under oath, the police denied responsibility for his death. Now they said they had killed him inadvertently. The extent and truth of their confessions must be tested at hearings where in other cases, the details were so gruesome that the commission chairman, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, put his head down on the table and wept.
I asked the President whether the public would continue to support the policy of amnesty as the horrifying truth of what happened to Steve Biko and others came out. "In fact," he answered, "some of the relatives of the victims have said, 'We don't want revenge, but we want to know what happened to our beloveds.' And that is an indication. If a person who has actually suffered can say that, then you know people understand that you can't build a united nation on the basis of revenge."
Mandela never met Steve Biko, who rose to prominence while Mandela was in prison; Biko's name is not mentioned in his autobiography. Biko led a movement whose first premise, at least -- that blacks should rely on themselves for liberation -- was very different from the A.N.C.'s historic nonracialism. I asked the President what role he thought Biko would have played if he had lived.
"There can be no doubt that he was one of the most talented and colorful freedom fighters South Africa has produced," he said. Then he placed Biko in his own pantheon of unity. "Young as he was, he was concerned with the question of unity. . . . Now that is a young man with realism, who could at that stage have felt that we were wasting our energies, our talents, by remaining divided."
A realist: Mandela's highest praise. Neville Alexander, his fellow prisoner, said Mandela's realism was the more effective because he was "extremely patient and wise. He's always been prepared to wait for people to catch up with reality. We wanted to fight the prison authorities. He said, 'Look, chaps, we're going to be here 10 years or more.' "
Alexander's view of Mandela, in the testing conditions of Robben Island, is especially interesting because his politics were different. He was a Marxist with a Ph.D. from Tubingen University in Germany, a member not of the African National Congress but of a student group called the National Liberation Front. We spoke admiringly of Mandela's single-minded pragmatic leadership even though the two men were ideologically apart in prison and, according to others, on cool terms personally.
"His goal always was the deracialization of South African society and the creation of a liberal democracy," Alexander said. "For that end he was willing to make compromises with people of different views. He was able to concentrate on his goal with utter conviction and lucidity, and he was a man of extreme discipline. His aristocratic family background and training -- one can use that term realistically -- were reinforced by both legal practice and a jurisprudential cast of mind."
Helen Suzman, who as an opposition member of Parliament visited the prisoners on Robben Island starting in 1967, said the same thing about Mandela's consistent goal: " 'I want to normalize things in South Africa.' That was what he always said to me in prison." What really mattered was ending the racial supremacy that dominated the country's life. Everything else -- economic theory, social ideology -- was subordinated in his mind to that end.
It was not easy for Mandela to make his view prevail, as the romance about his person may lead some to think. He had to fight for his pragmatism over many years. I talked with half a dozen alumni of Robben Island, and I learned something that surprised me. There were deep divisions among the prisoners, not only political but personal, even among A.N.C. members.
Relations were tense in prison, I was told, between Mandela and Govan Mbeki, a senior A.N.C. colleague and a leading figure in the Communist Party. Mbeki was critical of Mandela's good relations with what he called right-wing elements. They included Buthelezi and some tribal chiefs whom Mandela, who was from a Xhosa chief's family, acknowledged as leaders of a kind. However sharp the dispute with Mbeki, Mandela did not visit it on the next generation. He has made Govan's son, Thabo Mbeki, the Deputy President and his heir apparent. (See box on page 44.) As for Communism, the odd fact is that when apartheid fell, the Communist leaders Joe Slovo and Chris Hani played a crucial part in winning acceptance of the compromises necessary for a peaceful transition.
Many people told me that Mandela does not like what he considers ad hominem attacks or confrontations. One said: "With all the warm things he does, inside he can be hard. He has a terrible grudge against anyone who has crossed him -- once you've lost favor with him, he never lets go. That's the mistake that Winnie made: thinking he would forever be at her beck and call. She will never get close to him again, because he has finally taken the turn."
As to Winnie Mandela, it must be added that he did not move immediately for a divorce when he understood that she would not live with him as a wife. He waited until her trial for kidnapping was over, lest their public separation disadvantage her. And his lawyer, George Bizos, represented her. Magnanimity -- but it could also be said that the respectful way he dealt with her and the regret with which he announced the divorce minimized the possibility of antagonizing her young supporters in the A.N.C.
Whatever the differences among the prisoners on Robben Island, in the end they accepted his leadership. So several told me. Fikile Bam, a lawyer who is now Judge President of the Land Claims Court (set up to give justice to people whose land was seized over the last century), went to Robben Island, like Neville Alexander, as a member of the National Liberation Front. He said: "Mandela had this quality of being able to keep people together. It didn't matter whether you were P.A.C." -- Pan-Africanist Congress -- "or A.N.C. or what, we all tended to congregate around him. Even his critics -- and he had them -- deferred to him at the end of the day as a moral leader. He still has that quality. Without him I can't visualize how the transition would have gone."
Then Bam told a story about Mandela. Bam arrived in 1964 on Robben Island a few months before Mandela and his colleagues, after a different trial. When the Mandela group arrived, they were put in a separate wing of the prison.
"On July 18, 1964, my birthday," Bam said, "the guys in my section started singing 'Happy Birthday' to me early one morning. Then we could hear the others singing 'Happy Birthday.' We were not allowed to mix at that stage, but we had a way of communicating as we went to the showers, and we found that Mandela had the same birthday.
"Every year after that he had a gift for me on my birthday. We were allowd to buy sweets and biscuits over Christmas, and he would keep them seven months so he could give me a present. It embarrassed me, because I could never keep them for seven months." (Talk about self-discipline: those were the only treats a prisoner got in a whole year.)
I told President Mandela that Fikile Bam had told me about the birthday presents. He beamed. "Yes," he said, "black magic." Black magic? "Yes, Black Magic, they're a brand of chocolates. He couldn't imagine that somebody would keep a box of chocolates for seven months."
In politics, it was hard for some of the prisoners to accept the idea of negotiating with the apartheid regime. "I had to sit down with my colleagues," Mandela told me, "and say, 'Let us talk with our enemies. Let us suppress our feelings.' " That is what happened after 1990.
It was President F. W. de Klerk who opened the way for negotiations by his courageous decision to free political prisoners and end the ban on opposition movements. He and Mandela have often been pictured together, famously the two of them clasping hands aloft when they were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
But the two are not friends. Alex Boraine, the deputy chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, has said that the apartheid system rather than individuals was responsible for the crimes committed, so de Klerk, as a man who presided over the system for some time, should apply for amnesty. I asked President Mandela what he thought of that idea. "It is true that it is the system," he said, "and it would be a fine gesture if Mr. de Klerk admitted responsibility. Because it was his party that was responsible. . . . I agree with Dr. Boraine that that would be a fine gesture on his part."
Curiously, the President seems to have a better relationship now with Gen. Constand Viljoen, former chief of staff of the South African Defense Force, who heads a right-wing party called the Freedom Front. During the transitional period General Viljoen had ties with Afrikaners who seemed ready to use force to try to block political change. Mandela went to him and said, "General, you may defeat us now, but if you take the road of violence, some day you and your people will be destroyed." General Viljoen dissociated himself from violence and took the Freedom Front into the new political system. When he asked the President to extend the time for amnesty applications to the truth commission last year, it was done.
In his character and his place in his country's history, Mandela brings to mind George Washington. Of course they are worlds apart, in time and culture. But Washington's biographers, too, describe him as a man of strong emotions who suppressed them in the interest of creating a nation. His disciplined leadership held the quarreling colonies together in war and kept such strong-minded political antagonists as Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton together in his Cabinet.
"There is in the life of a country but one such person; we are just lucky that he came along at this time." That was said to me of Mandela by his lawyer, George Bizos. It sounds like the standard appraisal of Washington. The face that Washington presented to the world was not Mandela's disarming smile but an austere formality. But the two seem similar in the controlled personalities that made them the irreplaceable fathers of their countries.
The question emerging in South Africa is whether the Great Reconciler is also a great President. In Washington's day there was world enough and time. In Mandela's, South Africans, like everyone else, have to compete pell-mell in a world economy. A fast-growing population suffers from unemployment that may be as high as 40 percent, a grotesquely unequal distribution of wealth, appalling crime. Voices are beginning to be heard complaining about Mandela's record on those and other problems.
"The young are fed up," a prominent black figure told me, "with 400,000 coming on the job market every year and few jobs. They think this old man has been too much of a moderate, too reconciliatory, too compromising." Kaizer Nyatsumba, political editor of The Star in Johannesburg, wrote a tough column last fall after Mandela denounced some black journalists. "His unquestionable greatness notwithstanding," Nyatsumba said, "Mandela is an ordinary man with feet of clay."
If one ranks the challenges facing South Africa by what is on people's minds, crime is the most serious. Across lines of race and class, it is the subject of conversation. Carjacking is a terrifying example. Drivers are jumped as they get into their cars outside their homes or stop at a red light, ordered out at gunpoint, sometimes killed. The president of the Constitutional Court, Arthur Chaskalson, and his wife were held up outside their home. It happened to another judge while I was in Johannesburg last month. "The main problem in the country is criminal violence," said Winston Floquet, the chief executive of Fleming Martin Securities. His brother-in-law was shot dead outside his home, and two people in Floquet's office were attacked recently. One of them immediately left for Australia. White emigration has increased, and Floquet said Australians are vigorously recruiting South African financial professionals.
When I asked President Mandela about crime, he began by saying, "We don't want to be complaining about what happened under the apartheid regime -- we have now been in power for more than two and one half years, and it is our responsibility to solve problems as we find them." But it is a reality, he said, that in the apartheid years the police concentrated "not on detecting crime but on suppressing political activity." Others of varying political views made the same point to me. Not only did the white police devote most of their effort to putting down dissent; they also encouraged black policemen in Soweto to make deals with criminal syndicates that let the criminals operate in return for their help in the job of suppression. So corruption was and is a major problem. The President said his Government had arrested more police on corruption charges in its brief life than previous Governments had in the 45 years of apartheid: 400 police in the Johannesburg area alone.
The apartheid system did create conditions for crime: oppressive racial discrimination, deliberate denial of decent education to blacks, miserable housing and economic policies that left millions jobless. But the President was right that the responsibility is his Government's now, and its performance so far has to be judged a failure. In his address at the opening of Parliament in Cape Town last month he said, "Let me warn the criminals -- the carjackers, the rapists -- we will make their lives difficult." Perhaps new policies will take hold, but the police are still undermanned and under-reformed.
Housing is a signal disappointment in the Government's record. The need is overwhelming, as even a casual visitor who looks around will understand. On the way to town from the Cape Town Airport you pass Crossroads, a squatter community that became famous 20 years ago, when the apartheid Government bulldozed it, not just once but repeatedly. But the squatter problem persisted, as thousands of blacks fled the desolate "homelands" to which they were confined under apartheid. It is still not over. From time to time, residents of Crossroads are resettled, but new thousands move in and build their shacks. And not just in Crossroads. Around the country homeless families occupy land -- often land on which the Government plans to build houses. It is a serious enough problem that President Mandela, in his speech at the opening of Parliament last month, condemned the illegal "occupation of land."
The A.N.C. promised in the 1994 election campaign to build a million new homes in five years; so far, according to the Department of Housing, 123,000 have been built or are under construction. On the plus side, millions of people have been provided clean water and electricity for the first time. Mandela estimated that 1,700,000 more would get water this year: a remarkable accomplishment. The Government has also tackled, through the Land Claims Court and legislation, the daunting problem of restoring rights to people who lost their land to whites in the apartheid years.
The contrast between Cape Town, which may be the most beautiful city in the world, and nearby Crossroads symbolizes a fundamental truth about South Africa. It is both a first- and a third-world country, with some people, most of them whites, living in a luxury scarcely matched anywhere else, and others barely surviving. The society's gross disparities in wealth remain essentially untouched, a time bomb for possible future social turmoil. When I asked Mandela about that, he said: "We must not overestimate the speed with which a democratic government can bring about change in the thinking of the community or the structure of the economy. We are determined not to be deflected from the aim of assuring that there's a proper distribution. But we must not be unrealistic. We want to bring about change without any dislocation to the economy." He added that a start had been made on equalizing wages and on what is called black economic empowerment, black ownership of major companies. A striking example of the latter is the move by Cyril Ramaphosa, who was the A.N.C.'s chief constitutional negotiator, from politician to capitalist as the head of a large industrial group.
Mandela's caution about "dislocation to the economy" reflects a big change in his thinking and that of his colleagues, a growing concern about killing the golden goose in pursuit of equality. The A.N.C.'s 1955 Freedom Charter called for nationalization in some areas of the economy, and that was still in the air in 1990. The word is not heard today. When I spoke with the President, one of the first statements he volunteered was, "Private sector development remains the motive force of growth and development."
Leaders of business say they are content with the Government. Bobby Godsell, a high executive in the giant Anglo-American Corporation, said he was "robustly optimistic." His reason was that "at long last the fundamental diseases of the economy are being tackled." From the mid-1970's on, the apartheid Government ran very high budget deficits. The effect, Godsell said, was "to depress saving and investment, which undermined our capacity to acquire new technology, to be globally competitive." Helen Suzman, one of the sharpest critics around, said: "You cannot undo 45 years of misgovernance in so short a time. In that light they've done amazingly well."
Inflation was down last year from double digits to 7 percent, the lowest figure in 25 years. But the value of the South African rand fell 25 percent, though it recovered some of that loss in the opening months of 1997. Government corporations built up in the apartheid years -- owners of airlines, the railroad system, telecommunications and other big companies -- are being wholly or partly privatized. Annual economic growth is about 3 percent, not enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate.
The question is what the orthodox economic policy being followed by the Government will do to meet the expectations of the poor majority of blacks, and how soon. Mandela was careful not to raise expectations high in the 1994 election campaign. And South Africans have always been patient -- astonishingly so by American standards. Will that patience continue? Deputy President Mbeki has said that it will if people can see some improvement, however modest: a fresh water tap, a halt to the eviction of rural tenants. The Government aims to raise the economic growth rate to 6 percent. But that will take lots of foreign investment, which has not flooded in so far, and an increase in worker skills.
"The worst legacy of apartheid is the lack of education," Winston Floquet said. "People say South Africa is going to be another tiger economy, like the ones in Asia. But you can't get there from such a low skills base. It will haunt us for at least another decade."
Segregated schools and grossly disproportionate spending on white students played a key part in creating the separate worlds that the philosophers of apartheid wanted. But that is changing rapidly, as large numbers of black children enroll in the once all-white public schools in the suburbs of Johannesburg. "It is one of the most successful pieces of racial integration that I know about in the world," Bobby Godsell said. "It is one area in which the two worlds have begun to overlap."
But around the country most black childreon still get a sadly inadequate education. And critics say the Government is leveling down rather than up. It set a national standard of 1 teacher to 40 pupils and then forced thousands of teachers in Western Cape Province to move or retire because the ratio there was only 1 to 25 or 30. (Almost all retired.)
Beyond these specific areas of doubt about the Mandela Government's performance, there is criticism from all quarters about the way it governs. The complaint is that the President is too autocratic, too loyal to failed Cabinet ministers who go into a defensive crouch when their mistakes are exposed. Dr. Mamphela Ramphele, vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town, who is close to Mandela, said, "The more insecure people are, the less open they are to constructive criticism. He's not insecure, but his Government is."
Some of Mandela's old A.N.C. colleagues have been successes in office, others surely not, a prime example being the Foreign Minister, Alfred Nzo, who is virtually invisible. The Minister of Health, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, spent the equivalent of $4 million on a theatrical production that was supposed to tour the country advising people on how to avoid AIDS. The President did nothing when that misspending came to light, and nothing when the same minister later announced that scientists at Pretoria University had found a cure for AIDS -- without submitting the claim to normal scrutiny. (The country's AIDS problem is frightening. Nearly a fifth of the women who go to prenatal clinics in the Johannesburg area are HIV-positive.)
Mandela has rejected all calls for changes in the Cabinet. He made a joke of it when he spoke to Parliament last month. After delivering his written text for an hour, he put the manuscript aside, took off his glasses and ad libbed that he had rejected all the reasons advanced for reshuffling his Cabinet, but he had looked over during his speech and seen several members asleep -- "A good reason to drop them," he said. But then, he added, he had noticed the same thing among opposition M.P.'s, "so in equity I won't reshuffle the cabinet."
There are questions, too, about the way President Mandela has anointed Thabo Mbeki as his successor. At least some in the A.N.C. would have preferred an open contest between him and Cyril Ramaphosa for the party leadership when Mandela gives it up at the end of this year, with the presidency following almost inevitably. Mandela is sensitive on the subject, insisting that he has not forced the choice but that it will be made democratically by the A.N.C. He told me that he had agreed to Ramaphosa's wish to go into private business only after once turning him down. And he said he continues to speak frequently with Ramaphosa: "I am not going to allow him to escape from political duties. Cyril Ramaphosa is a son to me." Opinions differ on whether Ramaphosa will some day again seek public office. He would do so from an interesting new position: wealth.
Finally, among the felt doubts about Mandela as President, there is a concern that he has carried his emphasis on unity too far, to the point of dampening the criticism that characterizes democracy. He recently invited the Pan-Africanist Congress to join the Government -- and the Democratic Party, heir to Helen Suzman's Progressives, which has modest white liberal support. The Democrats' leader, Tony Leon, has been a vigorous critic, saying recently that President Mandela has too often "sacrificed accountability to loyalty." Suzman snorted at the idea of his joining the Government. She said she had told the President that "that would emasculate Tony Leon." (After considering the invitation for weeks, Leon declined the invitation.)
Those are the main criticisms of Nelson Mandela as President. To me, they are overshadowed -- overwhelmed -- by his achievements in the last three years. He has taken a country utterly divided by race and made it one where people of different races actually share a vision: where "the two worlds have begun to overlap," as Bobby Godsell of Anglo-American put it. He has transformed the political system without creating unrealistic expectations in the newly enfranchised. He has taken a country where fear was everywhere and made it free. He has given a society marked by official murder a culture of human rights.
I find South Africans today less resentful, less guilty, less prickly about race than many Americans. The submissiveness of some blacks is fading along with white lordliness. Young black lawyers call senior white colleagues by their first names: a social revolution.
But it is the acceptance of a human rights culture that struck me most powerfully on this visit. Law used to be an instrument of oppression. It dictated where you could live, whom you could marry, what you could read. The masters of that system rejected all demands for legal protection of individual rights, and many feared that when change came the new masters would be as unrelenting toward the old. But Mandela the lawyer, together with Cyril Ramaphosa and Arthur Chaskalson and George Bizos and other lawyers, carried out a revolution by law and in law.
A written Constitution and Bill of Rights as protective as America's now defends South Africans against official abuse. President Mandela told me with pride how the new Constitutional Court, where Chaskalson now presides, had overturned as unconstitutional his proclamation of elections in the Western Cape: "Arthur Chaskalson defended me when I was sent to Robben Island for 27 years. But when it came to the question whether I was entitled to issue those proclamations, he felt I had no right. And he overrode me. And within an hour of his ruling I came out and made a public statement to say this is the highest tribunal in constitutional matters, they handled a complicated case with great skill, and I called upon members of the A.N.C. and the public to respect the decision. I had to do so. It was a fitting opportunity for us to assert the independence of the structures we have put up to show that the bill of rights is a living document."
Neville Alexander, Mandela's Marxist fellow prisoner, said: "I don't think his South Africa is going to do much for the people in economic and social terms. But the crucial point of agreement is on a human rights culture."
For me, South Africa remains the most moving, the most exhilarating of countries: a land of possibility. Nelson Mandela made it that, made it a country whose people feel like proud citizens rather than pariahs. And that is not just a product of the transitional years after 1990. It could all have been lost when it came time to form and run a government. Whatever the faults of the Mandela Government -- and the critics have a case -- the transformation of South Africa into a free and rights-oriented society has been secured. The critics, most of them, recognize that. Richard Steyn, former editor of The Star, said: "Mandela is so intent on reconciliation that governing takes second place. We need some tough decisions. But just think where we were!"
There is an autocratic element in Mandela. He is both an autocrat and a democrat, an old colleague said. But he has an unyielding respect for human beings, and for law. What other leader of a liberation movement has subjected himself to legal limits when he won power: Castro? Mao? Arafat?
What, then, is the source of Nelson Mandela's leadership? The friends I have quoted mentioned his discipline, his mastery of symbols, his single-minded purpose, his magnanimity, his patience, his realism, his sense of power. Helen Suzman spoke of the way he establishes personal contact: "When I stuck my hand through the bars of his cell in 1967, it was almost an instant rapport."
Patrick (Terror) Lekota is a younger man who met Mandela on Robben Island and became an A.N.C. supporter there. He has just been made chairman of the new upper house of Parliament, the National Council of Provinces. When I asked him, he listed these qualities: "First of all, consistency. I cannot think of a day when he seemed to flag in his commitment to the struggle for freedom or even for better prison conditions. His stamina, to pursue an issue right to the end. There's a certain deliberateness. If you are deliberate in taking the risks of a certain course of action, then nothing can shock you because you've already come to terms with the possibility. And he is at peace with himself."
Nadine Gordimer said: "It's his total lack of personal self-protection and vanity. And an honesty of what he feels and thinks -- for me, that's what makes him absolutely unique." No vanity, I said, but isn't there pride? "Not pride," Ms. Gordimer said: "Self-respect. You're entitled to that when you know who you are and what you stand for."
Yes, Mandela knows who he is. Magnanimity came easily to him because he regarded himself as superior to his persecutors. There is an inner confidence in him as great as any I have sensed. And a moral quality: It is hard to imagine him doing a mean act.
But if those are some of the qualities that account for his ability to lead, where do they come from? His childhood in a chief's family cannot explain it, I said to George Bizos; hundreds and thousands have come from such a background, and the same with prison. What was it that made Mandela what he is? Bizos said, "I don't know that you'll ever find an answer."
Toward the end of the interview, I asked the President how he would like to be remembered. I mentioned Jefferson's tombstone, which by his choice says nothing of his having been President. Laughing, Mandela said, "Well, that would be very egotistic of me, to say how I would like to be remembered. I'd leave that entirely to South Africans." But he said that he had "reached the stage of planning my death." Then, in a soft voice, he added, "I would just like a simple stone on which is written, 'Mandela.' "
 
The Heir Apparent
 
Thabo Mbeki, Deputy President and Mandela's almost certain successor as party leader and President, is 54. He was in exile during the years of Mandela's imprisonment, acting as the African National Congress's top diplomat and as such developing friendships with officials and journalists around the world.
He has his critics. They say he can be edgy, seeming to lack Mandela's inner core of security. There are also admirers, by no means all in the A.N.C. Several business and financial leaders told me they find him well informed and sensible. Fikile Bam, a judge who was a prisoner with Mandela on Robben Island, said he thought Mbeki had the same natural courtesy as Mandela. "He's good at economic issues and foreign policy," Bam added, "and he might be able to handle the problem of the wealth gap better; by training he's an economist." Mbeki is already the Government's hands-on leader. Mandela leaves the details to him.
I asked Mbeki what kind of South Africa he saw 10 years from now. He replied, in part, as follows.
"This country today continues to be characterized in good part by the old racial divisions -- whether you talk about the economy, skills, housing. . . . Ten years down the road I think you will see a South Africa that is much, much, much less segregated.
"Secondly, you will see a much better educated South Africa. I'm talking about levels of literacy, numeracy, but also about access to knowledge: a South Africa that will not be as ignorant of the rest of the world as it is today. Some of us who spent quite a bit of time in exile can see the gaps in knowledge. There is tremendous enthusiasm to be educated.
"It's a fortunate circumstance that the possibility of lifting people out of ignorance, reintegrating them in the world of knowledge, occurs at the time of the information revolution. We'll get on the information superhighway much quicker than the developed countries could. For one thing, we don't have the huge communications infrastructure that New York or Los Angeles does. There's nothing to dig up. Our telecommunications infrastructure will be built at today's level of technology. That will have a rapid uplifting impact.
"The other big question is poverty, which is huge and expressed in numberless ways, whether it is unemployment, homelessness, landlessness. We ought to have a South Africa 10 years from now that has done something very meaningful about that." A.L.

The Road to Nowhere
 The Genesis of President Clinton's
 Plan for Health Security.
 By Jacob S. Hacker.
 239 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
 Princeton University Press. $39.95. 
 It may be true, as the old adage has it, that success has a hundred fathers and failure is an orphan. Still, the colossal failure of President Clinton's 1993 bid to fix the health care system sure has fathered a lot of books.
One of the latest is "The Road to Nowhere," by Jacob S. Hacker, a former health policy fellow at Harvard University who is now a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Yale. Fortunately, Mr. Hacker's is not another rehash of the infamous effort but rather a sort of prequel. It asks how health care reform got to be the nation's No. 1 issue in the first place.
In his answer, Mr. Hacker brings commendable clarity to a subject that has usually encouraged jargon and convolution (though he still relies too much, I think, on acronyms and academic-speak). He begins with the trends that made reform necessary. In the 1970's and 80's, rising medical costs led insurers to charge higher premiums and to refuse to cover sicker Americans, forcing many people to go uninsured. In addition, the proliferation of health maintenance organizations, which contained costs at the expense of service, worried not only patients but also doctors, who saw their autonomy, not to mention their standard of living, threatened.
Liberals, who had long clamored for reform, pressed their favorite plans: Under the elegantly simple "single payer" design, the Government would insure everyone through tax receipts. Under the slightly more complex "play or pay" scheme, companies that didn't cover their workers would have to help finance coverage of the uninsured.
But a small group of policy analysts, immersed in a culture that exalted the free market and viewed Government bureaucracy warily, turned toward another solution, known as "managed competition." This more cumbersome scheme for change would place every American in one of many pools, each of which would buy coverage for its members. The competition to win the pools' business, the theory goes, would drive down costs and regulation would be kept to a minimum.
In 1990, fearing a groundswell of support for Government intervention, the leading proponents of managed competition, who regularly met at Jackson Hole, Wyo., invited in heavies from the insurance and health care industries. Though Mr. Hacker rejects what he calls the "conspiracy" view of the proceedings, he notes that "all recognized that their interests were on the line" and that, for reasons of both ideological predilection and self-interest, all fell in behind a concerted push for managed competition.
Then, in 1991, the upset victory of Harris Wofford, the Democrat in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, over Dick Thornburgh, the United States Attorney General and former Governor of the state, which was built on health care reform, vaulted the issue to the top of the political agenda. Meanwhile, Michael M. Weinstein, an economist and editorial writer at The New York Times, who was researching the different reform options, became enamored of managed competition. He vigorously championed the Jackson Hole Group's agenda on The Times's editorial page, giving the little-known idea major-league attention.
Managed competition became one of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign planks. The promise of wholesale reform meshed with Mr. Clinton's vision of an activist, empathetic Government and highlighted George Bush's diffidence on middle-class issues. And the specific choice of the managed competition plan yoked together liberals like the sociologist Paul Starr, an informal campaign adviser, and conservatives like Jim Cooper, Representative from Tennessee, who would later help kill the Clinton plan by espousing a more conservative solution. Because the President's compromise seemed liberal to liberals and centrist to centrists, Mr. Hacker writes, he "would appear to be throwing his support behind both wings of the Democratic Party." In other words, classic Clinton.
Mr. Hacker then turns to the familiar story of the drafting of Mr. Clinton's plan and the failed campaign to pass it. I researched these events when assisting Bob Woodward with "The Agenda" (1994), and I found Mr. Hacker's account to be solid and informed, if short on the vivid anecdotes that gave the episode its singularly surreal character. But Mr. Hacker justifiably keeps this part of the story brief because, in his astute interpretation, the die was already cast.
The plan's undoing, Mr. Hacker contends, lay not in the Administration's poor salesmanship. Nor can it be found in the erroneous claim that Bill Clinton tacked leftward after his election (he ran on a middle-of-the-road managed competition plank and that's precisely what he sought to implement). Nor should we scapegoat Ira Magaziner, the adviser whose absurdly huge operation to draft a plan enlisted hundreds of people subdivided into narrowly focused working groups, meeting endlessly in wayward sessions.
Rather, Mr. Hacker argues, "the real problem was not that Clinton tracked left, but that there was not a significant constituency for the compromise approach he supported." Liberal Democrats with power in Congress remained committed to other plans, while more natural conservative allies held little influence. Far more than the insurance industry's "Harry and Louise" ads, this shortsightedness doomed the plan.
Mr. Hacker concludes with a chapter of analysis that to my mind is totally superfluous. Like his decision to organize the book thematically instead of chronologically, which often undercuts his story's narrative power, this belief that an extra 30 pages of political science terms will illuminate his ideas about how political agendas are set is mistaken. The ideas, whether Mr. Hacker realizes it or not, come through crystal clear in the body of his book. Analysis that's organically embedded in a well-told tale almost always works better than analysis that's added on explicitly to develop theories and models.
Still, Mr. Hacker's account, while not whitewashing the President's blunders, usefully reminds us that he was operating under tight constraints. In so doing, "The Road to Nowhere" should help relieve Bill Clinton of shouldering the whole burden of the debacle, which remains, not altogether fairly, the darkest blot on the record of his first term.

 BULLY
 Does Anyone Deserve to Die?
 A True Story of High School Revenge.
 By Jim Schutze.
 Morrow, $23. 
 The other teen-agers in Bobby Kent's crowd just wanted to continue the paradisaic existence of unlimited sun, surf, sex, drugs and alcohol their parents had worked so hard to make possible in the privileged suburbs outside Fort Lauderdale, Fla. They might be dropouts, occasional prostitutes, hustlers, thieves and drug dealers, but they still were considered good kids from churchgoing families. And unless Bobby forced them during one of his steroid-induced rages, they didn't make a sport of torturing retarded people or harassing homosexuals. But Bobby Kent was spoiling their fun, so in July 1993, seven of his friends savagely murdered him. For the three young women and four young men, the only problem was that they got caught. Three received life sentences; Bobby's best friend got the death penalty. In "Bully," Jim Schutze, the Dallas bureau chief for The Houston Chronicle, has written a deeply disturbing book, an indictment of suburban values and of an aimless, violent middle-class youth culture that is depraved because it is morally -- not economically -- deprived.

HEADLINE: $500 WEEKENDS;
Since 1811, a Cozy Vermont Inn

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO; JOSEPH SIANO is assistant to the travel editor of The Times.

 BODY:
WE know enough not to ask too much of $500 nowadays. A weekend away would be a lot more than a half-grand if that sum could get my wife, Marsha, and me through a weekend in a cozy southern Vermont inn and feed us a few meals worth remembering; some well-stoked fireplaces and snowy landscapes would take care of the rest.
Near the end of our Friday night drive last month from Darien, Conn., to the 1811 House in Manchester, Vt., however, I could tell that the white had been washed out of the landscape by the rain and unseasonably warm temperatures that had produced the pesky little fogbanks teasing our headlights on Route 7A. Still, Jeremy and Pat David had a fire going at the 1811 House when we arrived. 
 The couple are former owners of the inn, which has taken in guests fairly constantly since its conversion from a farmhouse in 1811. The only interruption came early in this century, when President Lincoln's granddaughter, Mary Lincoln Isham, made it her home for almost two decades. Considering what some Lincoln Bedrooms go for nowadays, ours was a bargain. And this house had two resident cats (Heath and Heather), not just one.
 The Davids were filling in for the current owners, Bruce and Marnie Duff, who were on vacation. Jeremy, a friendly Welshman, gave us a quick tour, the most telling highlight of which was the guest snoozing contentedly in front of the television in the book-lined living room. He seemed as natural a part of the decor as the antique writing desk, where the decanters of light and dark sherries sat.
Jeremy took our bags up to the Burr Room, $160 a night with a full breakfast ($347 total for the weekend, with tax). It was one of eight in the 14-room, two-story Federal style house that did not have its own fireplace. But we decided we'd rather save $40 a night and join our fellow guests (and there were plenty of them since the inn was full) in whichever of the four public rooms -- the two sitting rooms, living room or pub -- had a fire going.
Our room was part of what used to be the barn attached to the original farmhouse, built in the 1770's and now on the National Register of Historic Places. It had a four-poster bed with a crocheted canopy and antique bed tables with attractive Chinese ceramic lamps. Antique plates and a mix of prints adorned the walls, and an Oriental rug (well worn along the edges) covered the broad-plank floor. An antique dresser and two blue upholstered chairs filled the room, but didn't clutter it.
The bathroom was undistinguished, and the wallpaper in one corner of the bedroom was coming loose. Otherwise, the creaky floors and low ceiling -- crossed by the original rough-hewn beams of the barn -- were part of the idiosyncracies one would expect in this old house. Over all, the inn was a good mix of homey and formal.
There was still a little time that night to explore the inn's antiquarian pub, particularly its list of 49 single-malt scotches, while Marsha unpacked upstairs. Time, temperance and our budget limited me to one shot ($5), served in a Irish crystal snifter, but more amenable surroundings couldn't be conjured up by Robert Burns. The pub's ceiling is hung with pewter mugs and the walls adorned with all manner of old prints, sabers and memorabilia, with a leaning to the Scottish, a reflection of the Duffs' ancestry.
It felt so chummy that Saturday morning, Marsha and I had breakfast in the pub, rather than at one of the communal tables in the more formally furnished dining room. Our full English breakfast, starting with a bowl of fresh citrus-fruit chunks, was served on pretty china, accompanied by silver creamery. A small scone, bacon, potatoes, mushrooms came with two eggs cooked to order.
We could see the grand Equinox Hotel across the street, a proper old New Englander with its angular array of white columns and green shutters. When we told Pat David we were thinking of dining across the street at the Reluctant Panther that night, she quickly called the restaurant to make our reservation.
Outside, with much of their snow cover and foliage gone, the Taconic range to the west and the Green Mountains to the east looked stubbly and unkempt. But with temperatures in the low 60's, it was good browsing weather.
And Manchester is a browsers' town -- although the upper section, Manchester Village, is more a typical old New England town, with wide lawns separating the sidewalks from the main street, which is lined with large trees and stately white homes.
Down the hill from Manchester Village, along Route 7A, were a string of outlet stores in cluttered, commercialized Manchester Center, including such solid Yankee peddlers as Liz Claiborne, Giorgio Armani and Tommy Hilfiger. Marsha found some discounts at the Lancome outlet, and the Orvis catalogue store had some decent looking preppy-outdoor wear for as much as 70 percent off in its basement. But we soon developed an urge to see something Vermont-made besides maple syrup. Lunch would be a good place to start.
A few miles up the road on Route 30, in the quiet little center of Dorset, was the 200-year-old Dorset Inn. As warm as it was, we were happy to sit in the sunny, glass-enclosed room off the main dining area. Marsha's Welsh rarebit -- chunks of apple on top of an English muffin, covered with Vermont cheddar mixed with Amstel ale -- was a skillful balance of tastes and textures. Eggplant crepes -- two roulades of the vegetable wrapping a mixture of ricotta and chopped spinach, with a delicate homemade tomato sauce and melted buffalo mozzarella on top -- could have turned me into a vegetarian. "In winter, we do more or less comfort food, like pot roast and sauerbraten," said Sissy Hicks, the chef and inn's co-owner. "In summer, I have farms all over here sending us fresh produce." We left feeling especially comforted after sharing a serving of her bread pudding, floating in a pool of whisky sauce. With tip and two drinks, a splendid lunch came to $28.
Our waitress had recommended the Slate Valley Museum, about 15 minutes to the northwest in Granville, N.Y. Slate and marble (there's an abandoned marble quarry on the road into Dorset) are major raw materials found here. As victims of a leaky roof back home, slate sounded like an amenable subject to us. Besides a restored 1939 W.P.A. mural showing quarry workers and a moody collection of black-and-white photos, the museum -- in a restored mid-19th century New World Dutch barn -- is notable for quaint oddities, like a birdhouse with a 300-piece slate roof. For $2 a head, the time and detour were worth it.
On the way back, a small roadside sign pointed toward R. Gasperetti, furniture makers, in tiny Danby village. There, inside a simple frame house that had a two-floor showroom and an attached workshop, Robert Gasperetti greeted us with a sawdust-flecked smile. The small rooms were filled with the solid-looking, Shaker and Craftsman style furniture Mr. Gasperetti and his two assistants produce. The ambiance in his shop is as warm as the veneers on the curly maple, butternut, oak and walnut. "As a former teacher, I tend to talk a lot," Mr. Gasperetti said as he showed us around his workshop, demonstrating how slices of wood from the same tree are matched up to keep grains consistent. "And we get a lot of people who are just hobbyist woodworkers."
By now, we were heading back to the 1811 House to get ready for dinner at the Reluctant Panther, a restaurant and inn done up in lavender paint. Despite the paint scheme, we had chosen it because it offered a sophisticated sitting and food that promised to match, and our hosts at the 1811 House seemed to support our choice. The mood inside, fortunately, was much subtler than outside. We felt as if we were being ushered into a quiet parlor as the waitress hung up our coats and showed us to our table next to a large marble fireplace. Soft lighting and botanical prints on the walls, combined with quiet efficient service, made for a soothing evening.
Our meal had some disappointing moments, starting with the bread, which was little more than half baked at first delivery. Marsha's raclette appetizer consisted of a dollar-bill-sized slab of melted Swiss cheese accompanied by pickles, two pearl onions and a few potato chunks. I had a trio of smoked fish -- shrimp, trout and salmon -- that played off the subtle textural differences in the three, with a mild barbecue cream.
Sesame-crusted baked scrod and quail were fine but unremarkable. We spent just over $99, with a bottle of wine, tip and drinks. And although the atmosphere made up for any shortcomings in the food, we skipped dessert in the interest of economy.
We were going to try to catch the 8 P.M. curtain at the Dorset Playhouse, where a local cast was presenting "Isn't It Romantic" for $10 a ticket, but we decided instead to take the Reluctant Panther up on its suggestion to enjoy a leisurely postdinner drink beside the fire in a parlor.
Budgetarily speaking, it was a smart choice. After totaling our expenditures back at the 1811 House, we found that with a day to go, we had spent $483, leaving barely enough for lunch before we headed home.
Actually, if we each had taken up the 1811's offer of two eggs Benedict apiece the next morning, we might not have needed any lunch. But one perfectly poached egg -- nestled on an English muffin, a slice of country ham and a satiny layer of Hollandaise -- seemed enough, especially after the baked pear with maple-syrup laced sour cream.
The weather was now more Vermont-like: cold and windy. A light overnight snow had left a frosting on the landscape. But on the way back south on Route 7A toward our eventual final destination before home -- the Bennington Museum in Bennington, Vt. -- we still felt that in our search for snow-blanketed landscapes, the bed had been short-sheeted.
Along the way, we found some worthwhile places to poke our wind-reddened noses. A few miles off Route 7A in East Arlington, the East Arlington Antiques Center had 70 dealers crammed into what looked like the mother of all attics. And the Chocolate Barn sold chocolates, hand-dipped nearby using Swiss chocolate, for $10.95 a pound.
But it wasn't until we pulled into Shaftsbury, Vt., that we found the snowy horizon we sought -- peaceful wintertime New England villages as far as the eye could see.
Of course, the whole landscape was only about a foot high. It was all inside Quiet Horizons, a roadside shop that sells just about every one of those little ceramic collectible houses that pop up each holiday season. Jerrie Whitlock, the manager, was presiding over a few hundred square feet of tiny villages like some Brobdingnagian governess. She offered us coffee and made it clear we could spend as long as we liked ogling her miniature realm, where she could even make it snow on demand from a little mechanical cloud that worked like a salt shaker. If we closed our eyes, we could hear a tiny Jimmy Stewart in a little Bedford Falls. A fireplace blazed in the store.
Meanwhile, my ruminations about where to have lunch with our remaining funds became pointless: our car picked Quiet Horizons as the place to die quietly.
Mrs. Whitlock graciously allowed us to use her mail-order phone line, and we eventually found Rob Wyman. Moved perhaps by my wife's wailing in the background, he promised to be out with his tow truck in short order on a Sunday afternoon.
He towed us back to his service station in Arlington, where our only lunch choice was a "family style" place where Marsha sent back her odd-smelling burger.
On the way back to the garage, we passed a former church that now contained a gallery of Norman Rockwell prints. The artist had lived in Arlington for several years, and used its residents as models. Marsha and I could imagine the tall, angular Mr. Wyman in a Rockwell print of his own, reassuring two nervous travelers that their car would carry them home -- as he handed them a bill with only $15 in labor charges!
One problem: He had to bang on our car's dilapidated starter to get the engine to fire, so we couldn't turn off the engine any time before we got home. That meant no Bennington Museum, with its large collection of Grandma Moses paintings, 19th-century glass and pottery and 18th- and 19th-century American furniture.
But we had this to console us on our nonstop four-hour drive home: We had found an honest mechanic who does cheap work on Sunday -- albeit a long way off. I know some people who'd pay $500 just to see a museum piece like that.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: James H. Maloney;
Agenda for a Self-Proclaimed Centrist

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
JUST a few weeks before last November's national elections, polls had former State Senator James H. Maloney, a Democrat of Danbury, trailing the three-term Republican incumbent Gary Franks by 10 to 15 percentage points in the race for Connecticut's fifth congressional district.
But Mr. Maloney, a 48-year-old lawyer who had in 1994 unsuccessfully tried to unseat Mr. Franks in a district that includes Waterbury, Danbury and Meriden, pulled off a big upset -- defeating the incumbent by a margin of 53-to-47 percent. 
 It was a bitter campaign in which Mr. Maloney used aggressive television advertisements portraying Mr. Franks as an absentee congressman who spent more time promoting his autobiography than working on the best interests of his more than half million constituents.
Mr. Maloney had been elected to the State Senate in 1986 and represented Danbury, Bethel and New Fairfield for eight years. During his tenure there, he was chairman of the Finance Committee, engineered a $216 million phased property tax cut, and helped to secure $30 million in state funding for the construction of the Waterbury mall -- which will open in the fall.
Mr. Maloney, sworn in Jan. 7, holds two major committee assignments: Banking and Financial Services and the Committee on National Security.
In his Waterbury office, Mr. Maloney recently spoke about his upset election victory and the challenges he confronts. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Is support for right-wing conservatism eroding and the pendulum swinging back the other way?
A. Yes. But not so much swinging back the other way as swinging toward the middle. I almost won the first time I ran against Mr. Franks in 1994. I think we won this election because of a combination of reasons, including the fact that my opponent ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of Connecticut. He just never addressed the issues, or his record.
Q. Mr. Franks said you won by running a vicious smear campaign against him. How would you respond?
A. It's just sour grapes. Every charge we made can be documented. We had proof that there were rats the size of prairie dogs in piles of garbage on property owned and rented out by Mr. Franks. The job of a challenger is to hold an incumbent accountable for his actions.
We held him accountable on having the worst environmental record of any member in Congress from Connecticut, and one of the worst in New England. The commercial Mr. Franks didn't like also held him accountable for his position on Medicare/Medicaid. He attempted to say during the campaign that he didn't vote to cut Medicare/Medicaid, which he did.
Q. As a Democrat representing what has become known as one of the more conservative Republican districts of the state, how will your political leanings impact the way you represent your constituents?
A. Actually, I view myself as a centrist, and I think this has now become very much a centrist district. In fact, I think I won the election, in large part, because the incumbent was so far out to the right. This district is now very much moderate, which I think makes me a very good fit.
Q. You insist you're not a liberal, but you brought Colorado Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder, a self-proclaimed liberal, to Connecticut to campaign for you. Why?
A. I think that is part of what being a centrist is all about. There are some people I will agree with on some issues, and not on others. Pat Schroeder has been one of the leading proponents of family leave, and I was chairman of the Labor Committee when the Family Leave Bill was passed here. We were the first state in the country to pass the bill.
I asked Pat Schroeder to campaign here on that issue, particularly because that drew a pretty clear contrast to Mr. Franks, who was the only member of the Connecticut delegation to vote against that legislation at the Federal level.
Q. Saying you are a moderate or a centrist is one thing. But which issues can you point to and say on that issue you took a even conservative stance?
A. I was strongly opposed to the Connecticut state income tax that was put forth by former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. I thought it was the wrong tax, levied on the wrong people and at the wrong time. It is my understanding that I am the only Democrat in the Federal delegation who has indicated support for the balanced budget amendment.
Q. "Baloney Maloney" is a label your opponents, including Governor Rowland, have coined to describe what they say is your obsession with minor, pork barrel type issues. Is this a fair label? Do you plan to continue the same style in Congress?
A. You bet. I think that is actually a very good label, if by it they're trying to say that I fight very hard for my constituents. I believe this district needs someone who is going to stand up for their concerns -- property tax reform, economic development -- no matter how minor others think those concerns are.
Q. You once held up passage of the state budget for what your opponents called petty issues. How would you respond?
A. The year I held up the state budget I did so because there were economic development issues that I felt needed to be part of the package. And I ultimately prevailed.
We made several things happen, not the least of which is the Waterbury Mall that will create a total of 4,000 jobs, on and off site -- the largest economic development project in Waterbury since before the Second World War. Also, we got property tax relief on automobiles, which will begin in 1998.
Q. When you were in the State Senate you were always a member of the majority party. Now, as part of Congress, the Democrats are the minority party. How do you believe that will impact your effectiveness?
A. The person I replaced was a member of the majority party and never passed a single piece of legislation in his own name. I don't believe that partisanship has to ultimately be a barrier. But there's no denying that with a Democratic President and majority Republican Congress the dynamics are complicated. I think the biggest challenge for me, though, is going from a body in the State Senate of 36 people to a body of 435. I have to get to know 400 other people and then develop relationships with them.
Q. What do you believe will be the ultimate result of the much talked about 1994 Contract with America?
A. One of the interesting things is that when the Republicans attempted to use their majority to pursue an extreme agenda, it hurt them and was counterproductive. I think they understand that the election of '96 was a message to move to the center, just as I think it's fair to say the election of '94 provided the same message to the Democrats. That's why I believe that it is those of us who are in the center who will have a major impact on the agenda and the productivity of Congress.
Q. What impact do you believe the ethics question raised recently concerning Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich will have on the House's current session?
A. The Congress got off to a positive start regarding the need to cooperate on a bipartisan basis, particularly among newcomers in both the Republican and Democratic parties. The Gingrich proceedings substantially set that back and put the Congress in a polar controversy -- Democrats versus Republicans. The best news of late is that most of the Gingrich proceedings are now behind us, and I am hopeful we can now recapture some of the initial spirit of the Congress.
Q. It has been suggested that the Fifth Congressional District has two very distinct halves, divided between Fairfield and New Haven Counties. How will you juggle their different concerns?
A. Northern Fairfield County has concerns about environmental protection and education, particularly higher education, and northern New Haven County is much more concerned about economic development.
But whether you live in Wilton, which is one of the wealthiest towns in the world, or in an economically challenged community in the Naugatuck Valley, you care very deeply about education. In Wilton they may want to be sure we preserve higher education student loan programs, while in the valley they may want to make sure the vocational educational programs remain strong.
Q. The extreme economic differences among your constituents could gain even more attention now that the State Legislature is considering proposals to integrate and regionalize schools in connection with the Sheff v. O'Neill case. Busing has been mentioned as a possibility. How do you see that playing out?
A. I don't know. But I do know most of my constituents would agree on opposition to busing. Whether it's inner city families, or suburban families, busing is something they don't want. It breaks down the sense of community, the neighborhood.
Q. Are there any issues that bind the two political and economic groups?
A. There are plenty of issues, such as education and protecting the environment, that most of my constituents would agree on.

HEADLINE: The View From: Essex;
They Call It the Best Little Town in America

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN the annual New England Governors Conference was held in Connecticut a few months ago, Gov. John G. Rowland was able to do something that no other Governor could -- offer the best small town in America for the two-day event.
Essex, a Colonial seaport town of 5,900 about a half hour's drive from New Haven and New London on the west bank of the Connecticut River, is the only Connecticut town mentioned in Norman Crampton's second edition of "The 100 Best Small Towns in America" (Simon & Schuster, Macmillan Company, 1995). 
 It is also, says Mr. Crampton, not only at the top of the list, but a far better place to live than any other small town in the country. "Quite frankly Essex is way, way out in front compared to any other small town; it's just off the charts," he said. The rating is based on eight criteria for towns with populations of 5,000 to 15,000 including age (a population mixture inclusive of a stable older group and children to guide the future), crime rate (the lower the better), per capita income (high) , community involvement (pervasive is ideal) and educational quality.
Now come the tourists, to visit the 220-year-old Griswold Inn, said to be the oldest continuously operating inn in America, and a main street filled with antiques stores, novelty shops and refurbished Colonial houses.
The town's zoning laws are designed to preserve the wide array of housing styles and setbacks, winding roads and lanes and there's even a "street tree ordinance" that encourages shady walks and driveways.
"We get a lot of curious people who used to pass right by the town stopping in to see why we were named the best," said First Selectman Peter Webster.
Mr. Crampton, whose own town of Greencastle, Ind., placed 80th on the list, said that Essex "has a storybook-like quality -- kind of like a Norman Rockwell painting." It is "the Hollywood of small towns," evoking the picturesque locales portrayed in 1940's and 50's movies, and "a wonderful place to live."
But wonderful for whom? Like a Norman Rockwell painting, and like all the other towns on the select list, Essex is lacking in at least one key area that has become synonymous with progressive minded thinking during the 1990's: ethnic and racial diversity. "I found very, very little non-white representation in just about every small town across the country," Mr. Crampton said, "and that's not a judgment or political viewpoint to be debated; it's just a fact. Whether we like it or not, small towns just do not attract people of color." (According to the 1990 United States census, there are 59 black and 19 Puerto Rican residents of Essex.)
Mr. Webster said the homogeneity was more a matter of choice and economics than of exclusion.
"Of course we don't keep anyone out of Essex who wants to live there," said the First Selectman, a Democrat who moved to the town a decade ago from Old Saybrook.
Per capita income in Essex is $26,590, compared to the state average of $20,198, and median family income is $47,426, also well above state and national figures. Just 2.2 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
"We're not close to an urban center, and the fact is that housing in the entire Connecticut River Valley region is not inexpensive," said Mr. Webster.
Despite Mr. Crampton's assertion that Essex is full of affordable homes in the $150,000 range, the census data backs up Mr. Webster. It indicates the average home in Essex costs well over $200,000, with lower prices concentrated in the blue-collar Ivorytown section (which includes the Ivoryton Playhouse).
Mr. Crampton points to Essex's kindergarten through sixth grade elementary school, where 500 pupils prepare for regional middle and high schools. "One of the things we're most proud of is that our school board is completely apolitical, so we don't have the kind of political controversies and fighting involving education that many other towns have," said W. Campbell Hudson, chairman of the school board and a lawyer who has lived in Essex for 20 years.
The town spends about $8,200 a year for each student, ranking it 26th among the state's 169 towns, but Mr. Hudson said the quality of education in Essex really is a reflection of a high degree of parental and community involvement.
The elementary school's principal, Karen Bailey, who resides about 20 miles away in Salem, says "Essex is an absolutely wonderful place for families to bring up their children." Ms. Bailey said that to make up for the lack of racial and ethnic diversity, the school is taking part in programs with schools in Hartford, Middletown and New Britain.
"It is important for the children to have a more global perspective and by interacting with pupils from city schools, that's one way of doing it," she said.
Many of the people who live in Essex say they weren't surprised by its selection as the best small town in the nation.
"I grew up here and always felt it was the best," said 42-year-old Doug Paul, an owner of the Griswold Inn. "When I was away at college, all I could think about was coming back home -- and staying home."
Jerome Cutone, 79, a life-long resident of Essex, said "We're just a small, quiet close-knit New England town . . . and if a town had to be chosen as the best, I guess it might as well have been Essex."
In the American-as-apple-pie category, residents talk proudly about the town's eight annual parades -- including a Ground Hog Day parade that drew more than 2,000 people last month.
They even have an annual "burning of the ships parade" on the second Saturday in May to commemorate the torching of 28 ships by a British raiding party during the War of 1812. It was later called the nation's worst disaster, with a $160,000 loss, during the two-year war. During last year's parade, Mr. Webster stood at the edge of the river and told the hundreds who had gathered: "People ask us why we commemorate the burning of the ships this way every year . . . and I tell them because in Essex we just look for any excuse to hold a good old fashioned parade." The town historian, Don Malcarne, a life-long resident, said that "You can literally leave the door to your home unlocked here."
But he is quick to point out that things were not always so. Essex, he said, was a downtrodden, poverty-ridden mess for more than a century. It was not until the 1940's that wealthy out-of-towners decided that the decaying seaside Colonial buildings could be transformed into a town of quaint and historic elegance -- and did so.
Mr. Malcarne doesn't deny that the town's residents now have a somewhat elitist attitude -- more so in Essex Village than in the town's other villages of Ivoryton and Centerbrook.
"Let's not kid ourselves, Essex is not representative of the average population," said Mr. Malcarne. "Is it snobbish? Yes, it does have a kind of elite attitude about it. But that kind of goes with the territory. I think the people are basically a lot like the New England region we represent -- sturdy, proud and neighborly . . . but not all that demonstrative."

A Hip-Swaying State-Sponsored Export

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
IT'S 4 IN THE MORNING AT WHAT MAY BE THE best dance hall in the world, Havana's La Tropical, and the singer Issac Delgado, the king of Cuban cool, is crooning in front of 10,000 people. Manolin, el Medico de la Salsa, the most popular singer in Havana right now, comes out to join him, and the audience goes beyond euphoria, seeing two heroes on the stage together.
Everyone dances; everyone sings the chorus of the song, and the place seems as if it's going to levitate with the joy of the Cuban soul. And all this joy comes after four nights and five days of nonstop music called El Son Mas Largo del Mundo (The Longest Son in the World), a Cuban Woodstock that was part of the Government's first annual music-trade exposition this month. 
 The weeklong exposition, the Feria del Disco Cubano (the Cuban Record Fair), which ended on March 12, brought to light the changing relations between the the Cuban Government and capitalism and the rapid international growth of the Cuban music industry. The Government used this trade show to promote Cuba's music as both a cultural ambassador to the world and a way to earn badly needed American dollars -- dollars kept from the country, in part, by the United States embargo. Last year, 3,500 of Cuba's roughly 11,600 state-sponsored musicians performed abroad, raising what label executives say could run into the millions though there are no figures available from the Government. News organizations and impresarios from all over the world came to sample what the Government was selling.
Beyond the trade exposition, the Cuban Government has already begun taking cautious steps in entrepreneurship. It has signed a deal with Magic Music, a Spanish record company that specializes in Cuban music, to release "La Isla de la Musica," a 41-CD set of selections by virtually unknown Cuban musicians. The Government is also inviting multinational companies to set up booths at next year's exposition. And it has given permission to Eduardo Bautista, president of Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, the Spanish version of ASCAP, based in Madrid, to set up an office here.
"That they've let us set up an office can be read in all sorts of ways," Mr. Bautista said. "But the most important is that it shows what's happening to the system here, that the Government is opening up more and more to the outside."
The exposition also provided a showcase for the Government-run music education program that has contributed to the level of excellence displayed by the dance bands, choral groups, classical ensembles, rap groups and folkloric ensembles that performed during the weeklong event.
"If you're a musician anywhere in Cuba, from an early age, you can go to music school," said Alicia Perea, a classical pianist who is also president of the Instituto Cubano de la Musica, which oversees the entire Cuban music industry. "We don't teach them just to play notes. They have to study philosophy, and literature and history along with several instruments.
"El Tosco, the leader of the group NG la Banda, is the perfect example," she continued. "I've played Bach with him -- he plays flute -- and he's an exceptional jazz musician, and he leads perhaps the hardest dance band in Cuba."
The free national music schools were started in 1962, after the Cuban revolution, and they were devoted exclusively to training musicians in the European classical tradition. But in the late 70's and the early 80's, the curriculum was expanded to include jazz and Cuban music. The musical excellence that has flowered over the last 10 years is a result of these schools.
The world, except for the United States, is catching on. Magic Music's growth is doubling yearly, and one of its artists, Lucretia, who now lives in Spain, has been snapped up by MCA, the multinational label. Another small label specializing in Cuban music, Caribe Records, which is owned by a Spaniard but based in Panama, is reportedly poised to be bought by a large multinational record company.
"The thing that I'm worried about is that this invasion of foreign interest will fundamentally change the Cuban experiment, its idiosyncrasies," said Francis Cabezas, the president of Magic Music. "For all its problems, the Government here has supported the music in an extraordinary way, and while there may be problems, the system has created the future."
That system involves total Government regulation. Musicians are Government employees. A lesser-known band that finds work in a local club, for example, must go to the Government to be paid. Bands with larger followings perform where the Government tells them to. When bands perform abroad, the Government extracts up to 50 percent of their earnings in the form of a newly imposed tax.
Musicians also complain about the system for other reasons. El Tosco says he is overwhelmed by the amount of work NG la Banda gets. "It's like being in a prison of popular music," he said. "I have to play it to support my three children. I'd rather be playing serious music."
The drummer Jose Sanchez says that although he plays for the popular singer Rojitas, his earnings do not cover his living expenses. Like many Cuban musicians, Mr. Sanchez moonlights to earn American dollars, the only currency with real power in the country. "I teach students," he said. "I charge them dollars. Even Rojitas doesn't make much more than we do. When we go to Europe we make more, but not that much."
Ms. Perea, head of the music institute, is sympathetic toward their plight. "Socialism isn't there to deny riches," she said. "It's there to distribute the riches fairly. The problem is that we Cubans are very, very bad at making riches. Our distribution system is incompetent. We don't know how to market. But we're learning. We have to because, for example, we don't make basic things in Cuba like violin strings or music paper, which means we have to pay dollars for them."
Whatever the complaints of performers, for audiences the system works. At the outdoor night club La Tropical, for instance, which attracts no tourists, there's little distinction between audiences and musicians. Women regularly jump on stage to show off their steps, and singers improvise about the woman in the white dress in the front row or a fight breaking out in the back. In a country of profound material deprivation, where items from CD's to aspirins are virtually unknown to the average person, all the things that are free -- language, movement, sensuality -- become mythologically powerful. The bands, steeped in European, African and American sensibilities, are some of the best dance groups in the world.
In Cuba, even dance music, which has replaced the more folky Nueva Trova style that was popular during the 60's and 70's, is politicized. "Intellectuals think that salsa is the product of capitalism and is bad," Mr. Cabezas, the record label head, said. "Those opposed to the Government think that salsa is a product of Communism and is bad. But the truth of the matter is that salsa is a product of the people, who want to hear it and dance to it and live by it. Street music used to be marginalized, but it's not anymore."
At the exposition itself, which was held at the Pabellon Cuba, representatives of Cuban and foreign record companies vied for business at 10 stands. The air was pungent with rum and cigarette smoke, and on three stages bands from rural areas, rap bands, folk singers, salsa bands and choral groups performed from noon until the wee hours.
Back at La Tropical, the bands played dreamlike sets, and dancers challenged one another in the sweet, sometimes hard, language of the hips. Singers chanted about the streets and about the country, sometimes in code, sometimes not. The rhythm drove it all, and the music's intelligence and pleasure were indisputable.
And all over town, musicians, business people and Government officials talked about America and the relationship between the United States and Cuba. American flags were in evidence on many people's clothes, and among musicians around town and backstage at La Tropical there was a sense that America was the next frontier. Music, it was hoped, would help end the blockade, and there are signs that it has already begun to happen. Cuban music is making its way into the United States, like smoke curling under a door.
For Juan Formell, the leader of Los Van Van, one of the great Cuban groups that recently toured the United States, an end to the embargo could mean more work. "They loved us in the United States," he said. "I already don't have enough time to write and relax, so if the blockade vanishes, I'm in trouble."

HEADLINE: For an Australian Wunderkind, the Glitter of Hollywood

BYLINE: By BRUCE NEWMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
AT THE END OF "The Destiny of Nathalie X" William Boyd's scathing short story about Hollywood -- a character who has tried to corrupt a young African director consoles him by saying: "It's just a dance. It's just a dance we have to do." To the amazement of the hard-bitten Hollywood character, the young director just laughs. The point of the story is that he still can.
Seated on a bench at the Griffith Park Observatory here, Emma-Kate Croghan, the 25-year-old Australian director of the antic comedy "Love and Other Catastrophes," laughed, too. 
 A year ago, she was living on welfare in Melbourne. Now, her no-budget film about the entangled lives of a group of students at Melbourne University will play at the New Directors/New Films series on Wednesday and open in theaters on Friday -- this, after making a successful tour of the three most important film festivals: Cannes, Toronto and Sundance.
Ms. Croghan, who has skin the color of parchment, was this day looking down on Hollywood, literally. And she was contemplating what the town had in store for her. Hollywood, it should be noted, has already accepted into its negligible ranks of women directors two other Australians -- Jocelyn Moorhouse, whose forthcoming film is "A Thousand Acres," and Gillian Armstrong, who made "Little Women." Ms. Croghan may be poised to join their ranks.
Bob Aaronson, who, as vice president for acquisitions of Fox Searchlight, sees more than 200 movies by young film makers each year, thinks that despite her youth and inexperience Ms. Croghan has a big future as a director. "A lot of new film makers tend to work in familiar genres, and sometimes tend to fall prey to derivativeness," he said. "Emma-Kate's work has a kind of exuberant, loose-limbed quality to it that is completely ingenuous. There's an intimacy to it that seems very real and true, and that's rare."
Ms. Croghan came here after Sundance, to this place where people move and shake -- and dance -- to take meetings with studio executives who, she says, are "like teen-age boys." This very day she met with Bill Mechanic, the chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment; nine months ago at Cannes, Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, gave her a tour of the French Riviera in his limo.
It has been a fast transition for Ms. Croghan from her start in the film business just two years ago, when she set out to make her semi-autobiographical screwball comedy. She had read that the old Hollywood screwball comedies were written and shot at breakneck speed. So she wrote the script for "Love and Other Catastrophes" with two friends in two weeks. Then she and her boyfriend of five years, Stavros Andonis Efthymiou, shot her $37,000 film in 17 days.
"Love and Other Catastrophes" hurtles along at a kinetic pace as it portrays students trying to pay library fines, find roommates or switch classes -- all the while looking for love, of course. Several times, Ms. Croghan had no idea where her team would get the money to buy film stock to shoot the following day, and they were constantly trolling for backers.
"We were desperate," she recalled. "I think people could see the madness in our eyes and the sheer velocity of the energy we had."
That velocity carried Ms. Croghan and the film's lead actresses -- Alice Garner, who had known Ms. Croghan at film school in Melbourne, Frances O'Conner and Radha Mitchell -- to a kind of screwball comedy of their own at Cannes, where they periodically dived under tables to escape the small army of Hollywood agents and lawyers that were stalking them.
"That was the first time that we met Hollywood," Ms. Croghan said. "Or Hollywood met us. I was just so freaked out by the whole experience that I wasn't ready to talk to anybody."
To get out of Australia, she had already been obliged to talk her way past a government bureaucrat. She had lost a clerical job that had been paying the rent and, while wading through the often interminable financing process for Australian films, had gone on welfare.
"I was on the dole before I went to Cannes, totally unemployable," she said. "And I had to go in and explain how I was able to leave the country, that this was just a little hobby film that had been picked up by somebody who was paying my way to Cannes. The priceless look on that man's face."
Ms. Croghan gazed wistfully across the hills at the Hollywood sign. "And two days later, I was sitting on a yacht with Al Pacino."
The cast of "Love and Other Catastrophes" got its first taste of the international press last May at Cannes. "We were all waiting for the three questions that we had already answered a million times," Ms. Croghan said, "and this man from Czech television says" -- here she switches to a rumbling Slavic voice -- " 'How much for your soul?'
"Well, we all just looked at each other, and he asked again, 'How much will you sell your soul to Hollywood for?' "
That, of course, is the question that hangs over every young film maker. Ms. Croghan knows she will be answering it in the choices she makes over the next few years. Back at Cannes, she replied meekly that she hadn't yet been required to sell out.
"Nobody goes into it to sell their soul," she said now. "The truth is, people give it up for free."
When Fox Searchlight bought the worldwide distribution rights to "Love and Other Catastrophes" for $800,000 just a week before the Cannes festival, Ms. Croghan checked to see if her soul was leaving her body.
"You always think big bad Hollywood is going to take your film away," she said. "So my first question was, 'Do they have another film that's the same, and they want to stop ours from coming out?' "
HER EDUCATION IN American film making continued earlier this year at Sundance. There she met a young director from Los Angeles who was distributing posters for a film he had not yet actually made.
"It wasn't until I was in Sundance, and I saw all those people schlepping around desperately trying to get people to go to screenings, and unable to finish their films that I realized how lucky we'd been," she said. "In Australia, film making has always been about making the film, but people from L.A., even young film makers, are obsessed with the deal."
Making deals was not of interest to Ms. Croghan. Growing up in Melbourne on what she described as a commune, she was taken to see Truffaut's "400 Blows" when she was 5 or 6. (Someone read the subtitles to her.) After high school, she attended Australia's top film school, the Swinburne Institute of Technology, where she was one of only a handful of teen-agers admitted.
"She was pretty sophisticated, even then," said Jenny Sabine, dean of the school, which is now called the Victorian College of Art, in Melbourne. "I remember turning to someone after her interview and saying, 'Hasn't she made a mature presentation for someone so young.' " Ms. Croghan made two award-winning shorts, "Sexy Girls, Sexy Appliances" and "Desire" before she was 20.
With the increasing attention being conferred upon "Love and Other Catastrophes" -- it has already grossed $1.2 million in Australia, where it opened last summer -- Ms. Croghan hopes she can work within the Hollywood system without being consumed by it. For now she is waiting and does not yet have a new project.
Although she appears to be inside the velvet rope of the big dance, she can still laugh at Hollywood. At the Sundance festival, which she attended with her cast, she encountered one overheated Hollywood type being denied entrance to the party for "Love and Other Catastrophes." In a fury, the man ordered the film's publicist never to call him again. "Lose! My! Number!" he screamed.
"So now every time we see each other in a hotel lobby," Ms. Croghan said, "we start yelling 'Lose! My! Number!' "
Lose her number. But you may want to remember her name.

Housing Market Shows Slow, Steady Improvement

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WHEN their third child was born Ernest and JoAnne Zappitelli knew they needed to sell their 1,600-square-foot bilevel in Ringwood and buy a larger home for their growing family. But they delayed the move for three years, waiting for a stronger housing market.
That time came last January. After five months of house hunting the couple sold their smaller home in two weeks, getting their asking price of the low $190,000's, and bought a 2,400-square-foot center-hall colonial in the mid $300,000 range on one acre in Franklin Lakes. 
 "With interest rates good and houses selling more quickly we felt we could get the price we needed from our old house and upgrade to a bigger one," said Mrs. Zappitelli, whose husband moves heavy equipment from one job to another for a construction company. "We just felt it was the right time and for us, having just turned 40, it was now or never."
The Zappitellis forged ahead at a time when the state's housing market is healthy, but not spectacular. "There is a strong demand for and an adequate supply of homes," bringing the market "back to normalcy," said Bruce Zipf, president of the New York region for Coldwell Banker, a large brokerage in Short Hills.
After a flat 1995 the market rebounded in 1996, riding a wave of slow but steady improvement that so far has spilled over into 1997 said Michael Ford, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. The spurt was helped by stable, moderate mortgage interest rates and an improving economy and job picture, which nudged up the state's median household income by about $3,000 to $58,850 at the end of 1996.
The belief that the worst of the corporate downsizing is over also helped. One surprise, analysts, brokers and developers agreed, was that the impact of AT&T's breakup into three companies on the residential market, as in the office sector, was less harsh than expected.
As for the new-home market, the problem is supply, not demand, said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association in Plainsboro. Zoning and regulatory constraints remain hurdles to developing new housing and the situation shows no sign of easing, he said.
As 1997 progresses, many industry experts are betting more buyers will react like the Zapitellis did and buy. That sets the stage for an active, albeit not a booming, home-buying season through the spring and summer, they said. Unless there is a break in the pattern, the consensus is that 1997 should wind up on par with 1996.
"There are no wild cards on the horizon," said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president at HSH Associates, a Butler firm that tracks mortgage activity. Interest rates should hover near 8 percent through year's end, he said.
Job growth is also expected to remain steady in the state, which added 60,000 net new jobs in 1996, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "The modesty of the state's recovery, now in its 60th month, has contributed to its longevity," he said, adding a prediction for a recession-free 1997.
There is a general air of caution in the stable housing climate, said Neils Guldbjerg, vice president at the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick. Buyers remain cautious; owners have trimmed their expectations of price appreciation and builders are more flexible in meeting buyer preferences to close sales, he and others said.
On average existing homes are selling for 90 to 97 percent of their asking price and staying on the market for three to three and a half months, brokers say. The supply of resale homes in some areas does not meet demand, underscoring a lack of urgency in the market, some brokers said. Talk in Washington of lowering the capital gains tax also may have discouraged some owners from selling.
THE active markets were, and will be, communities that offer good schools and hold their appreciation and those in growth corridors, said David J. Schoner, vice president of the metropolitan New York region for the New Homes division of Coldwell Banker.
Among them are towns 20 miles west of the Interstate 287 corridor in Morris, Somerset and Monmouth and Middlesex Counties where corporate expansions are occurring, he said.
Sales of existing homes increased by 6.8 percent to 147,800 at the end of 1996. That is the best level reached this decade, and one not seen since 1987 when 158,400 homes were sold, according to the state's realtors association. The rise pushed up the median year-end sales price by 3.8 percent to $148,000.
The improvement was reflected in varying degrees in all three regions of the state. In northern New Jersey sales rose by 2,800 to 58,400 and the median sales price rose to $197,300 from $188,100; in central Jersey sales increased by 3,600 to 49,500 and the price increased to $145,900 from $140,200. Sales also rose by 3,100 to 40,000 in south Jersey, where the median price inched up to $109,200 from $106,700.
About 32 percent of the sales were for $100,000 to $160,000 homes, showing that first-time buyers remain in the market. But 26 percent were for $200,000 to $400,000 houses, indicating that trade-up buyers have increasingly entered the scene. Many are baby boomers with children who will be a marketing focus this year, added Dean Hughes.
Peter Mosca, spokesman for the state's realtors, said the active spring and summer season his association foresees should help the resale market remain strong and measure up in the first half of the year to its 1996 pace, when nearly 75,000 existing homes were sold. But the pace may slow by the fourth quarter, he said, noting that year-end sales could wind up the same as this year or 2 to 5 percent lower.
Many brokers said sales so far this year had been strong. Weichert Realtors, the state's largest broker, said 500 more contracts for new and resale homes had been signed through the first week of this month than the 3,200 signed in the same time last year. "There are more buyers than inventory," said Paul R. Christman, a senior vice president at the Morris Plains-based company. "But March is a big listing month and as the market heats up more sales will be made."
New homes, for the most part, are also geared to the higher-end market, with an average price of $250,000. But with homes priced at $150,000 to $175,000 most in demand "there's a mismatch between what builders can build and what people can afford," said Mr. O'Keefe of the builders' group.
The state ended 1996 issuing 24,647 permits, up from 23,408 in 1995. Half of the homes are targeted for six counties -- Ocean, Middlesex, Morris, Burlington, Monmouth and Somerset. "What we see is the peak level of production and it will trail down from here for the rest of the decade," said Mr. O'Keefe. Added John G. Udell, president of Weichert New Homes & Land: "That spells upward pressure on land and in turn on new home prices."
Still, developers say new homes are selling and that they are moving ahead with projects. "So far this year our sales are even with those of last year," said Wayne Patterson, senior vice president at Toll Brothers in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., among the larger developers in the state. "But given the generally strong New Jersey market, and as we open projects, we expect sales to increase by 20 percent over last year when 519 contracts were closed." He said Toll expected to begin projects this year that will ultimately have 900 homes, most costing $300,000 or more.
And K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest builder, reports that the just under 800 sales made so far this year is slightly up from last year. It is also expecting year-end sales to be higher, rising from 2,364 to just under 2,500, said Gabriel M. Pasquale, senior marketing adviser for the company's northeast region.
He said 15 percent of those homes will be for the active adult market as the company follows baby boomers. He said the company also would focus on homes for trade-up buyers as well as continue to build entry-level town houses and one-family homes.
The sense of optimism is not limited to builders. Mrs. Zappitelli said she and her husband felt that buying today garnered them more house for their money. "Whatever we put into this house," she added, "we will get back, plus more."

Housing Starts Dip, Prices Rise as Fairfield Prospers

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS are calling the climate in Connecticut mostly sunshine with some light showers. Housing starts were down by about 7 percent in 1996, compared with 1995, but employment inched up nearly 2 percent since 1990. Moreover, housing prices have been rising in a brisk market driven by a mild winter.
Residential real estate conditions vary, with lower Fairfield County prospering in tandem with Wall Street, New London County profiting from the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun gambling casinos and from submarine contracts for Electric Boat. But the central and northern areas remaining stagnant. 
 While the 7,714 housing starts statewide in 1996 were below the 8,307 in 1995 -- and represent a startling drop from 28,000 starts in 1986 -- rentals and sales of both existing and new homes are lively. John M. Clapp, professor of real estate at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, said, "I think people are responding positively to moderate interest rates and job growth."
One phenomenon worth noting is the widening of suburbia. Because of an acute shortage of land in lower Fairfield County and its ever-escalating cost of housing the borders of what had been considered a reasonable commutation range from New York City have been expanded. They now stretch from Milford on the New Haven County shore, through Orange, Shelton and Newtown in northeastern Fairfield County and into New Milford in Litchfield County.
It is possible to find well-designed homes up to 2,900 square feet for $269,990 at Lexington Green in Milford, one of the most active building locations in the state.
"Young marrieds who can't afford to live near their jobs in Stamford, White Plains and New York are our primary buyers," said Larry Blum, director of sales for the 261-lot subdivision. "We are five minutes from the Metro-North station, and an hour and 20 minutes from Grand Central."
"We're seeing people move here because it's the most affordable area in Fairfield County," said Kim Danziger, a builder in Newtown and Brookfield who has 2,800-square-foot homes for sale in the mid-$300,000 range.
Toll Brothers, a nationwide builder based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., will open Huntington Estates in Shelton next month, with homes up to 3,300 square feet selling from the low to mid-$300,000's. One hundred Toll Brothers homes in the Town of Fairfield and 24 in Newtown range in size from 2,200 to 4,200 square feet and in price from $300,000 to $550,000.
But such activity is limited geographically. Will McEachern, a University of Connecticut at Storrs economics professor who is editor of The Connecticut Economy, a university quarterly, had this overview:
"It's clear we have a recovering economy and a housing market that never did recover because we had enough overbuilding in the 80's to last another decade."
And Edward Deak, economics professor at Fairfield University, had this to add:
"The Hartford housing market will remain slow until the whole insurance and banking evolution is concluded. We won't see a strong revival in the Connecticut housing industry until the 21st century."
But talk to any real estate broker, banker, or builder in Fairfield County about a downturn in housing, and the response will be: "What downturn?"
"As soon as a new house comes on the market it sells," said Laurie Crouse, a Preferred Properties broker in Westport. "A lot of what is happening is that a property comes up for sale and a builder will buy it, tear down the house and build a new one on the same lot."
ONE builder didn't even have to demolish the old house, she recalled. He let the fire department burn it down in a practice exercise.
"What we have in new construction goes quickly, before it's completed," said Charlotte Felt, office manager at the Kelly Associates real estate agency in Darien. "Builders are buying houses, tearing them down and building on speculation."
A three-acre farm in the exclusive Tokeneke section of Darien was bought by Sean Shay, a local builder who turned the farmhouse into a guest cottage and built an 8,000 square-foot French country manor, tennis court and swimming pool on the property, soon to be marketed for more than $3 million.
For much of the Gold Coast market, brokers say, house sales of a million dollars have become common, although there are houses available from $200,000 fixer-uppers to multimillion-dollar mansions in most Fairfield County towns.
"Last February we had 727 homes on the market in Westport and Weston," said Ms. Crouse of Preferred Properties, "with a median price of $475,000. This year we had 444 houses in February and a median of $549,950. We sold 82 houses so far this year and have 38 under contract."
"Inventories are trending down and prices have firmed up," agreed Peter Helie, president of William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford. "Our unit sales are up 13 percent this year over the same period last year. The high end is moving, the middle market is the thinnest in terms of inventory because it's where the most demand is."
"We've been looking at the Milford market," said Terence Beatty, vice president of new home sales at Pitt. "It can absorb 60 homes a year in one neighborhood. In Seymour and Derby bigger neighborhoods can absorb 100 homes a year."
Builders, he noticed, are raising prices as they build and sell, charging more for lots 4 through 8 than lots 1 through 3, and still more for lots 9 through 12, and so on.
Assessing conditions around the state, Gerald R. Kunde, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, said:
"We'll see more development creeping into New Haven County if prices continue to go up in Fairfield. In New London, investors are buying up homes and renting them to people who work at the casinos, but we haven't seen any increase in home values."
A LOT of people in northeastern Connecticut," he continued, "are commuting up Route 395 to Waltham, Mass., where there is a huge upturn in technology jobs, and agents in Waterbury say they are having the best year ever."
He said he would like to see a cut in capital gains taxes on the sale of homes "because it would encourage activity in the real estate market."
"People accept the fact that they are going to pay something, but they would certainly like more money in their pockets," he observed. "On the investment side you find a much greater response. The amount of tax is the same, but investors can't defer payment when buying a more expensive property, or take an elderly exemption the way a homeowner can, so he has less to reinvest."
"People are not going to worry about a drop in capital gains," said Mr. McKeever, the accounting firm executive, assuming that it will be a small drop at best. "If they are elderly they may stay put because it's all going to be taxed in their estates. So why pay capital gains as well inheritance taxes?"
Real estate brokers as well find the issue of little concern to sellers; nor does Todd Martin, a first vice president at People's Bank in Bridgeport, see sellers holding back. What he does see is a window in interest rates.
"It's a coin toss whether the Fed will tighten monetary policy before May," he said, "and any change will be minor. We are looking for the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage to go down to 7 or 7.25 percent this summer from a current 7.5 percent, and adjustables to decline to 6.25 percent, with plenty of credit available."

Home Buyers Out in Force in a Humming Market

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
WHEN the Quartos put their four-bedroom Cape Cod in New Hyde Park on the market in January for $249,000, they were not unduly worried about selling it. Their target date for moving to St. Augustine, Fla., was June.
"The house is in a good neighborhood, and it's in good condition," said Joseph Quarto, who worked as a customer-service representative for a bank and is now retired. "And a lot of people are out looking." 
 But he and his wife, Carol, were not quite prepared to find a buyer so quickly. A few days after listing their home with Atanas Realty in Williston Park they had an open house and their first offer of $235,000.
Two days later they received a second offer -- this one for $232,500. They accepted the second because it came from a young couple pre-approved for a mortgage. The closing will be in early June.
Brokers report that, following a strong 1996, buyers have been out in force in the first two months of 1997 -- usually a quiet period in the real estate market -- and that this bodes well for another strong year. Even co-ops, which many buyers at one time shunned, are once again in demand, said June Shapiro, a Great Neck broker.
The Quartos' experience of getting more than one offer is no longer unusual and in some cases the final offer is higher than the asking price.
A four-bedroom colonial in Glen Cove that was recently listed for $359,000 by the Coldwell Banker Sammis agency in Locust Valley went for $360,000 -- and had a purchaser within one weekend, said Sandi Lefkowitz, the office manager. "It has to do with confidence in the economy and the fact that interest rates are still good," said John Juliano, a broker with Prudential Long Island Realty in East Meadow.
The Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which has more than 1,350 member agencies in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens, sold 17,204 homes in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in 1996, compared with 15,607 in 1995. The number of listings over the same period fell from 58,145 to 55,970.
"We still have a lot of inventory, but it's stuff that's been around for a while," said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive officer of the Long Island Board of Realtors and its Multiple Listing Service. "It's the newly listed and realistically priced houses that are getting attention and that buyers have to move quickly on."
Nevertheless, house prices in Suffolk and Nassau have remained stable, Mr. Mottola noted. "We had more sales last year, but not a corresponding increase in price," he said.
Most of the price appreciation occurred in Suffolk. For example, the median price of a house in Suffolk that closed in January 1997 was $135,000 compared to $131,000 in January 1996. In Nassau, the median dipped slightly from $176,800 in January 1996 to $176,000 last January.
William Davis, owner of the Long Island Profiles Publishing Company in Babylon, said he expected prices to move "slowly upward" at an annual appreciation of 5 percent. The research firm, which gathers data from deeds filed with county clerks, and thus covers the entire spectrum of property, counted 41,394 closings in Nassau and Suffolk in 1996 -- up about 7 percent over transactions that closed in 1995.
In some real estate offices the concern is no longer a lack of buyers so much as a lack of new listings. "I have qualified, serious buyers, but I don't have enough houses to show them," said Evelyn Atanas, the owner of Atanas Realty, the agency that represented the Quatros. Its listings are primarily in Williston Park, East Williston Albertson and Mineola.
Mrs. Atanas said that this time last year she had 30 listings in those three areas, while this year she has about 15 houses to show. Among her potential buyers are Christopher Guglielmo, a New York City fireman, and his wife, Julia, a police officer. The Guglielmos are currently renting an apartment in Williston Park and want to stay in the community, but they are finding that choices are limited.
W E'VE been looking for a year, but it's hard to find something to our taste, and I find prices are high," Mr. Guglielmo said. Recent offers he made on two houses were rejected, he added, because owners held out for a higher price.
Other brokers say they are also experiencing a shortage of listings. "We usually have to put on our rollerskates to go out and inspect 14 to 16 new listings at this time of the year," said Patricia McCormick, a broker with the Douglas Elliman-Van Riper real estate agency in Manhasset.
"This year it's more likely to be four new listings and two re-inspects," she added, referring to houses that for one reason or another were withdrawn from the market and are being relisted.
Bob Ceilly, a broker with the Eric G. Ramsay Jr., real estate agency in Bay Shore, attributed the reduction in inventory to a spurt in sales.
Inventory is down, Mr. Ceilly said, because sellers who have had their houses on the market over an extended period of time decided to come down to a more realistic figure and were able to sell. "As a result, the stock has been depleted," he said.
But shortages appear to be occurring only in select areas.
David Lurie, owner of Lurie Realty in Great Neck, for example, said he had more buyers, but also plenty of houses to show.
Ray Manzoni, owner of the ERA Manzoni agency in Mount Sinai, also noted that he had a "good supply" of houses and a "good balance" between people who were looking and serious sellers.
Wall Street profits are strengthening sales in the Hamptons. "It's a good healthy marketplace right now," said Jack Hangen, owner of Agawam Realty in Southampton and president of the Eastern Suffolk Chapter of the Long Island Board of Realtors.
"Prices are moving up 5 to 8 percent over last year, but they're not spiking up," he said.
Interviews with sellers and buyers indicate that worries over difficulties in selling a house or, from a buyer's perspective, that house values might still go down, are largely over.
"We knew Jericho is in great demand because of the location and because of the schools," said Rosa Taranto, who with her husband, Joseph, recently signed a contract to sell their four-bedroom colonial in Jericho. He is a plant manager in New Jersey, she works as an executive secretary in Manhattan. They are moving to Paramus to be closer to Mr. Taranto's job.
They listed the house with ERA Gatewood in Syosset and had an offer within a week, Mrs. Taranto said. They paid $380,000 for their Jericho house in 1994. Their asking price was $429,000 and they accepted an offer for $410,000.
Schools remain an important factor in attracting buyers from New York City. Valery Shubov, a commercial property manager, and his wife, Valentina, will be closing this June on a three-bedroom ranch in Jericho, moving there from Brooklyn.
They are paying $275,000 for the house, which they found through the ERA Gatewood agency. "My decision was driven by the reputation of the school district," Mr. Shubov said.
Debra and James Murphy, who are first-time buyers, closed on a colonial in Miller Place on Feb. 26, paying $150,000 for the three-bedroom house with a pool on half an acre. They had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in Farmingdale for five years, paying $800 a month.
They decided it was time to buy a house "for tax reasons" and because interest rates are still relatively low "and may go up," said Mrs. Murphy, who works as a customer-service representative for a musical instrument company. Her husband is a New York City fireman.
Linda Albo, owner of the ERA Albo Agency in Rocky Point, the real estate agency that negotiated the sale, said that sales in her area -- Mount Sinai to Wading River -- had been active because of the good mortgage products available for first-time buyers. With rents in short supply and very high "people have come to the conclusion they might as well buy," she said.
A year ago, the average time on market for a house in her area was 100 days. Now it is down to 74 days, she said.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
New Stores Raise Northern Boulevard's Profile

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
SHOPPING-CENTER developers love to fly. When they fly over central Queens and Brooklyn, they perceive in an instant what a research firm will later confirm in a study: In relation to the density of population, there is a shortage of the large modern supermarkets and big stores that shoppers find in the suburbs.
A push is on to correct this situation, even in the face of New York City's unusually restrictive zoning system and local resistance to the City Planning Commission's recent efforts to make more retail development "as of right" on land zoned for manufacturing. 
 Along Northern Boulevard in Queens that push is succeeding, most strikingly of late on a stretch that runs through Long Island City and Woodside, just north of Sunnyside. Large tracts of underutilized land with obsolete industrial buildings have given way to new retail uses, normally with a special permit from the City Planning Commission. The land is zoned for light manufacturing.
Major redevelopment began six years ago with a shopping center that features Pergament and Toys "R" Us stores. Since then a new Pathmark has arrived, OfficeMax has become the anchor of a strip shopping center, and Sports Authority, Staples and Tops Appliances have opened free-standing stores.
Now the most ambitious project of all, The Shops at Northern Boulevard, is in construction. It is a $40 million project, with a building of 220,000 gross square feet of space on a ground floor and second level, plus roof parking for 630 cars. It will house a 63,000-square-foot Edwards supermarket, a 34,000-square-foot Marshalls clothing store, an 18,000-square-foot Kids "R" Us store, and a 32,000-square-foot Creativity arts and crafts store. The project replaces a Gallo Wine distribution warehouse that was on the five-acre site.
Since parking is on the roof, the building can fill almost the entire lot, with stores entered directly from the sidewalk on 48th Street and on Northern Boulevard. The facade materials will be brick and glass, with brick-colored stucco used for the upper half.
The developer is Forest City Ratner, the Brooklyn-based company that built Metrotech, the downtown Brooklyn office complex, and Atlantic Center, with 400,000 square feet of retail space and parking for 600 cars at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, also in downtown Brooklyn. Forest City is now New York's most active retail developer outside Manhattan.
"Our business plan is to do 700,000 square feet of retail space a year over the next three or four years -- about $150 million in development a year," said Bruce Ratner, president. Mr. Ratner is a former New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, a position that he says made him acutely aware of a need for better supermarket service in many city neighborhoods.
In contrast to attitudes toward big-box development elsewhere, local businesses seem pleased by the new Northern Boulevard projects.
"We welcome new development on Northern Boulevard -- it will enhance the entire region," said Tony Barsamian, chairman of the Steinway Street Business Improvement District and publisher of the West Queens Gazette, a weekly newspaper. There are 300 businesses on the five-block stretch of Steinway Street in Astoria running from 28th Avenue to 35th Avenue. Besides many mom-and-pops, there is a Gap, a Nobody Beats the Wiz, and other newer magnet stores.
The Steinway Street owners are even planning to operate a shuttle bus that will take shoppers from Northern Boulevard to their own locale. They expect regional shoppers -- including many on weekends from the East Side of Manhattan --to be drawn to Northern Boulevard, and from there to neighborhood shops and ethnic restaurants on Steinway Street.
As for Forest City Ratner, it has emerged as the only commercial developer operating outside Manhattan that is currently showing the interest and capacity to take on a lengthy and uncertain pre-construction development process. Its competitors are the major users -- Home Depot or Costco as examples -- that seek out and develop large sites for themselves. The large users have one advantage: they don't have to make an investment profit on the real estate.
Users do take risks, however. Kmart is reported to have paid about $18 million for the Northern Boulevard site it later decided it could not develop, and now wants to sell. The cost of carrying it unused has increased its investment. Whether it will recoup that investment in a sale is unclear.
O UR problem is not in finding tenants -- we can lease everything we can build," Mr. Ratner said. "The problem is to find decent-sized sites where we'll be allowed to build. We are not so much retail developers as we are site finders and entitlers." As an entitler, it must be capable of winning local and city approval for development.
According to Sandeep Mathrani, director of retail development for Forest City Ratner, there are no more than 20 locations on main streets in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island that are appropriate for major retail development, irrespective of how they are zoned. Forest City itself is "working" on 17 sites -- sites it does not own but could purchase if there were reason to believe they could be rezoned. Only five sites that are already zoned for commercial use are appropriate for a modern shopping center of 100,000 square feet or more, Mr. Mathrani said.
Forest City has other centers in construction besides The Shops at Northern Boulevard. In Maspeth, Queens, it is building a 100,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center on Grand Avenue, anchored by a 52,000-square-foot Edwards supermarket. And in the New Springville section of Staten Island, near the Staten Island Mall, it is in contract to build a 77,000-square-foot center anchored by Circuit City, an electronics chain based in Richmond, Va.
The big-box tenants usually have to be willing to accept ratios of parking space to operating space far smaller than they are accustomed to on suburban sites. "It's not easy to persuade the big-box retailers to go into these sites when they have to make concessions to their prototype," said Peter T. Ripka, president of Ripco Real Estate Corporation, in Jericho, L.I. Forest City Ratner had a particularly hard sell at Atlantic Center in Brooklyn, which has exceptional access to mass transportation. It has a ratio of 1.5 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of shopping center.
The typical suburban ratio is about 5 parking spaces for each 1,000 square feet of shopping. In Queens, users have been willing to accept ratios of 2.5 to 3 cars per 1,000 gross square feet of space.
ON Northern Boulevard, with 630 spaces, there will be a 2.85 ratio at the Forest City project. Customers will drive up one of two ramps, and proceed to the stores via elevators large enough to accept six customers with shopping carts.
An even bigger issue for tenants is the need to to attract an exceptional amount of business to justify the cost of operating in the city. Mr. Ratner said that discount department stores in New York City had to generate sales on a square-foot basis almost double what they are elsewhere in the metropolitan area to justify the rents they must pay for new space. These rents (upwards of $24 a square foot a year for 100,000 square feet of new space) are at least 40 percent higher than are elsewhere, he said.
The Forest City Ratner project will not complete the redevelopment of the block. Next door is the vacant Ronzoni building on 11 acres. The property was sold to Kmart two years ago, but it is now is on the market again, with Home Depot reported to be near a deal. And along 37th Avenue near the railroad tracks, the vacant Weeks Furniture building, only 13 years old, is also on the market, through Lawrence T. Smith, a land broker with Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a Queens brokerage. Weeks Furniture moved to Maspeth in a merger last year.
"Thank heaven for the retail development," said Sanford Zuckerbrot, president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot. "The market would be dead otherwise."

The Envelope, Please: A Downtown Makes the Cut for an Award

BYLINE: By JULIE BEGLIN 

 BODY:
Attention, Westfield shoppers: your town is the only New Jersey community to have been named a semi finalist in a competition for the nation's best downtown area. The third annual Great American Main Street Awards -- jointly administered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Edward Jones, a St. Louis-based financial services concern -- looked at 92 applicants and named Westfield one of 20 national semifinalists. Five winners, each of which will receive $5,000, will be announced on April 28.
The judges looked for towns that had gathered broad-based community support for their downtown revitalization projects, successfully improved the local economy and preserved important historic buildings, said William McLeod of the National Trust. "Westfield has excellent building stock," he said. "It's an ideal, traditional American town. It has a variety of stores, churches, a fire house, post office, everything." 
 Westfield Main Street, a nonprofit organization that oversees downtown revitalization, submitted the application on behalf of the town's 425 businesses. Michele Picou, program manager of Westfield Main Street, discussed the designation.
Q. What makes Westfield's downtown stand out?
A. I think there's so much going on. It's compact; there are good restaurants, some really unique shops, and it's the only town I know of where there are policemen directing traffic in the streets.
Q. How important are those police officers to the town's character?
A. Violent street crime is not exactly an everyday problem here, but in any downtown a sense of caring and safety by public officials is essential, and I think the fact that these guys are on the street corner reassures people. It's one of the identifying hallmarks in Westfield. I don't know of any other town with this in New Jersey. I think we're it, and I think it's essential.
Q. The award committee made special note of the former Norris Chevrolet building at Central and North Avenues. Why?
A. One of the things we've done with the Westfield Main Street program is a facade renovation incentive program. The maximum grant we give is $2,000, which the store owner or landlord must at least match. In return, our office has input into the design, so we don't end up with a bunch of neons and awful-looking signs. The Norris Chevrolet building, which is now the home of Coldwell Banker Realtors, was being redesigned, and we gave advice on how to retain that Spanish Colonial look the building had, without it looking too hokey. The judges must have liked the slides of that particular project.
Q. What improvements would you like to see?
A. I'm concerned with variety. I would like to see something in home furnishings come in, for instance. I would also like to see more healthy mom-and-pop type operations. I'd like to see some type of gourmet food operation. And I wouldn't mind seeing a brew pub. Also, we plan to get our businesses up on the World Wide Web so we can get the word out.
Q. Can you go too far with these types of improvements?
A. I think there's always a chance of that. One of the things we've never advocated, and never will, is very tight design guidelines. I think it's wrong when a community becomes a theme park, of all Western design or something. I don't think there's too much danger of that in Westfield. People here tend to respect the basic architectural structure of the community. You don't put socks on a rooster, and you don't ignore matching the design to the architecture. We try to encourage tasteful common sense. JULIE BEGLIN

HEADLINE: Business in 31st Year Succeeds in Its Niche

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN a fledgling company loses all its capital after only six weeks in business, what then? "We hung in," recalled Dennis Mehiel, who saw his first venture -- as a subcontractor assembling fiber containers for war materiel -- fail when orders were curtailed during the Vietnam War.
In 1966, Mr. Mehiel and his brother Chris pooled their savings of $8,000 and with an additional $8,000 from a Small Business Administration loan started the Four M Corporation in Baltimore. "We carved out a slot for ourselves in the corrugated packaging industry," Mr. Mehiel said. "Our niche in the market was supplying the corrugated partitions that required hand assembly. We put together a labor force, and business was so good that we invested in cutting machines just before the big orders folded." 
 What followed was a difficult time. "I saw seven years of payments to the S.B.A. facing me when I couldn't even keep up my car payments," Mr. Mehiel said. "Eventually, my car was repossessed. There was a certain irony there, since one of my first jobs was repossessing cars for G.M. Auto Finance. In those days I was working three jobs. That was my night job. By day, I was a bill collector, and on the weekends, I collected coins for a car wash."
Despite the first business failure, Mr. Mehiel said: "We never thought of not being in business. We were still the only interested and reliable supplier of corrugated interior packaging partitions in Baltimore, and our marketing strategy made sense. Big companies didn't want to bother manufacturing corrugated partitions. It was a declining market, but we saw a niche we could fill, supplying partitions to giant companies like Colgate, Procter & Gamble and General Foods, who used lots of them."
This year marks the 31st anniversary of Mr. Mehiel's company, the Four M Corporation, now with headquarters in Valhalla. Together with its two affiliated companies, Box USA and the Fonda Group, Four M is the country's largest independently owned producer of corrugated-box packaging and shipping containers. It is also the country's leading producer of private-label paper cups and plates. Nationwide, 37 factories, with 4,500 employees, contributed to revenues of $900 million last year.
In an industry dominated by large, publicly traded corporations, Mr. Mehiel, an entrepreneur, became a major player by acquiring insolvent companies in the packaging industry.
"By 1980, we realized that we were limiting our growth by concentrating on only one product," he said. "So we started diversifying. In the years from 1984 to 1994, we bought 17 facilities, including box factories, all of them bargains. We borrowed to the hilt and when we started running out of money, we began buying bankrupt businesses from creditors who financed us because we were willing to pay them a higher rate of return than they could get otherwise. Only two of our purchases turned out badly. One we sold; the other is only a partial success." But the company's employment policy can be described as an unequivocal success. Almost all employees who were slated to lose their jobs at their former companies were retained by Four M. New people were added as business increased. And many people once on public assistance found employment.
"We apply a strategic rationale to business," Mr. Mehiel said. "In the communities where we have plants, we are able to save jobs and create new ones through internal growth. By expanding and developing the facilities we acquire, we have opened new markets."
And when larger companies in a kindred field began downsizing, Four M seized the opportunity to expand in another direction, Mr. Mehiel said.
"We managed to pick up small divisions of mega companies and cobble them together, which is how we developed the Fonda Group," he said. "For instance, when Scott Paper downsized its $70 million paper napkin-paper cup division employing 500 people, we bought it and stitched it together with other acquisitions of ours in what is known as the 'white business.' Fonda is now the leading producer of private-label paper cups and plates nationwide."
Although Mr. Mehiel and his management teams have been able to increase capacity, and consequently the sales, of all their acquisitions, their record is not flawless.
"There have been disappointments," he said. "For instance, when we acquired 15 box plants from the St. Joe Container Company in Port St. Joe, Fla., last May, we also had to buy the paper mill, which we did in a 50-50 joint venture with Stone Container of Chicago."
Shortly afterward, he said, the price of paper dropped 40 percent, forcing Four M to cease operations at the mill.
"Right now the mill is temporarily shut down, putting about 450 to 500 people out of work," he said. "Certainly detrimental to the local economy, but we intend to secure our asset. We believe in the mill and hope to have it back in operation as soon as is possible."
As a hands-on chief executive officer, Mr. Mehiel recently scheduled breakfast, lunch and dinner meetings with raw-materials vendors, customers and plant managers who were all in town for the American Forest Products Paper Week. "It's our industry's biggest annual event," Mr. Mehiel said, "an opportunity to network and transact business."
Business is only one of his interests. He is the founder of All the Way, a multimillion-dollar, year-round educational program for youngsters who live in large cities. It begins in kindergarten and continues through college. And, as a longtime resident of Armonk, Mr. Mehiel said he has been active in charities, in the Democratic Party and as a member of many boards.
When asked what influenced his outside activities, he said: "It's in the nature of a giveback. One of my grandfathers was a janitor, the other an elevator operator. Our family has prospered. I've done well in my life so I look for opportunities to recycle the American dream for other families."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
A Rising Interest Foreseen in High-End Houses

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
PHILIP ADLER was amazed recently when a center-hall colonial he was building on a small waterfront lot in Rye sold for the asking price of $1.1 million.
"We were putting in the foundation when it sold," said Mr. Adler, managing director of North American Properties Group, of Stamford, Conn. "We were surprised it sold so soon, and without the buyer being able to even see the house." 
 Also surprising, he said, was the fact that it went for the asking price, since it's a "rather modest house," with 3,200 square feet on less than one-third of an acre.
"I think it speaks to how few vacant lots are left in a place like Rye," Mr. Adler said, "especially on the water."
According to brokers and builders throughout the county, there are some indications of an increased demand for certain properties in very desirable locations, which may place an upward pressure on prices.
Diane Guarino, branch manager of Houlihan/Lawrence's office in Larchmont, said she could almost predict which listing will immediately generate a bidding war.
"In our area," Ms. Guarino said, "young couples will bid on a house that's priced appropriately and in good condition."
She cited one recent example of a house that attracted multiple bids -- a 4-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath colonial in Larchmont that was listed in the high $600,000's and sold for $60,000 above the asking price.
"It was in a real white-picket-fence neighborhood," Ms. Guarino said. "It had a terrace and a study, all the bells and whistles people look for."
Brokers expect more multiple bids on single properties in 1997, and a rising interest in the higher end of the market. "Our market is tied to the stock market," said Ebie Wood, Houlihan/Lawrence's regional manager for central Westchester. "We're so close to Manhattan. A lot of young couples have gotten good bonuses. They now have the money to buy the house they want."
Merritt Mitchell, owner of Merritt Associates, a real estate brokerage concern with offices in Larchmont, Scarsdale and Rye, said that while he had not seen much price appreciation in his market, the improved economy has created a more upbeat atmosphere in general.
A FTER schlepping along in the early 90's, people seem to be more enthusiastic now," Mr. Mitchell said. "They're finding more money in their coffers. But they're still looking for value. It's still crucial for sellers to price their homes properly. Then they might be in a position to generate multiple offers. If a house is overpriced, no one will even come look at it."
Westchester entered 1997 after having had a record-breaking sales year in 1996, posting 7,576 residential sales, including co-ops and condominiums, amounting to nearly $2.3 billion in total value, according to the annual report of the Westchester Board of Realtors. That represented a 7 percent increase above the previous record of 7,076 sales set in 1994.
Sales have been so good, in fact, that many brokers are now complaining about low inventory, which they hope will be replenished by spring.
"Overall there's a shortage of listings," Mr. Mitchell said. "But people tend to get their houses on the market by mid-April, so we're expecting it to get better soon."
In 1996, inventory dropped to 7,568, which was 13 percent less than the 8,657 in 1995. "There is a possibility that relative spot shortages in certain price ranges and locations could generate price increases in excess of inflation," according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors.
The median sale price for a single-family house in Westchester last year was $285,000, just 1.8 percent ahead of 1995 and 3 percent above 1994. "Now we're just seeing increases based on inflation," Mr. Mercurio said. "In fact, the recovery of Westchester's real estate market is due in large part to the stability in prices. It's enabled more buyers to enter the market."
While house prices are stable, the price of individual building lots has seen a "definite appreciation," according to Mr. Adler. "I've seen increases of 10 to 15 percent for approved and improved building lots for single-family homes," he said.
At a development called the Pinnacle at Purchase, Mr. Adler said, there was a bidding war for a one-acre lot at the site. "We were asking $320,000 for the lot and it sold for $325,000," Mr. Adler said. "Last fall, these same lots were selling for $275,000 to $285,000."
Some builders of single-family homes are taking advantage of a greater demand for new construction by increasing prices beyond inflationary levels.
Mitchell C. Hochberg, president of Spectrum/Skanska, a residential builder based in Valhalla, has raised prices 5 to 10 percent at the Highlands at Riverwoods, a 148-unit single-family-home project in New Castle. When Mr. Hochberg began to market his project in 1995, prices for the 2- to 3-bedroom houses were in the high $300,000's to low $400,000's, he said.
"Now in the third phase, we're raising prices to start in the mid-$400,000's to mid-$500,000's," he said. "Normally we raise prices phase by phase. But it depends on how well a project is doing. I like to base any price increase on sales velocity."
Overall Mr. Hochberg senses that the market in Westchester is strong, but has "no significant room for price increases," he said. "Just a little bit of room."
TOLL BROTHERS, based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., is now building 222 new homes in the county, and in the approval process for 183 more. Most of the company's developments fall into the $450,000 to $500,000 price range.
It is planning modest price increases this year of 2 to 3 percent, according to Robert Parahus, a Toll vice president. "We're increasing prices to keep pace with inflation," Mr. Parahus said. "Since sales at all our developments continue to be strong, we think they can absorb the higher prices."
The lower end of the market is much more price sensitive, according to Martin Ginsburg, president of Ginsburg Development Corporation, of Hawthrone, which in recent years has concentrated on building in the $225,000 to $350,000 price range.
"With land prices rising, and limited land resources available," Mr. Ginsburg said, "we may have to reinvent the way we do things in order to continue to offer moderate-priced housing. We may have to work closer to our margins."
By necessity, Mr. Ginsburg said, his company will probably diversify this year or next by moving toward the higher end of the market, with houses in the $400,000 to $500,000 range.
"It's a very competitive market right now," Mr. Ginsburg said. "A lot of builders are doing well at that price range. But regardless of what price you're building, buyers are still extremely price sensitive. They want good solid value. And if builders don't provide that, they won't succeed at any price level."

EVOCATIVE PAINTINGS
Peter Lampke's large, evocative oil paintings will be on view at the Schoolhouse Gallery in Croton Falls until April 6. 
 His forte is placing people in situations that can be interpreted in many ways. Why would a man be standing stolidly next to train tracks under an umbrella in the rain, with a train passing behind him? The picture's caption indicates that he has just been divorced.
Another painting depicts three men lying on a beach either unaware or unperturbed by the ocean surging toward them a few inches away. In still another picture a boy enters a room where his father is at the window looking through binoculars at . . . at what?
Gallery hours are Wednesdays through Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. For directions or more information, call 277-3461.
 
PIANO RECITAL
The pianist Masanobu Ikemiya is equally at home with the classics, for which he was trained, and ragtime, to which he is dedicated. He will give a recital today at 2 P.M. at Wave Hill in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, performing the music of Gershwin, Joplin, Brahms and Schumann and David Blake,
Mr. Ikemiya founded the New York Ragtime Orchestra in Manhattan and has presented his musically diverse repertory in Russia, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Bulgaria, Portugal, India and various countries of Asia as well as the United States. Tickets at $12 include admission to the gardens and landscaped grounds of Wave Hill at 675 West 252d Street. Call (718) 549-3200 for directions.
 
SKATING BENEFIT
Performances by world champion figure skaters, including Jo Jo Starbuck, will be featured at the first Starlight, Starbright Skating Extravaganza on Thursday at the Westchester Skating Academy at 91 Fairview Park Drive in Elmsford.
The event, from 7 to 9 P.M., will also include amateur figure-skating performances and a raffle of sports memorabilia, including items signed by the New York Rangers. Proceeds will benefit the Starlight Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps children ages 4 to 18 who are critically, chronically or terminally ill.
General admission tickets are $10, and V.I.P. tickets, which include reserved observation deck seats and refreshments, are $50. Tickets are available at the Westchester Skating Academy or by calling 347-8232.

HUNGER BANQUET
For the last decade Manhattanville College in Purchase has organized a Hunger Banquet to call attention to the estimated billion people in the world who are chronically underfed. According to the college staff, the reason is not lack of food but the unequal distribution of resources.
This year's banquet on Tuesday at 7 P.M. will benefit Oxfam America, and it will include a presentation on "Why World Hunger?" by Geoffrey Martin, a professor of economic geography at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. Folk music will be provided by the Don Richards Band.
Admission will be by a minimum donation of $25, and guests will draw lots for seating in one of three groups. Group One, made up of 15 percent of the diners, will be served a gourmet meal. Group Two, or 25 percent of the remaining guests, will have a meal of rice and beans. The final 60 percent in Group Three will be served rice and water. The banquet is to be held in Reid Castle on the campus at 2900 Purchase Street. Call 694-3425 for reservations.

HOLOCAUST SCROLLS
Dan Regan, a photographer who developed a process that produces what he calls photographic sculpture, has created a six-foot, three-dimensional work on three scrolls, depicting the plight of Holocaust victims.
Entitled "Scrolls of Remembrance," it is linked to recorded chants, and it may be seen in a preview exhibition at the Rockland Center for Holocaust Studies in Spring Valley through April 10. It will then tour five cities in the United States through the rest of the year and embark on a world tour next year. The center, at 17 South Madison Avenue, is open Sundays through Thursdays from noon to 4 P.M. Call 356-2700 for more information.
 
FOUR ART SHOWS
Four exhibitions at the Center for Curatorial Studies Museum at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson display the innovative quality of the college's master's degree program and of the four second-year students who organized the show.
Virgilio Garza, former head of research and development and curator at the Museo de Monterrey, Mexico, from 1991 to 1995, chose to combine the work of Roni Horn and Gabriel Orozco, the former focused on forbidding Icelandic landscapes, the latter on the human concerns of urban life. He calls the result "Sleight of Mind/ The Angle of Landscape."
Melissa Hiller came to the center from an internship at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, organizing an exhibition titled "Unfolding Memory -- Embodying History." It consists of 10 large-scale paintings by Hung Liu, in which the artist interpreted photographs of the tumultuous period in China before the Communist Revolution.
"Picturing," small installations of architectural models imbued with imaginative and humorous overtones, were executed by Kim Adams, Michael Ashkin and Steven Brower, curated by Tomas Pospiszyl, a writer and curator from Prague. Concurrently working on a public art project in Prague, he was the gallery manager for Prague Castle, the office of the President of the Czech Republic.
The fourth exhibition, called "Coda," is the work of four photographers who manipulate color, focus and composition to their own ends. Cityscapes by Uta Barth, museum interiors by Carolien Stikker, architectural studies by Jack Pierson and Modernist architectural icons by Gunther Forg were curated by Brian Wallace. Mr. Wallace is a former media arts developer at the Computer Museum in Boston and a former assistant curator for the advancement of science in art at Cooper Union in Manhattan. The exhibition is open to the public free of charge Wednesdays through Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. For more information, call 758-7598. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Big Deals -- Maybe;
Behind the Buzz, Possibilities Waiting to Happen

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THERE is a buzz in the air. Deals may be in the offing. Big companies seek large blocks of office space in midtown Manhattan as the market begins to tighten for the first time in this decade.
As the deal makers are eager to complete their deals, developers are watching carefully, hoping the lack of suitable existing space will impel companies with large space needs and solid credit to sign up as the anchor tenants for new buildings whose construction has been on hold for years. 
 "I've been talking to sophisticated people who have lived through several cycles and they say this is as active a market as they have seen," said Kenneth M. Krasnow, director of business development at Cushman & Wakefield.
Although the companies seen as being in the market for large hunks of space do not advertise their intentions, it is well known in industry circles which companies are looking for new homes and how much space they want. One of the biggest prospective deals involves the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns & Company, which is said to be looking for as much as 1.2 million square feet for its trading floors and offices.
The company is under pressure to find a replacement for its quarters at 245 Park Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, where its lease expires in 2002. The building is in need of renovations and company executives have said it would be too disruptive to move around the Park Avenue building as the floors are refurbished. William J. Montgoris, the company's chief operating officer said he expected that a decision would be made by the end of the year.
Another is Reuters America, the United States arm of the British-based news and financial information company, which is said to be looking for up to 800,000 square feet to consolidate operations that are now scattered in four major locations around the city. "Reuters America has been exploring its options in the real estate market in New York City and its environs," said Robert Crooke, the company's vice president for media relations.
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield is reported to be considering selling its building at 622 Third Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets and relocating in 700,000 to 800,000 square feet of cheaper space downtown. The change may be driven by economics, despite having to give up the convenience of a midtown location.
The building, like many in midtown, has increased considerably in value over the last few years, while the city is offering incentives for companies to move to downtown, which has had a large amount of vacant space. A spokesman for Empire said the company was evaluating its real estate options, but that no decisions had been made.
Standard & Poor's division of McGraw-Hill, now at 25 Broadway, is said to be looking for 700,000 square feet of space, which it may split between New York and New Jersey. A spokesman for McGraw-Hill said the company continuously reviews its space needs, but would not comment directly about Standard & Poor's plans.
And Citibank, reportedly looking for 800,000 square feet of space, is said to be considering shifting some of its operations from New York to New Jersey. John M. Morris, a spokesman for the bank and its parent Citicorp, said the company "is in the market on a continuous basis, but we do not have anything we want to announce at this time."
"With an operation of our size we are always surveying what is available to meet our needs," he added.
Other possible seekers of large amounts of space include the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, Grey Advertising, and the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison law firm, brokers say.
One deal that is off the front burner involves the investment firm of Morgan Stanley, which had been reported to be looking for 400,000 square feet. In the wake of its announced merger with Dean Witter, the securities firm, the company is said to be re-evaluating its real estate needs.
WHILE it is possible that Bear Stearns might ultimately decide to remain on Park Avenue and that none of the other transactions will come to pass, brokers say the reports are more than rumors. "These people are actively shopping the market," Mr. Krasnow of Cushman & Wakefield said. "They have hired representatives and they are spending time and money on searches."
With, as Bruce Mosler of Cushman & Wakefield puts it, "nine million square feet of tenants looking at four million square feet of space," it is likely that some will be unable to find what they need in existing buildings. Brokers say this is especially likely for banking companies, which need large, open floors with the latest in power and communications for trading rooms.
"In the top 65 buildings in midtown, the vacancy rate is 3 percent," said Steven A. Swerdlow, manager of CB Commercial's offices in the New York region. "The upper end of the market is very tight and big blocks of space are scarce."
That scarcity may drive a big tenant into the arms of a developer in a new building project. After the excesses of the 80's, developers are not likely to get financing for a new building without a top-quality tenant signed up for a large part of the space.
New construction means a delay of several years while the structure is built, but it can be customized for tenant's needs.
Since there are so few available building sites in midtown, the same sites are discussed over and again. According to industry executives, five sites are the most likely for new construction: the three remaining in Times Square, on the northwest, southwest and southeast corners of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue; 383 Madison, the blockfront between 46th and 47th Streets that has been vacant for almost 10 years, and an empty lot on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets that is usually called Rock West because of its links to Rockefeller Center.
Because of the success of the first office building in Times Square, which is being developed by the Durst Organization and was almost fully rented before excavation was completed, many in the industry say development will happen there first. Last week, executives of the Prudential Insurance Company, which controls the Times Square sites, said development rights to all three were for sale.
"The next buildings will almost certainly be in Times Square because the subsidy is worth $5 to $7 a square foot," said Andrew Roos of the Williams Real Estate Company, referring to tax breaks intended to spur redevelopment. "They will be developed before 383 Madison or Rock West."
Subsidy or not, Times Square has become an attractive area to be in, said Jeffrey Katz, the president of Sherwood Equities, which manages the triangular building at 1 Times Square that will house a Warner Brothers Studio Store.
"Times Square is more popular than Third Avenue now, and that would have been unthinkable three years ago," he said.
Douglas Durst, the president of the Durst Organization, acknowledged that he was interested in developing another office tower at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue.
The building at 383 Madison has been snarled in an ownership dispute and an extended struggle over whether a new building on the site could take advantage of the air rights over Grand Central Terminal, which is three blocks away.
Nevertheless, brokers say the site's proximity to the station helps make it an attractive location for development.
The Rock West site was assembled and cleared in the 80's, but became a parking lot when the collapse in real estate values made building impossible. It went with the company that controls the four buildings on the west side of Sixth Avenue when the Rockefeller holdings were divided last year.
Jonathan D. Green, president of Rockefeller Center Management Corporation, acknowledged that the company had been talking to prospective tenants and was prepared to redesign and re-permit a project that had completed the process in the 80's. "The market is demanding bigger, bulkier floors, and we will redesign to accommodate the right tenant," he said.
He said no deal to develop the site was imminent, but added that he expected one to be concluded by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: South Jamaica Innovator;
A Library Mindful of Light's Uses

 BODY:
The new one-story South Jamaica Library to be completed at 108-41 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in two years has been designed to use natural light in ways that will please library users as well as environmentalists and the city's accountants.
Innovations in the $2.2 million energy-efficient, environmentally responsive library will help the New York City Department of Design and Construction develop higher environmental performance standards in public renovation and new construction projects citywide, according to a department spokesman. 
 "We are projecting using about one-third less heating energy than a conventional building," said Carl Stein, partner of The Stein Partnership, which designed it.
Sunlight will enter the brick, glass and concrete building through three skylights, or clerestories. It will be softened by reflector diffusers and filtered by solar shades.
"As the the sun comes out, electric lights will dim gradually," said Mr. Stein. "As sunlight levels drop late in the day or during a sudden storm, the lights will brought back on automatically."
The 7,500-square-foot library will offer 75,000 volumes, at least 10 computers for public-use and after-school programs for children.
Passers-by will be able to look inside through a large glass-curtain wall.
"We are part of an urban renewal initiative for the South Jamaica community," said Robert J. Waters director of engineering, facilities planning for the Queens Borough Public Library System.
The new library will rise three blocks south of York College and two blocks north of the existing library, which now rents space in a church-owned building.

HEADLINE: For Region's Housing, a Solid '96

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
LIKE a wanting child longing for a hug, the New York metropolitan region's residential real estate market enjoyed an uplifting squeeze last year, with welcome pressure from the city's robust housing market and the nation's healthy economy helping to turn 1996 into one of the best years in a quarter of a century.
A year ago, housing scholars and institutionally-optimistic industry representatives were using such terms as "sluggish" and "muddled" to describe the market. And with fears of downsizing casting a cloud over consumer confidence, several observers predicted that 1996 would see "further uncertainty" with the market "in a stall, rather than a dive." 
 All proving that prognostication is a perilous exercise.
In fact, 1996 turned in a solid performance. All 11 counties in the suburban ring around New York City enjoyed increased sales in 1996. And of the 426 ZIP-code areas in those counties, 364 registered price appreciation, while only 62 showed price depreciation.
"Most economists were surprised how strongly the national economy performed in 1996," said James Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "That powerful national momentum filtered down to the region."
At the same time, Dr. Hughes said: "New York City had a particularly strong performance, led by Wall Street. The huge bull market is having a major positive effect on the regional economy, which translates into house sales."
That was apparent in data for the suburban ring.
For example, single-family home sales in Westchester, according to the county's Board of Realtors, increased to 5,211 last year, up from 4,561 in 1995, with median prices increasing by 1.8 percent to $285,000. In Nassau, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, the increase in home sales was 7.8 percent, up from 6,792 in 1995 to 7,319 last year. In Fairfield County, statistics provided by The Commercial Record, a business weekly, showed that the number of single-family homes and condos sold last year was 16,177, up 6.2 percent from 1995; and the median price in 1996 was $197,000, up 4.8 percent from '95.
And in New Jersey, according to statistics from the New Jersey Association of Realtors, single-family home sales rose from 138,300 in 1995 to 147,800 last year -- a 6.9 percent jump, while median prices increased 3.9 percent, from $148,000 to $153,800.
Among the thousands of housing nomads in the region last year were Tim Esperto, an accountant, and his wife, Irene, a bank manager, who just wanted to get out of the third-floor walk-up they were renting in Baldwin, L.I. They both work in Manhattan.
After 40 house viewings, the Espertos moved last May into a four-bedroom colonial in Cranford, N.J. They paid $235,000. "The price was not much of a problem," Mr. Esperto said, "maybe a little more than what we had in mind."
But other factors overrode price considerations. One was that "although the commute is almost the same, Long Island traffic is out of control," Mr. Esperto said. Another was that "it's closer to Staten Island, where my wife's family lives."
Of such mundane concerns are individual deals done. But broad market trends are the stuff of large, synergistic forces. Among those forces spurring the regional market last year were substantial job growth, low and stable mortgage rates of about 7.5 percent, the housing demands of the baby-boom generation, Wall Street's bull market and relaxation of fears about downsizing.
John L. Weiting, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, cited "a strong pickup" in job growth regionally as a potent element in the resurgence of real estate -- with calmed fears of downsizing as the key underlying factor.
NEW YORK, New Jersey and Connecticut added 167,400 private-sector jobs, Mr. Weiting pointed out, up from 10,883,000 at the end of '95 to 11,050,000 at the end of '96 -- a 1.2 percent rise.
"Downsizing wasn't as severe as originally feared," Commissioner Weiting said. In particular, AT&T in New Jersey did not lay off as many people as it had announced, he said, " and they've also been doing some hiring."
Arthur Zabarkes, dean of New York University's Real Estate Institute, concurred: "Telecommunications reconfigured, and some of the big old-timers, AT&T being the most notable, declined in market share. But meanwhile, the industry as a whole expanded significantly, so people found jobs" -- primarily in the so-called "new media" industry that is burgeoning in downtown Manhattan and significantly contributing to the city's economy.
That phenomenon illustrates the mix of ingredients in the regional real estate brew. Just as national factors exert their effects on the tri-state area, the effects of what happens in the region churn through the city and, obviously, vice versa.
A particularly powerful force at work in the regional market has been the record profits on Wall Street and, more specifically, the historic highs in year-end bonuses for the 150,000 workers in the financial industry.
A recent report by the New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said that while the year-end bonuses of 1995 had pumped $6.1 billion into the region last year, the bonuses handed out at the end of last year would leap to $8.1 billion this year -- with individual bonuses ranging from $10 million and more for the biggest winners to a few thousand dollars for clerks.
Those fistfuls of cash stir up a wave of sales throughout the region: luxurious co-ops, condos and lofts in Manhattan, brownstones in Brooklyn, single-family homes of all sizes and types throughout the boroughs and the suburban ring, summer homes in the Hamptons and even farther.
"Certainly the engine of New York City is felt all the way through New Jersey into the contiguous Pennsylvania counties," said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. "Bucks County is the fastest growing county in Pennsylvania, in terms of population."
KarenAnn Covais-Orlando and her husband, David Orlando, both work for Wall Street companies -- she as assistant to the managing director of KSH Investment, a new brokerage firm, he as an equity trader for Paine Webber.
Ms. Covais-Orlando got a $10,000 raise when she agreed to move with her old boss after he started the company last year. Mr. Orlando received a bonus from Paine Webber, the size of which he is keeping private.
THREE weeks ago, the couple moved from an apartment in Whitestone, Queens, to a four-bedroom, high ranch in East Northport on Suffolk County's North Shore. "No, not near the water," Ms. Covais-Orlando said. "The bonus was good, but not that good.
"But we were able to get half an acre with a built-in pool. And it has a brand new kitchen, a gorgeous kitchen, and that's what sold me." The couple paid $212,000.
"It's not that the bonus made it possible," Ms. Covais-Orlando said, "but it helped so that we weren't crunched at the closing."
Whatever the yearly bonus boost to the housing market, it has been sales of single-family homes to baby boomers that have steadily fueled the suburban market. "This decade has been a continuation of the baby-boom hegemony, with single-family units at the metropoltian ring the leading edge of growth," said Dr. Hughes of Rutgers. "They are now the second-time buyers, and their children are going for starter homes."
"The people who built the housing in the suburbs 50 years ago are at a stage where they are selling those homes and trading up or building," Dr. Hughes said. "And now they are selling to some of the X-generation, the ones who are now married and thinking of having a family.
"It's the circle of housing."
As evidence, Dr. Hughes cited data on housing starts in New Jersey, the state he most closely watches. "We have had, through the 90's, record shares of new construction in the single-family sector, as opposed to multi-family," he said. "The share has averaged more than 85 percent for the decade," while, over the last 35 years, the single-family sector has averaged only 60 percent. "It indicates the sheer impact of the baby boomers on the market."
DEAN ZABARKES at N.Y.U. both concurred and demurred: "Yes, the increased demand by the baby boomers explains a great deal about new construction. But I suggest we not lose sight of the fact that real estate is driven as much by the money train as by demand."
Stretching a phrase made famous by filmdom's evocation of a baseball field in the boondocks, Dean Zabarkes said, "Where financing is available, people will build and people will come."
Since the housing market collapse of the early 90's, he said, "We've seen a gush of money heading toward real estate." And as the statistics from so many communities in the region indicate, they have come.
Pointing to a 14.3 percent jump in sales for the state last year, the executive vice president of the New York State Association of Realtors, Charles M. Staro, attributed the gains, in large part, to "the lack of any major fluctuations in interest, which makes mortgages that much more attainable.
"You don't see those big spikes and the craziness of the market," he said, "which boosts consumer confidence."
But Mr. Staro also said that part of the credit goes to the state government, which, under Republican control, he said, has evinced a "much more friendly attitude toward business." He specifically cited the repeal last year of the so-called Cuomo tax -- a 10 percent surcharge on the capital gain on property sold for over $1 million.
"The removal of that onerous tax has spurred development, construction and renovation of existing apartments, shopping centers and businesses in general," Mr. Staro said. "People are willing to put the money into property knowing that if it were sold they would not have to share their gain with the state."
The effect of those factors, among others, was to spur the market, Mr. Staro said.
In Suffolk County, for example, the New York State Association of Realtors reported a 12.2 percent jump in sales volume, from 8,812 in 1995 to 9,885 last year. And median prices in the county increased from $134,000 at the end of 1995 to $137,000 last December -- a 2.5 percent increase.
Those trends were confirmed by an alternative measure of the market -- the repeat-sale survey by Case Schiller Weiss, a real estate statistics firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Case Shiller Weiss has devised an index to track fluctuations in price. The survey is based on a table showing the average price of all single-family homes sold in ZIP-code areas, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1996, for example, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP-code area during the year just ended, compared it to the price that the house brought the last time it was sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier purchase price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1996.
Of the 80 ZIP codes in Suffolk, only 6 showed price depreciation, while 74 experienced appreciation.
IN Nassau County, where sales volume jumped 7.8 percent last year, median prices increased from $168,300 in December 1995 to $175,000 at the end of 1996. And, according to Case Shiller, all 63 ZIP codes in Nassau experienced price appreciation.
John Juliano, a broker in the East Meadow office of Prudential Long Island Realty, doesn't need the numbers to know "it's been real strong."
The local economy "seems to be solid," Mr. Juliano said. "No big companies, but you can see that they are building hotels, shopping centers, a lot of commercial building" -- all creating new jobs.
"For a long time," Mr. Juliano continued, "people were afraid of losing their jobs; now they are working overtime and are able to take on a bigger monthly payment."
And the buyers are sticking close to home. "There was a time when 80 percent of our buyers came from Queens," Mr. Juliano said. "Now it's only 20 percent. People are staying on Long Island."
Jack MacCarthy, a systems technician for Chase Manhattan, is one of those homebodies. Along with his sister, Mr. MacCarthy owned a small Cape Cod in Levittown, next door to their parents.
WHEN he and his bride, Andrea, got married last August and bought a four-bedroom Levitt ranch for $160,000, it was in Hicksville -- three miles away. "I just like the area," Mr. MacCarthy said.
In Westchester, according to the county Association of Realtors, there were 5,211 single-family home sales last year, a 14.3 percent increase over the 4,561 sales in 1995. And prices rose from an average of $284,650 in '95 to $289,850 last year, a 1.8 percent increase.
Of the 64 ZIP codes in Westchester, according to the Case Shiller survey, 8 experienced depreciation and 56 appreciated. Those numbers indicated a significant turnaround from 1995 when 31 ZIP codes experienced depreciation -- all of them across the northern tier of the county.
For Fairfield County -- where The Commercial Record survey indicated a 6.2 percent increase in sales, from 15,233 to 16,177, and a median price rise of 4.8 percent, from $188,000 to $197,000 -- the Case Schiller survey showed that 39 of the 45 ZIP codes appreciated.
The New Jersey Association of Realtors calculates its data by separating the state into three regions.
In the northern section (Bergen, Bloomfield, Hudson, Hunterdon, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex and Warren Counties -- sales volume rose from 55,500 in 1995 to 58,400 in 1996, a 5.2 percent increase, while median prices appreciated by 4.9 percent, from $188,100 to $197,300.
The central section of New Jersey (Monmouth, Middlesex, Mercer, and Ocean) experienced a 7.8 percent jump in sales, from 45,900 to 49,500. And prices increased 4.1 percent, from $140,200 to $145,900.
AND in the southern region (Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Gloucester and Atlantic), sales jumped 8.4 percent, from 36,900 to 40,000, while prices rose by 2.3 percent, from $106,700 to $109,200.
Of the 283 ZIP-code areas in the 8 counties that comprise New Jersey's piece of the ring around the boroughs of New York City, 234 showed price appreciation last year, with only 36 experiencing depreciation.
As there long has been, said Michael Ford, president of the state realtors' association: "There's a lot of Staten Island and Manhattan buyers coming over to the central-northern section of the state. And we have a great influx of buyers coming out of the Philadelphia area to our southern shore."
"But the push in the market right now," Mr. Ford said, "is the first-time buyer."
Vanessa Van Brunt qualifies.
Officer Van Brunt, 25, a member of the Cranford Police Department for the last 5 years, recently moved out of her parents' home in Cranford into a three-bedroom cape -- across town. "The big break," she called it.
And she used her policing skills in the search.
"Basically, all I do is drive around all night," Officer Van Brunt said. "I probably go into 8 or 9 houses a shift, on calls and reports. Sure, you notice when one has a for-sale sign up. If a house is vacant and it's for sale, it's part of our job to keep an eye on that."
She kept an eye out for a month, perusing 10 homes before going back and buying, for $162,000, the first one.
"I'd miss living in the town I work in," Officer Van Brunt said. "You're not just patrolling any town, it's your own town."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT;
Can Betting (Though Not Necessarily on Horses) Save the Track?

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
Wally Medio fell in love with horses when he started to win bets he made on them."Before that, I never once rode a horse," he said. "I never much took a look at them until the track opened."
Mr. Medio, 67, of Vineland has been training horses to win at all five New Jersey race tracks since 1970. He said he wasn't sure which he loves more: the horses he has coached to finish-line victories or the spring day he walked into "the track" -- Atlantic City Race Course -- for the first time. 
 "My life began at the track," Mr. Medio said. "Atlantic City's not in the best shape anymore, but I'd still call it the best track for racing horses in the state, and one of the best in the country. To hear the talk about closing Atlantic City and Garden State makes me boil."
What has raised Mr. Medio's temperature is a recommendation this month by State Senator Richard Codey, Democrat of Essex County, to end live horse racing at Atlantic City Race Course and its South Jersey sister, Garden State Park in Cherry Hill, in hopes of improving attendance and betting at the Monmouth, Freehold and Meadowlands race courses. Mr. Codey is one of 19 members of the State Racing Industry Study Commission appointed by Governor Whitman to come up with recommendations to increase gambling revenues at the state's race tracks.
Mr. Codey's recommendation has received cautious approval from James Murphy, Atlantic City Race Course president, because of a provision that would require the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority, the state agency that channels casino revenue to local and state improvement projects, to finance renovations at the two Soth Jersey tracks and essentially keep them open as simulcast betting parlors.
Although the Commission has yet to make a formal report, Mr. Codey's proposal is among the most extreme among what Stanley Pancow, president of the 400-member New Jersey Thoroughbred Breeders Association, based in Bordentown, calls "the trial balloons they've been floating around."
Among the proposals Mr. Pancow mentioned were the addition of simulcast betting at Garden State, NASCAR automobile racing at Atlantic City and slot machines in the grandstands there. "It's too soon to judge how closing the tracks would affect the breeders," Mr. Pancow said. His organization has commissioned an economic impact study of live racing and expects to release his findings this summer.
Overall attendance and gambling at New Jersey's race tracks was declining before legalized casino gambling came to the Boardwalk in 1978. In an effort to keep the Atlantic City Race Course open in winter, when no live races are held, New Jersey voters approved simulcast betting there in 1986. Then Atlantic City Race Course then sold off part of its parking lot for construction of the Hamilton Mall shopping center. In 1991, citing a recessionary economy and increased competition from other gambling meccas, the State Legislature approved simulcast betting in Atlantic City casinos, on the condition that the casinos carry races from all five New Jersey tracks and return some of the proceeds to the tracks in compensation for lost business.
Business was booming when the Atlantic City Race Course opened. Founded on the Black Horse Pike in McKee City, about a half hour's drive west of the Boardwalk, by the Philadelphia blue blood John Kelly (father of Grace), the track numbered nightclub stars like Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Harry James, Xavier Cougat and Sammy Kaye among its stockholders.
"You should've seen the limousines pulling up," Mr. Medio recalled. "You couldn't get into the clubhouse unless you were dressed to the nines. Milton Berle once presented me with a trophy when one of the horses I trained had won. He said he'd bet on the wrong horse."
Now, the limousines seen on the Black Horse Pike rarely stop at the track. Most of them follow busloads of gamblers bound for the casinos, which, despite numerous casino-sponsored races, "are killing the track," Mr. Medio said.
In 1992, gamblers bet nearly $20 million at Atlantic City Race Course, about as much as the average Boardwalk casino hotel takes in in two weeks. A condition of the state's casino simulcast legislation required Atlantic City Race Course to stop offering simulcast betting from 1993 to 1995. Less than $9 million was wagered at Atlantic City Race Course in 1996, when simulcast betting resumed there. Mr. Murphy, the Race Course president, said live racing had been "a money-loser" at his track and at Garden State Park, where an awkwardly placed stop on New Jersey Transit's rail line from Philadelphia to Atlantic City has yet to bring back the Philadelphia gamblers who used to flock there.
On March 12, members of the Racing Industry Study Commission visited Stanton, Del., where the addition of 1,000 slot machines netted profits of $56 million in 1996, enough to pay for improvements to the track and increase Delaware's 1997 live racing season to 139 days.
By comparison, Atlantic City Race Course will have live horse races on only 31 days this year.
"It's impossible to run a track these days without slot machines," said Mr. Medio, who has visited the Delaware track and others that have added slot machines. "The gamblers want them, and gambling is all that's keeping horse racing alive. Atlantic City got slot machines because it was in trouble and needed a way to come back. Now horse racing is in trouble and needs a way to come back."
Mr. Medio doesn't approve of NASCAR automobile racing proposed for the race course. "Only thing I ever got from watching cars race was a headache from the noise and pollution," he said. "If you care about horses, slot machines are the only way to go."
Because more than two-thirds of Atlantic City's casino revenues come from slot machines, Donald Trump, the casino owner, who is also a member of the Racing Study Commission, has said he would block any attempt to put slot machines at Atlantic City Race Course or any other track in New Jersey.
Michael Vukcevich, deputy director of the New Jersey Racing Commission, said the commission would "observe the status quo" for this racing season. "We have people studying the problem, but there's nothing on our table right now about making any changes at the tracks," he said.
But "things can't stay the way they've been much longer," he added. "Something has to be done."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Some Investors Just Won't Deal Without the Net

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
BRUCE BENNETT would rather spend his money on fishing equipment than on commissions for his stock trades. That's why Mr. Bennett, a fourth-year medical student at the University of Mississippi, has used three different brokerage firms in the last year. Interestingly, those three firms share another trait besides cheap deals: they all offer trading over the Internet.
That is no surprise. The Internet is the speediest part of the fast-growing area of on-line trading. Investors can trade on line through a company's proprietary software, through commercial on-line services or directly on the Internet. But while only 5 of the 12 on-line traders, or 42 percent, offered Internet access in 1995, 25 of the 33 on-line traders this year, or 76 percent, are offering Internet service, according to the American Association of Individual Investors, which conducts this annual survey. 
 "All the growth in on-line investing is over the Internet," said Andre Scheluchin, managing editor at Mercer Inc., which also tracks this data.
When financial-services firms decide to start offering on-line trading, the Internet is more and more often their choice. Consider full-service brokers. Merrill Lynch recently announced it would begin offering Internet trading to qualifying customers in January 1998, and in December Dean Witter purchased Lombard Institutional Brokerage, which does about half of its trading on the Internet.
Mutual funds, which often offer prospectuses and applications on the Internet, are also edging into trading. The Scudder, Fidelity, Strong and American Century fund families now allow exchanges, redemptions or both over the Internet. And the last two also allow the purchase of additional shares on the Internet, if the fund is linked to the customer's bank account.
It is not surprising that bargain-seekers like Mr. Bennett have flocked to this system. The average minimum on-line trading commission has fallen from $35.33 in 1996 to $34.48 this year, and some trades -- particularly the Internet ones -- go for as little as $9 or less.
"As more and more brokerages go on line and offer Internet trading, the competition for who can offer the lowest fees is heating up immensely," said Kenneth J. Michal, an analyst with the American Association of Individual Investors.
Another reason for the low prices is low overhead, said Julio Gomez, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "It costs brokerages very little, if anything, to offer trades via the Internet," he said.
But investors must realize that these bargain deals sometimes come with conditions and hefty side charges. That is to be expected; discount brokers, the biggest presence in on-line trading so far, often use this approach in their off-line business, too. "What's happening right now with the price wars," Mr. Gomez said, "is that these firms are simply giving customers what they want -- cheap trades -- and extracting their pound of flesh elsewhere."
Scottsdale Online, for example, charges a flat fee of $9 a trade. To get that price, however, investors must keep a $10,000 account minimum; otherwise, they must pony up $19 a transaction.
Investexpress On-Line charges $13.95 a trade, but the trade must be for at least 500 shares, with a minimum share price of $3.
Some firms charge execution fees on each trade. At Computel that fee is $2.50; Net Investor charges $2.75.
"Investors should always call and ask about extra charges -- processing fees, handling fees, sometimes they're called different things," Mr. Scheluchin said. "All firms put it in their literature, but sometimes it's hard to find." Optional services can be steeply priced, too; Datek Online, for instance, charges $50 to mail stock certificates.
Large fees for inactive accounts -- Net Investor charges $50 -- are often levied on investors who fail to generate a minimum dollar amount of commissions within a certain period. And limit orders, through which investors set a price limit on a stock sale or purchase, can cost extra. A regular trade at Lombard and E-Trade costs $14.95, for instance, but limit orders are $19.95. Individual retirement accounts can be hit with high special fees as well.
Some researchers think cheap, no-frills trading -- with or without hefty side charges -- may not be what many investors want.
"What we're seeing is that most people want a higher level of service than deep-discount brokerages offer when it comes to on-line investing," Mr. Gomez said. "Though deep discounters will continue to exist, firms that offer more services and broker support will become the on-line brokerages of choice." And they will thrive even if they charge more for trades, he said.
Among such firms, Mr. Gomez said, are American Express Financial Direct and e.Schwab, which charge $31.95 and $29.95, respectively, for trades of up to 1,000 shares.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH STREET SEAPORT;
Plan for Apartment Towers Returns. So Do Protests.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
When a 20th-century history of New York's great real-estate battles is written, a particularly long citation will have to be included for 250 Water Street, a trapezoidal site just inside the South Street Seaport Historic District that has been the subject of 10 unbuilt designs since 1983.
Year after year, Milstein Properties has proposed commercial towers for their blocklong parcel, most of which have been shot down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission as unforgivably large and incompatible with its small-scale, 19th-century surroundings. 
 But in 1991, after the Milsteins scaled back what had once been a 43-story building to one with 11 floors, the commission gave the developers a green light. By that time, however, the sluggish demand for office space in lower Manhattan helped kill the project.
Now that the Wall Street area is a nascent residential community, Paul and Seymour Milstein have returned with plans for an apartment complex that features two towers: one 14 stories tall and the other, 30.
To area residents who have been fighting the project for more than a decade, it is if they are back to Square 1.
"We feel like we're living a recurring nightmare," said Gary Fagin, a musician who lives on Water Street. "There is no comprehensible logic in what they are doing."
Others say the Milsteins may be betting that the commission's 10 members, 7 of whom were appointed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, may be more inclined to approve the project than their Dinkins-appointed predecessors were.
"The Giuliani administration really wants to see this built, and if you're appointed by the Mayor, you're more likely to do his bidding," said Franny Eberhart, executive director of the Historic Districts Council.
According to several appointees who spoke on the condition of anonymity, there is a good chance the commission will approve the $90 million project, which if built, would be the first unsubsidized residential housing in the Financial District in more than two decades. One commissioner who is undecided about the proposed design said he was troubled by the building's size.
"No matter how good the design, I don't see any graceful way to hide 400,000 square feet of building," he said.
James M. Yasser, executive vice president for Milstein Properties, declined to comment.
In the meantime, the Seaport Community Coalition, an organization of area residents, has hired an architect to study the economic feasibility of a low-rise building and to come up with an alternative design that it plans to present to the Landmarks Preservation Commission next month. Barbara Marks, the architect, said she hoped the commissioners would see that a smaller structure could still be profitable.
"To approve the design as it stands would be an absolute disgrace," said Ms. Marks, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. "We need to spark their imaginations, to show them that there are other possibilities."
Opponents of the Milstein project, citing the landmarks commission's past denial of similarly sized proposals, say they are prepared to sue the agency if it approves the current plan. ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
Relief on IRT, but Summer Squeeze Awaits

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
While cramped commuters on the No. 7 IRT train will receive some long-awaited relief this month when full express service is resumed, local politicians and riders are grumbling that riders will be squeezed again this summer when the Transit Authority cuts back on service.
The IRT line's rush-hour express from Main Street, Flushing, to the Queensboro Plaza, is scheduled to resume March 31. 
 The express service, which was cut back in 1993 because of track reconstruction, runs between Flushing and Woodside from 6:30 to 9:30 A.M and reverses from 12:30 to 8 P.M.
The resumption in service is expected to eliminate three minutes of commuting time for the more than 115,000 rush-hour riders.
"The increase in service will save money, recycle the trains more often, and move people through Queens more quickly,"said Termaine Garden, a spokesman for the Transit Authority.
"That's the good news," said State Senator Leonard P. Stavisky, who sent a letter last week to the Transit Authority complaining that the summer cutbacks were unwarranted.
As part of the Transit Authority's summer plan, the number of cars per train will be reduced to 10 from 11, leaving 29 cars to accommodate the 332,000 daily rides, instead of the usual 31.
Trains will alternate as express and local carriers.
For more than a decade, the Transit Authority has reduced service in July and August, citing a 10 percent drop in demand when many people go on vacation.
"The Transit Authority's numbers are outdated," Mr. Stavisky said, admitting that he had not taken the train in nearly a year since he had knee replacement surgery. "Flushing has changed. You have people working at all hours and on the weekends. In this economy, people don't take vacations. The No. 7 is very busy year round, and the cutbacks are not justified."
Mr. Stavisky is asking for a new summer-use study.
Mr. Garden acknowledged that the No. 7 was one of the busiest subway corridors in the city.
But he defended the plan to shorten trains during the summer.
"It's not a matter of money, although the taxpayers will save money," he said. "It's a matter of running the system more efficiently."
Yet many Queens commuters who work late on weekends said the trains were erratic at best at that hour.
"You come home at 8 on a Saturday night and you'll wait a half an hour for a train," said Jose Farvion, a painter in Manhattan. "Sometimes you feel forgotten." CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
Rental Car Insurance: Staying Out of Financial Potholes

BYLINE: By BRUCE FELTON 

 BODY:

Q. Is there a way to beat the high cost of insurance on car rentals?
 
A. Vacationing in France last summer, I drove my rented Audi into a pillar in an indoor parking garage, amputating the side-view mirror and putting a sharp crease in the front fender. As unnerved as I was by the accident, I was also pleased, because it meant I'd be getting a tangible payoff from the exorbitantly priced $20-a-day collision damage waiver I'd bought. 
 Given the high cost of car rental insurance, I'm probably not the first renter to rejoice about a minor smack-up. If you've rented recently, you know that checking the "accept" box next to all the options offered on a typical rental contract can add $30 or more to your daily costs.
Of those options, the collision damage waiver, which relieves customers of financial liability for loss or damage to the vehicle, is often the most expensive. According to a 1994 report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization in Washington, the price of the collision damage waiver increases the base rental price of the car, on average, by 46 percent a day and by as much as 93 percent.
Indiana, California, Nevada, and Texas limit the amount that can be charged for collision damage waivers, and New York and Illinois ban them altogether. Elsewhere in the United States, the insurance can easily cost about $19 a day, or the equivalent of nearly $7,000 a year, depending on the rental company, the location and the class of car. Hardly a bargain when you consider that a 30-year-old driver living in a high-premium area like New York City can insure a new Ford Taurus for about $2,100 and receive more coverage than what a collision damage waiver would provide.
But that isn't to say that the rental insurance must always be avoided. If you rent a car and don't have another means of insuring it, taking the insurance makes sense, regardless of the price. Otherwise, you will have to bear the full cost of repairing or replacing the car if it's stolen, vandalized or involved in an accident.
What many renters don't realize, however, is that there are often more economical alternatives. If you have your own car insurance, chances are that it covers rentals, at least in part. Moreover, some credit cards provide excess collision insurance that reimburses you for any costs not covered by your own policy, including the deductible. But even that coverage is rife with exceptions and could leave you with a big bill if you have an accident.
For example, the collision damage waiver and credit card insurance don't cover personal injury or personal liability. In other words, if you or your passengers are injured, no one is covered. If the accident involves another car, neither option will pay to repair it or to treat the injuries of the car's passengers. And if you are sued, the coverage will not pay your legal costs or pay any judgment against you.
The cards generally do not insure off-road vehicles, trucks, or cars valued at more than $50,000. Actually, off-road driving, regardless of the vehicle type, is a deal breaker: Should you have an accident while taking a shortcut across a peat bog or golf course, your coverage will be voided.
American Express excludes damage resulting from causes like illegal activity. The Mastercard Gold card will provide coverage only for a rental of up to 15 days and American Express for 30 days.
If you can live with these conditions, decline the insurance on the rental contract and stand your ground if the agent tries to pressure you into reconsidering. It happens. Renting a car at National Airport in Washington from Alamo Rent-a-Car, Anna Aurilio turned down the rental insurance because she was paying with an American Express card. The agent wasn't pleased. "He said to me, in a very unpleasant way: 'Never mind the credit card. You'll take complete responsibility for the car if anything happens to it,' " she said. "I still refused the coverage, but left feeling very paranoid."
Leslye Lewis-Page, a spokeswoman for Alamo, said that rental agents "are in no way encouraged to coerce customers into buying specific items." She did note, however, that compensation for employees was partly based on total sales of ancillary products, including collision damage waivers.
 While collision damage waivers and credit card insurance offer no liability or injury coverage, most rental companies are happy to fill the void with "personal accident insurance," for about $2 a day, and a "liability insurance supplement" for about $7.
Usually, you can safely pass on the personal accident insurance because "you're most likely covered against injury by your health insurance or the personal-injury protection in your own auto insurance," said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute.
Personal liability is more complicated. A Hertz brochure called, "Are You Protected?" states that without buying supplemental insurance some Hertz locations offer "no liability protection under the terms of the rental agreement from claims of injury by others against you resulting from an accident," and that others provide only as much protection as state law requires. Taking the liability insurance supplement increases your coverage substantially, but it may not be the most cost-effective approach.
If you're a frequent renter, consider buying an umbrella liability policy, which supplements the liability coverage in your homeowner's and automobile insurance. In New York City, $1 million of coverage from State Farm costs about $200 a year, said Steve Witmer, a company spokesman. There is also a form of auto insurance for people who don't own cars, but still drive. They are called "named nonowner" policies and cover drivers for liability. They generally cost $300 to $600 a year.
If you aren't sure where you stand, the time to find out is before you reach the car rental service counter. "Many renters wrongly assume the rental agent will know if they're covered," says Jan Armstrong, president of the American Car Rental Association, an industry group. "The best way to find out is to call your insurance agent and credit card company."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Auto Stocks: Beneath the Metallic Glow

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
RESENTED with the prospect of buying something for nearly nothing, investors might pull out their wallets or they might fret that their pockets are about to be picked. When it comes to investing in the auto makers, fretting seems to carry the day.
For more than a decade, various Wall Street analysts have periodically suggested that investors could get something for nothing by buying the Big Three auto makers' low-flying stocks. By their argument, the non-automotive assets alone are worth almost as much as all the outstanding stock at these companies, so investors essentially get the automotive operations free. Auto executives frustrated by the low values placed on their stocks have been quietly encouraging this analysis lately. . 
 But the argument has some serious shortcomings, as stock analysts and executives alike acknowledge when pressed. After the calculations are adjusted for these shortcomings, the auto makers' stocks are not such clear bargains.
"The initial reaction is, 'My gosh, this is a great time to buy the stock,' " said Jack Kirnan, an auto stocks analyst at Salomon Brothers. But after closer examination, he said, "what on the surface looks like a very attractive valuation may in reality still be too high a valuation."
The rosy view of the auto makers' balance sheets, particularly those of General Motors and Ford Motor, is that they are loaded with valuable, noncore assets that could be spun off or sold outright.
An estimated value for these non-automotive assets can be derived from the share prices and earnings of similar businesses elsewhere, like lending companies. Adding up the values of the non-automotive subsidiaries and dividing the total by the number of shares outstanding shows that the non-automotive assets appear to account for roughly all of the current share prices of Ford and G.M., and for roughly half the stock price of Chrysler. Such calculations by investment banks indicate that the troubled automotive operations at G.M. and Ford account for no part of the share price and that even Chrysler's highly successful auto businesses are selling for only 3.4 times earnings.
Critics of this approach say it relies on three flawed assumptions. The analysis treats each of the auto makers' huge finance subsidiaries as non-automotive assets that could be separated out, even though they are closely linked to the daily business of selling cars. The analysis also assumes that all the non-automotive assets could be sold or spun off without incurring heavy taxes. And, finally, the implicit suggestion is that the automotive operations would be worth owning even at a low price. (Some analysts think that the automotive operations may be worth nothing if the economy runs into trouble and causes the auto makers to lose billions of dollars again.)
The biggest issue lies in whether to classify the lucrative finance units as non-automotive assets. These units -- the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, Ford Credit and the Chrysler Financial Corporation -- mainly offer auto loans and leases to buyers of the parent company's vehicles. They also lend money to dealers to finance their inventories.
Auto executives are very reluctant to sell the finance businesses. In recessions, the finance units can be counted on to lend money to their customers when banks cannot. The units are essential to building good customer relationships in other ways, too. For example, they track when a customer's lease is set to expire and then try to sell the customer another car from the parent company; outside finance businesses typically try to lend money for any brand of car. The in-house finance businesses also make low-interest loans on car models that the auto makers need to move. And because independent dealers, not auto makers, actually sell the cars, it is often only through the finance company that an auto maker can glean information on who is buying its products.
Ford Credit is the most successful of the finance units, having made money every year since its creation in 1959. Ford Motor's low stock price suggests that investors give the parent company little extra for holding such a thriving business. Yet Ford Motor has little interest in letting go of it. "You never say never, but I can't see it -- the linkage is very important," said John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer.
Even Chrysler resisted selling its financing arm during its repeated struggles for survival over the last 20 years, and it has no plans to do so now. "Chrysler has been shedding its noncore operations and Chrysler Financial is deemed a core asset -- it's considered part of the distribution network," said John R. Ferry, a Chrysler Financial spokesman.
A FEW experts say the finance units could be sold. Frederick W. Zuckerman, who was Chrysler's treasurer through the 1980's, said the company had come close to selling its financial arm, and he thinks that one of the auto makers will eventually do so. He said it should be possible to write a contract with a spun-off finance subsidiary requiring it to keep serving the parent company's needs.
So far, the auto makers' attitude has been "I don't want to go first," he said. But such a sale might be a few years away, he added.
The tax consequences of selling some subsidiaries are hard to measure. G.M. spun off Electronic Data Systems last year while convincing the Internal Revenue Service that it did not owe any taxes, after putting $8 billion of E.D.S. stock into its pension fund.
G.M.'s pending sale of the military businesses of its Hughes Electronics unit to the Raytheon Company has also been carefully structured to avoid taxes. But the deal has attracted so much attention that it may have "poisoned the well" for favorable tax treatment of other deals, said a Big Three executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Counting the finance units as part of the automotive businesses, and making a rough estimate of any taxes that might be due, the automotive operations of the Big Three still sell for extremely low multiples of their estimated 1997 earnings.
But many analysts argue that these low multiples are justified given the risk that rising interest rates and a strong dollar pose to the cyclical auto business.
"In effect we've got a business with no growth, vicious competition, that is littered with overcapacity and has little control over its destiny," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz, a New York brokerage firm. The auto makers are powerless to stop the dollar's strengthening, which has caused auto imports from Japan to soar in the last six months.
If the economy stays strong with low interest rates, and if Ford and G.M. can generate consistent profits from their core auto businesses, the stocks could someday turn out to have been tremendous bargains now, said Nicholas J. Colas, an auto analyst at CS First Boston.
G.M.'s stock rose only 3.5 percent for the 12 months ended on Thursday, while Ford's stock fell 5.6 percent and Chrysler's fell 7.5 percent. During the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.6 percent.
For now, with the dollar and interest rates rising, Mr. Colas said, "things will be very tough, and they will get worse before they get better."

Business District Looking to Stretch Its Boundaries

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Three years after its formation, the 125th Street Business Improvement District, which runs from Fifth Avenue to Morningside Avenue, has received a grant to study whether to expand its boundaries to Second Avenue and 12th Avenue.
The grant -- the amount has not been determined -- is part of a $2.4 million package from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone to help improve business in northern Manhattan by expanding three BID's, including the Washington Heights BID and the Lower Heights BID. The package would also provide grants to 150 merchants along major commercial arteries near 116th, 125th, 159th and 181st Streets. 
 Property owners, some major commercial tenants and Community Boards 9 and 11 have enthusiastically endorsed the expansion of the 125th Street BID. But the number of tax-exempt properties, like nonprofit organizations, churches and government-owned buildings in the expansion areas, is likely to be a major stumbling block for the BID, which already has five such properties within current boundaries. BID's are supported by special taxes collected from commercial property owners, which are typically passed on to tenants.
"In an area like Harlem, the presence of government entities and social services agencies on our commercial strip make it more challenging for us," said Barbara Askins, executive director of the 125th Street Bid.
Ms. Askins said the two major developments in East Harlem -- the Magic Johnson theater complex and the Pathmark commercial complex -- and the commercial property base in West Harlem make it feasible for the BID to expand. But she added that it would still be a challenge to finance services for the expanded area. She cited the number of city-owned vacant lots, empty store fronts and the general lackluster economic climate in East Harlem, as well as the mammoth public housing project, the Grant Houses, in West Harlem.
The cost of providing BID services to the five fully or partly tax-exempt properties -- the Apollo Theater, LaGree Baptist Church, the Post Office, Empire Baptist Missionary Church and the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building -- is offset by the larger tax-producing properties such as Nynex, Con Edison and the Theresa Towers, Ms. Askins said. That would not be the case in East Harlem, which lacks the large businesses. But Ms. Askins said the BID will be aided by a resolution passed by the City Council Thursday that would make it possible to collect taxes on the commercial portion of the 15 city-owned buildings in East Harlem.
To make up for the gap, Ms. Askins is negotiating with property owners within the existing BID to provide services in lieu of the assessed taxes.
Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said her agency has agreed to pay the BID to manage the city-owned parking garage and nine storefronts it owns in the State Office Building. Ms. Askins said similar plans are also being worked out with the Apollo Theater to provide support services. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: U.S. Mustn't Meddle in Russia's Politics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Helsinki Hopes" (column, March 16), William Safire gets some facts wrong. For example, it is incorrect to say that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is "$10 billion short in payments of wages to teachers, police and the military"; only 20 percent of this sum is owed by the Government, the rest by privatized factories. 
 But more to the point, Mr. Safire makes the remarkable, even fanciful recommendation that President Clinton should impose political conditionality on President Yeltsin by making it plain that "America would respond positively to a Yeltsin coalition with Yabloko's democratic reformers," led by Grigory Yavlinsky.
This suggestion must be roundly rejected. Economic conditionality is hard enough to impose. But the idea that Mr. Clinton can get Mr. Yeltsin and Anatoly Chubais, the First Deputy Prime Minister, to accept a political coalition, especially with Mr. Yavlinsky under the latter's "condition," as Mr. Safire desires, is hard to take seriously.
This is all the more so when Mr. Chubais has just consolidated his position within the Government, with the appointment of key loyalists like the reformist governor Boris Nemtsov, the privatizer Alfred Kokh and the economics expert Yakov Yurinson to the new Russian Cabinet, weakening any bargaining position that Mr. Yavlinsky may have hoped for earlier. Indeed, Mr. Yavlinsky may well find himself in the role of a "permanent oppozitsioner," a title bestowed on him by Gen. Aleksandr Lebed.
But then Mr. Chubais's own commitment to reforms need not be doubted. Nor his strategic sense, which was in full display in insuring Mr. Yeltsin's re-election and is to be inferred from Mr. Yeltsin's anointment of him as the economics czar leading the next stage of reforms. Mr. Safire's misgivings, prompted by his admiration for Mr. Yavlinsky, are misplaced.

HEADLINE: COPING;
A Farewell to Two Nobles Who Never Met

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
PEOPLE make places. The Queen of Gramercy Park and the Mayor of Union Square moved on this month, to greener acres. They lived less than 10 blocks apart, but came from different centuries. Both represented the duchies that flourish within democracy.
Mrs. Constance D. Gibson, who died on March 15, three weeks before her 95th birthday, was a Victorian lady, warm, elegant and witty. She owned a large town house overlooking the locked, private park, of which she was a life trustee. Connie Gibson, a member of the Daughters of the British Empire, was far surer of her education and social position than most of the people around her, and so could use the whip of manners for political effect. Her generation's stewardship of the park as a bucolic sanctuary for the fortunate few has been challenged in a legal mud-wrestling contest that carefully avoided spattering her. 
 It was the one local fight that Robert W. Walsh, a brash 37-year-old who rented in Stuyvesant Town, absolutely refused to join. Rob Walsh is smart, ambitious and charming in that handsome bad-boy way that wins the hearts of older men who admire the steel behind the smile. A master deal-cutter, he recently cut a deal for himself to revitalize the downtown area of Charlotte, N.C., where he will move this week.
As executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District and Local Development Corporation, he presided over the neighborhood's return to the gold and glory of being a "destination" and a "hub" after years of decay and neglect. He helped turn Union Square Park into an urban oasis for everyone.
In recent years, the Gramercy Park gardener, Peggy Herron, took to wearing bright red berets so that Mrs. Gibson, from her window, could follow her progess along the flower beds. The Queen was always watching, even when she was no longer "full of beans." Her friend and helper, Sally Holmes Holtze, the writer, remembers conversations that ranged from 13th-century Limoges enamels, which Mrs. Gibson studied at the Sorbonne after Bryn Mawr, to such practical advice as "never to trust a man to remember to mail letters."
The last time I saw Mrs. Gibson she urged me to stay until midnight when her husband, Brig. Gen. Herbert D. Gibson, would return from his inspection of upstate boys' schools. The general, she said, was concerned about the erosion of discipline in modern youth. I declined the invitation because I knew Mrs. Gibson needed her rest, not because I also knew that the general had been dead for 16 years. She was so confident that I would not have been surprised if he had marched in then, in dress blues, and swept Connie across the dance floor, as he would forever in the photo on the dresser.
Rob Walsh was raised mostly in Bensonhurst, the fifth of seven children of an Italian mother and an Irish father. He went to Fordham and worked in city government. The first time I saw him, he told me a story that may just define him, if only because he tells it. In 1989, he came back from a vacation at the Yankees' spring training camp to be interviewed for the Union Squre job by the president of the New School, Jonathan F. Fanton. Mr. Fanton asked him what he thought of Tommy John's chances. Mr. Walsh said that the aging pitcher was washed up and should retire. Mr. Fanton said Tommy John was his favorite player.
Mr. Walsh said he immediately stood up, walked out of the room, came right back and said, "Hi, I'm Rob Walsh, just back from spring training, where I saw Tommy John, my favorite player." He laughed and winked when he told that story.
Mr. Walsh helped improve 14th Street, and he built bridges between the business and arts communities and the struggling Washington Irving High School. He thinks he made his mark by closing down the Underground, a violent disco whose patrons would pour out into Union Square at dawn on Saturdays and attack the farmers setting up in the Greenmarket, which became the public jewel of the neighborhood.
Mr. Walsh merely rolled his eyes when asked about the private jewel, Gramercy Park, and its tree wars. That was a no-win for a deal-cutting, unelected politician whose job is to represent business interests, which want a more stable, long-term government than the one in City Hall. Mrs. Gibson represented older money's need to protect itself from the incursions of the less or more recently fortunate. Their constituencies intersected, often at the National Arts Club. But Connie and Rob, in their different orbits, did not even know of each other.
Mrs. Gibson was cremated and her remains will be buried in the Arlington National Cemetery beside the general, although there were romantics who imagined her secretly interred beneath a tree in her park. It would not take long to recruit that pick-and-shovel crew. And I think Mr. Walsh, who will someday be back, has the heart to dig it, too.

HEADLINE: Tour de New York

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
FOR a time in the 1970's, Alan F. Lowe was high on cycling in New York. He would slip out from his Houston Street apartment, straddle his 10-speed bike, and speed north up the Avenue of the Americas to Central Park, trying to achieve "harmony with the traffic" and not to stop even once. "The idea was to never have to put my feet down on pavement," he said.
He and other cyclists exchanged heady talk of bike paths that would crisscross the five boroughs and hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who would abandon their cars for human-powered, pollution-free transportation. 
 But in the 80's, the Balkan wars broke out, with cyclists pitted against cab drivers, bike messengers against pedestrians and in-line skaters against all of them. Add a boom in bike thefts, deteriorating streets and increasingly sclerotic traffic, and New York cycling seemed mired in a funk more paralyzing than a flat in the mud. In 1990 Bicycling magazine named the city (along with Orlando and Pittsburgh) the worst for cycling in the country.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Lowe, 59, the producer of a cable television program, "The Bike Show," began feeling less in harmony with the city's traffic. He had two concussion-inducing accidents -- one when a defective handlebar broke off in Times Square, the other when a car pulled in front of him in Chelsea. Last month another accident, again with a car, left him with a scrape from his right eyebrow to the left side of his chin. Still, he said: "I love to ride. I'm just older and more cautious now."
Today, cycling in the city seems to have reached, if not the top of the hill, then a point where the worst of its climb is behind it. The city's Department of Transportation counted a record 14,890 cyclists in Manhattan on an average day in 1995, up 36 percent from 1990. Transportation Alternatives, a bicycle advocacy group, estimates citywide ridership at nearly 50,000. Bike thefts are down and 350 miles of new bike paths are planned for the five boroughs by the year 2020. The paths are known as Greenway projects and can be used by joggers, pedestrians and in-line skaters as well.
Construction on the first of these is to begin this summer, and in the next two years 11 paths and esplanades totaling 45 miles are to be completed. Another part of Greenway, focusing on repairing and expanding an existing 500 miles of bike paths, some dating to the 1930's, is also to begin in earnest this year.
"This will be a big change," said Irv Weisman, a former president of the New York Cycle Club who has ridden a bicycle in the city since 1948. "We're talking Central Park without cars, except it's all over Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. It'll be a cyclist's highway."
But before you try out that highway, it's wise to learn about the equipment you'll need, the rules you have to follow and where you want to go. This cyclists' guide to New York does not resemble Douglas Adams's novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," except for that mythical electronic guide's friendly advice: Don't Panic.
One school of thought asserts that the perfect city bike is a clunker, a rusty-fendered monster ugly enough to repel thieves but durable enough to resist potholes. Adherents tend to be bike aficionados adept at replacing worn seats and bent fenders. But if they were car owners, they would be members of the "My Other Car Is a Lamborghini" School because they also tend to own $3,000 Italian racing bikes for more serious cycling.
But for the sake of comfort, getting around the city on a garage-sale model is a no-go. Most city cyclists recommend either a mountain bike, with its knobby fat tires and upright handlebars, or its close cousin, the hybrid, which has smoother, narrower tires for a faster ride. On city streets mountain bikes and hybrids shake less than racing and touring bikes, which have thinner frames, more slender tires and curved handle bars. And their tires resist punctures better.
 
Wanted in Bike Shops: Service and Inventory
Buying such a bike means visiting a New York bike shop. Like supermarkets, city bike shops tend to be smaller than their suburban counterparts. Thus, two things a cycling customer wants -- inventory and service -- are often lacking. Some cycling cynics buy all their parts from catalogues since mail-order companies can at least provide inventory.
But those customers also tend to be from the "My Other Bike Is a Racing Bike" School. For both the novice and the enthusiast, a good bike shop is often essential. After more than 15 years of living and cycling in New York, David Perry, a former bike racer from bike-friendly Palo Alto, Calif., and the author of "Bike Cult" (Four Walls Eight Windows, $23.95), says it is important to look for seemingly small features in such a shop.
For example, he said, female employees may indicate that the shop will have less of that "obnoxious adolescent male techno-geek sarcasm" of an all-male bike shop. The same, he said, would be true for middle-aged employees of either sex because their presence might show "a sense of loving cycling versus being in the cycling business."
Parts bins and a variety of bicycles are also good signs because they indicate the store depends on repairs and repeat sales. And a community bulletin board, with lots of cycling literature and local cycling newspapers, shows that the store has ties to the neighborhood.
Like an auto dealer, a bicycle dealer is giving advice on an expensive purchase. The best-selling bike at A Bicycle Shop, a well-known shop at 349 West 14th Street on the edge of Greenwich Village, is a Specialized "Hard Rock" 21-speed mountain bike, costing from $270 (for a mostly steel frame) to as much as $400 (for a lighter, mostly aluminum frame).
But unlike an auto dealer, a bike dealer also fits the vehicle to the rider's exact body type. Among cyclists, "fit" continues to be a subject of much academic debate, with esoteric theories and arcane mathematics used to determine the perfect relationship of frame, seat and handlebars to legs, neck and back. But the wrong fit will mean a far-from-academic reduction in performance and a possible source of pain, like buying skis that are too long.
The last decade has seen marked improvements in bike equipment. Tires lined with the fiber Kevlar, also used in bulletproof vests, resist punctures better than earlier tires, important on glass-strewn city streets. "Index shifting" makes for smoother gear-changing, not the Marley's Ghost clanking of chains from a baby boomer's youth. Most manufacturers have also moved gear-shift levers from the bottom tube of the frame to the handle bars, making it easier for the cyclist to shift gears without shifting body position or attention, another important factor in urban cycling.
However irritating non-cyclists' japes about "helmet hair" might be, helmets are critical to cushioning the head in a fall. When the head hits the ground, the brain remains in motion, colliding with the inside of the skull and bruising brain tissue. Helmets made out of specially hardened foam that weighs a few ounces can absorb most of the shock. But helmets should conform to American National Standards Institute or Snell Memorial Foundation standards. And they should fit snugly, since a loose helmet tipped rakishly to the side provides no protection at all.
No tire is impregnable to New York glass, nails and other detritus, so it is a good idea to put together a roadside repair kit consisting of a spare tube, tire levers, a patch kit, a saddlebag and a portable pump that can be mounted on the frame.
But unless you're a championship bodybuilder, such a pump is good only for inflating a flat tire to rideable pressure. A floor-mounted pump with a pressure gauge will enable tires to be inflated to 80 pounds or more. Another bonus: a floor pump's pressure gauge is often more accurate than the gauges at filling stations, which helps a cyclist to avoid under-inflation (which can lead to flat tires) or overinflation (and possible explosion).
Adults carrying children should remember that rear-mounted seats are designed for youngsters up to 40 pounds, roughly 4 years old or so. (It is illegal to carry a child less than a year old.) Seats that mount on the frame, between the adult and the handlebars, can be dangerous because the child can interfere with the adult's concentration or steering.
Once a shiny new bike is properly equipped, attention turns to the inevitable New York question: how long will it take for thieves to steal it? With the right precautions, maybe forever.
For the most expensive bikes, eternal vigilance is the only answer. Conrad's, a bike shop at 25 Tudor City Place on the East Side that caters to elite racers and enthusiasts, carries very few locks. The owner, John Tsang, points overhead to exotic titanium and carbon-fiber bike frames costing $3,000 and up.
"Nobody in their right mind," he said, "would lock up one of these bikes."
Police statistics show a drop in bike thefts, but whether this is due to the recent decline in crime citywide (many bikes were stolen to finance drug purchases) or better security tactics by bike owners, or both, is unclear.
Thefts peaked at 15,316 in 1975. From 1990 to 1995 annual thefts averaged fewer than 6,300 bikes. In 1995, the latest year for which data are available, 6,178 bikes were stolen with an estimated value of nearly $1.5 million, or about $240 per bike. And once-notorious open-air markets that trafficked in stolen bikes, like the one near St. Marks Place and Second Avenue, seem to have disappeared.
 
'New York Lock' and $2,000 Guarantee
In the 1980's, when bike thefts were more rampant, the Kryptonite Corporation of Canton, Mass., first marketed its "unbreakable" U-shaped lock with a $1,000 guarantee to cover the cost of replacing any stolen bicycle. But deluged with successful claims from New York, it withdrew the lock from city stores in 1988.
At the time it discovered that nearly half of its Manhattan claims came from just four zip codes: 10011 (Chelsea and Union Square), 10003 (Gramercy Park and Union Square), 10014 (the West Village) and 10023 (the Upper West Side).
In 1994, the company introduced a stronger, heavier "New York Lock," which carried a $2,000 guarantee.
Another bicycle lock, a favorite of bike messengers, is the Quadrachain, a 5.1-pound, six-foot behemoth of "through-hardened" steel alloy that the manufacturer says requires 50 percent more pressure from the bolt cutters commonly used by thieves. The chain's unusual square design, which differs from the more common tube design of other chains, is said to disperse the cutters' slicing pressure rendering them less effective.
Serious bikers commonly use two locks -- a U-shaped one like the Kryptonite lock and a hefty chain like the Quadrachain -- on the theory that roving thieves will carry either bolt cutters or lead pipes (used to pry open U-locks) but rarely both. Even if carrying a full larcenous assortment of tools, a thief may not want to spend twice the time with a double-cosseted bike.
Finding a place to lock a bike in the city may soon be easier. Some $1.1 million in state and Federal money has been set aside for 2,200 bike racks to be installed by next year. The city's Department of Transportation has installed 170 so far, with another 330 due this summer. And six privately owned garages and 12 city-owned garages in Manhattan and the other boroughs offer free space for bikes.
Assuming your bike evades theft, how do you avoid colliding with cars, buses and trucks? Mr. Weisman, the former New York Cycle Club president, who teaches a class on "effective cycling" in Central Park, suggests three principles.
First, "stay conspicuous." Cyclists should wear bright colors so drivers can see them, especially at dusk.
"I hate what's in fashion now," Mr. Weisman said, referring to the blues, grays and blacks that are the current trend-setters in helmets, jerseys and saddlebags. "It's a suicide-watch with that stuff."
"Ride as if something is going to happen" is Mr. Weisman's second principle. "Don't weave in and out of traffic," he said. "Be as predictable as possible because drivers associate bikes with children and children are unpredictable."
Colliding with open taxi doors is one of the most common accidents in New York. Among bike messengers, "Look for the lean and listen for the click" is a familiar adage. It is based on the tendency of taxi passengers to lean back before opening their doors. The click of the door lock can often be heard a car-length away before the door itself swings open.
The third Weisman principle is "Let the world know what you're doing" with standard hand signals and some not-so-standard, but obvious, ones. Often oncoming vehicles fail to signal that they are about to turn left, Mr. Weisman said, swerving in front of a cyclist. But a cyclist who points at the intersection ahead, will alert most drivers that he plans to ride through the intersection.
 
A Legacy Of Failed Lanes
The number of collisions between cyclists and pedestrians in the city remains high, but has declined somewhat from its peak of 707 in 1985 (with 747 injuries and two deaths). Crashes totaled 625 in 1994, up from 329 in 1990, according to the Department of Transportation, which compiles Police Department statistics. A computer glitch destroyed data for 1995 and data for 1996 is not yet available.
If Robert Kotch, a former bike messenger and president of Breakaway Courier Systems is any indication, bike messengers are getting in fewer collisions. In 1995, his 115-messenger firm had 20 accidents serious enough to file for workers' compensation; last year the total was three. The firm has intensive safety seminars, and Mr. Kotch disciplines riders he considers unsafe.
"If I think they're reckless, I make them deliver packages on foot," he said. "Most of the time, they quit. Sometimes I have to fire them."
For many seasoned cyclists, crowded Manhattan is the borough to escape from, but a new Federal-city project is trying to provide a reason other than the loop in Central Park to cycle in the borough.
The project is, in part, a legacy of the failed bike lanes installed by Mayor Edward I. Koch in the summer of 1980 on the Avenue of the Americas and two other avenues between Washington Square and Central Park. When ridership declined abruptly that fall the Mayor ordered the lane barriers removed. In 1994, the project, known as Bicycle Network Development, began identifying 500 miles of possible bike paths, some in Manhattan, to be marked by signs and sometimes by lane markings.
Like the Bicycle Network, the more extensive Greenways projects are being paid for out of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, the omnibus Federal highway construction bill known as "Ice-T" for short.
But unlike Bicycle Network paths, Greenways paths are to be separated from traffic by barriers or landscaping. About $12 million is scheduled to be spent for 11 Greenways projects by early next year, the largest of which is the Queens Pedestrian/Bicycle Greenway, about 22 miles from Little Bay Park, near the Throgs Neck Bridge south to the Ridgewood Reservoir.
 
Bridges Are Keys To Green Paths
Smaller stretches are planned near Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, where Amelia Earhart once flew, and between Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach.
Two projects are scheduled for the Bronx, near Pelham Bay Park and Soundview Park. Staten Island is to get an extensive five-mile bike path, stretching from near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge southwest to Great Kills Bay.
And new paths are planned in Manhattan this year: Cherry Walk, a mile-long path along the Hudson River between 96th and 125th Streets, as well as a mile-long path connecting the South Street Seaport with East River Park.
"But Greenways won't work unless the bridges to and from Manhattan become more accessible," said David Lutz, the program director for the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group. At the moment, only the Brooklyn and George Washington bridges are fully ramped and well-maintained enough for cyclists to use, he said.
As part of a plan to ease traffic congestion on the Upper East Side, cyclists are banned from the bike paths of the Queensboro Bridge from 3 P.M. to 8 P.M. and must ride with their bikes in city-operated vans. Besides, Mr Lutz pointed out, the bridge's metal grating is wide enough to trap bike tires and throw riders.
The Williamsburg Bridge is so poorly maintained that cyclists call it the "Ho Chi Minh Trail" for its numerous cracks. And the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn bans bicycles altogether.
For New York cyclists, the ideal would be a major Manhattan avenue permanently closed to cars. Mr. Kotch, of Breakaway Courier Systems, maintains that Lexington and Madison Avenues are able to carry enough traffic to allow the city to close Park Avenue. With its grass median, "Park Avenue would make a great bike lane," he said. "I dream of it at nights."
Then he pauses. "Fat chance."
 
Where Bikes Are Welcome
 "We're the most bike-friendly borough," declares the president of the Staten Island Bicycling Association, Richard J. Coronato. Many of the club's 200 members will meet visiting cyclists at St. George Station, the docking point of the Staten Island Ferry, which allows bikes on board at no extra charge. Members will then show the visitors around the 60-square-mile island.
Staten Island has a variety of elevations, like Todt Hill (pronounced "tote," Dutch for death), which at more than 400 feet is the highest natural coastal elevation between Maine and Florida. The terrain offers challenges for A-rated riders, those who can speed along comfortably at 18 miles hour, as well as C-rated riders, who chug along at 13 miles an hour or less.
Mr. Coronato recommended the following casual ride for C riders, which is over flat terrain along the waterfront and should take about two hours. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: Loyalty and the Press;
Why Clinton Is Such An Ink-Stained Wretch

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REMEMBER the 'giant sucking sound' that Ross Perot kept talking about?" The Philadelphia Inquirer editorialized last week. "It turned out to be Bill Clinton's money pump.
"The 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign," the editorial continued, "was pumping funds from everybody and anybody, legal or not, with a reckless abandon that will go down in the history books." 
 This, mind you, was not from some Republican organ. The Inquirer advocated President Clinton's re-election and normally supports Democratic candidates and Democratic policies. Now, like so many other such papers, the Inquirer has turned against him with a vengeance on the editorial page.
"In journalistic terms, Bill Clinton has no friend in court," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in the relationship between the Government and the press.
When Republican politicians get in trouble, the instinct of Republican editorial writers and columnists is usually to circle the wagons.
Editorial pages like those of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times have been critical of Speaker Newt Gingrich on some matters, but they defended him without reservation in his ethical tribulations early this year.
As the Gingrich controversy was being debated, The Weekly Standard, the political magazine launched in 1995 by Rupert Murdoch to air his conservative, Republican views, ran an editorial under the headline: "Stand By Your Man."
Conservative editorialists and columnists were also solidly on the side of President Reagan during the Iran-contra tumult a decade ago.
Even during Watergate, the conservative editorial pages of The Chicago Tribune and The Omaha World-Herald remained on the side of Richard M. Nixon until the damaging contents of the White House tapes were finally made public. The Wall Street Journal went even further, defending Mr. Nixon almost until the day he resigned.
 
Piling On
 But no comparable Democratic press exists. When a Democratic politician runs into difficulty as Mr. Clinton has now, or as former Speaker Jim Wright did in 1989, the instinct of normally Democratic editorialists and columnists seems to be to pile on.
A White House official who follows press coverage could not identify any big-city paper or national magazine that has defended Mr. Clinton against charges of abusive campaign finance practices.
The New York Times, which also endorsed Mr. Clinton for re-election, has been among the most critical. After a Clinton news conference this month, The Times editorialized: "It was a fluid performance in Mr. Clinton's best slide-and-glide style. But most Americans do not believe in a universe where Johnny Chung hustles Presidential photo ops, Vice President Al Gore's telephoning is described as a model of political dignity and Maggie Williams's palming of a $50,000 check is praised as artful handling of a strained social situation."
Even The Nation, the most doggedly liberal of the national magazines, has criticized Mr. Clinton on the subject of campaign finance.
Mr. Clinton's standing is even worse than it might otherwise be because clean elections and campaign finance reform are staples of liberal doctrine.
Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trust, described the situation this way: "There is more of a team mentality on the conservative side. There is, for instance, a great deal more intellectual collaboration between The Wall Street Journal editorial pages and Republican policy-makers than there is with any liberal editorial page and any Democratic policy-maker. There is no sense of loyalty to party among liberal commentators and editorial pages."
Commentators on both sides agree with that analysis. "We feel very loyal to principles; we do not feel any loyalty to a particular party or politician," said Jane R. Eisner, editorial page editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Howell Raines, the editorial page editor of The Times, said that the healthiest development in journalism since World War II has been journalists' "shedding the mantle of partisanship and beginning to think of themselves as politically independent."
Robert L. Bartley, editor of The Wall Street Journal, took a somewhat different tack. He said he did not think of the matter in terms of party but in terms of conservative versus liberal.
"You didn't see us jumping up and down in defense of Bob Packwood," he said. Senator Packwood, a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and disavowed supply-side economics, was forced to resign in 1995 over charges of sexual misconduct. What if the same charges had been brought against Mr. Gingrich or Dick Armey, the House Republican leader, or some other staunch conservative? Mr. Bartley was asked.
"Yeah, we would have defended them," he replied. "That's the way it is.
"The drift of American journalism is liberal," Mr. Bartley said. "What we do a lot of is lean against the wind of the general news coverage. That's not a problem for liberal editorial pages. They don't have a wind to lean against."
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, had another distinction. "Democratic Party leaders," he said, "don't mean as much to liberals as Republican Party leaders have meant to conservatives."
He added: "Reagan and Gingrich weren't just party leaders. They were leaders of the conservative movement. Therefore, the assaults on Reagan and Gingrich were assaults on the conservative movement."
Conservative editorial writers, Mr. Kristol said, often think of themselves as "shaping the agenda for a movement." Their liberal counterparts, he said, have more "the tone of preaching eternal truths to an unenlightened citizenry."

Albania Is Cast Adrift

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania

 BODY:
WHEN James A. Baker 3d visited this dilapidated capital as the American Secretary of State six years ago, hundreds of thousands of Albanians thronged the streets, and those who could get close enough kissed his car. While here, Mr. Baker met with the opposition leader Sali Berisha, a tall, ruddy-faced heart surgeon with leonine hair and a tempestuous personality who had been anointed as the man Washington would do business with.
Mr. Berisha went on to win the elections America hoped he would win, and to install a semblance of democracy. Then -- more to the point -- he went on to provide a quiet base for America's efforts to calm the volcano erupting next door in what had been Yugoslavia. 
 Now, little more than five years later, Mr. Berisha's rule has been discredited as a sham democracy in the service of greed, and Albania has collapsed in anarchy. But the crisis next door seems in remission, and so the rest of the world has until now maintained its distance. Certainly, nobody is rushing to prop up Mr. Berisha -- or his country. Quite the contrary. Mr. Berisha's former backers in America are calling for him to quit, while offering Albania little else.
It seems reminiscent of other crises in other strategic places -- Central America, Afghanistan, Zaire -- where America would pick an ally, promote him as a lover of freedom and rely on him to help guard the Free World's far-flung ramparts. When the cold war ended, the truth would emerge about these allies, and their countries would be left more or less alone to pick through the wreckage that these lovers of freedom had wrought.
All this was supposed to have ended with the cold war, but then came Bosnia.
And now, Albania.
 
Stability
 Mr. Berisha, the argument in his favor went, was more than an internal reformer for Albania; he offered stability in the Balkans. What his American supporters seem to have missed was that he had been indelibly shaped by the Marxist-Leninist regime of his Communist predecessor, Enver Hoxha; today it can be admitted that, as one American official put it, he turned out to be "a crackpot dictator." In other words, just another Balkan strongman who, in his case, served Western interests during the Bosnian war and can now be counted as expendable.
In the beginning, the match between what Washington wanted and what Mr. Berisha was offering seemed ideal.
Shut off from the world during xenophobic Communism, Albanians had long hungered for all things American: blue jeans, Coca- Cola, women's makeup, Hollywood videos. Mr. Berisha was elected in 1992 after a campaign in which America's then-Ambassador, William Ryerson, appeared on his campaign platforms.
Mr. Berisha espoused free market policies, and once-drab Albania soon began to feel like an exotic bazaar (even though many of the imports were smuggled goods). A country that had only one fax machine in 1991 soon had mobile phones and imported cars. The International Monetary Fund gave Mr. Berisha glowing reports for clamping down on inflation and encouraging privatization, even as it ignored the corruption that was coming to pervade the economy.
Meanwhile, as Yugoslavia cracked wide open, Mr. Berisha, who comes from the rugged northern part of Albania near the border of Kosovo, promised to be useful in containing the war. Kosovo is an Albanian enclave in Serbia where the Albanians are kept in check by a repressive Serbian police force, and even before Bosnia exploded it seemed likely to become a nightmarish flashpoint for ethnic hatreds. So Mr. Berisha repeatedly did Washington's bidding to help calm Kosovo, using his influence there to insure that its Albanians did not challenge the status quo.
And as the war in Bosnia intensified, Mr. Berisha proved more than happy to have his country used as a doormat by the Pentagon. American unmanned spy planes were based at an airfield in the northern region of Lezhe for their missions to identify NATO bombing targets. American warships had access to the Albanian waters of the Adriatic Sea that the Soviets had once used to flank Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia.
For all of this, Mr. Berisha's price was low: About $30 million of nonlethal military equipment like used trucks and uniforms was sent by the Pentagon. Military officers were offered training in the United States. (Several defected.)
 
Advice
 Although Albania was so backward, it seemed such a desirable piece of real estate during the Bosnia war that the United States and Europe treated it like a colony. Influence in the Government was divided up: the United States put advisers in the presidency and the Ministries of Finance and Defense, Italy advised the Privatization Ministry, and Germany helped out at the Ministry of Interior. The European Union poured in about $800 million in assistance, making Albania the recipient of the highest per-capita aid of any country in Eastern Europe.
While they still felt they needed Mr. Berisha, his Western benefactors ignored his authoritarian habits. Six months after his election, Mr. Berisha fired his attorney general for opposing a law that gave the police wide discretion in searching homes. Journalists were harassed by the secret police, the main opposition leader was convicted of fraud in a trial that human rights advocates consider suspect, the ruling party was purged, and officials who didn't toe the Berisha line were dismissed from the courts, the army, even the Institute of Fine Arts.
Last May, Mr. Berisha went a step too far and blatantly rigged parliamentary elections, then sent police to beat up protesters. The United States complained publicly, but by that stage it was easy to do. The fighting in Bosnia had been declared over, and the need to have Mr. Berisha on Washington's side had diminished, at least for the moment.
Officials in Washington also warned the Berisha Government that the pyramid schemes in which most Albanians had invested money would collapse, wreaking havoc in the economy. Even so, few in Washington seem to have foreseen just how bad the wreckage would be -- how many Albanians, such dreamers of the American dream, would be left even poorer than when they had emerged from Communism. Nor did anyone predict that Mr. Berisha's misrule would ignite the popular insurgencies that have left the country such a thoroughly disorganized armed camp.
"The irony is that Berisha was supported as a factor of stability in the region," said Fred Abrahams, a research associate at Human Rights Watch in New York. "And now we have the greatest threat to stability in the region since the signing of the Dayton peace accords."

Guess Who's Giving the Voters a Choice

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

 BODY:
IT is not what one might expect from Iran.
On May 23, all Iranian citizens over the age of 15 -- both male and female -- are eligible to cast their ballots in the most significant contest for the Presidency in Iran's 18-year-old revolution. 
 Officially, none of the candidates has been approved and the campaign is still weeks away.
But the front runner, using his power base as speaker of the Parliament, is making promises to improve the economy, keep away from the United States and enforce stricter Islamic law. The leading underdog, wooing women and teen-agers for their votes, is pledging more personal freedoms, more jobs and no more male supremacy. And eight other would-be candidates are struggling to be heard.
This is Presidential politics, Iranian-style: tough, nasty, confusing and full of alliance-building, horse-trading and mud-slinging. And all of it falls within the confines of the Islamic Republic.
 
Repression and Debate
 Is it democracy? Not by Western standards. But it is not the dictatorial system that the State Department has called it either.
Rather, Iran is at the same time a country of brutal and unnerving repression, and one with flashes of surprisingly open political debate. It is a combination designed to keep an elite acceptable to the Islamic Republic in power, and the population in check.
"There is space -- but only restricted space -- for political competition in Iran," said Shaul Bakhash, a historian who writes extensively on Iran. "The competition is limited to candidates and groups acceptable to the regime, and outsiders are not allowed to seriously participate in elections or the political process. I call it the politics of the ruling elite."
The reason there is a Presidential election at all is that President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has already served the maximum two four-year terms allowed under Iran's Constitution.
For months now, the leading candidate has been Ali Akbar Nateq-Noori, the speaker of Iran's Parliament and a mid-level clergyman with unimpressive religious credentials. Just a few months ago, he seemed a shoo-in.
But at least one other candidate has emerged as a serious contender: Mohammad Khatami, a cleric who served as Minister of Islamic Guidance for a decade until he was forced to resign for allowing too much freedom in the press, publishing and the arts.
Still, it isn't just anyone who can run for president. The Council of Guardians, a body that is dominated by the clerics and supervises elections, must approve all candidates. In last year's parliamentary election, the council disqualified about 40 percent of the 5,000 would-be candidates. In the last Presidential election, in 1993, more than 100 candidates tried to run; only three eventually did. And although Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has declared himself neutral in the coming presidential election, no candidate who did not meet with his approval could run.
Still, as the balloting draws near, what looks like a campaign of genuine issues and candidates is playing out.
Officially, political parties are banned in Iran, but clearly identifiable factions with clearly identifiable views are not. Mr. Nateq-Noori has the endorsement of the Society of Combatant Clergy, a political grouping he heads that is dominated by socially conservative clerics and supported by those bazaar merchants who care about free foreign trade but not necessarily about foreign investment. That support brings with it the power of a well-organized political machine with the resources to get out the vote: the nationwide network of mosques.
There are no reliable opinion polls in Iran, but a three-week tour of the country last December -- including interviews with dozens of workers, students, academics, teen-agers and retirees -- suggested that there is a widely held view that Mr. Nateq-Noori would only make Iran's economic problems worse and that he by no means enjoys the popular support that Mr. Rafsanjani does.
 
The Challenger
 Enter Mr. Khatami. He has the backing of two strong groups on opposite ends of the political spectrum: the left-leaning Coalition of the Imam's Line, which supports state control of the economy and more equal distribution of wealth; and, if some of Iran's newspapers are to be believed, all but one member of the Servants of Construction, a group that opposes state control of the economy, favors more foreign investment and better relations with the West, and is aligned with Mr. Rafsanjani. (Mr. Rafsanjani himself has vowed not to endorse any candidate.) Mr. Khatami is also popular among university students and intellectuals. Teen-agers are important, since about half the population of Iran has been born since the revolution.
Even though the campaign does not officially start for weeks, Mr. Nateq-Noori is crisscrossing the country in an effort to boost his strong lead. He traveled recently from town to town in his native Mazandaran province, visiting hospitals and schools, inaugurating factories, bakeries and even buildings -- trailed all along the way by crews from the state television, which extensively aired his pronouncements every night.
The fact that he is acting as if he has already been elected has incensed his political opponents. "Why is the television showing him every hour on his trip and broadcasting an anthem written especially for him?" one reader asked in a call-in complaint column in the daily Salam, which favors Mr. Khatami's candidacy. "Can television still claim it is not taking sides for the presidency?"
Another reader asked: "Please tell me why is it the speaker of the Parliament is the one inaugurating projects and not the President? If the President is busy his deputy should do it."
In their speeches, the candidates say little about the cultural onslaught of the West or confronting world arrogance, and much, much more about corruption, inflation, inequality and jobs. Some subjects are too hot for debate -- the Arab-Israeli peace process or the death warrant on the author Salman Rushdie, for example. But there have been hints that there is even room for some discussion of Iran's relationship with the United States.
On a campaign stop in Urumiyeh last month, Mohammed Mohammadi Reyshahri, a former Intelligence Minister and another Presidential hopeful, did not even mention "death to America" on his list of priorities. And Ibraham Yazdi, an English-speaking former foreign minister who once had a green card and lived in Texas, announced last Sunday that he favors "normal relations with America" and the creation of "a democratic atmosphere" in Iran.
But, then, Mr. Yazdi's group, the Liberation Movement of Iran, has never been allowed to run in any Iranian election. It's just not considered Islamic enough by Iran's theocrats.
"In a true democracy, the people give legitimacy to their government," said Stephen Fairbanks, a visiting scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars who is writing a study of Iran's political system. "But Iran's system claims its legitimacy comes from God."

What Goes Around Comes to Zaire

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
IF the map of Africa could be turned on its side, it would bear a passing resemblance to a pistol. And the country known as Zaire, as the writer Frantz Fanon once said, would be the trigger.
This image of Africa's third largest country has a lingering resonance that has little to do with geographical whimsy. From this country's birth, with independence from Belgium in 1960, Zaire, more than any other African state, has been the place where explosive crises begin. 
 All at once, Zaire is caught up in a civil war sponsored by its neighbors, economic collapse and an open struggle over succession. For anyone who has followed the country's turbulent history, this dangerous moment can only seem like old times.
In its first year of statehood, Zaire, then known as the Congo, experienced an attempt at secession by one of its provinces. In the heat of the cold war, the breakaway bid by Katanga Province quickly drew in the superpowers. Soon, the country was the scene of the first United Nations intervention in Africa, and the word Congo rarely appeared in print without being followed by the word crisis. In the immediate post-independence years, the Congo would continue to be an unfortunate pioneer in foreign interventions, armed rebellions and the use of mercenaries to put them down.
The essential event that has most marked this country was the 1965 coup, another African first, by a 34-year-old Lieutenant General, Joseph Desire Mobutu. If not entirely invented by the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Mobutu had been sponsored and, at critical moments, propelled forward by it. As army chief of staff during the first five years of independence, the general was covertly used as the lever through which Washington could manipulate the country's fragmented political system.
His tentativeness in the heat of early crises earned the young general the epithet of "one of the weakest strongmen in history." He was called a "a black Hamlet" by the American diplomat Smith Hempstone.
But once in power, Mr. Mobutu almost single-handedly went on to invent a new brand of African politics, which he termed Authenticity.
His bold project was nothing less than reinventing his country under his leadership as the all-powerful "Guide." Fashioning himself as a kind of supreme chief rooted in African tradition, he set out to create a sense of African pride and nationhood among over 250 tribes in a nation the size of the United States east of the Mississippi. The Congo became Zaire, cities were stripped of their Belgian names, and citizens were forbidden to use Christian names.
For a time, many Zairians felt a sense of hope from the country's strong currency and from the dams and factories and other big industrial projects that were launched. There was relief, too, when the incessant rebellions of the early years seemed over.
Today the Guide's project lies in shambles, eerily similar to what he inherited in 1965. His experiments crashed on the shoals of cynicism, greed and his all-consuming ego. There is no better symbol of his hubris than the name Mr. Mobutu chose in reinventing himself: Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa za Banga -- "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."
 
Personal Militia
 Of the military that has badly failed Mr. Mobutu in the country's current war, one dissident army colonel said: "The Mobutu system was destined to die this way. What we have is not a national army but a personal militia at the service of Mobutu, his family and a certain clique."
If Julius Nyerere of Tanzania influenced many with his "African socialism," Mr. Mobutu championed African dictatorship, which he sought to make respectable by cloaking one-man rule in the trappings of cultural authenticity.
The Zairian example proved to be a powerfully seductive model emulated by men like Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and Idi Amin of Uganda -- some of the continent's most sinister heads of state.
In the midst of his would-be nation-building, Mr. Mobutu busied himself playing mischief maker in many of the nine nations bordering his country, and beyond. In Angola, he did the handiwork of the C.I.A. for years, turning Zaire into the rear base of the Western-backed Unita rebel movement that was fighting against a Marxist Government in Luanda. At France's behest, he sent his soldiers to support dictators in Chad. And assassins were reportedly sent to kill the Marxist President Marien Ngouabi of neighboring Congo (a former French colony), changing the regime there in Paris's favor just as Congo was tapping huge oil reserves.
Since the mid-1990's, this tendency toward adventurism has come back to haunt Mr. Mobutu and finally seems likely to undo him at a time when he is ill with advanced prostate cancer and seen as having a tenuous hold on power.
The Zairian President was a longtime sponsor of the Hutu-led dictatorship that ruled in neighboring Rwanda. And when it was overthrown by Tutsi insurgents in the midst of a Hutu campaign of genocide against the Tutsi minority, Mr. Mobutu, working with France, came to the rescue of the defeated Hutu forces. Under the cover of huge numbers of refugees gathered in Zaire, the Hutu fighters reassembled and were soon mounting armed raids on Rwanda.
 
Rwanda's Revenge
 The rebellion that now threatens to sweep away what is left of Mr. Mobutu's power began in October as a minor uprising by ethnic Tutsi Zairians being threatened with deportation. The Tutsi-led Government in Rwanda saw its opportunity for revenge against Kinshasa. With its heavy assistance, what had been a minor revolt spread quickly in the face of a disintegrating Zairian army.
Suddenly an ethnic revolt had become an outright bid to usurp power. And casting about for a leader, Rwanda backed Laurent Kabila, a lifelong revolutionary and nationalist, against the Mobutu Government.
Several of Zaire's other neighbors -- Uganda, Burundi, Angola and perhaps more -- have seen in Mr. Kabila's rebellion a chance to put an end to a Zairian state that had become a source of instability throughout Central Africa. For Yoweri Museveni, the influential Ugandan President who is seen as something of a political godfather to Mr. Kabila, the crisis of Zaire is what he says is simply a "management problem." By this theory, inspired by Mr. Museveni's own experience in turning around Uganda, a strong and lucid leader is all that Kinshasa needs to get its house in order.
By backing the relatively unknown and unproven Mr. Kabila, Mr. Museveni and his allies in Zaire's upheaval may be committing an act of hubris as great as any committed by Mr. Mobutu.
"It is tempting to see in the rebellion's success a lot of new hope for Zaire, but the little that is known of Kabila inspires caution," said one Western diplomat here. "Mobutu's death will be a cause of celebration here. But Zaire and its problems are so big and so difficult that what comes next could be merely new, without being any better."

Basketball Gains the World and Loses Its Soul (and Profits Nicely)

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
There are probably enough Federal agents who care about hoops to slow down the current point-shaving investigations involving Arizona State and Fresno State until we get through this last critical week of March Madness. This is not to suggest that any team in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament is dealing with gamblers. But it would certainly stain the old school tie to even think that this youth festival could be about anything other than winning games to finance higher education.
It's been years since we've had a board-rattling basketball scandal, and this is hardly the time for another. Too much serious money is involved. And ever since 1992, when the so-called Dream Team perverted those aspects of the game that had made it socially worthwhile for a century, basketball has been on morally shaky ground. 
 Sometime in the 70's when we weren't looking, basketball became America's Game. The news media were besotted by the mythic Knicks and poor neighborhoods were inflamed by drugs and hoops, two ways to become somebody or to forget that you weren't. Here was the only team game you could play by yourself, in schoolyard or hayloft. No field, no equipment, no socio-historical-psychobabble baggage. Yet.
By the 90's, a team effort by the booming sportswear industry, television and David Stern's National Business-Ball Association helped the game become a truly gross national product, portable and exportable.
On the game's lowest level of skill, where players actually pay for their own shoes, the game was still about feeling good and earning street credibility. But the highest levels sent messages. In one of the country's best recreational programs, the Flames of Brooklyn, youth coaches like Gerard Papa bemoaned trash-talking and those behind-the-back dribbles in which the ball is invariably stripped. But coaches could do little about it; kids were mimicking ballplayers on television.
The "Hoosiers" dream of a raggedy little high school beating bigger and richer teams, as Coach Gene Hackman's did in that 1986 film, is still alive in Indiana and New York. Tiny Delta High of Muncie got to the state tourney in Indianapolis last week, and Manhattan's Washington Irving High School not only won every game on its way to a city title with eight players and no home court, but reached the state championship.
But even on this level there are problems, hard to believe when so much N.B.A. and Nike money is available. The Flames, whose players are predominantly Hispanic and black, have been forced out of the Catholic Youth Organization in a series of machinations that seem wholly out of character for C.Y.O.'s parent organization, Catholic Charities. Racism has been charged.
And the Horsemen of Washington Irving had to be shod through the dealings of a local power broker who had, small world, played for Papa 23 years ago. Rob Walsh, executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, got the nearby Paragon athletic equipment store to sell shoes at cost to the Princeton Club, which footed the bill.
Which brings us to March Madness, more accurately Media Madness. The men's game has been devalued of late by top players taking an early buyout. It's hard to watch big-time players without thinking that if they were really any good they would be in the N.B.A. already. All that news media fuss over the integrity of Tim Duncan, supposedly the best college player, for playing his senior year, dissipated after Wake Forest was eliminated from the tournament. Maybe he was just the best college player left.
Why would anyone want to stay in college when he could spend his teen-age years with Dennis Rodman? While the deep thinkers decide whether Rodman is a psycho, or a kamikaze (he is very popular in Japan) dispatched by the league to stir up interest and then self-destruct -- or both -- he is out there teaching behavior that looks like fun to me.
And lots more fun than being around campus if the Federal Bureau of Investigation finds more than rumors about point-shaving at Arizona State in 1994 and at Fresno State this year. Moreover, what if these are threads in a national gambling web?
Web's the word. The epidemic of sports gambling on college campuses has been documented, but its spread over the Internet is becoming a new subject of concern to the N.C.A.A. Most recently, a service based in Antigua allows Net-minders to bet on players and Final Four games while the games are in progress. While such gambling is illegal in most states, the cyber-bookies maintain that the gambling is occurring on their offshore premises, therefore legally.
With all this money in the game, the cry of the old gambler is new again: "C'mon, baby needs shoes."

Irish Eyes Turning Homeward As a Country's Moment Comes

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: CORK, Ireland

 BODY:
This river town of steeples, hills and vividly colored quayside storefronts is now the second city of the republic, but in the grayer past it was the last city in the country that millions of Irish men and women ever saw.
They were participants in one of the world's greatest migrations, forced by famine, poverty, colonial persecution and lack of jobs to board ships in Cork's port in nearby Cobh and sail away to America, England and Australia in the hope of finding a future that this beguiling land could not provide. 
 Over time the travelers changed from the bewildered, tattily attired farm workers pictured in sepia photographs with their life's possessions in battered steamer trunks to purposeful young men and women with college degrees in their suit pockets. But for more than a century the pattern persisted: To get ahead, you had to go abroad.
Now quite suddenly and dramatically, they are no longer leaving, and thousands who had fled are coming back. Ireland, the country that once stood accused by James Joyce, its most famous writer, of conferring honor only on those who went into exile, and that as recently as 1991 was still losing 26,000 people a year, is in the unaccustomed role of no longer being an emigrant nation. The end of this dominant feature of Irish life is emblematic of the profound changes that have come over this society.
The place whose self-confessed national gesture was the tug of the forelock and whose talismans bespoke nostalgia, diversion and melancholy finds itself today with Europe's fastest-growing economy and a young, continental-inclined citizenry redefining Irishness in exuberant new ways.
The Irish have thrown over what they considered the inhibiting influence of the church and explored the possibilities opened up by higher education. If the centerpiece of the Irish workplace was long the plow, now it is the computer keyboard, a telling symbol of the new Irish condition because while it promises progress for the growing numbers of the literate, it also leaves even farther behind dismayingly large numbers of the unskilled.
"These people returning from England and America are very important for us," said J. J. Lee, a historian from University College Cork and a member of the Irish Senate. "They bring back the message that they went abroad and found that the Irish could be competitive."
Joe O'Brien, 37, an architect who has returned here to his home city after years of designing and building in London, said, "There is a fantastic buzz in the country, there's a really good feeling." Eighteen of the 20 members of his University College Dublin School of Architecture class of 1984 emigrated, and he said he believed that almost all have now come back. "When I left, I had no illusions about returning," he said. "I remember my parents waved goodbye to me as if I was boarding one of the old ships."
Mr. O'Brien stood on one of the stone bridges spanning the Lee River talking to Jeff Robinson, 32, a graduate of Trinity College Dublin who was one of the 14 of his class of 16 engineering students in 1986 who emigrated, but is now back to head the new Cork office of Ove Arup & Partners consulting engineers. "Back then there was so little opportunity that there was no point in staying," he said.
Now there is so much opportunity that industries are holding recruitment fairs in downtown hotels, setting up booths at airports and publishing "We need you back in Ireland" ads aimed at persuading young Irish men and women abroad that the country now offers the challenge for their skills and the wages to make returning a good bet. The posters hold out the promise of a re-encounter with "craic," the Gaelic word for fun that describes the gaiety the Irish are able to wrest from life even when times are not as heady as they are now.
What is luring them back is a country that has an annual economic growth rate of 7 percent, inflation of less than 2 percent, a declining deficit and surging consumer confidence represented by record levels in telling indices like new car sales and housing starts. Ireland's growth rate is nearly three times that of Britain, which is credited with having the most buoyant economy of any major European country. In a statistic that is arresting when considered in the context of the traditional relationship between Ireland and Britain, the per capita gross domestic product here has just surpassed that of Britain.
In words he must have taken mischievous delight in composing, Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish Prime Minister, ended a column in the London Observer this month by saying, "Over all, the performances of our two economies suggests that Ireland may have more to teach Britain than the other way around." Mr. FitzGerald presided over a series of agreements with unions that produced efficiencies without the strikes and confrontations with workers that his counterpart, Margaret Thatcher, faced in Britain.
Ireland has even made an asset of its previous backwardness. There were no rusting hulks of abandoned plants and factories and no obsolete technology that needed demolishing before state-of-the-art industrial, transportation and communications equipment could be installed.
"The Industrial Revolution is the best thing that never happened to Ireland," is a popular phrase here these days.

The Change
 
A Boom Unleashed By Europe's Funds
The revolution is happening now, though its origins date to 1973, when the Irish traded in the underconfidence born of centuries of subservience to the British for the independence it truly felt only when it became a member of the European community.
"The Irish people of my day definitely suffered from an inferiority complex, and we had 30,000 to 40,000 emigrating to Britain every year," said Tom Mitchell, provost of Trinity College Dublin. "We had achieved political autonomy from the British, but no other kind," he said. "Ireland took to Europe like a duck to water."
Designated as one of the less wealthy nations in the European Union, Ireland qualified for subsidies of more than $3 billion a year and has been canny in putting it to use.
"The Irish played the E.U. card well," said Nicholas Koumarianos, a Briton who is the managing director in Ireland of Cable and Wireless Ltd., based in an industrial park in suburban Dublin. "They saw an opportunity to leapfrog their historic obsession with the British. They basically cleaned out the till."
As a result, the country has established a sound infrastructure and attracted a vast number of multinational companies in information technology and pharmaceuticals with generous development deals and draws like a corporate tax rate of only 10 percent. Ireland's small farm-based agriculture has been particularly well suited to the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy that has established secure prices in what had long been an area of Irish life that was particularly vulnerable to pressures outside the country's control.
In the most visible benefit of European benevolence, Ireland's cities are now linked by modern highways. Big rectangular blue billboards with the European Community symbolic corona of stars overlook intersections and cloverleafs announcing where major financing for the improvement came from.
"Every time I hit the road, I say, 'God bless the German taxpayer,' " said Kieran McLoughlin, the Dublin director of The Ireland Funds, one of the country's largest foundations.
Giant cranes lumber across Dublin's skyline, and glass and steel buildings are rising in areas of the city that once were so derelict and dreary that Western film makers favored them as stand-ins for inaccessible Eastern bloc locations. Gracious Georgian residences in city centers are being restored.
What will be the largest employment site in Dublin, the International Financial Services Center, is going up on the abandoned docks next to the old Customs House on the Liffey. A principal project manager of the development is, predictably, a 32-year-old Irishman named Stephen Kilroy who joined all but one of the 24 engineering graduates in his 1987 class in emigrating, in his case to the United States, and has now returned.
Sixty percent of all business-application software and 40 percent of all personal computer packaged software sold in Europe is made in Ireland. The Irish have established such a lock on the teleservicing business that whether your computer crashes in Barcelona, Berlin or Biarritz, the person who takes your exasperated call for help will most likely be sitting in Dublin. In fact even the devices designed to protect computers from breakdowns are now made in Ireland.
"It's quite amazing that a country as prickly as this one is about its independence would feel so comfortable in the community," said Dermot McAleese, a professor of political economy at Trinity. "But 'Brussels' is a good word. Can you imagine anyone here saying, 'We're happy to abide by the London criteria?' "
Ireland has done so well that it will probably find itself no longer on the receiving line when its deal with Brussels, where the European Union is headquartered, comes up for review in 1999.
"It will be interesting to see how we react when we suddenly are asked to go and pay for roads in Poland," said Kevin Myers, a columnist for The Irish Times.
The one deeply preoccupying aspect of this spreading prosperity is an unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent and the dismaying fact that the creation of more than 45,000 new jobs a year does little to cut into it. The rate reflects a group of unskilled and untutored people in the inner-city slums and concrete-block suburban housing projects whom the new Irish economy does not accommodate.
"And we are not talking small numbers," said Mr. Mitchell. "There are tens of thousands of them."
A poster at Dublin Airport unintentionally points up the problem. It shows young Irish graduates in gowns and mortarboards beneath the legend, "Hire Them Before They Hire You." In other words, the uneducated need not apply.

The Left Out
 
In Dublin Enclaves, A Pattern of Despair
There are neighborhoods in Dublin with unemployment rates as high as 70 percent along with drug addiction and crime that is being passed along generationally. "The children are trapped," Mr. Mitchell said. "There is no equality of opportunity in terms of education and teaching skills for them."
Hugh Frazer, head of the Government's Combat Poverty Agency, acknowledged the gravity of the problem but said he thought some aspects of Ireland's culture might ease it.
"There's a degree of social solidarity here because we are a relatively classless society," he said. "The concept of structural poverty has been accepted, and our challenge is to see if we can make a modern society an inclusive one."
Mr. Frazer also argued that the newness of Irish prosperity gave the country a leg up.
"In an expanding situation it's easier to get at the resources," he said. "It's more difficult to redistribute existing resources."
There is broad consensus on what is behind the Irish resurgence.
"The credit must go to the reforms in education," said Mr. Koumarianos, managing director of Cable and Wireless Ltd. Mr. Mitchell dated the moves to the middle 1960's, when the Government made secondary education free and put school buses on the back roads to ferry students from remote areas.
At the time only 20 percent of the population went to high school; today the figure is 80 percent. College and university attendance, then 7 percent, is now at 46 percent, close to the European norm. "Our education has developed at a massive rate," Mr. Mitchell said.
It also has become more ambitious and more competitive. "The students are much bolder than they used to be," said Professor McAleese. "They will take risks, turn down jobs to travel and get experience. They are very pro-Europe, and they all study a foreign language."
If education and progress are the new adopted religion of Ireland, the Roman Catholic Church is rapidly becoming the old discarded one. Cabinet ministers freely use the phrase "post-Catholic Ireland," and a well-regarded new book by the writer Mary Kenny is titled "Goodbye to Catholic Ireland."
Rocked by a series of sexual scandals involving pedophilia and priests who have secretly fathered children, the church confronts an increasingly secular society that no longer follows its dictates on social and sexual behavior. Sectarian violence in Northern Ireland has lessened the sense of identification and responsibility for co-religionists in the North to such a degree that the subject of The Troubles arises in conversations with people about the state of their island almost as an afterthought. "But there's still a gut feeling," warned Mr. Myers, "and all it will take is one British atrocity to resurrect it."
Tourism is so successful that more people visit here each year (4.7 million) than live here (3.6 million). And the Irish confess with no apparent smugness that among the selling points are themselves.
"We're friendly, great communicators, well educated and good to do business with," said Noel J. Toolan, 38, who markets the country internationally for the Irish Tour Board with skills learned at Procter and Gamble. Mark Ryan, an Irish writer based in London, said he once saw a beggar doing smashing business in Paris with extended hand and a sign that said simply, "Je suis Irlandais."

The Icons
 
What Nostalgia? Stars Stay Put
Much comment in Dublin is made over the fact that directors like Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, rock groups like U2, playwrights like Brian Friel, writers like Roddy Doyle and Nobel Prize winning poets like Seamus Heaney remain in Ireland even after achieving international success.
"In the old days if you made it, you disappeared -- vanished," said Mr. Myers. "Ireland was an unsuccessful entity you left behind and spoke about all the time with romance and nostalgia."
Irish writers, musicians and artists have always been prolific, and success and the new domesticity have seemed to give them fresh impetus. There is the added incentive of a quintessentially Irish exemption on paying taxes on the proceeds of "products of creativity."
"This is the first generation of artists who are actually doing well," said Peter Murray, curator of the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery in Cork. "What you have here is that charm, that free-flowing conversational thing." Michael Colgan, director of the Gate Theater in Dublin, said: "They have found that they don't do well by not being Irish. They do well by being Irish."
Mr. Murray said cultural and heritage centers were appearing all over Ireland. One of them is in the old railway station at Cobh, Cork's port, and commemorates with photos, mock-ups and memorabilia the more than three million Irish who left the country from its docks from 1815 to 1970. The center's manager, Maighread Rutledge, 33, is the only member of her family to have stayed in Ireland. One sister went to England, one to the United States and one to Australia. All three have returned.
As evidence of what influence the British presence had in Ireland, the port's name, Cove, was changed to Queenstown in 1849 after Queen Victoria set foot on Irish soil for the first time there. In 1920 it took back its original name and gave it its Gaelic spelling.
Bob Crowley, 44, the Cork-born associate designer at London's Royal National Theater who won a Tony award in New York for "Carousel," finds an illustration of the altered condition of life in Ireland in the stories of his own career and that of his brother John, a director at Dublin's Abbey Theater, who is 17 years younger.
"When I left Ireland, I knew I would never come back, except for visits," he said. "It was a terrible feeling. I remember packing a huge metal trunk for the boat journey and watching the horizon disappear. I felt part of the Irish diaspora.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Loyalty Pays Dividends

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 22

 BODY:
"I know you trust me," Boris N. Yeltsin once told Bill Clinton, American officials say. "But I know it's because you are afraid of what may come after me."
As much as the Clinton Administration is accused of personalizing Russian politics in its devotion to Mr. Yeltsin -- an accusation similarly leveled at the Bush Administration for its loyalty to Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- the summit meeting here this week showed the value of Mr. Clinton's trust. 
 Mr. Yeltsin came through for Mr. Clinton, choosing to minimize Russian anger and humiliation over NATO's coming expansion in the interests of a larger strategic partnership with Washington and Europe.
Mr. Yeltsin, who suffered a heart attack during his re-election campaign last summer and who was written off by many Russians, let alone Clinton critics, has emerged from successful multiple bypass surgery to reassert his authority over a chaotic Russia -- or at least to try.
American officials say Mr. Yeltsin is much improved from his surgery. In fact, they say, he seemed more mentally acute in Helsinki than at any time in the last two years -- speaking clearly and wittily, without slurring his words.
But the summit meeting also showed the fragility of the Russian state, where the whims and wisdom of one man, even if elected democratically, can still dictate the policy of the nation. And Mr. Yeltsin understands that in some fundamental way, Russia is still on probation.
Five or six years of haphazard democracy and a wayward path toward a market economy are not enough to make Central and Eastern Europeans confident that Russia has turned its back on its imperial, totalitarian history. That is reason enough for them to want to join NATO -- in case Russia reverts.
And Mr. Yeltsin, who as President of Soviet Russia supported the independence of the Baltic nations in his battle against Mr. Gorbachev, knows it very well.
Never a "greater Russia" chauvinist, like his first Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, Mr. Yeltsin has shown moderation on nationalist issues, like the fate of ethnic Russians living in Ukrainian Crimea, that could have led to serious confrontation.
It was only in Chechnya, within the Russian Federation itself, that Mr. Yeltsin agreed to use force to end a secession attempt. But the outcome -- the humiliation of the Russian Army, the international embarrassment and condemnation, the revulsion of some of his closest political allies -- became a warning not only to the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but, it seems, to Mr. Yeltsin himself, who was betrayed by the blustering confidence of his military leaders.
Faced with an expanding NATO -- the cold war enemy against which the Warsaw Pact was founded, and which now seeks to absorb some of Moscow's former allies in Europe -- Mr. Yeltsin made a difficult choice.
Instead of bluster and opposition, which would have been more popular at home, Mr. Yeltsin chose to look past what he could not stop, to secure Russia's cooperation with the West and avoid a new isolation.
His choice seemed to vindicate Mr. Clinton's faith in him -- and served as a rebuff to those in the United States who argued that NATO expansion was a fundamental mistake that would only embitter Russia, doom its slow transition to democracy and a market economy, and create an enemy for the future.
American sages as respected as George F. Kennan -- the 93-year-old former historian and diplomat who framed America's post-World War II containment strategy toward the Stalinist Soviet Union -- agree with scholars like Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University that NATO expansion is a fatefully stupid response to Russia's first extended chance at democratic politics in more than 1,000 years.
Such warnings may prove right in the long run. But Mr. Yeltsin decided to bargain as best he could to win concessions from NATO in return for a first round of expansion he knew Russia was too weak to stop.
He received some softening of the military aspect of NATO expansion, some confidence that American technology will not drive Russia into a new arms race, some further commitment that America will push to invest in Russia and some stronger promises that America will welcome Moscow as an important member of international institutions like the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the group of main industrialized countries.
Mr. Yeltsin also got a chance to cut strategic arms, save money and preserve Moscow's cherished nuclear parity with the United States.
In an agreement on firm guidelines for a third strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 3, both Presidents said nuclear warheads for each side would be cut to 2,000 to 2,500 by the end of 2007 -- a third fewer than Start 2 limits and two-thirds fewer than under Start 1.
The point is to give the Russian Parliament the confidence to ratify Start 2 first, in the knowledge that Start 3 limits will mean Russia will not have to build a new generation of missiles to keep up with Washington.
"I would say that emotions sometimes get the upper hand in assessing the Russian-American partnership," Mr. Yeltsin said Friday. "That's not the approach that Bill and I have."
The two Presidents have now met 12 times, and they feel a clear sense of loyalty to each other. A sense of their relationship came out in the dinner that ended the long, exhausting Friday of the summit meeting. The day had been difficult, officials say, and it was not clear until nearly 4 P.M. that one key American goal -- to allow the continued development of short-range American missile defense projects -- got settled.
But at the dinner, there were jokes and toasts, American officials said. Mr. Yeltsin gave Mr. Clinton a cane, and Mr. Clinton gave Mr. Yeltsin a small statue by the American artist of the Wild West, Frederick Remington. The statue depicts an Indian chief on a horse, picking through a difficult landscape.
In his toast, Mr. Clinton said the statue was a metaphor for Mr. Yeltsin's own extraordinary ability "to stay in the saddle, and not lose his footing even in rough terrain."
For all his foibles and maneuverings, it is Mr. Yeltsin who has kept Russia most closely to the path of economic and democratic reform. Mr. Clinton has to hope that Mr. Yeltsin maintains not only his health, but his capacity to keep his seat.

HEADLINE: Samm Sinclair Baker, 87, Author Of Dozens of Self-Help Books

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Samm Sinclair Baker, whose 30-odd self-improvement books counseled readers on how to help themselves to anything from svelte figures to good sex to making money by writing books, died on March 5 at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 87 and lived in Mamaroneck.
He had suffered a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Baker, who had an earlier career in advertising as a copywriter and agency executive, changed professions in 1963 to write books but also continued as a self-employed personal business consultant.
He teamed up with a number of diet and fitness experts to publish their best-selling advice.
He was a co-author, with Dr. Irwin M. Stillman, of "The Doctor's Quick Weight Loss Diet" (1967), and "The Doctor's Quick Inches-Off Diet" (1969). With Dr. Herman Tarnower, he published "The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet" (1979).
He joined Dr. Stillman for "The Doctor's Quick Teen-Age Diet" (1971) and "Dr. Stillman's 14-Day Shape-Up Program" (1973). Among his more recent titles, as sole author, was "Erotic Focus: The New Way to Enhance Your Sexual Pleasure" (1984). Mr. Baker published three mystery novels in the 1950's.
He also wrote popular gardening books, like "Miracle Gardening Encyclopedia" (1961), "Samm Baker's Clear and Simple Gardening Handbook" (1964) and "Gardening Dos and Don'ts" (1970).
He was born in Paterson, N.J., and was a 1929 economics graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. He went into advertising in Manhattan, starting as a copywriter and ending as president at the Kiesewetter, Baker, Hagedorn & Smith agency.
In 1955, he joined the advertising agency of Donahue & Coe as a vice president and member of the executive staff.
Mr. Baker is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Natalie Bachrach, an artist; a daughter, Wendy Cammer of Larchmont, N.Y.; a son, Jeffrey, of Newbury, Mass.; two grandsons, and a great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: 'Other Governor' of Texas Turns His Flaws Into Assets

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 19

 BODY:
Bob Bullock, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, does not have the standard attributes for political success.
Married five times, a very public alcoholic in office before he went to what he calls "drunk school" and became a recovering alcoholic in office, the craggy-faced, gravelly voiced Mr. Bullock has mastered what might be called the politics of redemption. 
 When a state senator from East Texas -- a member of the opposite party, no less -- was arrested a few weeks ago and charged with soliciting oral sex from an undercover police officer in Austin, Mr. Bullock conspicuously passed on the opportunity to say he was shocked by such news about a public servant.
"I will not judge him, lest I be judged," the 67-year-old Mr. Bullock, a Democrat, lectured reporters. "I myself have been to the point of desperation before in my life, to the point of low ebb, of despair and loss of self-respect."
Such candor may be unusual in a politician, but it seems to work for Mr. Bullock: across the span of a 40-year career in Texas politics, he has never lost a race, including six statewide elections.
While he is often called the most powerful and most feared political figure in the state, both arguable propositions, Mr. Bullock has unquestionably emerged recently as a principal figure in the increasingly heated battle in the Legislature here over Gov. George W. Bush's mammoth plan to overhaul the Texas tax code. The plan is widely seen here as a potential signature issue for Mr. Bush to use if he runs for the White House in 2000.
The plan itself is in serious trouble, in no small part because of Mr. Bullock's objections to its increase in the state sales tax and other taxes, which Mr. Bush, a Republican, wants in return for sweeping property-tax reductions and a vastly expanded role for Texas, the nation's second-largest state, in school financing.
At the same time, though, Mr. Bullock is working to fashion an alternative that could allow Mr. Bush to claim victory anyway, and he is hardly considered an obstructionist when it comes to Mr. Bush's national ambitions: he makes a point of calling the Governor a "fine fella" who, he says, will probably be President someday. (If that occurred while Mr. Bullock was still in office, Mr. Bullock would just happen to become the Governor.)
What if a tax overhaul helps raise Mr. Bush's national profile? "It doesn't bother me at all if it's good for Texas," Mr. Bullock said with a chuckle in an interview. "That's no problem."
Texas has an unusual system under which the Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected separately. And in terms of raw power over legislation, the Lieutenant Governor actually has much more of it: he presides over the Senate and controls the movement of bills and committee assignments.
A casual visitor to the State Capitol here might even think the state had two Governors, since everyone calls Mr. Bullock "Governor."
Around the Capitol, the Lieutenant Governor is viewed as an epic figure, whose ego, heart, temper, virtues and flaws are all outsized.
"He's one of the two or three most fascinating political figures I have ever known," said George Christian, a former top aide to Lyndon B. Johnson, a man to whom Mr. Bullock is often compared. "His knowledge of government is just overwhelming. He knows what it takes to get things done. And he works like a dog."
Mr. Bullock is hardly the only political figure to be so candid about personal weaknesses: former Gov. Ann W. Richards, for instance, essentially found a way to turn her status as a recovering alcoholic into a political asset. Still, Mr. Bullock's political survival in the face of numerous publicized personal difficulties -- "all self-inflicted," he quickly points out in an interview -- is particularly impressive. These include alcoholism, past marital infidelities (he says he is now happily and faithfully married to his wife of 12 years, Jan) and troubles with the law, including guilty pleas on a drunken-driving charge and a ticket for driving 106 miles an hour on an interstate.
He also has so many health problems that many people marvel that he is still alive. He has been hospitalized for heart surgery, lung and kidney problems, and severe depression. But he has a morbid sense of humor about it all: in the late 1970's, he told his staff to issue a few press releases that began: "If still alive, Comptroller Bob Bullock will. . . . "
Newspaper and magazine articles over the years about his excesses and potential scandals read like epitaphs, except that Mr. Bullock is still in the Capitol. Despite two grand jury investigations into allegations of wrongdoing, he has never been indicted for misusing any office.
Mr. Bullock is hardly universally admired. In a recent issue, the liberal Texas Observer called him "The Last Don" of Texas politics, and some Democrats grumble that he has been too accommodating of the Republicans, who are fast becoming the state's dominant political party. There are signs that his formidable power is waning.
Mr. Bullock, who has been Lieutenant Governor for six years, is the highest-ranking Democrat left in the state, now that Republicans hold the Governor's office and both United States Senate seats. While Mr. Bush was upending his predecessor, Ms. Richards, in 1994, Mr. Bullock, recuperating from a heart operation, stayed off the campaign trail but won re-election handily anyway.
Thus began an intricate relationship between the two men, in which Mr. Bush, then 48, started off by seeming to play the role of professional son to Mr. Bullock, constantly seeking his advice. That made for a harmonious legislative session in 1995, Mr. Bush's first year in office.
More recently, though, their relations took a frostier turn, when Mr. Bush, having perhaps grown a bit cockier in office, abruptly announced last fall that he wanted to use the $1 billion surplus in the state budget to cut school property taxes for homeowners across the state. Mr. Bullock was widely described as livid that he had not been consulted.
Now, Mr. Bullock could wind up doing Mr. Bush a favor, by pushing an alternative plan that closes some tax exemptions and avoids more obvious increases that the Governor had proposed, like a half-cent increase in a sales tax that, at 6.25 percent, is already high.
In any event, it is clear that Governor Bush is relying on Mr. Bullock for help: when a reporter for The Economist magazine, based in London, came here several weeks ago to do an article on the tax plan, he looked up Mr. Bullock and pronounced him "exactly the sort of Machiavellian bully Mr. Bush needs" to get a tax plan through the Legislature.
Of course, the final chapters on the relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Bullock have yet to be written. Both men are up for re-election next year, and one question that fascinates people here is whether Mr. Bush will recruit a top-ranking Republican to run against Mr. Bullock.
The potential benefit to the Governor is obvious, especially if he decides to run for President and needs an ultraloyal stand-in (and would-be successor) back in Austin. But so is the risk: it could amount to an all-out declaration of war in which the powerful Mr. Bullock might make Mr. Bush's re-election as Governor a more tenuous proposition.
The Lieutenant Governor said he had never even discussed next year's elections with Mr. Bush. "He's busy; I don't see him as much as I used to," Mr. Bullock added. But he said he was planning to run for re-election next year, and most legislators here certainly expect him to do so.
"There's only one way that Bob Bullock ever wants to leave the state Capitol," one said. "And that's in a pine box."

Lure of Fly Tying Is in the Preparation

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

 BODY:
As the angling season approaches in the Northeast, many fly fishermen are hunched at their desks, work benches or dining room tables of an evening, creating hook-bearing imitations of insects, minnows and other creatures on which fish are wont to dine.
Tying your own flies is a way to heighten the anticipation of fishing and to conjure up recollections of seasons past. My 1997 fly tying began a month ago, when I noticed an Atlantic salmon fly hanging from the spine of an anthology of modern American poetry on one of the bookshelves above my fly-tying desk. It was a low water Blue Charm on which Bob Winthrop of Glen Head, L.I., had taken a nice salmon on the Restigouche River in Canada last summer during a period when the fish were dour. Noting that the fly was unusually sparse, I had asked Bob whether I could take it home with me to make copies. 
 I made those copies, and while putting them away I noticed that standard versions of Blue Charms were in short supply and immediately fashioned more of them. That night I read several chapters of the recently published "Fishing Atlantic Salmon -- The Flies and the Patterns" (Stackpole, 1996) by Joseph Bates Jr., which was completed after his death in 1988 by his daughter, Pamela Bates Richards.
A big, handsome, lavishly illustrated book, it is an inspired blend of salmon fly history and salmon angling lore, and it reminded me that I needed additional Rusty Rats in various sizes for salmon, as well as more salmon dry flies, notable among them White Wulffs, Royal Wulffs and Bombers.
With the Atlantic salmon flies out of the way, I was about to start on a striped bass fly of my own design when Cooper Gilkes, who runs an Orvis fly fishing shop on Martha's Vineyard, where I live, asked whether I had ever encountered a streamer known as the Maynard Marvel during my years in New Hampshire. I had, but couldn't remember how to build it. I found a description of that fly in my copy of Eric Leiser's "The Book Of Fly Patterns" (Knopf, 1987), an invaluable reference work.
Leiser gives two versions of the fly, one from Bill Hunter, the other from Dick Stewart, both knowledgeable and accomplished fly dressers. I chose the Hunter fly -- which calls for a wing of 12 golden pheasant crest feathers -- because it best resembled the Marvel I remembered. Such feathers are costly, and, according to Hunter, the original Marvel, designed by Ora Smith of Keene, N.H., had 24 of them. But that pushes the expense and the time involved in creating the fly beyond reason. In economic terms, the simplest bucktail streamer can cost $3, and complicated patterns, such as a classic Atlantic salmon fly, are much more dear.
I resolved to tie up half a dozen Marvels for my annual June trip for landlocked salmon on the Rapid River in Maine. Having used up all my golden pheasant crest feathers for tails on the Blue Charms, I obtained a fresh batch from Cooper, and while tying the Marvels I realized that I was running low on Muddler Minnows, my most productive fly to date for the Rapid River's land locks.
Last June, the largest landlocked salmon I have ever seen in the Rapid River grabbed my Muddler beside the canoe, hurtled aloft flinging spray on me, threw the hook and departed. Perhaps the best-known fly in North America for trout, Atlantic salmon and landlocked salmon, the original Muddler, which has many versions, was the creation of Don Gapen of Minnesota in the 1930's.
After fashioning more Muddlers, I decided that I needed some extra Gold Ribbed Hare's Ear nymphs, a venerable and highly productive trout pattern that has a fuzzy body of dubbed fur from the head and ears of the hare. I couldn't locate the hare fur that I bought last fall, so I substituted muskrat for it.
Another reason for tying your own flies is that it enables you to experiment with new patterns. There is always the possibility, albeit remote, that you may come up with something as effective as the Muddler. It wouldn't make you rich -- for obvious reasons, you can't patent a fly pattern -- but it would bring you recognition among your peers. And it would catch fish.
While sorting out my saltwater flies this winter, I came upon several boxes marked "Junk Flies." In them were hundreds of experimental striped bass flies, some more than 40 years old, that had failed to live up to my expectations. But I have a new striper fly in mind, a sparsely tied tandem hook streamer with a slightly curved Corsair body. The tail hook is intended to deal with the problem of stripers striking short, which often happens when they are simply hanging in the current letting the little forage fish come to them.
I am so confident that this fly will not wind up in my junk fly collection that I have already given it a name. Because its basic colors are red, white and blue, it will be known as the "Patriot."

HEADLINE: White House Open to Separate Vote on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The White House has told Congressional Democrats that it would support Speaker Newt Gingrich's idea of separating the issue of tax cuts from balancing the Federal budget, Administration officials said today.
White House support for the proposal could provide important momentum in the budget negotiations aimed at eliminating the Federal deficit by 2002. 
 Administration officials said they were not backing away from the tax-cut proposals included in the budget President Clinton sent to Congress last month, including tax breaks for college expenses and credits for families with children.
But they said they wanted to send a signal of support to moderate Republicans who back the idea floated by Mr. Gingrich on Monday to balance the budget first and address the question of tax cuts separately. The idea is also backed by many moderate and conservative Democrats, including a group known as the Blue Dogs that has been pushing for a budget that would not include any tax cuts.
The White House chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles, met with several groups of Congressional Democrats this week and told them of the Administration's willingness to consider splitting the budget and tax issues.
Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, said: "The President's budget shows you can balance the budget with tax cuts, and our preference is to have a balanced budget plan with tax cuts in it. But if having a separate vote on tax cuts is the key to getting a budget agreement, we will be open to it."
Mr. Clinton is calling for almost $100 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, largely paid for by closing tax loopholes and extending some existing taxes. Republican proposals range up to $200 billion in tax cuts over five years. Republicans have not yet specified how they would pay for those cuts.
Mr. Gingrich's proposal to split taxes from the budget, at least in a procedural sense, has left his party's right wing on the verge of revolt, raising questions about Mr. Gingrich's future and making clear just how complicated budget politics will be as the two parties try to work out an agreement.
On Friday, Mr. Gingrich said in a speech from the House floor that he had been misunderstood, and he declared, "I'm deeply committed to lowering taxes."
Mr. Gingrich has said that considering taxes through legislation separate from the budget would make it easier to force the Administration to agree to deep and permanent spending cuts, especially in politically sensitive entitlement programs like Medicare.
Mr. Gingrich's critics contend that it would be politically impossible to push through a tax cut of any size outside of the budget agreement, and that his strategy endangers a goal that has been the centerpiece of the conservative economic agenda for years.
The White House is now walking much the same line as Mr. Gingrich, and although tax cuts do not have as powerful a constituency among Democrats as among Republicans, Mr. Clinton's strategy could expose him to criticism that he is not serious about providing tax relief to the middle class. His failure to follow through on promises of tax cuts in his first two years in office is among the reasons cited for the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994.
Mr. Clinton met with Congressional budget officials last week in an effort to get negotiations between the two parties back on track. Although there have been quiet negotiations on the staff level over the last several months, both sides are now trying to speed up the pace and broaden the talks.

HEADLINE: Gore to Raise Prickly Issue, Campaign Finance, in China

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 22

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that during his visit to Beijing this week, he would discuss earlier accusations that the Chinese Government tried to funnel money to American campaigns before the 1996 elections.
But in a conversation with reporters just before his airplane stopped here to refuel, Mr. Gore indicated that he would be restricted from discussing the issue in detail because it is under investigation by the Justice Department and because the Chinese have "vigorously denied" that they sought to influence the elections. 
 Still, Mr. Gore said, "In an appropriate and sensitive way, it'll be discussed, with every other matter that has potential for having some effect on our important relationship."
Mr. Gore was questioned repeatedly about the subject, underscoring how his long-planned visit to China has been rendered politically prickly by almost daily accusations about campaign finances that have brought intense scrutiny to any Administration contact with China.
"This is not what this trip is about," Mr. Gore said of the Justice Department investigation.
Mr. Gore is the highest-ranking American official to visit China since President George Bush went there in 1989, and his trip is intended to pave the way for a visit by President Clinton next year. His central missions are to strengthen ties with the Chinese and, he said today, to establish "a forum for ongoing discussion on the environment and development."
Mr. Gore said he also planned to raise other subjects, including human rights, the future of Hong Kong and the possible admission of China to the World Trade Organization. He is to meet with both President President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng, as well as other officials.
Although President Clinton recently acknowledged that the Administration's policy of engagement with China had produced few tangible benefits on human rights, Mr. Gore defended the approach today. "It is more than reasonable to place a bet that as the free market expands dramatically, so will free ideas," said Mr. Gore.
Some optimistic Administration officials have said that by raising the Vice President's profile and possibly advancing relations with China, this visit will enhance his image.
"If he just does what he's supposed to do," said one senior White House aide, "the politics will take care of themselves."
Such predictions notwithstanding, Mr. Gore's office seemed uncertain in recent days how to manage the campaign finance issues during this trip. Fearful of a deal-making image, they wrangled among themselves over whether the Vice President should preside over the signing of a billion-dollar deal for China to buy a small fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft. Now, Mr. Gore's aides say that if the deal is ready, he will attend the signing.
Mr. Gore is bracketing his visit to China with stops in Japan and South Korea, but he is most focused on his discussions in Beijing. He argued today that his visit was well-timed. "It's a more propitious time now than in the past," he said "because both our countries are clearly signaling to each other that we want to find a way to go forward in the relationship while being very respectful of the disagreements we may have."
Mr. Gore seems determined not to let the finance issue shoulder aside the subjects he would prefer to talk about. His aides said that the Vice President first began to explore environmental issues with the Chinese in meetings with visiting officials in 1994 and 1995. At a low point in United States-China relations, Mr. Gore met with Mr. Li in Copenhagen in March 1995. Mr. Li used the opportunity to upbraid Mr. Gore for what the Prime Minister called meddling in China's internal affairs, Western officials said, but since then, the two men have exchanged letters that led to this week's planned meeting.

HEADLINE: The New Push For Less Costly Electric Power

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
After years of having the nation's highest electricity rates, New York is pursuing a drastic reorganizing of the state's three biggest utilities, as it follows the lead of other states in a belated effort to stem a painful loss of industry and jobs.
With the increasing concerns about corporate flight and cutbacks in many states across the country, large industrial customers have provided the biggest push for deregulation of the electric industry. These customers assert that they need lower rates to keep up with competitors not only in other states with cheap power but also in other countries where costs are lower. 
 Big companies in states like California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, where the drive to deregulate has advanced the furthest, are likely to reap the largest savings from competition. Many have already extracted rate cuts of 20 percent to 30 percent from utilities by threatening to build their own power plants or closing plants and moving to states with lower power costs.
By contrast, smaller commercial users and residential customers in most areas do not have the influence to force similar savings from the utilities. Even when deregulation is broadly put into effect, as early as next year in some states, the savings for smaller users are expected to be far more modest, raising concerns among consumer advocates that small users will be disproportionately subsidizing the effort to save jobs.
In New York, the plans promoted by Gov. George E. Pataki's administration and the State Public Service Commission are driven largely in response to plant closings and cutbacks that have cost the state an average of 3 percent of its manufacturing jobs each year in the last decade. Mr. Pataki campaigned for Governor on a promise to cut electricity rates and stop the loss of jobs.
Last week, the Governor announced a plan to cut electricity rates on Long Island up to 23 percent, the centerpiece of a partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company. While homeowners on Long Island have been the loudest protesters of high electric costs, the Lilco plan is also a response to the complaints of industrial customers.
Earlier this month, the Consolidated Edison Company and the State Public Service Commission agreed on a sweeping plan under which big industrial customers would get rate cuts of 25 percent while homeowners and smaller businesses would receive cuts of only 3.3 percent.
Also this month, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, based in Syracuse, announced its own plan for relief, saying it had agreed to spend $4 billion to buy out long-term contracts for high-cost power from most of its independent suppliers. The buyout would allow the company to shop around for cheaper power and thus pass along lower rates to its customers.
Niagara Mohawk's situation demonstrates the critical importance of electric rates to the economy as states battle for the jobs and tax dollars that large plants deliver. The utility serves an area that includes much of the state's industrial heartland, including such major centers of manufacturing as Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady and Buffalo.
In an interview in his office in Syracuse, William E. Davis, the chairman of Niagara Mohawk, said he had repeatedly been confronted over the last several years by his major industrial customers, who threatened to move.
" 'Why should I stay here?' " he recalled them asking. "They say that to the local economic development people, to the Governor's office. It's hard to refute their argument. They are saying that things have to change -- and they have accelerated that change."
Among companies that have cited power costs in closing plants in Niagara Mohawk's service area in recent years have been Smith Corona, which phased out a typewriter assembly plant in 1993 in Cortland, costing 875 jobs, and the Miller Brewing Company, which phased out a brewery in the early 1990's that had employed 700 in Fulton.
Rarely, however, is the cost of power the only factor; other competitive forces are usually at play, too, as was the case in both the Miller and Smith Corona closings.
Electricity can become a significant problem, however, if other issues, like high taxes, are offset by incentives offered by local economic development agencies.
Ken Green, the president of the Saratoga Economic Development Corporation, said that Quad Graphics, a company that employs 1,000 people in Saratoga Springs, wanted to build a new plant in the area.
Even though his agency was able to reduce some of the plant's costs of environmental compliance, the high cost of energy supplied by Niagara Mohawk played a big role in management's decision to build instead in West Virginia.
"We still have that noose of higher energy costs hanging around our necks," Mr. Green said, "that knocks New York State off the table when industry is looking to locate here."
Clarence D. Rappleyea, the chairman of the New York Power Authority, agreed. "Low electric rates," he said, "have now become a key component of the industrial development packages offered by major states." The power authority, a state agency that owns and runs many plants with low-cost energy, has been working closely with the Pataki administration to offer cheap electricity to struggling industries.
The struggle has been particularly hard for the paper industry, a heavy user of power. For example, in Glens Falls, a city of 15,000 about 50 miles north of Albany, the Encore Paper Company has been weighed down in recent years by huge electric bills from Niagara Mohawk. These have totaled $3.8 million a year, representing 12 percent of Encore's operating costs.
"We're trying to sell our products in markets where electricity costs for our competitors are half of ours," said George E. Mangarelli, the chief financial officer of Encore, which employs 300 people and turns out tissues, towels and toilet paper.
Like other heavy power users, Encore thought it could not wait for the state to lift the barriers that keep lower-cost utilities out of Niagara Mohawk's service area. The removal of such barriers is at the heart of the deregulation effort.
Instead, under a special program to help industrial customers keep jobs, Encore was able to contract for cheaper power from the power authority, which will save the company $1.2 million a year. Under the program's rules, though, few companies qualify for such assistance.
The depressing effect of high power rates on the economy of Glens Falls worries many local political and business leaders.
"There has not been any expansion here," said Paul A. Kemnitzer, the town treasurer, who frets about a rising delinquency rate in property tax payments that he links to the loss of high-paying jobs.
He noted that another big local employer -- Finch, Pruyn & Company, a paper manufacturer with 1,000 workers -- decided to build its own power plant to lower its costs.
"If they were still buying power from Niagara Mohawk, they would not be in business," Mr. Kemnitzer said. Niagara Mohawk charges the average large industrial customer 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, double the rate of many areas in the Northwest and the South.
While Glens Falls struggles with its economic health, the loss of large customers like Encore and Finch has begun to sap the financial strength of Niagara Mohawk, which cannot cut its costs fast enough to offset the decline in revenue.
To keep more customers and prepare for the new competitive environment of deregulation, Niagara Mohawk decided to bite the bullet and buy out its long-term power contracts, under which it pays triple the going rate on the wholesale market.
It has also cut special deals with some of its most restive large customers, reducing its revenue by $230 million a year.
With revenue down, the utility has suspended its dividend and its stock has plunged. At times, it has warned of the possibility that it might seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
"It's very painful to work your way through this, and it's very complicated," said Theresa A. Flaim, the utility's vice president for corporate strategic planning.
The danger, she said, is that if the utility's revenue base erodes much more, it could end up not having enough cash flow to pay for its past investments in power plants and other so-called stranded costs.
And if it cannot recover those costs, she warned, "you could end up in a financial death spiral."
Thus, the state's politicians and regulators walk a fine line in deregulating the industry. A major step in this direction was the reorganization plan, announced March 14, to prepare Con Ed for deregulation. That plan could set a pattern for agreements with the state's other large utilities. And it underscores why most of the pressure for change in New York is coming from industrial users: The savings from deregulation will be negligible for most homeowners, other than those served by Long Island Lighting. Lilco is an exception because its high rates stem largely from the decision not to open the Shoreham nuclear plant.
The unequal split in savings is the case nationally as well. Big employers in other states, like Raytheon in Massachusetts, have been able to shape the drive for rate cuts in their areas along the same lines.
"This process is being driven by the large industrial customers and large marketers," said Edwin S. Rothschild, the energy policy director of Citizen Action, a national consumer group based in Washington. "After the dust settles, it will be the residential customer who will have less savings."
Despite the concessions they have already won, the biggest utility customers are pressing for more, in New York and elsewhere: full-scale deregulation, with the promise of even lower rates from wide-open competition.
Toward that end, they have formed trade groups to keep them informed and to lobby state legislators and governors.
While the Con Ed agreement and others like it nationwide have been attacked by consumer groups and some legislators as leaving small customers shortchanged, it is the kind of bitter medicine, state officials say, that is needed to save jobs.
"It may make the residential people upset," Mr. Rappleyea of the power authority said. "But the job factor is big in everybody's mind."

Industrial customers pay substantially higher rates for electricity in New York than the national average, and in recent years the problem has spread beyond the always expensive New York City area to affect upstate industries as well. Industry executive say the high rates have contributed to the decline of manufacturing in the state. Graph tracks electric rates for industrial customers, from 1977 through 1996.

Clinton and Yeltsin Manage to Get Along

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials seemed heartened by the outcome of Mr. Clinton's summit meeting Thursday and Friday in Helsinki with the once-again vigorous Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin -- their first meeting since last April.
Rather than blustering about NATO's plans to enlarge, which Russia opposes, Mr. Yeltsin acted to preserve and revive Russia's strategic partnership with the United States. 
 The Russians had a weak hand, knowing they were unable to stop NATO expansion, but they played it well. They won some important concessions on strategic arms control, economic aid and the
nature of NATO's enlargement, which will emphasize political stability rather than military preparedness against some Russian threat.
Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton, who was hobbled during the meeting by his knee injury, enjoy each other. Most important in Helsinki, Mr. Yeltsin put his trust in Mr. Clinton that NATO means no harm to Russia and does not mean to shut Moscow out of the heart of a democratic Europe.
Mr. Yeltsin, in a bargain for a better future, swallowed his pride. But it's not clear that his parliament, which is dominated by nationalists and Communists, will go along -- to finally ratify either the second strategic arms reduction treaty or the new NATO-Russian charter of security cooperation that both Presidents hope to sign before NATO meets in Madrid, to announce its expansion, in July.

HEADLINE: The $1 Trillion Dogfight

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
YOU would think they were selling cans of cola to the chief executives of the world's airlines instead of flying machines that can cost more than $125 million apiece.
One Airbus marketing brochure depicts a Boeing 777 as an aging stretch limousine painted taxicab yellow and the Airbus A340 as a sleek Mercedes sedan. In another, Airbus cattily points out the age of the Boeing 737, noting that the plane entered service the same year, 1968, that Richard M. Nixon was first elected President. 
 And in a brochure from Boeing, Airbus is not even granted the respect of being mentioned by name, with the company's wares referred to only as "Theirs."
Such flippant selling materials show how serious the marketing battle has become between the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, the world's two superpowers in passenger planes.
In the last year, the skies were essentially cleared of second-tier competitors, as Fokker N.V. landed in bankruptcy and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation accepted a merger proposal from Boeing. That has left just two teams in the biggest contest in industry history.
"It will be like most Super Bowls," said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It's going to be a very, very close game or it's going to be a blowout."
The stakes are huge: an estimated $1 trillion or more in orders over the next 20 years. Industry forecasts suggest that more than 13,500 planes will be built -- eclipsing the size of the fleet now in service -- to replace aging fleets and accommodate the growing demand for air travel, particularly in heavily populated developing countries like China. The "sticker price" of a Boeing passenger jet ranges from $32 million for its smallest plane, the 737, to $171 million for its newest offering, the 777; Airbus jets range from $40 million for the A319 to $128 million for the A340.
With just each other to worry about, Boeing and Airbus might be expected to act like most duopolies, settling back and cruising profitably on autopilot as they divvy up the skies.
But that will probably not happen anytime soon. For one thing, airline orders are typically measured in billions of dollars, so a lot rides on each sale. And those sales contracts are getting bigger. As competitive pressures mount for the airlines, the economies of scale gained from flying just one maker's planes are proving irresistible. In the last four months, American Airlines and Delta have signed long-term exclusive buying deals with Boeing, and US Airways has signed a large, although not exclusive, one with Airbus. If a customer is lost, it might be lost for a very long time.
"It's downright bloody out there," said John J. Leahy, an Airbus senior vice president and the company's chief salesman.
When pressed for their definition of victory in this trillion-dollar dogfight, executives from Seattle-based Boeing, which has long dominated the industry, said they wanted to consistently win two-thirds of all new orders, about their current level. Airbus, a privately held consortium of manufacturers from Britain, France, Germany and Spain, wants to consistently win about half of all orders. That would represent a big jump for Airbus, which is less than half the size of Boeing. But considering how quickly this upstart has grown, its goal seems well within the realm of possibility.
Clearly, only one company will succeed in its goal, and at the expense of the other.
Comparing aircraft order statistics can be a dark science, but based on the companies' announcements of orders, compiled by Edmund S. Greenslet, an industry analyst, Boeing has won 63 percent of the plane orders over the last five years, Airbus has won 27 percent and McDonnell Douglas 10 percent. In the last year alone, however, Boeing won 66 percent of the orders, Airbus received 30 percent and McDonnell Douglas only 4 percent. (True to form, Airbus contends that the Boeing numbers are inflated because it counts less definitive orders, and that Airbus in fact won 44 percent of the orders last year.)
The battle is fraught with risks and uncertainties that could divide the market into larger or smaller slices than either company is projecting.
Airbus, for example, hopes to leapfrog over Boeing in jumbo-jet sales by building a double-decker plane that could hold more than 550 passengers. But if demand falls short of its projections, it may have trouble recouping its investment, which it estimates at $8 billion. Airbus could also stumble if its member companies start squabbling over the consortium's plan to raise money by going public. Boeing, meanwhile, may face difficulties of its own in digesting its planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas, a deal that is considered unlikely to be blocked by antitrust regulators in Washington.
Because the stakes are so high, both sides appear to be fighting over every last order with everything they have.
Consider Airbus's failed effort to win over Delta. Among other things, Airbus bought $95,000 worth of television time in the airline's hometown of Atlanta for commercials about its planes. It was an unusual move, considering that Airbus really needed to sway just one person, Harry Alger, Delta's executive vice president for operations.
"At any corner, at any level of this company, they're there," Mr. Alger said of Airbus before he chose Boeing. Although he and other executives say they base their decisions on cost and technical capabilities of aircraft, such marketing efforts do not go unnoticed. "From a marketing standpoint, Airbus is very, very aggressive," he added.
SOMETIMES the manufacturers' marketing efforts get a helping hand from international politics.
Many airlines in the Far East, for example, have fleets that are largely from Boeing, a convenient and highly visible way for governments to put a dent in the United States trade deficit with Japan and the rest of the region. And when Saudi Arabia was in the market for new jets in 1995, President Clinton stepped in as part-time salesman and closed a 61-jet, $6 billion deal for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to share.
Airbus has a clear edge in many European countries, where airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and Iberia tend to shop locally for new planes -- no doubt with encouragement from officials of the four countries in which Airbus's partners reside.
For all that, the political realities can hinder as much as help the home team.
For example, Boeing has been building a relationship with China for 25 years, setting up training centers and developing an air-traffic control system there, and even making the country a subcontractor to build tail sections for its 737's. Boeing has also been an unpaid lobbyist in Washington, stumping for most-favored-nation status for China. Nonetheless, China thanked Boeing last year by placing a $1.5 billion order with Airbus, sending a signal to the Clinton Administration that it could turn to Europe if the United States became too pushy on human rights and trade issues.
Just last week, a possible order by China for a small fleet of 777's also became snagged by politics. In that case, China wants Vice President Al Gore to preside over the signing of the deal, a ticklish situation for Mr. Gore in light of China's role in the Administration's campaign finance imbroglio. A decision from Mr. Gore and a final word on the deal were pending as of Friday.
Boeing executives say that they are often treated as a political football.
"We are exposed to being used as something to kick," said Ronald B. Woodard, president of Boeing's commercial airplane group.
Airlines have done their share of kicking the manufacturers, too, but to win better deals -- something they could do relatively easily when there were several manufacturers competing for sales. Continental Airlines found last year, for example, that it was able to get a better deal on 737's by telling Boeing it was considering buying MD-95's from McDonnell Douglas.
Over time, many industry experts say, Boeing and Airbus may be able to exert more control over pricing, particularly if they are able to sign up many airlines for long-term exclusive relationships. After all, an airline that flies an all-Boeing or all-Airbus fleet will have little desire to switch -- mixing fleet types sharply increases training and other costs -- and will therefore have less leverage in future negotiations for new aircraft.
The existence of just two major manufacturers may also smooth out the wide swings in this notoriously cyclical business. Historically, jet makers have ramped up employment and production to build planes when demand was high, only to have to lay off thousands of workers when it slackened. Now, with nowhere else for the airlines to go -- barring the entry of a new manufacturer or the revival of Fokker -- Boeing and Airbus should be able to manage those fluctuations better.
"The nature of the industry is changing," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers. "Traditional aircraft gluts, which were the product of airline-buying frenzies, may be a thing of the past."
For now, though, the two companies are competing more aggressively than ever.
When Airbus wins an order, Boeing excuses its loss by saying that Airbus, as a consortium that has received government support, does not have the same operating constraints as a big publicly owned American company.
"There is no doubt that they will take risks that we, as a practical matter, cannot take," Mr. Woodard said. "We have different sets of business realities forced upon us."
Airbus executives retort that they are not undercutting Boeing, that they are repaying all the government loans they have received and that Boeing has received plenty of indirect government subsidies of its own.
Airbus has also criticized Boeing's penchant for exclusive contracts, saying that such a practice is bad for the airline industry because it eliminates new competitive bids for decades.
THE two even jab each other over safety issues -- long taboo among airlines and airplane manufacturers. Under the auspices of an information bulletin for employees in December, Mr. Woodard pointed out that throughout the jet age, safety has typically increased with each new generation of airplanes. "However, note that the Airbus A320/321 are an exception to this pattern," he wrote, referring to four crashes over the last nine years.
Airbus executives point out that investigators attributed all of those crashes to factors unrelated to the planes' airworthiness. "The A320 family is as safe or safer than anything made by our competitors," said Mr. Leahy, the Airbus senior vice president.
Airbus executives also say that Mr. Woodard's statement in the Boeing newsletter incorrectly suggested that the A321 model had a history of accidents. In fact, the model has never been in an accident.
A spokesman for Airbus, David C. Venz, said that because Airbus aircraft use the most advanced data recorders, the cause of each accident of an Airbus plane has been quickly determined. "There have been no mysteries," Mr. Venz said in a thinly veiled reference to the uncertainty surrounding the cause of two Boeing 737 crashes, and the crash last summer of T.W.A. Flight 800, a Boeing 747.
And the spin goes on. Airbus likes to characterize its products as "money-making machines," compared with Boeing's "commodities." Airbus attributes Boeing's successes to the power of a "myth machine." In a presentation to reporters last year, Adam Brown, Airbus vice president for forecasting and strategic planning, talked about his frustration in sales campaigns with "a competitor who seems increasingly to treat the truth somewhat economically."
But Mr. Woodard of Boeing has registered similar complaints, even taking a shot at Mr. Brown personally. "I've watched him and his nose does grow longer when he talks," Mr. Woodard told reporters at the Farnborough Air Show in England in 1994.
But when the spinning stops, how do these companies really match up?
EACH company, of course, has its strengths and its potential weaknesses.
Boeing's 747, which is much bigger than any Airbus model, gives Boeing a a wider range of aircraft sizes. And with the combined resources, revenues and future profits from its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas, Boeing will have an enormous budget for research and development. (Last year, Boeing spent $1.2 billion in this area.) It also benefits from the transfer of technology between the commercial and military parts of its business. However, it is likely to have some difficulty integrating the McDonnell military operation and the Douglas aircraft business -- which have never seen themselves as one company as it is -- into Boeing.
Airbus has had many technological and marketing achievements. But it may trip as it tries to balance the varying interests of its members in creating a new, publicly held corporate structure.
Such a restructuring, though, also holds out the possibilities of greater efficiencies. Many functions, like market forecasting, are now done by each of its members, as well as by Airbus staff.
By all accounts, Airbus has taken a less conventional approach to designing and marketing aircraft, and that has paid off in its ability to oust McDonnell Douglas from the industry's No. 2 spot. Boeing made its mark by being the first to build jets, in the 1950's -- a move that catapulted it past Douglas Aircraft.
Airbus is also counting on technological innovation to set it apart. For example, it adopted the concept of commonly equipped cockpits as its signature, enabling pilots to switch from one type of plane to another with minimal training. Because this represents a huge savings to airlines, Boeing has followed suit and now builds its 757 and 767 with common cockpits.
Airbus can also take credit for building the first wide-body jet, the A300, to fly with just two engines. It was the first to make a key piece of a production plane -- the vertical tail fin -- out of composite materials, and the first to use an entirely electronic flight system, rather than mechanical controls, to move key parts like the rudder.
The structure of Airbus, which was established as a risk-sharing partnership 27 years ago, is also unusual: Daimler-Benz of Germany and Aerospatiale of France each hold 37.9 percent, British Aerospace holds 20 percent and Construcciones Aeronauticas, or Casa, of Spain owns 4.2 percent.
THE companies in Airbus are also its key subcontractors. Generally, British Aerospace makes the wings, Daimler-Benz builds the fuselages and Casa makes parts of the tail sections, while Aerospatiale produces the cockpits and assembles most of the planes in Toulouse, France, where Airbus is based. A former Aerospatiale executive, Jean Pierson, is the chairman of Airbus.
Boeing takes a much more traditional approach to business. It wants to know an airline's needs better than the airline itself does, and then offer a numbingly thorough and tailored sales pitch.
"The Airbus crowd tends to be much more image-driven," said Robert W. Baker, executive vice president for operations at American, who last November committed the airline to buying Boeing jets for the next 20 years, and placed an initial order for 103 jets worth $6.6 billion. "Boeing is a very methodical corporation, and has perhaps done a little better job of reading customers' desires."
For example, Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman, has long complained that when a reading light burns out on his company's aircraft, a mechanic is needed to replace it. Boeing took care of that problem on its new 777, in which the lights can be changed by flight attendants.
Airbus executives say they also listen closely to customers, and again blame what they call the Boeing myth machine -- in this case, for the common perception that Boeing was the first to grow ears.
If the companies' order books are any indication, though, Boeing does it a bit better. Over the last five years, Boeing has announced orders for 244 of its 777's, compared with 162 for Airbus's A330 and A340, which are comparable in size.
The ability to listen to customers will be increasingly important in coming years, experts say, as blockbuster technological innovations occur more rarely. Historically, the airline industry has responded and adapted to innovations from manufacturers, like the jet engines and the two-person cockpits that drastically changed the economics of the business. Now, as the airlines' involvement in designing the 777 suggests, it is the other way around.
But when listening to customers, these aircraft makers tend to hear different things. Boeing, for example, has decided that most airlines do not need anything bigger than a 747, which Boeing has been building and refining for almost 30 years.
Airbus, however, believes there is enough demand to develop its jumbo double-decker plane, which could hold about 120 more passengers than the largest 747 model. With encouragement from carriers like British Airways and Singapore Airlines, Airbus says the oversized planes will be needed to carry passengers more efficiently between cities like London, Tokyo and New York, where crowded skies are straining airport capacity.
Airbus plans to start delivering the plane, currently called the A3XX, in 2003 with a projected price tag of $198 million, and is trying to sign up more partners to help share the costs and risks. It spent a year in fruitless negotiations with Boeing over possibly building the aircraft together. (In hindsight, it was an effective, though not necessarily intentional, move by Boeing to delay Airbus's efforts.)
In many ways, the two companies' decisions on the issue of large aircraft crystallize their differences: Airbus, the challenger ever willing to place a risky bet with a potential payoff of one-upping the competition, and Boeing, the more conservative leader.
Not surprisingly, Boeing's steady course has won approval from investors. On Jan. 21, the day after Boeing announced that it would hold off investing $7 billion to develop larger versions of its 747, delighted stockholders bid up the shares 7 percent. Since then, the stock has fallen 7 percent, closing Friday at $105.75, giving Boeing a market capitalization of $38.1 billion.
Over the last four years, Boeing's stock has risen more than threefold. While some industry analysts say the stock is peaking, others still see more upside. Mr. Callan, the aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the maturity of Boeing's product lines and higher production rates meant that the company would be generating enormous profits.
Boeing, with sales last year of $22.7 billion and a net profit of $1.1 billion, is already more than twice the size of Airbus. And McDonnell Douglas will make it a lot bigger. Last year, McDonnell Douglas had a profit of $788 million on sales of $13.83 billion, mostly from its military business. By contrast, Airbus's sales last year were $8.8 billion; it does not report profits.
At some point after 2000, Airbus, too, may sell shares to the public. That will most likely prompt many investors to take their first close look at Airbus. Mr. Leahy, the Airbus senior vice president, said that because much of what investors have learned about the aerospace industry has come from skewed information from Boeing, Airbus will be able to illuminate what is really happening in the industry -- namely, that it is a bigger and more formidable contender than people think. "What investors really ought to do is look at the cold, hard facts," he said.
Boeing executives counter that their facts tend to be colder and harder than those offered by Airbus. Mr. Woodard, with feigned sincerity, will concede only one thing to Airbus.
"There is no doubt," he said, "they are superior p.r. types compared to us."

HEADLINE: Pondering the Inequities in Today's Job Market

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Occasionally one edition of your paper carries two news articles that, taken together, demonstrate the errors of our present self-centered society. March 19 was such a day. 
 A front-page article described how, in New York City, 4,000 job seekers showed up to apply for 700 jobs at the Roosevelt Hotel. Since the jobs are described as paying between $6 and $15 an hour, we can estimate the annual payroll for the 700 successful applicants as less than $14 million. Even adding a liberal 30 percent for benefits, the total cost of employing those 700 will be less than $20 million per year.
A Business Day article reported on I.B.M.'s proxy statement and included an analysis by Graef C. Crystal, an executive compensation consultant. He calculated that the chief executive of I.B.M. received $20.2 million in total pay last year.
The fundamental incongruity speaks for itself. As a friend once remarked, "Don't bother me with the details. Someone is stealing from someone."

HEADLINE: Wave of Violence Unsettles Nerves in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 21

 BODY:
With an election just two weeks away, Haiti is confronting another outburst of violence. The unsolved attacks have shaken confidence in the new, American-trained National Police and in the ability of President Rene Preval's Government to provide security for the increasingly frustrated and fearful population.
Since mid-February, more than 50 people have been killed in incidents whose origins remain unclear. Six police officers are among the dead, along with the security chief for the Ministry of Justice, a well-known businessman and the chauffeur of a senator who was himself wounded in the same attack. 
 The violence began with battles between rival gangs of drug dealers and traffickers in Cite Soleil, a sprawling slum here with more than 200,000 residents. At least 18 people were killed in those clashes, which have been followed by attacks by armed gunmen in more upscale areas and by incidents in which the police have killed innocent bystanders or people fleeing crime scenes.
"Is the climate of insecurity becoming a climate of terror?" the newspaper Le Nouvelliste asked in a recent editorial. "The specter of Haiti turning into a a sort of Somalia has shown itself to be a real possibility."
There have also been complaints that the United Nations mission here, greatly reduced in size since 23,000 American troops restored Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Mr. Preval's predecessor, to power in October 1994, is not doing enough. The mission continues to provide "technical support" and training to the Haitian police. United Nations officials have urged calm and say that some of the concerns are exaggerated.
"We're going through a bad patch right now," Enrique ter Horst, director of the United Nations mission here, acknowledged in an interview. But he described the situation as "exceptional and temporary," saying "there is no doubt that political stability is not in danger" and calling for "a sense of perspective."
As is often the case here, it is not clear whether the attacks have been carried out for political reasons, are ordinary crimes or are a mixture of the two. "It is hard to explain the spikes of violence that occur from time to time," the American Ambassador, William L. Swing, said.
Mr. Swing suggested that "a good deal of it reflects the economy," which has failed to provide jobs or the growth people expected after Mr. Aristide's return to power. Haitian officials have also pointed to Senate and municipal elections scheduled for April 6, which they say have set off partisan disputes in the countryside.
"Elections fan local struggles for power, above all for control of the local councils," said Prime Minister Rosny Smarth.
In addition, "it is possible that people who are boycotting the elections don't want them to happen," said Kely Bastien, the Speaker of the lower house of Parliament.
Twice this year, left-wing splinter groups claiming to support Mr. Aristide and to oppose Mr. Preval's program of privatizing state-owned companies have called general strikes in the capital. The latest effort, less successful than an earlier one in January, was on Thursday, and was accompanied by threats of retribution against those who failed to comply with the call.
Flyers distributed around the capital warned that "anything that moves, be it a mouse or a feather, will be shot to smithereens." Most schools and businesses remained closed and many people stayed in their homes.
In an interview, Mr. Smarth, who faces a vote of confidence in Parliament next week, dismissed the importance of such threats, attributing them to "groups that do not have public support, cannot mobilize anyone, and so have turned to intimidation."
"It all seems a little chaotic," he said of the current situation. "But that is the result of us leaving behind an authoritarian regime for one that is democratic."
Whatever its source, the violence has revived concerns about the ability of Haiti's poorly trained and inexperienced police force to maintain public order. The 5,200-member force was set up in mid-1995 to replace the Haitian Armed Forces, which Mr. Aristide dissolved in 1994, three years after he was deposed by a military coup.
Many Haitians express irritation with the police, calling them brutal, corrupt and imperious. At the same time, they complain that the police are incompetent, apparently unable to solve even simple cases.
"People are dying, and the same people are committing the same acts as always," said Philippe Paul, an unemployed 23-year-old. "The same people who had guns before still have them, and though the police want to do their jobs, people are getting killed, and the police don't know how it happens."
In a report issued in January, three American human rights groups severely criticized the Haitian National Police, blaming it for many cases of torture and "extrajudicial executions or the excessive, unjustified use of lethal force."
Though such abuses "do not reflect an official government policy," in contrast to previous military regimes, the report added, they do indicate a distressing lack of official accountability.
"It is alarming to see members of this new, U.S.-trained police force resort to abusive practices reminiscent of Haiti's repressive military," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Americas Watch, a Washington-based human rights group that helped issue the report. "If the Haitian Government does not address these issues promptly, it risks institutionalizing abuse and undermining the legitimacy of the new force."
Mr. Swing, the American Ambassador, said the Haitian Government had taken steps to address such complaints, training more mid-level commanders and setting up an Inspector General's office that has dismissed nearly 100 officers for human rights violations. "The police are literally getting better by the day," he said.
The police force is supported by 1,300 United Nations soldiers and police, whose mandate expires July 31. In addition, nearly 500 American troops are here in a noncombat role, building roads, bridges and clinics and digging wells.
There is widespread concern among Haitians that the international force will depart, leaving the police on their own. Government officials said they had been talking with Canada about a long-term agreement that would replace the United Nations mandate, since it appears more and more likely the United Nations will not stay on in its present role and numbers.
Mr. ter Horst said he hopes "that we will be able to stick to our current July 31 deadline." After that date, he continued, he expects that "we will have mainly a technical assistance arrangement in the form of development projects."
But he added, "It is clear that if the Government needs any additional assistance, I don't see the international community leaving Haiti in the lurch, especially considering the very considerable investment it has made here."

HEADLINE: As Life Gets Even Harder, Albania Grows More Fractured

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, March 23

 BODY:
At the open market in the center of this ramshackle capital, shoppers stared this morning at the fresh fruit and vegetables piled high on the wooden stalls and at the meat, unable to believe the prices. Oranges had doubled in the last three weeks; the price of sausage was up nearly 50 percent.
But the price of food is far from the only problem here. Three weeks after Albania was consumed by armed insurgencies in the south and counter-rebellions here and in the north, picking up the pieces to mold a unified country is proving very hard. 
 The coalition Government of the Socialist Prime Minister, Bashkim Fino, controls little outside the capital. The Albanian Army, always one of the most feeble in Europe, evaporated during the rebellions and few deserters have returned to their posts.
A Western diplomat said the new Government might use some Albanian naval ships now in Italy to try to take back the southern port of Sarande, now in rebel hands. But "that's one big 'if,' " the diplomat said.
Another southern port town, Vlore, remains in the hold of rebels. A committee from Vlore met in Tirana with Mr. Fino on Saturday -- but there appeared to be little progress in bringing the town back into the Government's fold. The delegation said it was still insisting that President Sali Berisha resign before any consideration would be given to surrendering arms seized from army depots in the town one month ago.
To illustrate their anger, one group from Vlore circulated a petition saying it had found a modern-day Avni Rustemi, a legendary Albanian hero who went to Paris in 1924 and gunned down the Albanian Prime Minister because the people believed he had robbed the country. The new Rustemi would kill the head of the secret police, Bashkim Gazidede, unless he resigned, according to the petition.
The rebels have also demanded the resignation of Mr. Berisha, who still controls the important Interior Ministry and its secret police. But he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he would not be "blackmailed" into resigning.
He blamed the "Mafia and rebels" for terrorizing the population, and said former Communists had organized the rebellion in the south because they lost parliamentary elections last May. Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party claimed a resounding victory in those elections, which were deemed deeply flawed by the United States and other Western countries. The opposition parties have refused to sit in Parliament since then, making the body a rubber stamp for Mr. Berisha.
Mr. Fino, together with his new Finance Minister, Arben Malaj is expected to visit Rome on Tuesday to meet with European officials as well as some from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Mr. Malaj said he would ask for assistance to help manage sectors of the economy, and for an initial $150 million for balance-of-payments support.
"We have no revenues," Mr. Malaj said in an interview.
He said he understood that Albania had to "re-establish public order" to qualify for assistance.
Economists say they cannot recall another recent instance where a European country faced such an economic collapse. Many banks outside Tirana have been robbed. A large percentage of the population is worse off than at the end of Communism because they lost their savings in failed pyramid schemes, losses that touched off the revolt. The minimal production that Albania ever had appears to have ground to a halt.
In Tirana, the calmest spot in the country, there was a blanket of despair today.
"I have little hope with this new Government," said Flora, a 54 year old film editor at Albanian State Television as she started her weekend shopping. Flora, who did not want to give her surname, said the new coalition Government headed by Mr. Fino had made little headway during its 10 days of existence.
She was particularly distressed, she said, that Mr. Berisha, who many Albanians blame for encouraging the fraudulent financial schemes, had survived the turmoil.
"After all this and all that he has created, it is irritating to see him back on television," she said.

HEADLINE: By the Sea, the Specter of Drugs and AIDS

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: NEW BEDFORD, Mass., March 19

 BODY:
The well-being of this old whaling city whose cobblestone streets Herman Melville once roamed can be measured at Millie's Laundry.
"I used to have fishing bags all the way out this hallway," said the proprietor, Millie Barlow, standing in her laundry down by the waterfront, with a clamshell mobile above the dryers and a shark's jaws mounted on the wall. 
 That was a decade ago, when the fish were still abundant and there were plenty of commercial fishermen making good money. Ms. Barlow would stay open all night, pulling their blood-, salt- and gurry-soaked clothes out of the bags and piling them into her specially designed machines, with two wash cycles and two rinse cycles.
"They came from Texas, down South, from the Carolinas, from New Jersey," she recalled. "They came from everywhere. We were the biggest fishing industry in the country."
But fishing has changed, and so has New Bedford. Where once there were more than 3,000 working fishermen, they now number fewer than 1,500. And with Government restrictions to conserve fishing grounds, each season means fewer fishing days. And that means less laundry.
It is not only the depleted fishing grounds that have devastated the city. The textile mills that once provided jobs for thousands of uneducated immigrants have long since shut down, and jobs are scarce for everyone.
Now, amid the deepening poverty, the city is being visited by the deadly plague of drugs and AIDS.
Ms. Barlow keeps an unofficial record of the dead on the wall of her laundry, posting the obituaries from the local newspaper of the men and women she knew. Most of them died young, in their 30's or early 40's.
"Died unexpectedly -- that means a drug overdose," Ms. Barlow said, reading aloud from the obituaries on her bulletin board. "Died after a long illness -- that's AIDS."
At the fisherman's bar next door to Millie's, the National Club, Dick Alcobia, the owner, a former fisherman, talks angrily about the obituaries. "They put it in the newspaper -- died unexpectedly," said Mr. Alcobia, who has been dispensing drinks -- and interest-free loans -- to fishermen in this town for 35 years. "Why not be honest? Why not let the guy die for a reason? You go to the wake, the casket is closed because some guy who used to weigh 200 pounds is shriveled up to 65 pounds, and they don't want anybody to see."
New Bedford, with 100,000 people and 417 reported AIDS cases since 1981, has the fifth-highest rate of AIDS in Massachusetts. Three-quarters of the cases are caused by intravenous drug use, health officials say.
Ms. Barlow recently went to the funeral of a scalloper in his 30's who died "after a long illness."
"He was a real nice guy, smart guy," she said. Sadly, she added, "A heroin addict."
Up the street from Millie's at the police station, Lieut. Melvin Wotton, a fisherman's son who heads the narcotics unit, held up a small plastic bag filled with heroin. "It used to be $20 a bag," he said. "Now it's $8 to $10." The heroin, he said, comes up along the highways from Providence and New York.
Away at sea for 10 to 16 days at a time and then home for less than a week, a fisherman has a life that can be stressful and lonely. Some turn to drugs and alcohol for comfort, Ms. Barlow said, and social service workers agree. By all accounts, the drug dealers prey on fishermen with money in their pocket, a few days to unwind and, for many, no families. "They sit down and wait for them at the dock," Mr. Alcobia said.
There are no records showing the extent of drug use among fisherman, and Lieutenant Wotton and other experts here say the problem affects people throughout the city.
Ms. Barlow knows of as many as 40 fishermen who have died of AIDS or drug overdoses in the last five years, she said, but she also knows plenty of fishermen who do not use drugs. The local newspaper, The Standard-Times, reported last July that a review of death certificates showed that 50 fishermen in New Bedford and surrounding communities had died of AIDS or drug-related causes in the previous five years.
Construction workers, carpenters and teachers are also among the dead. Ms. Barlow lost her best friend, a waiter, to AIDS.
Ms. Barlow, a former waitress, got into the laundry business 12 years ago when her two sons, Brian, 42, and Tim, 33, were fishing; only Brian still does. "I had two sons fishing," she said. "I used to wash all their clothes and all their friends' clothes. I thought it was a great idea to open a laundry." She started her business in what used to be Skip's Marine Supply, two blocks from the Whaling Museum, where she likes to show off New Bedford's proud heritage to her four grandchildren.
Her customers, most of them single fishermen, call her Mom. They walk around with their clothes smelling sweetly of Snuggle, the fabric softener she puts in the dryers.
Ms. Barlow also offers her customers coffee, home-cooked meals, bleach for those who use needles to inject drugs and respect.
"I've been on the boat," she said. "I've seen how they work. I've seen how my son works. I think it's one of the hardest things I've seen in my life." Ms. Barlow knows all about hard work. She left high school at age 15 to go to work as a sales clerk to help her mother and father and 11 brothers and sisters.
Sometimes the fishermen drop off their bags of clothes but never come back. Pointing to a worn blue duffel bag on the floor, Ms. Barlow said the owner, from Poland, had drowned.
While there is not much washing to do these days, there is plenty of hubbub at Millie's. Ms. Barlow's ex-husband, Chic, is usually around, folding clothes and watching television in the back.
The visitors this afternoon included Ms. Barlow's sons and Patricia Holland Heaps, a psychotherapist who says her fisherman father died at sea of pneumonia two weeks before her 13th birthday.
Harry Morris, a fishing captain about to head off to sea, sat on a chair, waiting for his laundry.
The day before, another fishing captain, Carl Corrao Jr., had come by, back from his father's funeral in Florida. Ms. Barlow hugged him. "I'm so sorry about your father, Carl," she said.
Mr. Corrao held out a medallion he had received recently to mark his eighth year without drugs. Ms. Barlow congratulated him.
New Bedford, with its mix of Portuguese, Cape Verdean, Cambodian, Polish, Dominican and Guatemalan immigrants, had the highest unemployment rate, 10.6 percent, of any city in the state last year. But the city, which was among the richest in the world back in the 19th-century whaling days, is trying to make a comeback. Hopes were raised last year when the neighborhood that includes the laundry was designated a national historic district. There is talk of building an aquarium that would attract tourists.
"New Bedford has a lot of potential," Ms. Barlow said.
A sign over the laundry advertises her name in big black and white letters: Millie's. "I want people to know who I am when I come down here," she said.
There are days, though, with business lagging and the bill collectors calling, that she would rather not be Millie, she said. "When certain people call, I say, 'Millie's not here anymore -- she went to Florida.' "

HEADLINE: Down-and-Out Town Sees Survival in a Private Prison

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: FALLSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
Frank Kaplan, the town supervisor here, scans Main Street in South Fallsburg, one of the six communities that make up this Catskills town. He looks at the sagging buildings that used to house grocery stores, clothing shops, a pizza parlor and like a mantra he utters the obvious: "Empty. Boarded up. Empty. Boarded up."
The town is hurting. There are few jobs, few people and still fewer tax-paying businesses. There are several Orthodox Jewish temples and schools, but they are all tax exempt. There is a sprawling ashram on land once owned by three hotels. It is tax exempt. There are three state prisons. Again, tax exempt. 
 It's no wonder that when Corrections Corporation of America, the world's largest operator of private prisons, proposed building the first one in New York State here, Mr. Kaplan and other local officials perked up. The land and building would be taxable. "It would help stop the hemorrhaging," Mr. Kaplan said.
Corrections Corporation has already paid $470,000 for 185 acres on the site of the former Rothstein's Olympic Ranch and Fitness Resort, and plans to build a 1,000-bed "minimum to medium security" substance-abuse treatment prison, said Susan Hart, a spokeswoman. About 250 jobs would be created, she added.
But beyond its purchase of the land, the company has yet to detail its plans, and it is unclear whether it can legally build a prison in Fallsburg. New York prohibits private companies from housing the state's prisoners, and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco says he is studying whether the company would be allowed to hold prisoners from other states under the law. To that end, he has asked to company to state its intentions.
Although Ms. Hart would not say where prisoners would come from, she said: "There is a need for a specialized type of correctional facility in this part of the country. We do not have a presence in New York State, and we're expanding not only the number of beds we have and the number of contracts, but we're expanding geographically. This would add to our book of business."
Corrections Corporation of America, based in Nashville, runs 59 prisons in 17 states and in Puerto Rico, Britain and Australia. It runs a detention center for illegal immigrants in Elizabeth, N.J. (It took over management of the center from another private prison concern, Esmor Correctional Services, after a disturbance.)
But it has not said whether it would try to hold Federal immigration detainees, or Federal prisoners, at the Fallsburg location.
Gov. George E. Pataki, generally known to support privatization, is strongly opposed to private prisons, as is the Commissioner of Correction, Glenn S. Goord, said James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services.
"The Governor and the Commissioner believe that there are certain functions of government that government must perform," he said. "One of the most onerous functions of government is denying someone their liberty. That should be the responsibility of the Governor and the people he appoints."
None of this sits well with Mr. Kaplan and other members of the town board, who are still smarting from the State Senate's vote in January against legalized casino gambling in the Catskills and the rest of New York State.
"Why not let local people make up their minds about what they want?" Mr. Kaplan said. "What we lack are jobs, and jobs come from business. We need commercial tax-paying property. We're losing $10 million a year in assessed valuation. We don't appreciate these obstructionist attacks. How would the Governor have felt when he was Mayor of Peekskill if someone would have told him he couldn't have a business in town?"
Steve Levine, the town's deputy supervisor, agrees. "Let the state give us some money to augment what we lose from the tax-exempt businesses that are here, since their laws are hurting us," he said.
Mr. Kaplan thinks the Governor is pandering to the correction officers union.
Bob Lawson, communications director for Council 82, a union of 26,000 correction and law enforcement officers, makes no bones about the union's opposition to private prisons, most of which hire nonunion workers. "We have vowed to do everything from the grass roots to the Governor to oppose it," Mr. Lawson said. "The track record of private prisons in other states is dismal, to say the least, from the safety of the prisons to the training of correction officers."
Mr. Flateau pointed out that legislatively, much stands in the way of operating private prisons in New York. For example, he said, under New York State law, an escapee from a private prison cannot be charged with escape. (A judge in Texas ruled that inmates breaking out of private prisons could not be charged with escape. In Texas, which has more private prisons than any other state, legislators are considering rewriting the law to close that loophole.)
In other states, private companies have housed prisoners imported from elsewhere. But Attorney General Vacco said he would oppose importing prisoners into New York State.
"They ought to find a place like Texas or Florida where they're authorized by law to operate a private prison," he said. "I'm not going to stand idly by while they bring in prisoners from an undisclosed jurisdiction. We can do other things to enhance the economic climate in Sullivan County. Why do we want to turn the beauty of the natural landscape of the Catskills into a region of out-of-state prisoners. We have enough difficulty with our own prisoners."
Companies like Corrections Corporation of America can build prisons for 15 percent to 25 percent less than government agencies because they are not subject to the same construction contract rules.
They often operate their prisons for 10 percent to 20 percent less by hiring fewer administrators, procuring goods and services at lower rates and, finally, because most are not bound by civil service and union rules.
But for Mr. Levine, the union issue is a nonissue. He said he just wanted help for his dying community. "Let them be unionized," he said. "We don't care. We'll take another state prison for the jobs. It's like Albany has forgotten about us. It's like Sullivan County is second-class."

HEADLINE: An Endangered Act

 BODY:
Last week the city of San Diego approved the first stage of the most ambitious effort ever undertaken in this country to reconcile the competing needs of environmental protection and economic development. The unanimous vote by the San Diego City Council means a virtual Noah's Ark of endangered plant and animal life will now have a fighting chance to survive the relentless development that has disfigured so much of Southern California. It may also give the Federal law that made the plan possible, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a better chance of surviving Congressional efforts to weaken it.
Under the plan, out of a 900-square-mile region, 172,000 acres will be set aside as protected habitat for 85 endangered species. One of these is a vulnerable little bird called the California gnatcatcher, whose shaky hold on survival got the whole process started six years ago. Eventually, state and Federal planners hope to create a network of nature preserves covering an additional half-million acres from Los Angeles to Mexico. 
 In exchange for giving up all rights to develop this acreage, developers will be freed from any further obligation to protect endangered species on the rest of the land covered by the San Diego plan. The Clinton Administration has already built this "no surprises" policy -- shielding landowners from future challenges under the Endangered Species Act -- into scores of habitat conservation plans around the country.
Many conservationists do not like "no surprises." Nature, they note, is not static, and even the most beautifully designed habitat plan may need midcourse corrections. They have a point. In future agreements, the Federal Government should insist on the right to negotiate additional protections if they become necessary.
That said, the plan and its endorsement by a conservative city could not have come at a better moment for supporters of the Endangered Species Act. By protecting an entire ecosystem, the plan should reduce the need for the costly tract-by-tract, species-by-species struggles that provoke political opposition. The plan is also proof that the existing law can reconcile even the most bitter opponents without requiring the massive overhaul that some members of Congress have in mind.
The question is whether Congress is paying attention. The Endangered Species Act is the most controversial of the landmark environmental statutes passed during the Nixon era. Property-rights advocates hate it. The Republicans who run the key environmental committee in the House would just as soon get rid of it. Even in the more hospitable Senate, John Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho are circulating a draft bill that, while offering useful improvements, would leave the basic law in a weakened condition.
Mr. Chafee, for years one of the Senate's most dependable defenders of the environment, apparently believes that he has to offer a few compromises to head off the zealots on his committee. But the Administration is not so encumbered. It should march up to Capitol Hill with the message that the bill is unacceptable.
The bill would undercut the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to review and when necessary modify Federal projects that harm species and their habitats. That job would be largely handed over to the very agencies whose projects are causing the threat -- agencies like the Forest Service, which has a dismal record on environmental matters. The bill also shifts control over water rights to the states, which in many Western jurisdictions would mean serious trouble for threatened fish species like the Pacific salmon. Finally, in codifying the "no surprises" policy, the bill fails to provide for the kind of midcourse review that would have made the San Diego plan much stronger than it is.
Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary who worked hard to bring the San Diego plan into being, cannot rest on that achievement. His next task is to go up to the Senate and demand a better bill.

HEADLINE: Disabled Children Feel Budget Cuts;
Long-Term Care Is Reduced Under Managed Care Programs

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va.

 BODY:
Three-year-old Samantha can say about 10 words. She can say "stuck," as she tries to slide out of her wheelchair on her powerless legs. Peppy and playful now, Samantha started coming to the Children's Therapy Clinic here in the winter of 1996 with a range of disabilities that seemed to preclude any thought that she would ever speak or navigate a wheelchair.
"We had been told that she was severely, profoundly mentally retarded," said Connie Miller, Samantha's foster mother. "All she did was cry. She wanted to be flat on her back on the floor." 
 In 90-minute sessions every Tuesday, therapists have been working with Samantha and had ever rising hopes that she would eventually be able to function on her own. "She just hadn't been worked with," Ms. Miller said.
But those hopes are dimming. The state sharply cut financing for Samantha's therapy in January. Like many of the nation's children who have chronic and developmental disabilities, like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism, sensory impairments and fetal alcohol syndrome, she has been caught in the move to limit state and Federal spending for welfare and health care, particularly for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor whose costs the states share with the Federal Government.
Chronically handicapped children in West Virginia are not alone, though they are among the most severely affected because the state's weak economy has forced budget cuts. Most states are shifting to the businesslike practices of managed health care, and many are turning their patients over to health maintenance organizations that provide little chronic or long-term care for children.
Peggy McManus, co-director of the Maternal and Child Health Policy Research Center in Washington, a private group, said of children served by managed care: "It's a hot potato. The bottom line is these kids are not getting access to services."
In a study of the impact of managed care on children in four states -- Oregon, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Tennessee -- Ms. McManus said she found that "the infrastructure that has been created as a safety net for kids with special needs is crumbling."
The effort to cut costs has exposed sharp differences between health care services and government agencies over how much professional attention a child needs. "What we're finding is that the state is not going to want to pay to maintain these children," said Jennifer Bezjak, director of the Children's Therapy Clinic here. "The trend is to get children to a certain level and place the burden on the parent to continue the process."
West Virginia health officials do not dispute Ms. Bezjak's findings. They argue, however, that years of largely uncontrolled Medicaid spending, based mainly on the prescriptions of doctors and health care providers, led to excesses and inefficiencies at the Children's Therapy Clinic and the three other privately run clinics in the state for disabled children.
"No one denies they provide very good services," said Philip Shimer, Acting Commissioner for the Bureau for Medical Services, the state's Medicaid agency, speaking of the four clinics. But he said, "They were asked to better align what they were providing with what we pay for."
Medicaid was one program that President Clinton persuaded Congress not to cut in the overhaul of the welfare system last year. But cuts in care for the children in poverty who are eligible for Medicaid are coming anyway because of the cost-saving initiatives of many states.
"It's a real squeeze, from one state to the next," said Joseph Romer, executive vice president of the National Easter Seal Society, which operates 105 clinics for one million people with disabilities nationwide, including 350,000 children. Most of the clinics receive Medicaid support.
Depending on the strength of their economies, states contribute an average of 25 percent of the cost of Medicaid, and the Federal Government pays the rest. The states are allowed wide latitude in the type of care they provide. But when states cut the cost in their Medicaid programs, the Federal contributions decline in line with state spending.
For children with chronic disabilities, new state curbs on Medicaid pose a difficult question for politicians and bureaucrats, and not solely because of compassion for the children. Unlike most disabled adults or people needing short-term therapy after an accident or a bout with disease, a child with a chronic disability is often an uncharted terrain of human potential.
No one knows yet, for example, how far Samantha can go in learning to speak, to dress and feed herself, to use her muscles and limbs. But advocates of frequent professional therapy say that the more that government and charities invest in helping Samantha learn to function as a child, the less they will have to spend to support her as an adult.
Samantha's weekly therapy sessions cost about $5,000 a year, and foster care for her and her two foster brothers costs about $30,000 a year. But one year in an institution for one child costs $80,000 a year, according to the National Easter Seal Society. For the moment, the Children's Therapy Clinic here is keeping Samantha on her regular schedule of therapy by delaying admission of new patients and digging into its reserves of charitable donations, mostly from the United Way, which it uses to cover services that Medicaid does not and to treat children who have no insurance.
But that well, too, is running dry. Jack Blair, president of the United Way agency in Charleston, said the clinic was one of the city's most popular charities and the second-largest recipient of United Way grants. "But the private sector just cannot replace the revenue sources that have come from the government," Mr. Blair said.
In West Virginia, Medicaid spending, for which the state pays $1 for every $3 from the Federal Government, has become an enormous burden, leaping to $1.3 billion a year in combined state and Federal spending, from $400 million a year in the late 1980's. The state is trying to slice $150 million from that total.
Even West Virginia's relatively small share -- about $3.25 million -- has begun to put strains on a state that vies with Mississippi and Louisiana as the nation's poorest. Twenty-nine percent of West Virginia's children live in poverty.
And yet the state had become a model in caring for them. With the big expansion of Medicaid, the state's infant mortality rate dropped from 9.9 deaths for every 1,000 children up to the age of 1 in 1990 to 6.7 in 1994, lifting the state from 41st in the nation to 14th.
To achieve the new cut, West Virginia, like many states, has turned to the tight scrutiny and business practices of managed care in allocating money to health care providers like the Children's Therapy Clinic.
With 385 patients and a waiting list of 60, the clinic is the biggest of the four in the state providing therapy for disabled children, whether rich or poor, and the only one serving Charleston and a 10-county area.
About 220 of its patients are covered by Medicaid. Fifteen have no insurance and are covered entirely by charitable contributions. The rest are covered by their parents' private insurance policies.
The clinic charges $45 for a half-hour of occupational or physical therapy. Before the cuts, Medicaid reimbursed $35 of that amount and allowed up to 120 half-hour sessions for each patient a year. Under the cutback, Medicaid pays from $17 to $32 for sessions of 15 minutes to one hour and restricts the number of covered sessions to 20.
Experts in child development argue that children with chronic disabilities like Samantha's typically need regular and individually tailored professional therapy based on frequent evaluations of their progress by doctors and therapists. Without that, the experts say, the children can regress.
"Often what may be true for adults is absolutely not true for children," said Katy Neas, senior government relations specialist for the National Easter Seal Society. "They change so fast. You can get parents to help them with their exercises, but that's not therapy."
The state is also rationing the care. Jack Frazier, a senior policy analyst in the Medical Services Bureau, explained that a health care provider might seek financing for speech therapy for a 4-year-old child whom a doctor finds six months behind in learning to speak. The state could well reject that request now. "We would say he has a mild delay and that it's not significant," Mr. Frazier said.
Many patients, however, pose more difficult choices. Donna Manning's foster son, Kiry, 5, given up by an unwed mother at birth, is about 6 months old in development. He has to be carried. He gurgles and drools. He still drinks from a bottle and wears diapers. He cannot stand or even crawl. "He's got cerebral palsy and a brain deficiency," Ms. Manning said.
With regular therapy and practice at home, Kiry has begun sounding out vowels, his first signs of speech. He is showing some curiosity. "What he needs now is a wheelchair," Ms. Manning said. But with the new restraints, she said, the state would not buy him one.
Vicki Douglas, a Democratic state legislator, said the Medicaid budget planners' unilateral prescriptions for all children did not allow for the vast differences in children's needs. "Those T-shirt solutions, do not work very well for those who do not fit the T-shirt," she said.

RISING TIDE
The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America
By John M. Barry
Illustrated. 524 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27.50. 
 It's a great idea for a popular history that John M. Barry has come up with in "Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America." And he gets off to a wonderful beginning.
A political reporter whose first book was "The Ambition and the Power," about the downfall in 1989 of Speaker of the House James C. Wright Jr., Mr. Barry understands well how to create drama through conflict. And in the competition between two brilliant and fascinating 19th-century engineers, James Buchanan Eads and Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, he has a conflict amounting to a duel to the death with slide rules. Both of them shaped by an age that thought science could solve any problem, Eads and Humphreys were determined to master the chaotic forces of the Mississippi River. Through their separate studies they came to disagree with the conventional wisdom of the time, which held that the river's tendency to flood could be contained by levees, or earth mounded into hills along its banks.
Eads logically objected that levees only exerted their effect when the river rose to their high level. Levees would therefore not consistently speed up the flow of the water and produce the scouring effect needed to deepen the riverbed. His alternative proposal was to build jetties along each bank that would narrow the river and accelerate its flow, and its scouring effect, even when it wasn't flooding.
To demonstrate, Eads set about in 1875 to construct jetties in the mouth of the Mississippi that would cause the scouring out of the sandbars that were preventing ships from sailing up the river. By this time he had aroused Humphreys's enmity, and Humphrey had enough political pull to thwart his rival's project at every turn. Eads finally had to test his jetties' effect by getting an oceangoing steamship to sail between them. When the ship's bottom wasn't gouged out, his point was proven.
This first section of "Rising Tide," 100 pages long, is excitingly told, full of breathtaking twists and vivid scenes. Alas for posterity, Eads's point didn't stick, and the organization in charge of controlling the Mississippi went ahead with a levees-only system.
The catastrophic effect of this error was shown by the 1927 flood, when it washed out the levees in key places, and, as Mr. Barry writes, "put as much as 30 feet of water over lands where 931,159 people -- the nation's total population was only 120 million -- had lived."
Unfortunately too, Mr. Barry's narrative loses its breakneck momentum when his two engineers leave the scene. The focus shifts north to the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta and the story of how four generations of a family named Percy founded the city of Greenville, Miss., and tried to build an agricultural civilization around it based on rich cotton and cheap labor.
There is dramatic conflict here too, particularly between the Percys, who wanted to keep black labor in the South, and the Ku Klux Klan, whose purpose was to drive blacks away. And there is much portentous prose about dark secrets, family scandal and a Faulknerian curse on the land. But despite Mr. Barry's pumping up of his story, its events are too diffuse in their occurrence and abstract in their significance to match the opening section's excitement.
All the same, "Rising Tide" remains worthwhile to read as history. Because of the levee system's failure, two particularly disastrous chains of events were set in motion. When a levee upriver from Greenville was breached, the flooding of the Delta led to a situation in which, as Mr. Barry describes events, the black population was betrayed by the Percy family and suffered severe mistreatment.
Because Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, had seized the flood as a way of promoting his candidacy for the Presidency in 1928, he got himself appointed in charge of relief and, Mr. Barry argues, exploited the plight of the blacks for his own ends.
Meanwhile, the city of New Orleans panicked over the rising waters and determined to lower them by dynamiting a levee downriver from the city and flooding a community of 10,000. When it came time to compensate this community, Mr. Barry writes, the leaders of New Orleans in effect reneged on their promise to do so.
The upshot of all this was considerable, as Mr. Barry sees it. Hoover won the Presidency, but betrayed the blacks who helped him. As a result, black voters began to shift from the Republican to the Democratic Party, and black labor began leaving the South in large numbers. The arrogant behavior of the New Orleans power elite helped get Huey Long elected as Governor of Louisiana, and sent the city into an economic decline.
Most significant, writes Mr. Barry, because of the South's insistence that the Federal Government pay for the flood damage, the resulting law "set a precedent of direct, comprehensive and vastly expanded Federal involvement in local affairs." A foretaste of big things to come, Mr. Barry points out. Meanwhile, the last in the direct line of Percys, William Alexander, when his cousin LeRoy committed suicide, adopted LeRoy's three sons, LeRoy, Phinizy and Walker, the last of whom would grow up to become the award-winning novelist.
Today, Mr. Barry concludes, the Mississippi has been equipped with some of the flood-relieving adaptations, like spillways and reservoirs, that the two engineers opposed to the levees-only system so presciently advocated. What the reader never gets, however, is an informed contemporary opinion of how the jetty system proposed by the brilliant James Buchanan Eads might have worked. But then by the time one gets to the end of "Rising Tide," Eads's proposal seems very far in the past. Too far in the past, as far as the real excitement of Mr. Barry's book is concerned.

Not Yet

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So it's all O.K. now?
That's the word from the Clinton folks. They got the mood music they were looking for in Helsinki: The Russians will complain about NATO expansion, but Boris Yeltsin will accept the goodies the U.S. offered him to tolerate NATO's moving closer to Russia's border. Therefore, we will have the best of all worlds: NATO expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, vague assurances to the Balts and others left out that they can join later and even some progress on arms control thrown in to boot. As one U.S. official quipped to me, referring to my own criticism of NATO expansion, "When do we get to see the headline: 'Clinton Right on NATO Expansion, Critics All Wrong'?"
Not yet. 
 To be fair, if Clinton is able to achieve this best-of-all-worlds scenario, it would indeed merit real praise. My priority is that the arms control treaties with Russia be implemented and the reform process there be enhanced. That is what would really secure European stability. If the Administration can deliver both, while also pursuing its dubious, politically inspired NATO expansion scheme, then it would be churlish to oppose this Helsinki package.
But we are a long way from drawing that conclusion. To begin with, many of the key issues involving NATO expansion remain unresolved: What will happen to all the countries, particularly the Balts, that don't get into NATO now? How will the U.S. Congress react when it discovers that Clinton's Helsinki package comes with a price tag of at least $40 billion, and a U.S. military commitment to defend the Polish border? How will Russia's parliament react to this deal?
But beyond these unanswered questions, I remain a skeptic because this Helsinki "success" is based on two white lies. The first is that while the Russians don't like NATO expansion, they've decided to make the best of it. In truth, that is not what Helsinki demonstrates. What it shows is that "Russia has concluded it is simply too weak to stop expansion," notes Johns Hopkins University foreign policy specialist Michael Mandelbaum, a leading critic of NATO expansion.
And the problem with expanding NATO on such terms, Mandelbaum argues, is that up to now "the entire post-cold war security structure in Europe, whether the unification of Germany or the conventional and nuclear arms control treaties, has been based on Russian consent. NATO expansion will be a departure from that. After NATO expands, the new European order will rest not on Russian consent, but on Russian weakness."
In other words, what Helsinki proves is that we won the cold war. But we knew that. The question is, Are we making the most of it? Should NATO expansion be a priority, even if it weakens Yeltsin or diminishes Russian cooperation elsewhere, such as against Iran?
The other white lie is the Clinton argument that expanding NATO will stabilize democratic reform in Central Europe and be good for Russia, because NATO has changed and Russia has changed. In truth, the way to strengthen free-market democracy in Central Europe is by bringing these nations into the E.U. common market, not by giving them NATO nukes. But more important, the very reason Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic want to join NATO is that they think NATO has not changed -- that it is still an anti-Russian alliance -- and because they feel that Russia has not changed -- that it is still the Soviet Union. (Never mind that Russia now has a cabinet led by economic reformers more progressive than half the nations now trying to join NATO.)
What Clinton said to Yeltsin in Helsinki was: We will pay you to pretend that NATO expansion is something other than what it is. We will pay you to forget that NATO is expanding because you're weak and because we still see you as the main threat to European stability, not as an equal member of the club. For now, Yeltsin is willing to be bought because he has no choice. But we should have no illusions: Clinton's "New Europe" is being built on white lies.
Momma always said: When you don't call things by their real name, you get in trouble. That's what's going on here. I don't know when or where, but this sort of diplomacy will lead to trouble. So pardon me for sticking with the headline: "Clinton Still Wrong on NATO Expansion, Critics Still Right."

HEADLINE: Mobutu, Emerging, Vows to Unite Zaire but Doesn't Say How

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, March 23

 BODY:
Zaire's ailing President, Mobutu Sese Seko, made his first public appearance today since he returned home on Friday, promising to unite his shattering country.
But Mr. Mobutu, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer, gave no indication of how he planned to pull together his vast country, which has been besieged by a six-month civil war. He hinted that he would outline his proposal soon. 
 "You will know within the next 48 hours," he said.
Mr. Mobutu spent part of the day with South Africa's Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, who came here in an attempt to help resolve the crisis. Mr. Mobutu also received Cabinet members and other officials of his Government.
Wearing his signature leopard-skin hat, Mr. Mobutu, 66, looked frail and spoke briefly to journalists on the veranda of his villa perched above the Congo River at Camp Colonel Tshatshi.
"I'm as you see me," Mr. Mobutu said when asked about his health. He ignored other questions and recited what sounded like a prepared statement.
"I did not return to deal with the interests of Mobutu," said the President, who has ruled his country with an iron grip for 31 years. "Nor to deal with Mobutu's fortune, as you write from time to time, but to deal with the interests of Zaire -- our unity, our national integrity."
Mr. Mobutu, who had been in Europe for medical treatment, has few options. Western diplomats predicted that he might resign outright, form a new Government or create a "national council" free of his control and give opposition parties a greater role in government.
In the most widely discussed possibility, Mr. Mobutu would appoint his chief political rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, as Prime Minister, in the hope that the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, would then accept a cease-fire and negotiate.
"I don't know if Kabila is going to buy that," a diplomat said of the rebel commander, who leads a group called the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. "But that's how it's going to be presented."
Since last October, the rebels have repeatedly routed undisciplined and demoralized Government troops, gaining control of much of the eastern part of the country. Now the rebels are pushing toward Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city. President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who has been playing a leading role in efforts to end the conflict, sent Deputy President Mbeki here with a letter asking the parties to halt the fighting and negotiate a settlement. The rebels have refused.
Although Mr. Kabila has steadily gained both territory and popular support, questions remain as to whether he could effectively govern the entire country.
Many here were deeply worried when Mr. Kabila announced recently that he would form a provisional Government excluding any political figures who had shared power with Mr. Mobutu. Mr. Tshisekedi, too, commands considerable support in the capital.
"We are the ones who have brought down Mobutu, the man who used to consider himself the colleague of the gods," said Kabanga Badadi, president of the National Christian Democratic Party, which has announced its support for Mr. Tshisekedi as Prime Minister.
"We were defeating him with the pen," he said. "Is it fair to come in now with the gun and say you're shutting out those who have fought for democracy?"
Wherever the rebels have taken control, however, Mr. Kabila has established an administration that diplomats call impressive. In every town, the rebels have included local people in policy discussions and have kept corruption to a minimum.
The streets in this sprawling city appeared calm today. Most people went about their Sunday routine -- attending mass, catching up on family gossip and seeking refuge from the blistering heat.
Still, there was unease as Western nations continued to make preparations for possible evacuations of their citizens. Belgium, this country's former colonial ruler, announced that it would fly soldiers to neighboring Libreville, Gabon, to rescue its 2,800 citizens in Zaire if necessary.
Today, as news of Mr. Mobutu's appearance filtered through the capital, residents reacted with annoyance and impatience.
"He's not going to change anything," said Jean-Marcaire Katunda, 38, who was discussing the event with a group of unemployed men. "He has been in power for a long time and he has done nothing for the country. We are awaiting Kabila, not Mobutu."
Standing nearby, Touby Mbengi, 31, said, "Mobutu never tells the truth."

HEADLINE: Schumer Criticizes Pataki's Plan to Increase Tuition at Public Colleges

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Already pressed for money, Harry Daguizam, a student at Hunter College in Manhattan, says that Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed $400 tuition increase for New York's public colleges may force him to delay plans to attend law school.
"The City University of New York was created for students who couldn't afford to go to a big-name Ivy League college," Mr. Daguizam, 21, said in an interview. "And I just want to say, 'Please, let's keep it that way.' " 
 At a news conference yesterday, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of Brooklyn, criticized the Governor's proposal and urged the adoption of his own plan, which would allow parents to create tax-exempt savings accounts for tuition while their children are young.
He said that more and more students at New York's public universities are finding it harder to pay for their educations because of increases in tuition and cuts in financial aid -- a problem that may be forcing lower income students to drop out.
"One of the great things about New York is that we've always had people who have been well trained," said Mr. Schumer, who is considered a possible gubernatorial candidate. "That golden day may close."
To show the severity of the problem, Mr. Schumer said, he gathered figures indicating that students at the State University of New York who graduated in 1995 owed, on average, 65 percent more in Federal loans than those who graduated in 1990, even though inflation rose only about 16 percent over that time.
Students at the City University of New York also faced an increasing burden, Mr. Schumer said. The average Federal student loan balance at graduation was 34 percent higher in 1995 than in 1990.
In January, Governor Pataki proposed the $400 annual increase, which would bring tuition at SUNY to $3,800 a year and tuition at CUNY's four-year colleges to $3,600 a year. He also proposed a reduction in state aid for some of the neediest students.
Yesterday, Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor, defended the proposals.
"The State University system remains one of the best bargains in the nation," Mr. McKeon said. "Under Governor Pataki, New York State continues to provide tuition assistance that puts 80,000 students through SUNY and CUNY systems tuition-free."
Mr. Pataki's proposals still face scrutiny in the Legislature, which rejected similar tuition increases last year. Mr. Schumer called on state lawmakers to defeat the Governor's proposals, and he asked legislators in both Albany and Washington to pass bills similar to the one he has proposed.
Robert M. Hollander, who is studying linguistics and sits on the Doctoral Students' Council at CUNY, compared the combination of rising tuition and lower financial aid to "a vise" that squeezes students tighter and tighter. He said at the news conference yesterday that when students have to work to make up for a tuition increase, they must reduce the number of classes they take. That, in turn, forces them to stay in school for more terms, increasing their debt burden even more, he said.
Shamsun Naher, 27, said that she is still a Hunter College freshman, even though she has been attending classes since 1994. To afford school, she said, she must work full time.
"If you don't get a degree," she said, "you won't get a good job, and if you don't get a good job, how can you improve your life?"
Nora Dial, 32, a student in the 15-month midwife re-education program at the SUNY Health Science Center at Brooklyn, received her nursing degree at the school in 1996. In the fall semester 1995, Ms. Dial went to Albany with 100 other nursing and medical students to protest that semester's tuition increase.
"If I was an incoming student, an extra $400 or $500 increase would hurt quite a lot," she said. "I would be very upset. The added financial burden makes things much more difficult for students, and there's enough stress as it is. It makes you lose faith in the system."

HEADLINE: Study Shows Jump in Investing in China and Revival in Mexico

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
China now attracts more than a third of all the investment in factories and other manufacturing plants in developing nations, attracting $42 billion last year, according to a study of global investment trends released today by the World Bank.
The study also provided the strongest evidence yet that Mexico is recovering speedily from the financial crisis that started about two years ago and threatened to ricochet through other fast-growing emerging markets. And over all, capital flows into the world's emerging markets rose to more than $244 billion last year, a jump of $60 billion from 1995. That figure combines net investments in factories and real estate with commercial lending and investments in stocks and bonds. 
 Direct investment in factories and other manufacturing sites in Mexico totaled only $6.4 billion in 1996. That was a distant second to China's $42 billion, just ahead of Malaysia, and well below the investment levels in Mexico before the peso crisis of late 1994 and 1995. However, the Clinton Administration's effort to stabilize the Mexican economy so that private investors would return appears to have worked. Last year, a record $28 billion in total private capital poured into the country, twice the amount that went into Mexico in 1995, at the depth of the country's economic troubles.
The picture of Mexico drawn in the report bolsters the Clinton Administration's decision to use taxpayer funds to prop up the country's economic recovery. But perhaps the most interesting and politically significant conclusions in the report concern China, the emerging market that has become a battleground for developed nations seeking to stake a large economic foothold.
The figures show a huge increase in direct investment and commercial lending to China, though fairly cautious investment in China's stock markets. The rise in direct investment could make China more reluctant to make market-opening concessions in the negotiations to enter the World Trade Organization, the main club of trading nations.
"It frees the Chinese to say, 'Hey, even without making reforms everyone is breaking down the door to invest here,' " one Clinton Administration official familiar with the negotiations said recently. "These kinds of numbers help the hard-liners who don't want to deregulate or risk destabilizing the state-owned industries."
The report also concluded that China had been building up a huge war chest of foreign exchange reserves, now totaling more than $100 billion. The World Bank's economists, comparing that amount with the reserves of other nations around the world, concluded that China's reserves were "higher in absolute terms than Germany's foreign reserves, and equivalent to about nine months of imports."
But even as private investment in markets like China has surged, foreign aid from the governments of the wealthiest nations to the poorest has continued a rapid decline. Grants and concessional loans, which are offered at below-market interest rates, declined by nearly $1 billion, to $44.4 billion.
"What we are seeing is that aid is down to levels that no one has seen since 1990," said Fred Kilby, an economic adviser at the World Bank who assembled the report.
The bank's study concluded that the cuts for education and economic development programs in the developing world had been more severe than the numbers reveal, because a far larger portion of foreign aid now goes to refugee relief and peacekeeping in Haiti, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
Much of the remaining aid now goes to sub-Saharan areas of Africa. East Asia has declined as a recipient of foreign aid, though there have been significant increases in aid to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
Investors also returned to Europe and Central Asia over the last two years, the study concludes. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Turkey were all able to borrow significant amounts in private markets, and Russia floated a $1 billion Eurobond offer that marked its return to international capital markets.
But the chief economist of the bank, Joseph Stiglitz, who recently left the White House as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, cautioned on Friday that the world markets were increasingly unforgiving of countries that wandered off a narrow path in how they managed their economies and failed to open their markets to competition. "The stakes become higher for those countries that fail to undertake these reforms," he said.
The statistics in the report confirm what anyone trying to find a business-class seat on an airline flying to Asia already knows: Asia is awash in Western cash to build power plants, telecommunications facilities, airports, roads and other projects.
The study found that more than half of the $22.2 billion in infrastructure financing to developing countries in 1995 went to Asia. A decade ago, the region drew only about a quarter of the loans, bond issues and equity sales in infrastructure projects.

Israel Presses Arafat On Steps to Curb Attacks
Israel demanded that the Palestinian Authority take measures against further terrorism, but fell short of threatening to stop peace negotiations. The Government's statement was accompanied by declarations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security chiefs charging the Palestinian leadership with giving an indirect "green light" for terror attacks. Security forces maintained a high alert after Friday's bombing in Tel Aviv. A1
 
Palestinian police officers faced the wrath of their own people as they tried to control a crowd hurling stones at Israeli soldiers. A6
 
Zaire Leader Ends Isolation
Zaire's ailing President, Mobutu Sese Seko, made his first public appearance since returning home. He promised to unite his country, but gave no indication of how he planned to do it. Western diplomats predicted that he might resign, form a new Government or create a "national council" free of his control and give opposition parties a greater role in government. A9
 
An American Army airborne unit arrived in Congo to prepare for the possible evacuation of Americans from Zaire. A9
 
Chaos Continues in Albania
Albania's President, Sali Berisha, dug in his heels and said he would not be "blackmailed" into resigning. Rebels from the port of Vlore, for their part, repeated their demand that Mr. Berisha go. One group from Vlore circulated a petition threatening the head of the secret police with death unless he resigned. Inflation soared. A8
 
European officials said the European Union was expected to provide a small contingent to provide security for the delivery of food and other aid in Albania. A8
 
Philippine Cloak for Korean
Reporters scrambled frantically in the Philippines to try to find a North Korean defector being given refuge there temporarily after he was allowed to leave Beijing. The Government confirmed that he was in the country, but reporters were marveling at the success of officials at keeping their secret. A4
 
Belarus Expels U.S. Envoy
An American diplomat was asked to leave Belarus after taking part in an anti-Government rally, state television said. The statement said that the embassy's first secretary had been detained during a protest against the President's pro-Moscow policies. In Washington, the White House said that the official would comply. A8
 
Burmese Religious Conflict
Officials tightened security in the capital of Myanmar, formerly Burma, because of religious conflict. The unrest began a week ago in Mandalay, when Buddhist monks attacked mosques after reports that a Buddhist girl had been raped by a Muslim man. Monks play a major role in the affairs of the largely Buddhist country. A6

Deal With Cigarette Maker Yields Little for Smokers
Thousands of smokers and their families stand to gain little financially under a proposal in which one of the nation's large cigarette makers would settle all present and future lawsuits by smokers, their survivors, cities, counties and insurers. An Alabama judge has given preliminary approval for the settlement with the company, the Liggett Group. That settlement is separate from one in which Liggett agreed to admit that smoking is addictive and causes cancer. A1

Drug Corruption on the Border
Law-enforcement authorities said they had mounting evidence of systemic corruption of Federal and local officials by drug dealers in some remote counties along the Mexican border. Some of the suspicions involve customs and immigration inspectors, who had long been considered trustworthy defenders against the influx of marijuana, cocaine and heroin. A1

Rabbis Argue Over Judaism
A group of Orthodox rabbis said it would issue a statement declaring that the Reform and Conservative movements, the more liberal branches of the faith, are "not Judaism." A spokesman for the group said the statement was timed to counter efforts by Reform and Conservative leaders to gain official recognition for their movements in Israel. The statement was criticized by a number of Jewish religious leaders, including the president of the nation's largest Orthodox rabbinic organization. A11
 
New Guideline on Mammograms
The American Cancer Society recommended that women begin annual mammograms to detect breast cancer at age 40. Until now, the cancer society had urged mammograms every year or two for women in their 40's. The society's board of directors announced the change at a science writers' conference. A10
 
Thaw Floods North Dakota
Runoff from melting snow flooded hundreds of homes across North Dakota as ice jams sent rivers pouring over their banks. Several residents had to leave Beulah and Hazen, N.D., two small towns roughly 50 miles northwest of Bismarck where the Knife River spilled over its banks. The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for broad areas of western and south-central North Dakota, after two days of temperatures in the 50's. (Reuters)

Whitman Assailed on Plan To Cover Pension Shortfall
Governor Whitman is seeking to borrow $2.9 billion over 35 years to help cover a shortfall in New Jersey's pension system -- the first time any state has floated bonds to cover pension liabilities. She faces a $750 million budget gap in a year when she is running for re-election. Her critics said the plan would burden future taxpayers with the costs of the tax cuts she boasts about now. A1
 
Objections to Private Prison
Several New York State officials said they objected to a company's proposal to build a privately owned prison in the Catskills and take in prisoners from other states. State law prohibits New York's own prisoners from being housed in private prisons, and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said he was not sure that the law would even allow the prison to take inmates from elsewhere. Officials in Fallsburg, where the prison would be built, said they needed it to shore up their tax base, especially since the State Senate's vote in January against casino gambling in the Catskills.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Defends His Decision on Issuing City Contracts

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Facing criticism that minority-owned businesses are suffering under his administration, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday vigorously defended his decision three years ago to dismantle an affirmative action program that steered city contracts to such businesses.
Mr. Giuliani said that the program, a major initiative of former Mayor David N. Dinkins, had been of questionable legality ever since several court decisions declared such practices unconstitutional. 
 And besides, he added, the program often helped businesses that needed no help or employed few minorities or women. Since the program was eliminated, the city has instead encouraged banks to lend to small minority businesses and has expanded bidding on smaller contracts as a way to include more struggling businesses in poor neighborhoods.
But even as he touted this approach, the Mayor conceded that the city no longer keeps track of how many city contracts are awarded to minority-owned businesses, suggesting that officials have no way of knowing whether their efforts are working.
"I've done away with a lot of that race-based analysis," Mr. Giuliani said. He was responding to questions about an article in The Daily News yesterday that stated that the city had not compiled statistics on the number or value of contracts awarded to businesses owned by minorities or women since mid-1994.
"Our analysis is, 'How are we helping small businesses? How are we helping poor people in the city?' " Mr. Giuliani said. "How are we helping people who are poor, not people who are poor who are white or black?"
Under the old program, companies owned by women or minority group members could be awarded city contracts even if their bids were 10 percent higher than the lowest bid.
In its first year, 1992, the program increased the percentage of contracts awarded to such companies to 17.5 percent, up from 9 percent in 1990.
Two earlier studies had found that minorities and women represented 25 percent of qualified contract bidders, but received less than 8 percent of the public money spent in a given year.
While Mr. Giuliani defended the philosophy of his policies yesterday, he said nothing about what effect they have had, even in a general sense. Instead, he repeatedly emphasized that even if the city had wanted to keep minority contracting goals in place, it would have been foolhardy.
"Had I gone ahead with the program I inherited and awarded contracts on that basis, the City of New York would now be paying hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for unconstitutionally and illegally used race-based criteria as a way of helping people," Mr. Giuliani said.
Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who oversaw the implementation of the new policies when he was commissioner of the Department of Business Services, said the administration had focused on strengthening minority businesses to compete for contracts in an open market. "Most programs just seek to give somebody a contract and subsequently they default or fail on that contract," he said.
Although court rulings do not prevent the city from compiling data that identifies contractors by race or sex, Mr. Washington said, he questioned "the real significance of trying to keep data on 'Who's doing what?' " Rather than "sitting by idly and playing the numbers game," he said, "we wanted to do something proactive."

HEADLINE: Gore, in Japan, Pushes the Environment

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, March 24

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, visiting Tokyo at the start of a tour in Asia, proposed today that the United States and Japan take the lead in persuading countries to reduce their emissions of carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases.
"Economic and security issues are vitally important," Mr. Gore said in a speech to an environmental forum intended to lay the groundwork for a global environmental conference in Kyoto, Japan, next December. "Yet they are undergirded and integrally connected to our stewardship of the planet." 
 Aides said that Mr. Gore hopes that an agreement can be completed in time for the conference.
Mr. Gore's one-day visit to Tokyo included dinner with Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, a courtesy call on Japan's emperor and empress and meetings with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to discuss policies on China, trade and American leases for military bases in Okinawa.
Given the attempts to bring North and South Korea together for formal peace talks, Mr. Gore said, "this would be the very worst time" for the United States to consider shrinking its military forces in the region, which include some 40,000 troops in South Korea as well as forces in Japan.
The environment is high on the agenda for Mr. Gore's trip, which will take him to China for four days of talks, including discussions with Prime Minister Li Peng on China's plans to quadruple its energy supply over the next decade.

HEADLINE: San Diego: The Wireless Valley;
An Information Revolution Revives Its Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
The economic boom from high technology that has led this area to start calling itself Wireless Valley will soon be hard to miss. The San Diego City Council recently accepted $18 million from Qualcomm Inc., the scrappy telecommunications company that is shaking up the cellular industry, to rename a sports arena Qualcomm Stadium.
If it appears that San Diego is borrowing a page from its northern neighbor, Silicon Valley, where the computer networking giant 3Com Corporation not long ago purchased the right to rename Candlestick Park, the resemblance does not end there. 
 From its roots as a military town, San Diego has been transformed in just half a decade into a vital entrepreneurial center spawning garage start-ups and attracting giant multinationals doing research, marketing and manufacturing.
A drive through the Sorrento Valley north of downtown San Diego shows Silicon Valley-like clusters of sprawling, low-slung, hyper-modern factories bracketed between the Pacific Ocean and the rolling desert foothills, and glinting in California sunshine.
Employment in telecommunications in the region jumped 65 percent in 1996 from the previous year, to 19,075. The two largest employers in the San Diego area are Qualcomm and Sony Electronics Inc. -- both wireless equipment makers -- with 7,500 and 4,000 workers, respectively.
The wireless industry is on the same growth curve that has marked other high-technology consumer industries like personal computers. Wireless operators are expected to increase their annual investment by 20 percent a year, from $29 billion last year to $86 billion in 2002.
As with any boom there are still reasons for caution. For example, in recent months Qualcomm has become embroiled in intellectual property lawsuits with two of its toughest competitors, Motorola Inc. and Ericsson Inc., over the wireless standard the San Diego company pioneered.
Moreover, the multibillion- dollar industry investment in spectrum licenses could still be a bust. Few think it will be, however. Currently, wireless penetration in the United States is estimated to be 16 percent and, according to the market research firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc., it is expected to be approximately 48 percent by 2006.
The development of the industry here highlights the way the geography of the information revolution differs from that of the industrial revolution. For information-based industries, labor is the most important natural resource.
Companies like Qualcomm, PCSI and Nokia Mobile Phones are clustering around San Diego because of engineering talent left over from the declining military industry and the proximity to the University of California at San Diego as a source of skilled workers.
"We're best known for biotechnology, but now telecommunications is growing faster," said William W. Otterson, a former I.B.M. executive who directs U.C.S.D. Connect, a program intended to transfer technology from the university into the private economy.
But Mr. Otterson warns that one possible factor could hold back growth: a serious shortage of trained engineers plagues the region.
Producing new engineers and keeping trained ones around was the focus of Richard Atkinson in the 1980's, when he was chancellor of the university campus. Like Stanford's former provost, Frederick Terman, who in the 1930's helped incubate the local electronics industry so that Stanford graduates could stay in the area, Mr. Atkinson in the 1980's built university-industry linkages in biotechnology and telecommunications. (He is now chancellor of the University of California system.)
In addition to the research activity at the university, Japanese, Korean and Finnish companies like Sony, Uniden, LG InfoCom and Nokia have moved wireless communications research and development activities to the area. The giant government-oriented research and consulting concern, the Science Applications International Corporation, last year acquired Bell Communications Research Inc. as part of a move into the communications field.
According to Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics in Palo Alto, Calif., industrial clusters linking companies around the manufacture of personal communication devices are now growing up in San Diego, mirroring a similar process in Silicon Valley. "The big difference between the two communities is scale," he said.
What it lacks in bulk, however, the wireless industry makes up in competitive fire. Today, the San Diego area is the home base of a new digital cellular transmission standard known as C.D.M.A., now the fastest-growing wireless technology in the United States. A consortium of 14 companies has established the Center for Wireless Communications at the university campus. It has recently embarked on the design of a broadband wireless network that consortium members hope will transform the nature of all kinds of business and home communications.
And San Diego has its own version of the Hewlett-Packard Company, Silicon Valley's pioneering electronics concern. In 1968, two San Diego engineering professors, Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Verterbi, started Linkabit, a part-time consulting firm focused on digital communications. The company grew into a full-time endeavor, making satellite communications gear for the military.
Now almost three decades later, Linkabit has spun off more than 20 other companies, including Qualcomm, a business Mr. Jacobs founded with Mr. Verterbi after selling Linkabit in 1980.
But more than the rise of any one company, it was the ascent of the Internet and a telecommunications explosion in the developing world that propelled a dramatic turnaround in the recession-plagued San Diego economy.
Nearly 44,000 people had been employed in the military and aerospace industries in 1990, the peak for such employment. The contraction in Federal military contracting squeezed that labor force down to 14,600 today. Military contractors reduced their work forces or left the area.
But the wireless business has helped bring an end to the subsequent recession in a quick three years. The wireless work force, only 5,200 in 1992, is now nearly half of what the military work force was at its peak, and growing rapidly.
"The wireless communications business has changed the nature of San Diego's economy," said Robert Conn, dean of the school of engineering at the University of California at San Diego.
And although the transformation seems an overnight occurrence, it has not been particularly easy. "San Diego has had a problem of trying to retread a lot of guys who were at General Dynamics, which was military-oriented and slow moving," said Martha Dennis, vice president for engineering at Pacific Coast Services Inc., a wireless data company. That kind of corporate culture was far removed from the risk-taking style of companies like Qualcomm. "Some made the cut and some didn't," Ms. Dennis said.
Despite its proximity to Southern California's laid-back beach culture the new wireless communications industry has much more in common with the "90 hours a week and loving it" life style of Silicon Valley.
No company better exemplifies that spirit than Qualcomm, which is leading the battle for its particular cellular standard, called code division multiple access. If this standard can prevail, making competing standards like T.D.M.A., or time division multiple access standard, used in Japan and the United States, and the European favorite, G.S.M., or Global Special Mobile, into the industry's Betamaxes, Qualcomm stands to do extremely well.
Mr. Jacobs, who was traveling and unavailable for an interview last week, created Qualcomm as a company run largely by engineers. He had gained a reputation as an independent thinker while a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, long before digital communications systems were thought feasible.
Mr. Jacobs's company has demonstrated its ability to quickly seize business opportunities in new technology areas. For example, early in its rush to commercialize the Internet, Qualcomm licensed Eudora, an electronic mail software package. The program is now the Internet's most popular E-mail software.
If Qualcomm is Wireless Valley's leading enterprise, the University of California at San Diego's School of Engineering's Center for Wireless Communications is the area's intellectual engine. Founded two years ago with backing from Qualcomm, Sprint, Hewlett-Packard, and other companies, the center has begun work on a radically new communications network.
Led by an engineering professor, Anthony Acampora, a small team of faculty and students is exploring the possibility of leaping across the technology divide that until now has frustrated communications companies in their desire to reach America's homes with multimedia interactive data services.
It is called the "last mile" problem: copper wires will not carry high-speed transmissions, but neither telephone nor cable companies have been willing to invest in connecting homes to fiber optic cables.
But Mr. Acampora, who is a veteran wireless researcher with a 20-year career at AT&T's Bell Laboratories, said he was daydreaming during a long technical conference when he hit on another idea. Instead of using radio signals like today's cellular networks, he envisioned an optical-radio network.
Low-power high-frequency radios that would deliver tens of megabits of video, data and voice information would gradually be installed in homes and businesses. These local transmitters, called picocells, would in turn be connected to laser-based optical transceivers, installed on the rooftops of many structures, to carry digital information for the whole city at even higher data rates.
"Each house would have a transceiver that would have four beams," Mr. Acampora said. "It would create a dense web that could carry more information as more customers were added."
As with the Internet itself, each new participant would add value to the system as a whole. And the network would essentially be self-assembling, avoiding the billions of dollars in infrastructure investment that now stymies telephone and cable companies. Consumers would build the network themselves by buying transceivers at local stores, then installing them on their roofs.
Mr. Acampora acknowledges that his hybrid network is a totally unproven idea. Lasers are now the best solution for sending high-speed data over fiber optic cables, but sending laser beams through the air raises both safety and reliability issues.
"The idea of putting a laser cyclops on top of your house for fast data is really an interesting and novel idea," said James F. Moore, a telecommunications and computer industry consultant at Geopartners Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "Everyone else has been concerned with sending laser beams long distances through glass. These guys are thinking about short distances through the air."
The vision has captured the imagination of the center's small team of engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists, like Lawrence Larson, a professor of electrical engineering.
"I was frustrated that many things that I had worked on had never taken off in a commercial sense," Mr. Larson said. "I wanted to see something I had done in every home in the country."
If Wireless Valley continues to grow at its current remarkable pace, his chances are good.

A chart in Business Day on Monday about the concentration of wireless telecommunications companies around San Diego referred incorrectly to the 1996 financial results of one of the companies, Hughes Network Systems. It had revenue, not net sales, of $1 billion. The company does not report net sales, a figure that omits some sources of income included in revenue.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Higher On Expectation of Rate Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar recovered from early weakness against the yen to end mostly higher yesterday, strengthening on expectations that interest rates would be raised in the United States and on reports suggesting that Japan might impose more domestic sales taxes.
In New York, the dollar settled at 122.91 yen, up from 122.85 yen Friday. The dollar cost 1.6881 German marks, up from 1.6861. 
 Many currency traders were betting that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee would nudge up short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent, at its regularly scheduled meeting today. Higher interest rates tend to lift the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets worth more.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has been hinting that pre-emptive steps are needed to thwart inflation, suggesting that the central bank is about to move rates higher for the first time in more than two years.
"Everybody's waiting for the Fed meeting, and a 25-basis-point increase has already been factored in," said Hans Boman, vice president for foreign-exchange sales at Swedbank in New York. "The underlying trend for the dollar is still up."
The dollar also got a lift after Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, suggested that the country's tax on consumption, scheduled to rise to 5 percent from 3 percent on April 1, might be raised even further. Mr. Mitsuzuka told Parliament he could not rule out another increase.
His remarks helped incite a selloff in Japan's stock market and dropped the yen on investor fears that an expanding tax burden could derail the slow Japanese recovery from a prolonged recession by discouraging consumers from spending.
Though the dollar rose against the yen, it fell against the British pound, which strengthened to $1.6186, from $1.6033 on Friday and the highest level since Feb. 28. Much of the increase reflected heightened expectations that interest rates would be raised in Britain, regardless of whatpolitical party wins the May 1 general election.
The pound was also helped by a British Government report saying Britain's broadest measure of trade showed a deficit in 1996 that was far smaller than expected.

HEADLINE: Albert Key, 71, Broker, Dies; Led Historical Society in 80's

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Albert Lenoir Key, a stockbroker and former investment banker who, as a trustee, president and chairman, helped steer the New-York Historical Society through its heaviest turbulence in the 1980's, died on Friday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 71 and lived in Locust Valley, L.I.
The cause was postoperative complications related to lung cancer, his family said. 
 At his death, Mr. Key remained a society trustee. He joined the board in 1984 and was its president and chairman from 1986 to 1989 as the society painfully pulled itself out of a crisis, with bankruptcy and the forced dispersal of its treasures looming all too real.
At 196 years old, the New-York Historical Society, on Central Park West and 77th Street, is the oldest of its kind in New York State and the state's oldest museum. Its collections have ranged from works of the Old Masters to old American manuscripts to Americana to Hudson River paintings, not to mention its stately landmark home.
At the root of the problem was the depletion of its endowment in an ambitious quest for growth. As its difficulties mounted, state and city support for a rescue effort was in serious doubt.
Under the guidance of Mr. Key and his fellow trustees, the society underwent a drastic regimen of cutbacks in staff, visiting hours, shuttered exhibits and assorted other economies. To clinch the survival with state help, it had to sell off some of its possessions in 1995 in an auction that brought in $17.6 million.
"He was the leader during a very, very troubled time," the current chairman, Miner H. Warner, said of Mr. Key yesterday.
Mr. Warner said he now liked to refer to it as the "formerly troubled New-York Historical Society," having seen "troubled" as the accustomed precede to its name for so long. He said it was now "doing extremely well, endowment way up and the plant completely refurbished."
Mr. Key was born in Washington and graduated from Harvard College. He was in the diplomatic service in the early 1950's, when he was posted to Israel to smooth the way for Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
Returning to the United States in 1955, he became a member of the New York Stock Exchange and a 20-year partner in the investment banking firm of Harris Upham & Company. Most recently, he was associated with H. G. Wellington & Company, an old-line stock brokerage firm.
He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Julia Bowdoin Key; their three sons, David M. and Albert L. Jr., both of Manhattan, and Robert L., of Denver; a brother, David M., of Vero Beach, Fla; a sister, Majorie K. Andrews of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Last Pulp Mill in Alaska Closes, And Ketchikan Braces for Impact

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: KETCHIKAN, Alaska, March 24

 BODY:
After 40 years, Ketchikan breathed the last pungence of damp wood pulp today as the last pulp mill in the state shut down, partly because it needed up to $200 million in environmental renovations. The closing leaves 500 workers without jobs at the Ketchikan Pulp Company in a town that has depended on the mills for more than 40 years.
"A lot of people maybe will have to go work for McDonald's to make a living, and that isn't right," said Rob Izatt, a worker who will lose his job. 
 A money-losing operation, the mill was closed by its corporate parent, the Louisiana Pacific Corporation. Severance pay amounts to a year's wages or more for some employees, many of whom said they planned to fish, hunt and think about new careers in the summer.
For just about everyone else in this island town of 15,000 in the southeastern corner of the Alaska Panhandle, the effects are already apparent. Car and boat sales have plummeted. The housing market has been flooded, and other businesses have cut staffs and working hours. A shipping company is hauling 20 percent less freight and shipping out household belongings.
The mill has run around the clock almost every day since 1954, except for maintenance shutdowns and labor disputes.
Two pulp companies are near the end of 50-year contracts with the Forest Service to cut timber in the Tongass National Forest, deals that the Federal Government struck in the 1950's to spur job development.
Managers at the mill faulted lawsuits that hampered logging and a change in policies that increased the costs for lumber from the Tongass forest.
The company did win a concession that let it continue logging for two years after closing the mill, when Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, put a special provision in a bill on parks and public lands last October.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Gain Ahead of Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday as investors prepared for a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers today.
Many market participants were expecting the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. "For the most part everyone is content with their positions heading into the meeting," said David Shabelman, a market analyst with MMS International. 
 And there was talk yesterday that if the Fed did indeed raise rates, short-term maturities could be hurt but that there was a potential for a rally in the long bond. Still, Mr. Shabelman said that any such gains would be limited by sellers waiting for upticks in prices.
The price of the 30-year bond ended up 19/32 yesterday, to 96 11/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.92 percent, from 6.96 percent on Friday.
Yesterday's gains, said Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management of Hartford, were "a reflection of the fact that everyone knows the Fed will tighten."
"When it's anticipated as much as that, then rates will not change very much," he said.
Many in the market were expecting the Fed policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, to raise its target on the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent. Those expectations were bolstered on Thursday when Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted again at a pre-emptive move to keep inflation low.
But not everyone is expecting an increase. Lou Brien, an analyst with Finacor Vendome Inc., a Chicago brokerage firm, said that if the Federal funds rate "is at a level that may help to accomplish the Fed's basic goal, then the Fed chairman may consider it appropriate to leave it alone."
"One rate hike will bring the anticipation that more will follow and among the costs of higher rates would be increasing the burden of debt-strapped families, sending the dollar even higher and exports even lower, swiftly ending the exuberance of the stock market and severely testing the resiliency of an expansion that has entered its seventh year," Mr. Brien said.
"On the other hand," he continued, "the cost of no action is the risk of inflation. But with inflation at 30-year lows and the real funds rate a half-point above its historical average, the Fed will take that risk and leave rates unchanged Tuesday."
Mr. Whelan of Aeltus Investment Management said there were several signs that the Fed would make only one move on rates. "The Fed generally doesn't tighten much when the dollar is appreciating, and when the gap between the Federal funds rate and inflation approaches 3 percent, which is usually sufficient to slow the economy," he said. "They are starting this tightening cycle with that gap already 2.25 percent, which suggests that the central bank does not have all that much to do."
Interest rates were up modestly at yesterday's Treasury bill auction, with the results about as expected on the eve of a Fed policy meeting. The average rate for a three-month bill rose to 5.26 percent, up 13 basis points from last week's auction, while the six-month bill hit 5.33 percent, up 7 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Today, the Treasury will be selling $17.2 billion of two-year notes, as the Fed is deciding monetary policy for months ahead. And the Government is selling $12.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year notes were yielding 6.26 percent, down four basis points from Friday, and 6.56 percent for the five-year note, down six basis points.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	 	Average Price	98.670	97.305	Discounted Rate	5.26%	5.33%	Coupon Yield	5.41%	5.55%	High Price	98.670	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.26%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.41%	5.54%	Low Price	98.668	97.305	Discounted Rate	5.27%	5.33%	Coupon Yield	5.41%	5.55%	Accepted at low price	18%	33%	Total applied for	$53,556,124	$44,746,244	Accepted	$11,648,073	$11,528,982	Noncompetitive	$1,280,533	$1,174,954

HEADLINE: Dow Up 100, But Late Rally Skips Nasdaq

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A rally late yesterday lifted blue-chip stocks out of their worst downturn of the year. But it was not enough to salvage technology stocks, which extended their slump.
While the Dow Jones industrial average surged 100.46 points, or 1.5 percent, to 6,905.25, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell for the ninth time in 10 sessions, closing down 11.43 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 1,242.64. 
 The rally came on the eve of today's Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy. Investors are typically reluctant to buy stocks before a possible move by the Fed, and indeed trading was light yesterday, as 452 million shares changed hands, down from 544.8 million on Friday.
Yesterday's rally was also unusual because many in the market expect the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, and such expectations have caused a slump in stocks in recent weeks.
"What happened today should have happened tomorrow because the rate increase was already factored into the markets," Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said yesterday. "Everyone expected it, and when that happens you get the opposite response."
The 100-point gain in the Dow, however, was not indicative of yesterday's market performance. A large part of the gain was driven by program trading. According to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn., two programs begun after 2:30 P.M. accounted for most of the Dow's gains.
Yesterday was the third time this year that the Dow has had a gain of more than 100 points. Analysts said that the Dow's gains continued to demonstrate how lopsided the market had become.
"It continues to be a professional traders' market, an index fund market," Mr. Rice said. "But if you take away the blue chips, we've been in a secular bear market. We saw program trading today. The rest of the market was pretty dormant."
Despite the rally in the Dow, more stocks lost ground than gained on the New York Stock Exchange. And along with the Nasdaq, the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks also fell yesterday, down 2.25 points, to 349.48. For the year, the Russell 2000 is down 3.6 percent.
For much of the day, though, investors were focused on technology stocks, which continued to get hammered. At one point, the Nasdaq 100 index had lost more than 3 percent, pulled down by declines in its five largest technology stocks.
Shares of Microsoft fell as many as 6 points yesterday after the company indicated that the next version of its Windows 95 software would not be out this year. Microsoft pared its losses late, closing down 3 7/8, to 90 1/8. And Intel, off early, also recovered, to close up 1/8 at 130 5/8.
The Nasdaq has lost about 6 percent in the last two weeks, and for the year it is woefully underperforming, down about 3.8 percent at a time when the Dow is up 7 percent.
"I'm betting it will accelerate on the downside," said Richard Eakle, president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. "Valuations are high and many companies are reporting disappointing earnings. And this market is showing no tolerance for earnings disappointments. They're taking them out and crucifying them."
One of the companies punished yesterday was Idexx Labs Inc., a maker of animal health diagnostic kits, based in Westbrook, Me. The company said yesterday that it expected its first-quarter earnings to plunge. The stock then plunged.
Shares of Idexx fell 63 percent, losing 20 points each, to close at 12. It was the third most actively traded stock yesterday, with volume of more than 22 million shares.
But among the blue chips, more than half of the Dow's 30 component stocks showed gains of better than one point, led by I.B.M., up 4 1/4, to 136 3/4; Philip Morris, up 4 1/4, to 115 3/4; Du Pont, up 3 1/2, to 114 1/4, and General Electric, up 3 1/8, to 105 7/8.
The rally in the Dow, however, came after four consecutive sessions of losses. At Friday's close, the Dow was 280 points, or 4 percent, below the peak of 7,085.16 it had reached on March 11.
Still, even with all the volatility -- and the severe downturn in the technology stocks -- the Dow has not fallen very far from the 7,000-point level.
And the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks -- up about 6.8 percent this year -- has fared almost as well. Yesterday, the S.& P. 500 gained 6.79 points, or 0.87 percent, to close at 790.89.
The late-breaking rally yesterday may again raise the question of whether blue chips have become too expensive, some analysts said, a question that the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has raised more than once.
Rao Chalasani, chief investment officer at Everen Securities in Chicago, even says yesterday's Dow surge might give Fed policy makers that much more conviction about raising short-term interest rates.
"The market's up 100 points the day before they decide to raise rates," Mr. Chalasani said. "They may think that if they don't raise rates the market will take off even more. The Fed may feel it has to raise rates just from a credibility point of view."

HEADLINE: Workers Deserve a Choice

 BODY:
The "comp-time" bill passed by the House gives workers the attractive option, impossible under current law, to take their compensation for overtime work in time off rather than extra pay. It might seem odd that Democrats would oppose a sensible idea that most workers say they want. But sensible or not, comp time is opposed by labor unions, which paid over $30 million during the fall campaign to guarantee that Capitol Hill Democrats would do their bidding. President Clinton also opposes the House bill, but at least in his case he has proposed a reasonable, if overly restrictive, alternative.
Under current law, workers must be paid one and a half times their hourly wage for every hour they work over 40 in a week. The Republicans would allow workers, at their discretion, to forgo higher wages and take their compensation in the form of one and a half hours of time off. The existing requirement for paid compensation might have made sense when it was passed in 1938 -- a time of widespread unemployment that put a mostly male work force at the mercy of employers. Sixty years later, competition largely dictates how employers treat workers, and according to polls, female workers yearn for the opportunity to cash in their overtime for time at home. Comp-time options work well in the one place they are currently legal -- for Federal, state and local government workers. 
 Critics point to employers that violate existing overtime pay rules and say they will surely violate the comp bill's prohibition on coercion and force workers to accept time off rather than extra pay. But the House bill would do nothing to make the lives of these victimized workers any worse. Under the new law, a few more companies might also be tempted to violate comp-time rules by pressuring workers to take overtime compensation in the form of time off rather than cash. But if the House bill lacks adequate sanctions, the answer, as the President proposes, is to add more. Besides, the House bill would terminate after five years. If Congress finds abuse, all it need do is refuse to renew the legislation.
The President's comp-time bill includes protections for vulnerable workers. It would provide better judicial protection against misbehaving employers and more control over when workers could use the comp time they accumulate. Unfortunately, the President adds other restrictions that look needlessly costly and complex. But the distance between the House bill and his is not large. There is room for a compromise measure.
The bigger threat lies in the Senate, where Democratic opposition could kill the bill. Voters will be treated to the spectacle of key senators voting for organized labor's support and against ordinary workers, who want nothing more than a choice of compensation that everyone working in Congress already enjoys.

HEADLINE: ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FINAL FOUR;
Changing Landscape Leaves Familiar Faces

BYLINE: By Malcolm Moran 

 BODY:
It's still a coach's game.
That is the unexpected result of the economic freedom that underclassmen have gained. The mass defections of young players to professional basketball have not created any shift in power during tournament time. This Final Four lacks star quality, and the rich subplot of a highly anticipated rematch may be gone forever. But those are marketing issues. The competitive reality is that the parity of the 1980's has been pushed deeper into the past and the influence of the coach has never been greater. 
 Unless Arizona completes an unprecedented achievement of back-to-back victories over No. 1-seeded teams in Indianapolis, a No. 1 will win the national title for the seventh time in the eight tournaments of the 1990's. In the 1980's, only three No. 1's became champions, and two of them -- North Carolina in 1982 and Indiana in 1987 -- had to come from behind in the final seconds to win by 1 point. The industry is a long way from the time when North Carolina State and Kansas won from No. 6 and Villanova from No. 8, when as many as 50 teams had a realistic hope of winning a championship.
That number had shrunk to 15, maybe 10, by the time this March arrived. As the trickle-down economics of the National Basketball Association and tightened academic standards complicate roster moves, the coach has remained the constant. The coach as personnel director, adapter, choreographer and propagandist. And maybe most important in this era of free agency at the college level, the coach as holder of the keys to the showcase.
Rick Pitino trumpeted Ron Mercer's decision to leave Kentucky after this sophomore season, and a potentially distracting issue vanished. The coach portrayed the Wildcats as an overachieving, injured group, and successfully camouflaged Kentucky's depth of talent.
Dean Smith criticized his poor preparation for a regional semifinal victory over California, and told his players to treat the game as a loss, and no one was asking about North Carolina's longest winning streak in 10 years.
Arizona's Lute Olson confronted the early-season loss of Miles Simon, his most experienced player, because of academic problems. With Mike Bibby establishing himself at point guard as a freshman and Simon unavailable until January, Olson could not begin developing a starting unit until after the Pacific 10 schedule had begun.
Clem Haskins created Minnesota's Midwest championship the old-fashioned way, by merging experienced leadership with younger talent.
If a coach of a high-powered program can assemble enough elite-level talent, a lack of depth does not have to become an issue. Three years ago, coaches bitterly protested a vote at the N.C.A.A. convention against restoring one scholarship per team. The scholarship was finally approved this January, but this Final Four, with most of the survivors going seven or eight deep, demonstrates that the additional player is an afterthought.
Kentucky could afford the luxury of redshirting Jeff Sheppard, a senior guard who played an important role in the national semifinals last year. North Carolina's Vasco Evtimov, a highly recruited freshman from Brookville, L.I., sits and watches until it is time to clear the bench. A lack of depth is not a problem now, when the stop-and-start pace divides games into segments and creates frequent breaks. "With those N.C.A.A. TV timeouts, you could almost take a nap," Smith said.
Smith once spoke of freshmen as if they triggered an allergic reaction, but now Ed Cota of Brooklyn comes off the bench to run his team. Smith decided early in the season that he had made a mistake in judgment, that this team was not capable of the pressure defense he had envisioned, and revised his approach.
There is one other area in which Smith dominates the rest of the Final Four field. North Carolina, with its 85 percent graduation rate according to the most recent N.C.A.A. survey, is the only remaining school with a rate above 33 percent.
The survey covers scholarship athletes that enrolled from 1986 through 1989. Pitino, who is in his eighth year at Kentucky, was in place for the last of the four classes in the survey, so he is not responsible for the program's 33 percent rate. But Minnesota's 24 percent rate has taken place with Haskins as coach, and Olson has been in charge of the Arizona program throughout a period that has produced a 23 percent rate, including just 14 percent among black players.
Smith will lead his fourth Final Four team of this decade, with his fourth group of starters. His place in the game and his team's level of play have not been altered by the new economics. Once upon a time, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse would have been seniors this year.

HEADLINE: GORE WITNESSES BOEING-CHINA DEAL

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Tuesday, March 25

 BODY:
In a move to underscore Washington's enthusiasm for expanding trade with China, Vice President Al Gore appeared today at the signing of two business deals worth almost $2 billion, including a purchase by the Chinese of five Boeing 777 jetliners for $685 million.
The Boeing agreement seemed jeopardized last week by the charges of illegal campaign finances now dominating Washington, as Mr. Gore's aides worried about associating the Vice President with anything that smacked of deal-making with the Chinese during his four-day visit here. 
 The agreements were signed at a long table in the Great Hall of the People at about 11:30 A.M. in Beijing. Mr. Gore stood shoulder to shoulder with Prime Minister Li Peng behind the signatories, turning to the Mr. Li and saying "very good," as the two men smiled and shook hands.
In the larger of the agreements, the General Motors Corporation and a state-owned Chinese enterprise will split the investment in a $1.3 billion joint venture to make 100,000 Buick Century and Regal sedans a year in Shanghai. In the second, Boeing will sell five 777-200 airplanes to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, a state-owned enterprise, for use by China Air.
Mr. Gore's decision to attend the signings doubtless will be welcomed by American businessmen in China as well as the Chinese leadership, which is anxious to consolidate its position after the death of Deng Xiaoping, by demonstrating that it can manage Beijing's all-important relationship with the United States.
The agreements could also give the Clinton Administration new evidence of the economic benefits of its China policy. Ginny Terzano, Mr. Gore's press secretary, hailed the deals as "proof positive that there is greater economic cooperation between China and the United States."
Administration officials who described the deals here said that their effects would ripple through the United States economy, creating and protecting jobs at the aircraft company, the auto maker and their suppliers. More than 4,500 companies provide parts for the Boeing airplanes, and General Motors estimates that its joint venture will require $1.5 billion in American exports over five years. However, after five years these exports will tail off because the plant in Shanghai will by then be producing nearly all of its parts.
But the business deals are unlikely to stem rising criticism in Congress that the Clinton Administration's policy is failing to expand human rights in China.
Representative Richard Gephardt, a likely rival of Mr. Gore for the next Democratic Presidential nomination, has already said he will oppose extending most favored nation trading status to China this year, partly because of human rights issues. He is also seeking a greater role for Congress in approving the possible admission of China to the World Trade Organization. On Sunday, Mr. Gore tersely declined to comment when asked about Mr. Gephardt's efforts on the trading organization.
But in a third agreement today, China will permit the United States to retain its consulate in Hong Kong after the colony reverts to Chinese control in June. Ambassador James Sasser signed that agreement, long sought by the United States, with China's Vice Foreign Minister, Li Xhaoxing.
Ms. Terzano denied that Mr. Gore and his aides ever wavered about attending the signing of the Boeing deal. "There was not a reluctance," she said.
But Boeing officials worried publicly last week about whether the Vice President would show up.
"If the Chinese Government thinks they are doing a favor to Al Gore by giving us this order," said Boeing's spokesman in Beijing, Chen Linde, "then they may take it back if he does not participate." Mr. Chen said that Chinese officials probed the company about arranging a ceremony that would include the Vice President.
Other businessmen expressed alarm last week. "I'm flabbergasted," said Eden Y. Woon, the director of a Seattle-based business council whose members do business in China. "People who are unhappy with this Administration's engagement of China policy are using this political tempest to handcuff the Administration -- and it's working."
Under the deal to be signed today, the first three planes are to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 1998, and the last two the following year. The president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, Ronald Woodard, is here in Beijing to sign the deal.
The United States airline industry and the Administration were bitterly disappointed less than a year ago when Mr. Li kicked off a visit to France by placing a $1.5 billion order for European planes. At the time, Mr. Li made clear that the Chinese would not give in to United States pressure on trade or any other issue.
Mr. Li presided over the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square, and during a meeting in Copenhagen two yeas ago he upbraided Mr. Gore for what he characterized as Administration efforts to meddle in China's affairs. But Mr. Gore and he have since corresponded, and their contacts led to this week's visit.
It is not clear what the long-term economic effects of these deals will be. Once the auto complex is up and running, the cars' high-value components will all be produced here. In addition to an assembly plant, the joint venture, to be called Shanghai General Motors, will include stamping, engine, and transmission plants. After the first five years of the venture, G.M. estimates that it will require only $100 million in parts from the United States.
But G.M., the world's largest auto maker, also argues that the joint venture will increase the chances for future imports of entire cars and trucks to China by creating a market-based distribution network here. It was not immediately clear how that network would function, since most of the cars are likely to be bought by the Chinese Government.
General Motors has long struggled to make pick-up trucks in a joint venture in northeastern China. Still, G.M., like the other American auto makers, is anxious to establish a firm foothold in China's dramatically expanding economy. The Chrysler Corporation also take part in a joint venture to produce vehicles in China.
As recently as January, Jack Smith, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, expressed impatience about the pending joint venture.
"We need to get going," he said in an interview at that time. "This is going to get stale." He was referring to Buick models, whose styling and technology is becoming dated. Today, Mr. Smith was here to sign the deal.
 
One of the articles also misstated Mr. Gore's role at the signing ceremony for the deal in some copies. He was a witness but not a signer.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 1997, WednesdayApril 19, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Articles yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's visit to China misstated the day of his arrival and the day of the signing of a major Chinese-American trade deal in some copies. The Vice President arrived in Beijing on Monday, not yesterday, and the trade deal was signed yesterday, not on Monday.
An article on March 25 about Vice President Al Gore's appearance in Beijing at the signing of two business deals with China, including the sale of five Boeing 777-200 jetliners, misidentified the airline that would use them. It is Air China, the national airline, not China Air.

HEADLINE: A TASTE OF: Los Angeles;
And for Dinner? How About Fun?

BYLINE: By RUTH REICHL 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN the early 1980's, Los Angeles was the most exciting place to eat in America. Jonathan Waxman, who was the chef at Michael's in Santa Monica, Calif., told me at the time: "My customers will eat anything, as long as it is different from what I fed them the night before. They think of eating as entertainment."
In those days, the city was confident and prosperous and happily discovering the fun of food. Starchy old establishments like Perino's, where everyone had to dress up and mind his or her manners, were being replaced by exuberant young ones like Trumps, where the menu was wild (bananas with caviar) and anything went. 
 The East Coast was still wedded to European food, but in Los Angeles you could eat everything: California cuisine, upscale pizza, Southwestern cooking, Franco-Chinese, not to mention the most exciting ethnic food in America.
Then the recession came along, followed by riots and earthquakes. Together they put a damper on the city's spirit. Restaurants closed in droves. New ones opened, but they tended to play it safe; many were inexpensive clones of existing places. It was not a happy time.
Now, the city's restaurants are emerging from the doldrums. While Los Angeles has not totally regained its manic spirit, the signs are optimistic.
It is still, I think, the best place in America to eat ethnic food. This is mostly a function of demographics and geography. Whole sections of the city are Korean, Chinese or Salvadoran, which means that restaurants can cater to the neighborhood, serving authentic food without regard for American tastes.
Wine lists are reasonable enough to make those in New York seem overpriced. You can eat outdoors in the dead of winter. And there is a continuing sense of fun.
During five days of munching around town, I sampled a dozen restaurants. The best meal I had, unfortunately, cannot be replicated: it was a country French dinner cooked by Wolfgang Puck at Spago as a favor to an ailing friend of his. None of the dishes were on the menu.
The meal began with charcuterie produced on the premises: homemade salami and liverwurst, an oxtail terrine and fabulous rillettes. It went on to an extraordinarily intense fish soup. Then there was duck in an olive and red wine sauce, followed by leg of lamb with aligot -- potatoes pureed with garlic and fresh cheese. It ended with a classic mille-feuille filled with whipped cream and jam.
It was a spectacular dinner, and also a perfect metaphor for Los Angeles restaurants. When it opened in 1981, Spago was revolutionary, a new kind of celebrity restaurant serving light California cuisine in a casual atmosphere. The most imitated restaurant in the country, it will close on April 12 and reopen a day or two later in Beverly Hills on the site of the former Bistro Garden. After all this time, it is still vibrant, still reinventing itself.
So is the city. Here are a few of the places I found most interesting.

Fenix at the Argyle
It is a balmy night, and we are seated outdoors: plastic palm trees sway above us, a luminous swimming pool gives off a turquoise glow and below us the lights of the city sparkle like a twinkling carpet. The effect is slightly unreal, as if a curtain could drop at any moment and make the whole thing disappear.
The scene behind us is equally unreal. A woman with a bare midriff and eyes highlighted by a thousand colors of shadow snuggles up to her date. Then she excuses herself to go to the restroom and he turns to watch her. The moment she is out of sight, he picks up his cellular phone. "Sherry?" he says. "Hi, babe. Just wanted to see how you're doing. I'm sitting here thinking about you."
Fenix is the perfect Los Angeles restaurant, not least because the chef, Ken Frank, is the quintessential Los Angeles chef. Famous at 21, he was the original chef at Michael's in Santa Monica. He had his own restaurant, La Toque, by the time he was 23.
Now, at the ripe old age of 41, Mr. Frank has opened this glitzy new place. Like Andre Soltner of Lutece, he is known as a chef who never leaves his kitchen. This makes his restaurant consistent, which is a good thing, but it also makes his food self-referential, because he has had very little exposure to the work of other chefs. As a result, Mr. Frank's best dishes are ones he has been doing for years, like lightly scrambled eggs served in the shell with black truffles. Or foie gras, cooked so it has the delicacy of custard. Or a fine oxtail salad served with the tiniest haricots verts and a sprinkling of truffles.
My favorite main course is the chicken in "half mourning," stuffed under the skin with black truffles and served in a fine sauce. I liked Grand Central monkfish pan roast, too, with the fish in a rich, creamy and delicious sauce larded with clams and tasting like the famous New York pan roast.
The best dessert is the truffle ice cream, another dish Mr. Frank has been making for years. It has never tasted better.
Fenix at the Argyle, 8358 Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood, Calif.; (213) 848-6677. Dinner entrees, $22 to $34.

Campanile
Food people don't go to Campanile just to eat the amazing doughnuts, pastries and fruit pies that the restaurant somehow manages to pass off as breakfast instead of dessert. They don't go to drink cappuccino and juice, either. They go because the casual self-service breakfast has become such an institution that if you're trying to find someone who cares about food early in the day, he or she is very likely to be there.
The building was originally constructed as a studio for Charlie Chaplin; the courtyard, fountain and pointed arches give it a slightly Moorish air. It's a wonderfully quirky space, and it never looks better than in the morning, when it is filled with casually dressed people on their way to or from their trainers, looking very guilty as they eat the world's most satisfying sticky buns.
Campanile, 624 South La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles; (213) 938-1447.

Obachine
Everyone agreed that I simply had to see Obachine, the latest outpost in the ever-expanding Wolfgang Puck empire. Like most of Mr. Puck's recent restaurants, this one was born to be cloned.
Contrary to my expectations, Obachine is not a low-rent version of his wildly inventive, French-inflected Chinois on Main. It is a pan-Asian restaurant serving creative versions of classic dishes from Thailand, Cambodia, China, India, Vietnam and Japan. This cuisine is rapidly capturing America, and Mr. Puck's spin on it is good but this is the least innovative of his restaurants.
What would I have if I went back? The crisp lamb samosas, which were filled with a thin but extremely spicy filling. The crab shumai. Smoked Peking duck not only was delicious, but also was served with a date-plum sauce that is a big improvement over the traditional hoisin. Seared scallops, in the shell, were served on a yam puree: who would have thought scallops and sweet potatoes would be a happy combination?
Grilled lemon and ginger chicken was a surprise, too. Steamed baby bok choy and duck fried rice were both delicious. The one dish I would definitely avoid is pad Thai, a terrible rendition of the dish.
Obachine, 242 North Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif.; (310) 274-4440. Dinner entrees, $7.95 to $17.95.

Jozu
Obachine is not the only new pan-Asian restaurant in Los Angeles. Andy Nakano, whose parents owned Imperial Gardens, a Japanese restaurant in Hollywood popular with screenwriters in the 70's, has just opened his interpretation of Los Angeles Asian cuisine.
I remember the space in a previous incarnation as clamorous and uncomfortable, but Jozu has been completely redone. Now, you sink into big cozy booths surrounded by neutral colors. The sound and light levels are serene enough to give you the relaxed sense of being in some underwater atmosphere. It is very pleasant. So is the food, cooked by Suzanne Tracht, who worked at Campanile.
The appetizers are so good it is tempting to order them all, washing them down with sake, which is served in delicate glass pitchers cunningly contrived so that the liquor can be iced without being diluted. The fried Ipswich clams are delicious, as are the oysters with lemon grass, garlic and chilies. Crisp marinated quail is brushed with tangerine and served with a shockingly spicy cucumber salad. Plump little crab-and-shrimp cakes the size of quarters are served with a fine green papaya salad.
The crisp sweetbreads taste of tamarind, and Chilean sea bass is simply roasted, drizzled with ponzu and served with a cabbage salad so that each flavor stands apart. Scallops are sauteed and served with green curry and noodles.
Should you feel like eating good old American food, you can have the fine grilled rib eye without the sichuan peppercorn teriyaki sauce, although it would be a shame to miss the horseradish potatoes.
Jozu, 8360 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood; (213) 655-5600. Dinner entrees, $13 to $24.

Yuca's
The upscale stuff served in New York's Mexican restaurants just doesn't satisfy me the way any Los Angeles taco truck can. When I am in Los Angeles I stop in at every taco stand I pass.
That is not hard; there are hundreds of good places to eat Mexican street food. I spent one day just driving around East Los Angeles sampling antojitos. (The word, loosely translated, means "little things you crave," and the snacks are always cornmeal based.) But I would never leave town without at least one visit to Yuca's.
The family-run stand has been in a parking lot in the neighborhood of Los Feliz for years, right next to a liquor store. Everything on the small menu is good. My favorites are the small soft tacos filled with carnitas (shredded pork) and cochinita pibil (pork cooked in the style of the Yucatan). I like carne asada with green chili, too. But what I dream about when I am in New York are the burritos filled with slightly chewy and extremely delicious beans. "Not vegetarian," the sign points out. Well, of course not; it's the lard that makes them so good.
Yuca's, 2056 North Hillhurst Avenue, Los Angeles; (213) 662-1214.
 
Oye! at Xiomara
Patrick Healy is another homegrown Los Angeles chef. French-trained, he had his own much-loved Champagne restaurant for many years before he joined forces with Xiomara Ardolina at her eponymous restaurant in Pasadena, Calif.
Now, Ms. Ardolina has persuaded him to turn his talents to the food of her native Cuba. They have opened a restaurant within a restaurant, the nuevo-latino Oye! just behind Xiomara (pronounced SEE-oh-mara).
I am not convinced that Mr. Healy's heart is totally in this new venture, but the menu is fascinating and much of what we ate was very good.
The ceviche, for instance, which is served in a martini glass, features scallops, clams, rock shrimp, squid, sea bass and pickled chayote, and is as good as any I have tasted. He makes an awesome Cuban black bean soup, flavored with ham hocks and topped with okra croutons. Crisp little cakes of bacalao (salt cod) are excellent, served with a rich saffron-yuca and garlic sauce. Shrimp tamales are also innovative, served with a chanterelle salsa and so rich they seem like new-wave quenelles.
Among the entrees, I recommend the Cuban cassoulet -- black beans stewed with chorizo, rabbit, smoked pork loin and plantains. There is also a fine, but rather dry, ropa vieja.
Desserts feature a fine tres leches cake and a lovely trio of tiny flans flavored with guava, soursop and guanabana. At $8 a serving, they are a good indication of what is going on in Los Angeles. Five or six years ago it would have been impossible to imagine the staid citizens of Pasadena spending big money on fancy flan.
Oye! at Xiomara, 69 North Raymond Avenue, Pasadena; (818) 796-2520. Dinner entrees, $16 to $19.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
After Profit Taking, the Dollar Climbs on the Fed's Rate Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose strongly yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in more than two years, a move seen by some currency traders as the first in a series of increases.
The prospect of rising rates in the United States, combined with the uncertain outlook for rates in economically weak Japan and Germany, emboldened traders to buy dollars. Higher rates in the United States tend to bolster the dollar by making assets denominated in dollars more attractive. 
 "There seems to be at least one other rate hike down the pike, and I think that's good for the dollar," said Bob Near, vice president of foreign-exchange trading at the Bank of New York. "It was very much a Fed story today. Everything else doesn't really matter."
In New York, the dollar settled at 123.75 Japanese yen, up from 122.91 on Monday. The dollar cost 1.6914 German marks, up from 1.6881. The British pound cost $1.6184, down from $1.6186.
The Fed's policy-making committee raised the target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight lending, by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.50 percent.
Currency traders had bid the dollar higher before the Fed announcement because they expected it. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had hinted recently that the central bank would take pre-emptive steps, like raising rates, to thwart inflation.
The dollar initially seesawed on the news yesterday, rising on an initial burst of buying, then falling as profit takers sold dollars.
"There was a pretty big exhale after we finally got a Fed move," said Robert Katz, a currency trader at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "There was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction to the topside, then we came off quite a bit."
But the dollar subsequently rallied as traders interpreted the Fed announcement as a signal that the rate increase was the first of several to be phased in over a prolonged period.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday, were: 1.4666 Swiss francs, up from 1.4586; 5.7045 French francs, up from 5.6900; 1,693.25 Italian lire, up from 1,688.80; 1.3779 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3795.

HEADLINE: Region's Economic Optimism Level Soars

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The level of economic optimism about jobs and business conditions in the Middle Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania soared over the last year, increasing at a faster pace than any other region of the country, a nonprofit business research group said yesterday.
The Conference Board, a group based in New York, said that in the first three months of this year, the region's consumer confidence index -- a combined measure of residents' current economic outlook and future expectations -- rose by nearly 62 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier. The report said that while the Middle Atlantic continues to have the bleakest perspective of any region -- a lingering hangover of the deep recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's -- many more people apparently now believe that better times lie ahead. The strongest component of the regional index for March, in particular, came from residents' thoughts about the future. 
 "Current conditions are still weak, but people are becoming more optimistic, and one fuels the other," said Lynn Franco, the associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
Separately, the New York State Department of Labor said that the unemployment rate, which has climbed sharply in the last few months, especially in New York City, as more residents have entered the job market searching for work, was little changed in February, at 9.8 percent. The statewide rate of 6.9 percent was also unchanged from the previous month.
Both the job report and the confidence index point to much the same conclusion, economists say: Brightened job prospects. Increased hiring on Wall Street, and the expansion of retailing, construction and film making -- along with other sectors of the economy -- have not only created new jobs, but also raised expectations for job seekers, and that, somewhat paradoxically, is what helps explain the higher unemployment numbers.
Economic growth, much of which has been concentrated in the city itself, rather than its suburbs, has apparently created a high level of optimism, with more new job seekers than there are new jobs. The confidence index underlines those heightened expectations.
But like the unemployment rate, which hints at the hidden frustrations that simmer within the economy, the consumer confidence number for the region also offers a very mixed message. The region's confidence levels are by far the lowest in the nation, followed by the New England region, which includes Connecticut, where the confidence levels are the second lowest.
In March, for example, the preliminary, not seasonal average of consumer confidence index for the Middle Atlantic region stood at 77.2, a level that Conference Board officials said is the rock bottom threshold for any growing economy. Anything below 70 is considered recessionary, while anything over 100 is an indicator of strong economic growth. One year ago, the confidence index for the region stood at 51.
By contrast, the confidence index for the nation as a whole now stands at 118.5, up from 98.4 one year ago. The index is based on written surveys sent to 5,000 households around the country, and has a response rate of about 70 percent, the Conference Board said. About 18 percent of the people in the sample -- reflecting the national population distribution -- live in the three Middle Atlantic states.
New Jersey reported last week that its economy added 8,300 jobs, statewide, in February, and that its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, from 5.9 percent in January. Connecticut's unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in January; it is to report its February numbers next week.

Bananagate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
I'm Chiquita Banana and I've come to say / Bananas have to ripen in a certain way . . .
"Soon we'll hear about Bananagate" was the prediction here two weeks ago, as a veteran right-wing tycoon and philanthropist -- Carl Lindner of Chiquita Brands -- was spotted giving $415,000 to the Democrats in hopes of getting the World Trade Organization to clear the way for Chiquita to make a bundle. 
 Time magazine's Michael Weisskopf and Viveca Novak advanced that story this week. Chiquita worked with the D.N.C. to steer another half-million dollars into the Democratic maw through two dozen state parties -- avoiding the scrutiny given Federal campaigns.
When donors go to great lengths to duck disclosure, they usually have something to hide. In this case, it was Chiquita's need to get President Clinton to bring American trade power to bear, even though few U.S. jobs were involved.
Lindner is a rock-ribbed Republican, a big giver to the G.O.P. for years; the very quiet largess to the other political side helped guarantee that Clinton would trounce the Europeans in trade.
When they are flecked with brown and have a golden hue / Bananas taste the best, and are the best for you.
The golden hue began on April 12, 1996, the day after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor asked the W.T.O. to take up Chiquita's grievance, on which the body ruled favorably this week. Within 24 hours, notes Time, Lindner and his men began shoveling heavy money into Democratic coffers in two dozen states.
Kantor, Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, insists to me from Bangkok it was a staff recommendation: "I had no earthly idea of his contributions. I was once asked by somebody in the White House -- no, I won't say who -- should he meet with Lindner, and I said, 'No, you should not.' "
Lindner not only met Clinton, but turned out to be one of the Lincoln Bedroom 900. And after its political investment of a measly million, Chiquita got U.S. sponsorship for a ruling that profits it a bunch.
Clinton has that Midas touch. Turn to his intimate, Webster Hubbell, who was able to multiply his earning power fivefold as the jailhouse loomed.
Just before entering the slammer on Aug. 7, 1995, the man who may hold the secrets that could bring Clinton down sent an intermediary (probably through a cutout unknown) to Michael Carlisle of the William Morris agency in New York. On Sept. 28, 1995, Hubbell signed a contract with Harper Collins for a $125,000 advance for a quickie book tentatively titled "Friends in High Places," interminably subtitled "an intimate look at the character of our President, his wife, his circle and perhaps his entire political generation."
The publisher (part of Rupert Murdoch's empire, but that mogul was unaware of a deal involving such small potatoes) paid the felon $41,667 on signing and $20,000 more in May 1996, which it is now trying to get back. Other providers of the more than $500,000 Hubbell received while he was deciding to clam up have been more understanding.
Hubbell did turn out a work product in jail, which is more than he did for some other "clients" -- thousands of pages of rambling ruminations on a yellow pad, plus answers to editors' queries and pleas for "more compelling" material.
Most of the manuscript was recently delivered under subpoena to the Independent Counsel, who is belatedly trying to establish a connection between Clinton and the college friend of Carlisle's who brought the agent the proposal.
What do the astounding financial successes of Chiquita Banana and Webster Hubbell have in common?
Only this: If you have a really nice bowl of golden-hued fruit to contribute to the flecked Clinton cause, you can expect your Government to make your case before the world.
Similarly, if you have information to withhold that could break the Whitewater case, you can expect to find Asian wheeler-dealers, financial cash cows and as-yet-unknown cutouts making deals for you that can bail the sleaziest fraud out of the most horrific hole.
So you should never put bananas/ In the refrigerator. No-no-no-no.
A 1 percent correction of the C.P.I. would save about $150 billion a year in 10 years, not in the first year, as misstated here Sunday.

Eye on the Bottom Line, Braves and Indians Trade

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., March 25

 BODY:
After "kicking the tires of this deal all spring long," the Atlanta Braves and the Cleveland Indians made a stunning trade today that was fueled by the economic concerns of both clubs. The Braves sent two-thirds of their outfield, David Justice and Marquis Grissom, to the Indians for Kenny Lofton, who is considered the best leadoff hitter in baseball, and relief pitcher Alan Embree.
"Quite candidly, I think we made a good baseball trade that was motivated by baseball economics on both sides," John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said. 
He said the two teams had been contemplating the deal throughout spring training. "We finally got to the point where we both felt comfortable with it," Schuerholz said. "We both approached this matter guardedly because we were talking about giving up significant talent from our clubs. But it suits our needs and theirs."
The trade between the two teams can be viewed in various ways:
*It is an exchange of Gold Glove center fielders, Grissom for Lofton.
*The Indians, by acquiring Justice, bolster an offense that has lost Albert Belle.
*The Indians get something for Lofton before losing him, like Belle, as a free agent. Lofton's contract expires after this season.
*The Braves open a spot for Jermaine Dye and Andruw Jones, two attractive outfielders, who contributed to the team's success last season.
*The Braves, who wanted to reduce their major league-high $63.8 million payroll, save $7.7 million in actual salary and luxury tax for this year. By shedding $26.9 million owed Justice (two years) and Grissom (three years) for the rest of their contracts, the Braves also create greater flexibility in their quest to keep Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who can be free agents next November.
By losing Justice's $6 million salary and Grissom's $4.8 million salary this season and taking on Lofton's $4.75 million and Embree's $206,000, the Braves emerge with a net saving of $5,844,000. They also save $1,870,400 in luxury tax. Combined, the reduction in actual salary and tax means a saving of $7,714,400.
The Braves will still enter the season with one of the five highest payrolls. The five clubs with the highest payrolls over $51 million will pay a 35 percent tax on payroll portions over that threshold.
The Yankees now have the highest payroll, $63.4 million. The trade sent the Indians, who had been seventh at $53.5 million, past the Braves, $58.8 million to $58.5 million. Payrolls for tax purposes will change with each player move during the season so the top five teams won't be known until the end of the season.
The Braves had made no secret of their desire to trade Justice, Grissom or Fred McGriff as a way of reducing their payroll and opening a spot for Dye and Jones. "If we can make a deal that allows our club to be championship caliber, as strong as it is now, and also diminish our payroll, we'll do that," Schuerholz had said early in spring training.
The only surprise was that Schuerholz was able to put Justice and Grissom in the same package. Lofton's status made that possible.
"We went through it last year with Albert Belle, and Albert left us," John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said at a news conference in nearby Winter Haven. "We are not prepared as an organization to let that happen again."
Lofton, who has usurped Rickey Henderson's status as the game's No. 1 leadoff hitter and the American League's perennial base-stealing leader, disputed Hart's view that Lofton "made it clear he wanted to exercise his right to go out on the market."
"I never planned on testing the market," Lofton said. "That didn't come out of Kenny Lofton's mouth. The Indians decided that." He alluded to the inability of the two sides to reach agreement on a contract extension.
Lofton, who batted .317, had 75 stolen bases and scored 132 runs in 1996, joins an Atlanta outfield that has Ryan Klesko as the incumbent left fielder and will now have Dye and Jones in right.
Dye, 23 years old, batted .281 in 92 games last season after Justice dislocated his right shoulder swinging at a pitch May 15. Jones, a native of Curacao who will turn 20 on April 23, became the youngest player to ever hit a post-season home run when he connected against St. Louis in the National League Championship Series, then surpassed that performance by hitting two home runs in his first two times up against the Yankees in the first game of the World Series.
Although it was initially assumed that the Braves would use Lofton only for this season, then let him go as a free agent so that Dye and Jones could play at the same time, Schuerholz disputed that conclusion.
"We're going to leave that agenda item wide open," he said by telephone from West Palm Beach. "We have demonstrated over the last six years our willingness to commit to whatever level is necessary financially to keep a championship-caliber team."
The Indians, anticipating Belle's departure, acquired third baseman Matt Williams from the San Francisco Giants last Nov. 13. They also signed Kevin Mitchell as a free agent, but they were evidently not satisfied with him or Brian Giles in their lineup as the left fielder.
Justice has never been the home run hitter Belle is, but he hit a career-high 40 in 1993, the last full season he played. He drove in 120 runs that season. Hart said the Indians were satisfied that Justice was healthy 10 months after he had shoulder surgery.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Reboulet to Play for Alomar
 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 25 (AP) -- Jeff Reboulet will start at second base for the Baltimore Orioles on opening day in place of the suspended Roberto Alomar, Manager Davey Johnson said today.
Reboulet, signed as a free agent during the off season, came to the Orioles after spending the past four seasons with the Minnesota Twins.

Harlem U.S.A. Project Is Progressing, but Tempo Lags

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Harlem U.S.A., the long-delayed entertainment-retail complex that is supposed to be one of the sparks for the redevelopment of 125th Street as a shopping district, is making progress, backers say, but more slowly than originally planned.
Drew Greenwald, the president of Grid Properties, the principal developer of the five-level, 275,000-square-foot project, said he has signed or made oral commitments for about 70 percent of the space -- up from 30 percent last June -- and is negotiating with banks about financing the estimated $56 million that it will cost to build. 
 The ambitious project, which would occupy most of the block bounded by 124th and 125th Streets and Eighth and St. Nicholas Avenues, is already scheduled to be the home of a Gap store, Chase Bank, Radio Shack and Watch World, as well as Disney. Other stores that are reportedly negotiating for space in the proposed building are HMV, a music store, and Modell's, a sporting goods store.
Unlike suburban shopping malls, where stores face an interior corridor, each of the planned 20 ground-floor stores will open to the street as part of an effort to make the project blend in with existing stores in the neighborhood.
The entertainment is to be provided by a nine-screen Cineplex Odeon movie theater, committed last year, with as many as 3,000 seats on top of two stories of retail stores. On the top level, an ice skating rink is planned with as many as 2,000 seats for watching ice hockey games. The rink is to be operated by Recreation World, a company that operates sports and entertainment concessions, mostly in suburban shopping malls.
But finding enough tenants for the development to attract the private financing it needs has not been easy. Banks have told the developer that 75 percent of the space must be committed before construction financing will be provided.
Mr. Greenwald is optimistic, even though predictions of when construction will begin have slipped. Early last year, the developers had said they hoped to start construction by the end of the year. Later in the year, the target was the first quarter.
"Negotiations are like that," Mr. Greenwald said. "They take longer than you would like. We are still hoping to do demolition and asbestos removal in the spring and start building in the summer." He said several banks had expressed interest in financing the project.
Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services, who is a leasing broker for the project, said one reason for the slow pace of leasing is the developer's desire to get first-class tenants. "We could have rented the space 20 times over if we were willing to accept lower-quality tenants," he said.
Retail real estate specialists said one problem for major retail employers is recruiting executive staffs to work in lower-income locations. Richard Seligman, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, a commercial brokerage concern, said, "If you say to a guy 'I'll pay you $55,000 to manage a store in midtown or $57,000, $58,000, to manage one on 125th Street,' he will probably say, 'keep the extra couple of thousand, I don't need the aggravation.' "
Nevertheless, he said, the community has relatively few stores in relation to its population, which presents an opportunity for retailers who can tailor their operations to the neighborhood.
"There is business to be done in Harlem, and it is not just sneakers and jeans," said Faith Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates. She said 125th Street was like 34th Street was before national retailers like Kmart started moving in. "It's been local businesses, and the area was always a cultural center."
Ms. Consolo said that because the 125th Street strip was in a Federal economic empowerment zone and the state has pledged to extend low-interest loans for projects in the area, more retailers from national companies will be persuaded to locate in the area.
Real estate brokers say that if a few national companies open successfully on 125th Street, others will rush to join them. "It's a herd mentality," said Alan Victor, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation. "If one opens, the rest will follow."
Mr. Greenwald said plans are to relocate an existing Chase bank branch to the west side of the proposed L-shaped building before demolishing the present building so that there will be no time gap in the branch's operations. After that, the rest of the site will be prepared for the start of construction.

HEADLINE: Let's Get Our Superpowers Straight

BYLINE: By Fareed Zakaria; Fareed Zakaria is the managing editor of Foreign Affairs.

 BODY:
Two simple facts define the geopolitical landscape today -- Russian weakness and Chinese strength. In the North Atlantic, across Eurasia, in East Asia, these two realities form the backdrop against which daily events occur, from the chaos in Albania to the cautiousness in Hong Kong. Yet increasingly the Clinton Administration's foreign policy looks as if it were intended to meet precisely the opposite challenges.
As Russia continues its political bumbling, economic muddling and military retrenchment, the Administration is spending vast amounts of time, energy, money and political capital to deter it from launching an invasion of Central Europe. 
 China, on the other hand, is surging economically, bulking up its armed forces and becoming more assertive by the day. Yet the United States has scaled back its military capability in the region, relying instead on good will and engagement with Beijing.
The diplomatic excursions of the last week perfectly symbolized the Administration's outlook: No sooner did President Clinton return from Helsinki, having informed Boris Yeltsin that NATO would expand whatever the outcome of their talks, than Vice President Al Gore was off on his trip to Beijing, toasting business deals.
Russia today is not a great power, but a great power vacuum. Its economy is half the size of what the Soviet Union's was, and it has declined continuously now for five years. Political instability in Moscow and the regions persists, and the present state of the Russian army, warns a recent report by a private Moscow think tank, "can only be described as a catastrophe."
Those who always worry about Russia reflexively insist that these crises are temporary, that Russia will return as a great power, as it always has. But has it? Czarist Russia was never an economic powerhouse, either agriculturally or industrially. And, other than World War II, Russia's record in power politics is one of failure followed by failure: the Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, World War I and the cold war.
Today Russia's borders are farther away from Central Europe than they have been for centuries. Even if we were to see the renewal of Russian expansionism in the next decade, the countries being considered for first-tier membership in NATO would not be vulnerable to attack. Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states are at greater risk, but no one really expects them to become NATO members in the foreseeable future. Indeed, it is unlikely that they will ever be made members precisely because they may face a real threat.
The historian A. J. P. Taylor said the Treaty of Locarno of 1925, in which Britain and Italy promised to defend France and Belgium, "rested on the assumption that the promises made in it would never have to be made good -- otherwise the British Government would not have made them."
NATO is now willing to make a similar guarantee to Hungary only because it, too, is assumed to be totally unnecessary. That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott can assert that the movement closer to Russia's borders of the most powerful military alliance in the world does not actually threaten Russia. As Tweedledee says, "if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be: but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."
Our problems with Russia all stem from its weakness: the danger of chaos within Russia and on its Central Asian borders; the fear of its losing control of its nuclear arsenal; a breakdown in relations between the military and the Government. President Clinton has been able to bully the Russians into accepting NATO expansion only because they are too weak even to maintain the rhetoric of obstruction. This, of course, raises the question of why they need to be contained in the first place.
All the while, of course, China continues its relentless economic march. In the last five years growth has averaged almost 12 percent, with exports rising even faster. Much of this expansion is in low-cost, labor-intensive goods, but increasingly China is gaining access to high technology, often aided by the Chinese diaspora in East Asia.
The Chinese military, too, is a growth industry. The People's Liberation Army is the largest in the world; it boasts the third-largest nuclear arsenal in terms of delivery vehicles. China's defense budget, a subject of great speculation, is probably around $30 billion and growing by 10 percent each year. The army's rapid reaction force has increased tenfold, to 200,000 troops. These trends are likely to continue because keeping the military happy is an important way to maintain power in Beijing, as Prime Minister Jiang Zemin has readily recognized.
This economic and military expansion is occurring in a region where other countries' economies and militaries are already bursting with growth. (Indonesia, for one, is building up its armed forces at a steeper rate than China.) Beijing has troubled relations with many of its neighbors; of the 14 with whom it shares land borders, four have disputed boundaries: Russia, North Korea, Tajikistan and India. Additionally, as the China scholars Andrew Nathan of Columbia University and Robert Ross of Boston College have written, "China's territorial interests overlap with those of 24 other countries."
American problems with China all relate to Chinese strength: the military buildup, increasing chauvinism, mercantilist economic policies, refusal to sign international agreements on proliferation. If a great power's potential for trouble is judged on the basis of a combination of its capabilities and intentions, China can only be rated a graver threat than Russia.
China is not a rogue superpower, mainly because it is not -- and is unlikely to become -- a superpower. Thus a policy of containment would be premature and unworkable. But the United States must increase its military presence to stabilize East Asia. This is the surest way to deter China from attempts at expansionism such as a military takeover of Taiwan.
Yet the Administration seems to assume that talking with Beijing can produce results on issues from trade to human rights, even as it whittles down our military deterrent. The United States has virtually no military forces left in the Philippines and has reduced its presence in Japan. Washington diplomats have already begun murmuring that if and when Korean unification takes place, American troops will not be able to stay in Korea, since China will object.
Thus if the Clinton Administration's policies are successful, 10 years from now a large, well-equipped American-led force will be in place on the central plains of Europe, fully capable of deterring a paralyzed Russia. Meanwhile, American military power and political influence will have been steadily shrunk in East Asia, the site of the rise of the world's next great power. Perhaps each policy on its own terms might seem plausible, but taken together the two add up to a global grand strategy that is topsy-turvy.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Drop as Fed Raises Rate

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices turned lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve fulfilled investors' expectations and raised short-term interest rates.
The central bank's monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, raised its target on the Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent. The rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, has not been adjusted since January 1996, when the Fed cut it a quarter-point amid concern that the economy was headed for a recession. The committee did not, however, adjust the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges its member banks for overnight loans. 
 While the rise in the funds rate had largely been expected, the hawkish tone of the Fed's announcement had not. "This action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand," the Fed's statement said, "which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy."
The comments "suggest the Fed will not stop tightening until the economy shows signs of slowing," Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said.
Indeed, concerns over the Fed's next move weighed down prices late yesterday.
The price of the 30-year bond ended down 18/32, to 95 25/32. The bond's yield -- a benchmark for consumer and corporate interest rates -- rose to 6.96 percent, from 6.92 percent on Monday.
Prices of shorter maturities also fell. The price of the two-year note fell 4/32, to 99 7/32 for a yield of 6.31 percent, up from 6.24 percent on Monday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Prices were mixed in thin trading yesterday until noon, when prices surged briefly on speculation that the Fed would not raise rates. The rally forced investors who had bet that prices would fall to buy securities to cover their short positions.
When the Fed made its announcement on rates about 2:15 P.M., prices fell.
The question for the market now is: What will the Fed do next? Many are betting on at least one initial increase in rates.
"Barring any sudden and sharp deceleration in economic growth, it would be prudent to assume at least one more Fed tightening move going forward," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Mr. Palash of MCM Moneywatch said he expected one or two more rate increases in the near term. "The whole point of the tightening is to slow the economy, and clearly 25 basis points will not accomplish that, so I think they have to go 50 basis points," he said, for a total move of at 75 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes was held before the Fed made its announcement. The auction's bid-to-cover ratio -- the number of bids compared with the size of the sale -- was a bit on the soft side, but noncompetitive bidding was stronger than expected, Mr. Palash said.
The two-year issue was sold at a high yield of 6.270 percent, up from 5.885 percent last month and the highest since July 23, 1996, when the yield was 6.288 percent. Today the Treasury is to sell $12.5 billion of five-year notes and $13.75 billion of new one-year bills. In when-issued trading, the five-year maturity was offered at a price to yield 6.64 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price	99.963	High Yield	6.270%	Low Yield	6.200%	Median Yield	6.240%	Accepted at low price	47%	Total applied for	$37,989,482	Accepted	$17,254,292	Noncompetitive	$1,479,000	Interest set at	6 1/4	
 
The two-year notes mature on March 31, 1999.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Index Shows a March Dip

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Americans' confidence in the economy slipped this month, and their expectations for coming months dimmed as well, but both gauges remained close to the high levels registered recently.
The Conference Board said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence fell to 118.5 in March from a revised 118.9 in February, which was the highest reading in eight years. The February level was originally reported as 118.4. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a March reading of 117.7. 
 The index that measures consumer expectations over the next six months fell half a point, the research group said.
"The message from consumers is that both business and employment conditions will remain upbeat through the spring and the summer," said Lynn Franco, associate director at the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
The report was issued as the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee met. The panel decided to raise the Federal funds rate by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent; the rate applies to loans that banks make one another overnight.
 "From the Fed's point of view, confidence is a sign that the economy is not about to slow down," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "Each new release gives the Fed more reason to raise rates."
Analysts expect consumers' confidence, and their spending, to remain high. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
Yesterday's report did suggest, however, that consumers were less upbeat about their financial prospects. The index that gauges expectations for the next six months fell to 101, from a revised 101.9. The index that tracks consumers' assessments of present conditions fell to 144.1, from a revised 144.3 in February.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Likely Impact: Less Disruption Than Last Time

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Three years ago, a move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates set off a huge retrenchment in a bond market where prices had been driven up by speculation. This year, such a move is likely to have a much smaller effect on the financial markets. For it is Japan's central bank, not America's, that has done the most recently to foster speculation.
The Federal Reserve's move yesterday to raise the Federal Funds rate, at which banks lend to one another, by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, caused little immediate market reaction, in part because it was widely expected. 
 The general Wall Street view is that the economy, and the stock and bond markets, can escape this round of credit tightening without major damage. But that could change if the Federal Reserve proves to be more determined to raise rates than most now expect, or if the Japanese were to join in raising rates.
In the early 1990's a huge amount of speculation had been built up, largely in bonds, by traders who borrowed at short-term American interest rates and then bought various kinds of longer-term bonds whose rates were higher. When the Federal Reserve moved to push up short-term rates, it cut profits of the speculators and threw fear into them. A selloff in bonds ensued.
There is no shortage of speculation now -- and stemming that speculation may have been one of the Federal Reserve's goals -- but it does not appear to be based on borrowing at United States short-term rates. Now, the speculation is more in stocks, and for many aggressive professional investors the preferred source of borrowing is Japan, where short-term rates are well under 1 percent.
"If you want to talk about the speculation associated with low short-term rates, you have to go halfway around the world," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
An increase in Japanese rates would be more likely to throw fear into speculators right now. But those rates are held down, as they were in this country in the early 1990's, in an effort to help banks that have been damaged by bad loans, as well as by a desire to stimulate economic growth. It is not clear how soon the Bank of Japan will feel it can afford to begin raising them.
The increase yesterday had been repeatedly hinted at by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and had been almost universally forecast. By contrast, Mr. Greenspan's hints in late 1993 and early 1994 were largely ignored, and the increase came as a shock to many. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 96 points, or 2.4 percent, on Feb. 4, 1994, the day the Fed acted, and the rate on long-term Treasury bonds rose to 6.35 percent, from 6.30 percent the day before. That was not a big move, but bigger ones were to come soon, as speculators sold bonds, driving prices down and interest rates up. By later in 1994, the rate was above 8 percent.
During the months after the first 1994 tightening, the Dow fell nearly 10 percent, and lesser stocks fell further. The Nasdaq composite managed to rise to a new high on March 18 that year, a few days before the Fed made clear it was serious by pushing rates up again, but it then fell almost 15 percent over the next three months.
Few expect bond yields to rise as much as they did in 1994. "The reaction will not be as vigorous this time around," forecast Henry Kaufman, the economist and money manager who runs the firm of the same name. He said 30-year Treasury bond yields "will be in the range of 7 to 7.5 percent" by the second half of 1997. That is not much of a move. Yesterday, the yield on 30-year Treasuries rose from 6.92 percent, to 6.96 percent.
The general view now is that the Fed is unlikely to push rates up more than one or two additional times, and that such moves will slow the economy a bit but not tip it into recession. And the Dow now is already down about 2.5 percent from the peak it reached earlier this month, while the Nasdaq composite is off 10 percent from the peak it hit in January. Yesterday, stock prices gyrated but ended with only modest changes.
If the view holds that the Fed's action will have little economic impact, and by delaying inflation indefinitely may even prolong the current six-year economic expansion, then the impact on stocks could be slight.
In announcing the move yesterday, the Fed said it was acting "in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy." Wall Street found two ways to read that, one encouraging and one not.
Some said the talk of a "risk of inflationary imbalances" rather than of actual ones, meant that the Fed was unlikely to do more until it really saw inflation. Others said that the focus on "persisting strength in demand" might be a signal that the Fed would act until it was clear that strength had dissipated.
If the latter interpretation becomes widely accepted, that could cast a pall over the stock market, by raising the risk of recession or at least of an economy slowing enough to damage profits. Profits have grown rapidly in recent years, and stock prices generally assume that trend will continue.
Mr. Greenspan drew much attention in December, when he spoke of possible "irrational exuberance" in the stock market. Prices have gyrated some since then, but money has continued to pour into stock mutual funds at a rapid rate. So far, most investors, professional and amateur, appear to believe that the Fed will not do anything nasty enough to really damage one of the greatest bull markets in history.
But if Japan's central bank were to act decisively, that market confidence might weaken, if not vanish.

HEADLINE: Invasion of the Stealth Antennas;
In Cellular Phone Era, Receivers Are Hidden All Over

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The air war over New York has begun.
On building rooftops and towers, billboards and water tanks -- and coming soon, perhaps, even to a city lamppost near you -- antennas are sprouting by the hundreds as the wireless communications revolution advances on the nation's largest, most densely populated, most lucrative and, for engineers, most maddening communications market.
But unlike the wiring of New York for electricity and telephones in the late 1800's, which choked streets with webs of wires and poles and construction teams, this new wireless world is being built very quietly. Block by block, building by building, new companies and familiar names like AT&T are racing one another to negotiate with property owners for placement of antennas that they say are needed to meet the exploding demand for cellular telephones, pagers and other more exotic wireless devices of an increasingly mobile society. 
 The number of these radio antennas in the five boroughs of New York has quadrupled in the last six months, to 1,000 or more, and is likely to double again within the next year, telecommunications experts estimate. But anyone trying to count these new antennas will need good luck and good eyesight. This emerging wireless communications network, perhaps in keeping with its ethereal medium, is being constructed with deliberate and almost complete invisibility.
Antennas are being concealed and camouflaged, painted to blend with building surfaces, hidden inside parking garage signs, tucked under awnings and stashed behind billboards. Along some blocks of midtown Manhattan or along Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst, Queens, there are dense clusters of antennas -- for reasons that only a radio engineer could love -- but spotting them, on rooftops or at street level, painted to look like bricks, would be like a telecommunications version of "Where's Waldo?"
In Herald Square, there are two waffle-sized antennas at opposite ends of a metal-framed awning. A Park Avenue office building near Grand Central Terminal has an antenna just under a stern-looking frescoed angel on its stone facade. At St. Bartholomew's Church on East 51st Street at Park Avenue, an antenna is visible just over the word "apostle" on the building's northwest corner.
Within the next few months, the city plans to award a contract for the first of what could be thousands more antennas to be mounted on city-owned lampposts. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York is also negotiating with six companies that want to mount disguised cellular antennas in church spires or on other church properties.
"You're probably going to have more antennas per square mile than any other city in the country, and right now you've just seen the beginning," said David Roddy, the chief telecommunications economist at Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group in Atlanta.
But however quietly this part of the telecommunications revolution is proceeding, there are New Yorkers, in scattered buildings and neighborhoods, who have emerged to fight it, because of concerns about the health effects, which they say are uncertain, or about the esthetic implications for buildings or the cityscape as a whole.
In a cooperative building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, for example, residents are now in a standoff with Sprint PCS, a company affiliated with the Sprint Corporation, about a partly installed rooftop antenna. In Queens, residents circulated petitions and wrote to the New York City Public Advocate's office last year when they became concerned about a cellular phone antenna on a nearby apartment building.
But both of those instances also underline the power and momentum of the new wireless expansion. The Queens residents found they could not even learn the name of the company that had placed the antenna. Since the purpose complied with the health standards set by the 1996 Federal Telecommunications Act, city officials told them, the contract was purely a matter between the landlord and the wireless company. At the Manhattan co-op, Sprint has declared that its contract is valid and that it will take the building to court if necessary.
Health studies and tests conducted for the Federal Communications Commission have found no danger from exposure to radio transmissions, especially the newer systems that use very low power. Opponents say, however, that just as exposure to high-power electrical transmission lines has been linked by some researchers to higher cancer rates, the health effects from long-term exposure to cellular transmissions remain unknown.
A spokesman for the City Health Department, Fred Winters, said that the agency accepted the F.C.C.'s analysis that there was no basis for concern.
Opponents say that feeling helpless against antenna encroachment is as much a problem as any anxiety caused by the technology.
"I felt stuck," said Edward Drinkmann, a registered nurse from Whitestone, Queens, who unsuccessfully fought his neighborhood's antenna, on the roof of a building on 146th Place, two doors from his house. Mr. Drinkmann said he was concerned about the effect on property values, but even more worried about his two daughters, ages 9 and 13. "I don't want to hear 20 years from now that there is a pattern of health concerns found around the clusters of cellular telephone transmission sites," he said.
Nationwide, telecommunications experts estimate that more than 100,000 new radio antennas will be needed over the next decade to keep up with the exploding volume of cellular telephone use and the newly licensed technologies like personal communications services. The new technologies, which include new forms of cellular phone service, pagers and data transmission, using different radio band-widths and digital rather than analog technology, have been licensed in recent years as the Federal Communications Commission has begun selling off chunks of the nation's airwaves.
But telecommunications industry officials and New Yorkers who oppose rampant antenna installation agree that building the wireless machinery in New York is also a fundamentally different proposition from doing it anywhere else.
Because of the city's dense topography -- especially in Manhattan -- radio signals bounce in unpredictable ways through the urban canyons. That means more antennas are required. New York's population density, meanwhile, means that residents are more likely to find themselves living in close proximity to an antenna than residents anywhere else in the nation.
Wireless communication is also pushing into new uses. Copier maintenance companies, for example, are installing mobile transmitters on copy machines, which can then automatically call headquarters for service or repair. The next generation of soda machines will likely live in the wireless world as well -- they will call home when they run out of root beer. And every one of those systems needs an antenna.
For cellular phone traffic, antennas are essentially the conduits between footloose radio signals and land-based wire systems: a customer speaks into his phone and the signal bounces to the nearest of that company's antennas. From there, it goes into the regular telephone wires and then to the antenna nearest the person on the other end of the call.
But the pressure to build the antenna networks that will insure call quality means more than competition between companies.
Co-op owners at 67 Riverside Drive, the building that is in the dispute with Sprint PCS, said they worried about a long-term commitment to a technology that they realized they just weren't sure about. Sprint PCS, which is jointly owned by four communications giants -- Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc., the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications -- signed the contract last year to pay the building $24,000 a year for the next 25 years to use a roughly refrigerator-size transmitter, connected to several antennas, each about the size of a box of long-stemmed roses.
A lawyer for the building's board said residents reconsidered when they saw equipment being moved in last month. That caused them to go back and look the contract, which the board now says may not have been validly negotiated or signed.
Sprint said the contract was valid, but offered to shorten the lease to five years. The building counter-offered a one-year-lease that Sprint says is too short to justify its investment.
"There's a sentiment in the building that it's just not worth the potential risk," said Lawrence S. Hirsh, the co-op's lawyer. "The building would be happy to have Sprint go away and give them back their money."
A lawyer for Sprint PCS, David L. Snyder, said the company had no such intentions.
"We have a valid lease, we have rent checks that have been cashed, construction plans that have been approved," Mr. Snyder said. "We comply with all Federal, state and local laws and we have a co-op which refuses to honor its obligations."
Keeping up with the aerial advance could also prove hard for the city government. In November, it said it wanted to lease out as many as 9,000 lampposts for antenna use and was seeking proposals. But the laborious municipal contract machinery moves at land-based pace; the untethered, deregulated telecommunications market does not.
At Omnipoint Communications, a company in Mountain Lakes, N.J., that began building its New York City system in August, initial company blueprints called for using lampposts. But Omnipoint's president, George F. Schmitt, said that only seven months later, without the use of lampposts, the system was more than 60 percent built, with more than 300 antennas in the city and 200 to go up within the next few months. There may still be Omnipoint lampposts, he said, but not that many.
A spokeswoman for the city's Department of Information, Technology and Telecommunications declined to comment because lamppost negotiations are still being held.
"It didn't happen fast enough for us," Mr. Schmitt said. "We couldn't wait."

Many are painted to blend in with their background. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times; Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times; Ruby Washington/The New York Times))(pg. B1)

HEADLINE: Crisis in the Housing Program

 BODY:
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Janet Reno this week jointly announced a vigorous program to stamp out fraud in the Government's major housing program for low-income families. The abuses in the Section 8 program, as it is called, are real -- as New York learned when Federal authorities took over a housing project in the Bronx two weeks ago after sanitary and building conditions had deteriorated to appalling levels. But fraud is not the program's major problem. A financial time bomb is. The Administration understood that Congress would not fork over the money needed for continuation and expansion if the programs were riddled with fraud and abuse.
Section 8 subsidies help millions of families that cannot afford even low-rent apartments. One rent subsidy goes to landlords, who are also provided government-insured mortgages. A separate subsidy, a rent voucher, goes directly to poor families that apply it to apartments of their choice. The financial crisis stems from the fact that many of the 20-year contracts with the landlords are coming to an end. Renewal will be hugely expensive. 
 The amount of money that the Government is turning over to landlords is often well above market rates. The high rents are often necessary to generate enough money for the landlords so they can pay off their mortgages. Washington is caught in a vise. If it tries to control the program's costs by reducing the rent subsidies, it may bankrupt the landlords, forcing them to default on their government-insured mortgages. To keep landlords in the program, Congress has to either maintain high rent subsidies or pay off some of the mortgages. Either way, costs are high. If Congress refuses to fork over the money, more than four million people will face sky-high rents or eviction next year alone.
The Administration has proposed a constructive solution. For next year, it asks Congress for an additional $5.6 billion, a 30 percent increase, in the Housing Department's budget. It is asking Congress for money to issue an additional 50,000 vouchers for the rising number of low-income families who cannot afford market rents. The Administration is also asking Congress for legal authority to pay off part of the mortgage of near-bankrupt landlords and to cut down excessive rent subsidies by renegotiating mortgages of landlords before they come due, perhaps offering the landlords tax breaks as an incentive.
Section 8 is the housing lifeline of seven million poor Americans, most of whom hold jobs and do everything taxpayers could ask. The program relies on the private market to solve the housing shortage of low-rent units. The program also has an admirable history. It gave landlords an incentive to rent to minorities and thereby chipped away at segregated housing patterns in both the North and South.
One danger is that Congress will balk at giving the Administration the budget and legal authority it needs, thus letting the program wither. Another is that it will tell the Administration to preserve Section 8 subsidies but find the billions elsewhere in the department's budget. That too would be unacceptable. The department has become, sadly, the repository of the only programs targeted on cities. A time when Congress is stripping blighted neighborhoods of Medicaid, welfare, food stamps and disability payments is no time to take away the only remaining trickle of Federal dollars to poor neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Labor's New Organizing Tactic

 BODY:
American labor leaders are developing a new tactic to boost union membership. Frustrated by repeated losses in secret-ballot elections to determine whether companies must accept a union, key labor leaders now want to go for voluntary recognition without a formal election. In exchange they would offer managers the prospect of labor peace and even workplace concessions. As a desperate effort to thwart management's stunningly successful opposition to unionization elections, the new tactic makes sense. But the tactic is not likely to reverse labor's 20-year slide because managers will still be able to manipulate the ballot process in ways the labor laws never intended.
Under current law, unions must round up signatures from 30 percent of a workplace's employees on pro-union cards to trigger a Government-supervised secret ballot, whose outcome is determined by a majority of the votes cast. In practice, labor organizers usually try to get at least 70 percent of the workers to sign these cards in order to end up with more than 50 percent of the secret ballot. There is always a dropoff between the cards and the final vote. Management may persuade many workers to change their minds, for example, and some workers who actually oppose unionization sign cards to avoid confrontation with their peers, and then vote their hearts on the secret ballot. 
 But some companies use shameful tactics to thwart protections built into labor laws. They use legal tricks to delay ballots for years, fire union organizers with impunity and, once a union wins recognition, refuse to negotiate a first contract.
Secret ballots are not yielding many victories. Thus some union leaders now want to focus instead on voluntary agreements. The idea is to get more than half of a workplace to sign pro-union cards -- well under the 70 percent it usually takes to win an election -- and then ask management for voluntary recognition. The bait offered might include some contract concessions and uninterrupted labor peace. These would be accompanied by the threat of a labor-led campaign to pressure the company through demonstrations, boycotts or other tactics. The new approach has worked at Las Vegas hotels and Levi Strauss.
But most managers exert too much control over the current balloting process to accede to voluntary recognition. Sensible reforms could make elections fairer. The secret ballots could be conducted in a timely fashion without waiting to resolve all legal challenges by management. Speedy injunctions could reinstate union organizers who have been inappropriately fired, and binding arbitration could be used to break an impasse over the initial contract. But Republican leaders, still smarting from organized labor's campaign to boot them out of office, are hardly inclined to reshape the system to give labor a fair shake.
Labor leaders complain that their right to organize is being thwarted by fear and economic intimidation. Management complains that labor laws often impose irrational restrictions, preventing them from creating productivity teams at work or compensating workers, if they prefer, with time off instead of extra pay for overtime. In a less partisan time, Congress would pass evenhanded reforms. That will not happen soon, leaving labor unions on their own. Their shift toward voluntary recognition does no one harm. After all, it is voluntary. But more will be needed to right the grievous imbalance in some of the nation's workplaces.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Limited Faith in the Nation's Productivity

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For weeks, Alan Greenspan has been saying that the nation's productivity is greater than the statistics acknowledge. American workers, the Federal Reserve chairman suggested, were managing to produce ever greater amounts of goods and services, thus avoiding the shortages and inflation that so often come with a strong expansion. Just last Thursday, Mr. Greenspan told Congress that Fed policy makers would have to decide whether the expansion "will continue to be met by solid productivity growth."
Mr. Greenspan had given plenty of hints that he and his fellow policy makers would raise interest rates. But he had also spoken optimistically about productivity, and that had left open the possibility that he just might let a strong economy run. Rather than raise rates to discourage spending and cut back economic growth, the Fed would count instead on rising productivity to keep the economy safely supplied and free of inflation. Yesterday's decision dashed that hope. Mr. Greenspan, who dominates policy-making at the Fed, announced, in effect, that his faith in productivity had its limits. 
 "He is not willing to bet on productivity," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street firm. "Whatever the productivity story, when demand is strong, and inflation a possibility, Mr. Greenspan goes back to his old instincts, which are hawkish."
Mr. Greenspan had opened the door to a rate increase by arguing recently that temporary factors had played a role in staving off inflation, but these temporary factors seemed likely to disappear. He cited, for example, falling health care costs, job insecurity and a strong dollar that made imports inexpensive. He also drew a distinction between gains in productivity over the last year or so, and gains still to come. Going forward, productivity might fall short, he suggested, particularly at a moment when consumer demand is so strong.
If this strong demand "does not seem likely to be matched by productivity improvement," Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week, then he and his colleagues might have to act. They did, yesterday.
Still, Mr. Greenspan's optimism about productivity, set forth in recent speeches and testimony, is likely to reappear. It helped to explain why the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady for more than a year. "He is not walking away from the notion that productivity has improved," said Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting firm.
But he did flinch yesterday, in the view of many corporate executives, who insist that their downsizings, their reorganizations, their computerization and their other efficiencies have bolstered productivity. Productivity has risen, the National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement yesterday critical of the Fed's rate increase, because of "technological advances and increases in efficiency from new production processes."
Productivity is key to prosperity, which has two main ingredients. One is the labor force. When it grows, because of population growth and immigration, then there are more workers to produce the goods and services that Americans demand. But labor force growth has been a meager 1 percent a year.
The other main ingredient is productivity, or output per worker in a given hour. Circumstances and equipment play a big role here. Given the right mix, output has risen more quickly in some decades than others. Since 1973, however, the rise in output has also been meager, averaging just more than 1 percent a year, according to Government statistics. The total of labor force and output growth -- averaging a bit over 2 percent a year since 1973, and less in recent years -- is considered to be the ceiling at which the economy can expand. If the economy grows more quickly, then shortages develop and prices are driven up.
The economy's growth in the current six-year-old expansion, however, has averaged 2.6 percent annually, and higher in recent months. But no shortages have appeared, and inflation has remained subdued, despite the weak productivity growth registered in Government statistics.
Mr. Greenspan, however, rejects the statistics as inaccurate, offering several arguments. One involves the Consumer Price Index, which is used to calculate productivity. If a "faulty" C.P.I. overstates inflation, as Mr. Greenspan argues, then the published productivity rate understates productivity. The math leaves no other choice, he says.
Then there is technology, and the stories the corporate executives tell. "Certainly, the judgment that aggregate productivity has been growing faster than indicated by the official statistics seems reasonable," Mr. Greenspan said, "in light of the significant business restructurings and extraordinary improvements in technology in recent years."
Manufacturing productivity has indeed been rising handsomely, the Government data show. But that means productivity in the much harder to measure service sector must be shrinking. Mr. Greenspan rejects this conclusion. How can that be, he says, when service companies have been so profitable. Two Fed economists produced a study last fall that said as much -- a study Mr. Greenspan cites, ignoring another study by Fed economists that raises doubts about improvements in the nation's productivity.
Still, for all his emerging convictions about productivity, he did not insist on them yesterday. "I don't know why he makes these productivity arguments," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm. "He has argued against what he wants to do."

HEADLINE: Backers of Rival Health Tests Fight to Get Medicare Dollars

SERIES: SPECIAL PLEADERS: A look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Legislation to expand Medicare coverage of preventive health services is all the rage on Capitol Hill as Republicans and Democrats trumpet the value of tests to detect breast cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes and other diseases.
But behind the scenes, lobbyists are waging a shadowy, fierce battle to win the Government's imprimatur for some tests while denying coverage for others. At stake are millions of patients' lives and billions of dollars in revenues for doctors and medical-supply companies. 
 The debate over testing for one particularly deadly disease, colorectal cancer, illustrates how Congress grapples with such issues, which raise complex questions of science, economics and politics.
Gastroenterologists say they can best detect cancers, and the benign polyps that can turn malignant, by inspecting the colon with a fiber-optic instrument in a procedure known as a colonoscopy.
Radiologists say they can spot the abnormalities just as well by taking X-rays of the large intestine filled with a barium solution that shows up on film. The largest maker of barium products used in the X-ray procedure, E-Z-EM, says that test is cheaper and safer than the colonoscopy but just as effective.
Each side has lined up a politically well-connected law firm to argue the case, knowing that private insurers and health plans often follow the example set by Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
The American College of Gastroenterology has hired the law firm of Patton Boggs here to obtain Medicare coverage of colonoscopy as a screening procedure.
E-Z-EM, of Westbury, L.I., has hired the law firm of Manatt Phelps Phillips, which has a large office here, to obtain coverage of barium X-rays for screening.
A Congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, "You'd think barium was gold, the way they've lobbied on this."
Daniel R. Martin, president of E-Z-EM, said: "Barium is not gold. It's a product that happens to be opaque and inert and exceedingly safe, much safer than colonoscopy. I won't allow anyone in my family to have a colonoscopy if they can get a barium examination."
Mr. Martin wants Medicare to cover barium exams and colonoscopies "on an equal footing" so doctors and patients can choose whichever they prefer.
But Dr. Seymour Katz of Great Neck, L.I., a former president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said: "We have overwhelming evidence to show that colonoscopy is the best screening device for high-risk patients. The barium lobby, the companies that sell products used in barium X-ray procedures, have, in my view, placed their own commercial interests ahead of the best interests of patients."
Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of death from cancer in the United States, killing 55,000 people a year. It strikes men and women in roughly equal numbers. Doctors say it is largely preventable because most colorectal cancers develop slowly over many years from benign polyps. Finding and removing these polyps radically reduces the risk of such cancer.
David M. Klaus, a lawyer at Manatt Phelps who lobbies for E-Z-EM, said: "There is some pretty tough politics going on here. I've never seen a medical specialty group campaign so vigorously to knock out a competitor."
Mr. Martin of E-Z-EM said: "Colonoscopies account for a very significant part of gastroenterologists' income. The gastroenterologists have made a very determined effort on Capitol Hill to exclude barium procedures. And they have misrepresented the effectiveness of these procedures."
The College of Gastroenterology and Patton Boggs insist that colonoscopy is the preferred method of screening, especially among blacks, who are much more likely than whites to die of colon cancer. And they say the fight over barium may confuse Congress and jeopardize the passage of legislation providing colorectal screening for the 38 million people covered by Medicare.
But Dr. C. Daniel Johnson, a radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said the barium examination was "the most cost-effective way of screening for colorectal cancer" and should at least be available to Medicare patients as an option.
Medicare now covers these procedures for treatment but not screening. The Medicare fee schedule for 1995 shows that the Government paid $131 for an X-ray examination and $434 for a colonoscopy with removal of tumors or polyps.
Dr. Johnson, the chairman of the colon cancer committee of the American College of Radiology, said: "I hope this legislation doesn't get bogged down because of disputes over these techniques. Let's hope the patient doesn't lose in the end."
Each side has inundated Congressional offices with articles from medical journals to support the use of its preferred technique.
President Clinton; Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, and Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, have all proposed wider Medicare coverage of preventive services, including colon cancer tests, and their proposals have broad bipartisan support. But the proposals differ on details.
Representative Norman Sisisky, Democrat of Virginia, has an intense interest in the issue because his own colon cancer was detected in a routine screening two years ago. He praised Mr. Thomas's efforts, but faulted his bill on the ground that it would not immediately cover barium X-ray tests, which Mr. Sisisky described as "one of the most cost-effective screening procedures currently available."
Mr. Sisisky's cancer was found by colonoscopy in August 1995. He had surgery, and doctors then performed barium X-ray tests to confirm that the operation had been successful.
On the other hand, Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., a professor of surgery at the Howard University College of Medicine, said colonoscopy was "the best means presently available for detecting and preventing colorectal cancer." With that test, Dr. Leffall said, a physician can remove cancerous and precancerous growths as they are identified, with no need for separate surgery later. But "barium X-ray has not been well established for colorectal cancer screening in either the average-risk or high-risk populations," he said.
In a newsletter summarizing the issue, the College of Gastroenterology said it was resisting a compromise with "the barium lobby," fearing that private health plans would cite Medicare to justify "selection of lower-cost barium enema instead of colonoscopy for high-risk patients."

HEADLINE: Toyota to Sell Hybrid-Power Car in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 25

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would become the first company to sell a low-polluting hybrid vehicle, with both an electric motor and a gasoline engine, to a mass market.
The company, the largest Japanese auto maker, said it would begin selling a compact hybrid car with a 1.5-liter engine in Japan this year. Executives said they had no immediate plans to sell the vehicles in the United States, though that is a possibility later. "We are very confident about what this offers," said Akihiro Wada, an executive vice president of Toyota, "but we would like to get reaction and criticism by testing it in the Japanese market first." 
 Hybrid vehicles significantly reduce emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars but are far more practical than fully electric cars. They cannot achieve the zero-emission level of the fully electric car, which California regulators have been seeking. But many auto engineers believe that the hybrid approach represents a reasonable compromise.
Toyota estimates that its hybrid car will get 66 miles a gallon of gasoline in Japanese fuel-economy tests, twice the efficiency of a similar-size Corolla. Emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut in half, and those of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides reduced 90 percent.
Many other companies are working on hybrid vehicles. Detroit's Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are pursuing them, in an effort partly financed by the Department of Energy, to develop a high-efficiency supercar. Audi, a division of Volkswagen, is said to have a hybrid car using a diesel engine ready for sale later this year, and Renault has also announced hybrid technology.
Until recently, much of the emphasis in cutting automotive air pollution had focused on fully electric vehicles, because California was requiring that 2 percent of the cars sold there beginning in the 1998 model year have zero-emission levels.
But last year, with auto makers insisting that it would be a long time until it was possible to make an electric vehicle that would satisfy consumers, California dropped that deadline, though it is still aiming for 10 percent of vehicles sold in 2003 to have no emissions.
Takehisa Yaegashi, chief engineer for Toyota's hybrid system, said the company hoped that California might further relax its requirements and accept hybrid vehicles instead of electric ones.
General Motors in December began offering an electric vehicle in California and Arizona, but has sold only a few dozen a month. The Honda Motor Company, Toyota and possibly others are expected to begin sales of electric vehicles in California this year.
The hybrid vehicles could avoid a major shortcoming of fully electric ones -- the limited range of the batteries. G.M.'s electric vehicle goes only about 90 miles before the battery must be recharged, a process that takes about three hours.
But the hybrid vehicle can also travel farther because it uses gasoline. And energy from the gasoline engine can recharge the battery while the car is in motion, so that no external recharging is needed.
Hybrids can achieve high efficiency and low pollution because of the way they combine dissimilar propulsion systems. Gasoline systems are good for quick refueling, but get zero miles a gallon when the car is idling; in a hybrid, that energy can be converted to current for the batteries. And if the engine runs at a constant speed, the antipollution system can operate at most efficient levels for that speed.
Electric systems are clean and powerful but rely on slow recharging, which is cumbersome if the car has to stand still. And the gasoline engines used in hybrids can be small and light, because they do not have to be big enough to meet peak demand -- acceleration to highway speeds; for that, they can get help from the electric motor.
Because hybrid cars can get by with smaller batteries, they also should cost significantly less than fully electric cars, Toyota executives said. They would not disclose the price of their new car, but said they aimed to keep it no more than about $4,000 more expensive than a similar-size conventional car, implying a price of less than $20,000 for a compact model. By contrast, the G.M. electric vehicle, which seats only two people, has a price of $34,000.
Toyota officials suggested that they expected to sell significantly more hybrid vehicles than the several hundred a year electric cars that most makers expect to sell. But they would not announce a sales target and conceded that the hybrid car's higher price compared with conventional cars would limit sales.
In Toyota's hybrid vehicle, power from the gasoline engine is split into two paths -- one directly turning the wheels and the other operating an electric generator. The generator's electricity output can be used to turn a motor that drives the wheels, or to charge the battery. The proportion of power allocated to each path is automatically adjusted to achieve maximum efficiency.
When the car is started and moving slowly, only the electric motor is used because gasoline engines operate inefficiently at such low speeds. In normal driving the gasoline engine is used, perhaps assisted by the electric motor during acceleration. When the car is slowed, the gasoline engine is shut off and the momentum of revolving wheels helps recharge the nickel-metal hydride battery.
Toyota is not banking solely on hybrids but is pursuing many different technologies for increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions, such as lean-burning gasoline engines, electric vehicles and cars that use other kinds of fuel.

HEADLINE: Mobutu Offers to Share Rule; Some See Ploy to Keep It

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, March 25

 BODY:
In the first public admission that Mobutu Sese Seko is losing his hold on a country ripped by civil war, his spokesmen said that the longtime dictator is willing to negotiate an end to the fighting and share power with the rebels.
Speaking on national television tonight, Mr. Mobutu's spokesman, Kabuya Lumuna Sando, said that Mr. Mobutu has formed a negotiating team with full power to represent him and has called on the Parliament to nominate a Prime Minister and form a transitional government. And the second-ranking official in Mr. Mobutu's party, Banza Mukalay, also said tonight, "We have decided to share power, including with the rebellion, during a transition period." 
 But political specialists here said that Mr. Mobutu, who has managed to outmaneuver his opponents since his supreme rule was challenged in 1991, may be simply trying to buy himself more time in what looks like an increasingly doomed effort to cling to power.
"This is clearly a preparatory step," said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Mobutu knows that his days are numbered, and he is trying to prolong them."
The rebel alliance, which already controls the eastern third of the country and is poised to take Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city, rejected Mr. Mobutu's overture and warned that it would treat as an enemy anyone who accepted the post of Prime Minister in a Mobutu Government.. On Sunday, Mr. Mobutu made his first public appearance and promised that in the next 48 hours he would have a plan to stop the rebels' attempt to overthrow his government. The rebels, known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, have rejected international pressure for a cease-fire and confidently proclaimed that they will win the war by marching into this sprawling capital city by June.
The rebels are said to be about 100 miles from Lubumbashi.
While, it is clear to almost everyone that the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, will win the war, he faces a greater political fight whenever he invades this capital city. Mr. Kabila has announced that he would not let any existing political party participate in a transitional government.
Mr. Kabila's move to exclude opposition leaders, particularly Etienne Tshisekedi, from the Government, does not sit well with people here. While Mr. Tshisekedi enjoys strong backing, many here in recent days have come to view Mr. Kabila suspiciously as a potential second incarnation of Mr. Mobutu.
"We've been fighting for democracy for years," said Alphonse Lupumba Kamanda, president of the Republican Front, which supports Mr. Tshisekedi. "If Kabila can put an end to dictatorship, then we say yes. But if he comes with his guns, we will say no. We can't chase one dictator only to end up with another."
But Western officials here said that Mr. Tshisekedi's moment to lead Zaire is well behind him. "I don't think Tshisekedi is a player," said a senior Western diplomat. "You see his press saying it has to be settled by sitting Mobutu, Tshisekedi and Kabila around a table. But I don't think Kabila sees any reason to deal Tshisekedi into the game."
Zaire's war began last October, when Zairian ethnic Tutsi began an uprising in the eastern border region. The rebel movement was widely believed to have had the backing of Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola, all countries with scores to settle with Mr. Mobutu for having supported uprisings in their own country.
After weeks of empty declarations from the Government, Mr. Mobutu could have seized the occasion to name a Prime Minister today, particularly Mr. Tshisekedi, who led the Government twice during 1993, Zairian leaders and people on the street interviewed here said.
The crisis is being hotly debated today in the streets of Kinshasa, the capital. Throughout most of the day, the residents were anticipating a bolder move from the dictator, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Many people said they had been expecting him to announce his resignation, or at least to name a Prime Minister.
So tonight when Mr. Mobutu failed to appear in person, there was deep disappointment.
In bars in the working class neighborhood of Matonga, at the university and on the streets, people said they had been expecting Mr. Mobutu to announce his resignation.
"I want Mobutu to go," said Paul Tsimva, 40, an unemployed civil servant. "He has done nothing for the country except to enrich his friends and his cronies."
Such talk, which never would have been heard here during the years when Mr. Mobutu was the unquestioned ruler, was echoed over and over.
The stage was set for a challenge to Mr. Mobutu in 1991 after Zaire's economy nearly collapsed, forcing Western donors to intervene politically here. Mr. Mobutu reluctantly agreed to share power then, but by manipulating divisions in the opposition, he managed to avoid actually doing so until the civil war erupted in the eastern region.
"Mr. Mobutu must exit the political stage gracefully," said an African diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But that is difficult in our continent. After 30 years in power it is difficult to accept defeat."

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE LIFTS A KEY RATE; FIRST RISE SINCE '95

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years, firing a warning shot at an inflationary threat that remained hidden over the horizon.
The central bank took one of the smallest steps it could, nudging up the more important of the two short-term rates it controls -- the Federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks -- by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. In doing so, it was trying to keep the economy from growing so fast that it generates wage and price pressures strong enough to threaten the nation's six-year economic expansion. 
 Because banks tie their benchmark loan rates to the Federal funds rate, today's action will ripple through the economy, probably curbing investment and consumption somewhat by increasing the rates charged for many business and personal loans and for credit cards.
The move was applauded as tempered but appropriate by a number of Wall Street and academic economists, many of whom say the current combination of strong growth and low unemployment will ultimately lead to a resurgence of inflation unless action is taken to slow the economy. They said the Federal Reserve was likely to keep trying to fine-tune the economy by raising rates at least once or twice more this year.
"What the Fed did today is about right," said Paul A. McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities.
But with few signs that rising prices are actually infecting the economy, the move drew criticism from a significant minority of economists as well as from labor unions, business groups and politicians who say that economic statistics overstate the threats to steady growth and that such factors as global competition and fear of layoffs have permanently damped inflationary forces.
"By increasing short-term interest rates even though there is no evidence of accelerating inflation in the actual data," said John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., "the Federal Reserve has sacrificed the economic interests of America's working families on the basis of a hunch that's about as scientific as reading tea leaves."
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, had dropped broad hints about the central bank's intentions last week, taking some of the sting out of today's move for the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 6,876.17, down 29.08 points. It rose more than 40 points immediately after the Fed's announcement at 2:15 P.M, but then plunged a few minutes later. Bond prices fell, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.96 percent, and the dollar increased in value against other major currencies.
Big lenders like Citibank and the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis immediately followed the Federal Reserve's action by raising their prime rates to 8.5 percent from 8.25 percent. The longer-term rates set by the financial markets -- such as those that govern mortgage rates and auto loans -- had already moved up in recent months as investors anticipated today's action.
The Federal Reserve's other monetary policy tool, the little-used and largely symbolic discount rate for loans from the Federal Reserve system to banks, was left unchanged today at 5 percent.
In his nine and a half years as the chairman, Mr. Greenspan has built a reputation as an uncompromising inflation fighter. But over the last year he has surprised many analysts by patiently watching the economy to determine whether it can accommodate strong growth despite an unemployment rate, currently 5.3 percent, that is well below the past levels at which workers began receiving the kind of hefty wage increases that can lead to higher prices.
In raising rates today, Mr. Greenspan not only signaled that his patience with that experiment had run out, but also that he was concerned that growth might be so strong that it could require further rate increases this year, analysts said.
In a statement explaining its action, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said its action "was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy that would eventually undermine the long expansion."
The central bank last started a series of rate increases on Feb. 4, 1994, when it made the first of seven moves that pushed the Federal funds rate to 6 percent from 3 percent over the span of a year. In that case, Mr. Greenspan succeeded in squelching any inflationary pressures without choking off growth completely.
Although the situation now is different -- most notably, interest rates relative to inflation are much higher than they were three years ago -- analysts said 1994 had clearly become a model for pre-emptive action at the Federal Reserve.
Economists said Mr. Greenspan had also learned another lesson in 1994, when he sent the financial markets into a tailspin as soon as he started raising rates. This time, Mr. Greenspan has been explicitly warning investors for months that interest rates would have to rise eventually, and he has tried to impose a reality check on investors with his comments about the "irrational exuberance" of the stock market.
Whether Mr. Greenspan will be forced to keep raising rates, economists said, will largely be determined by whether the economy slows substantially from its 3.9 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Given the economy's record last year of strong growth without serious signs of inflation, critics of Mr. Greenspan's take-no-prisoners approach to inflation spoke out today.
"The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates was simply wrong," said Paul Huard, senior vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "It will impede economic growth and make life tougher on consumers and job-creating businesses."
But in its statement, the Fed defended its action as "a prudent step that affords greater assurance of prolonging the current economic expansion" because low inflation "is essential to realizing the economy's fullest growth potential."

"Ripple Effects of the Fed's Rate Move"
The Federal Reserve, for the first time in more than two years, increased its short-term interest rate target, lifting it a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5 percent. To some extent, the move had already been anticipated in the markets, where long-term bonds, mortgage rates and bank deposit rates have moved up slightly in recent weeks. But consumer and auto loan rates tend to be much stickier and they have barely budged. The Fed is counting on higher interest rates to help slow the economy enough to keep a lid on inflation. Graphs track bond yields, bank deposits, mortgages and consumer loan rates, since the beginning of 1995. (Sources: Bank Rate Monitor; Datastream; Associated Press) (pg. D5)

HEADLINE: Judge Orders Assessments For Workfare Recipients

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court justice has told the city to stop assigning welfare recipients to workfare programs unless it first does a full assessment of recipients' needs and skills to determine whether they should be put into educational programs instead.
In a setback to the Giuliani administration, Acting Justice Jane S. Solomon of State Supreme Court in Manhattan issued an injunction on Monday after making a preliminary finding that the administration was violating state law by assigning many welfare recipients to its Work Experience Program without doing proper individual assessments. 
 The injunction was in response to a lawsuit brought by six welfare recipients who say that the city -- which calls in more than 3,000 welfare recipients for possible workfare assignments each month -- is undermining their prospects for jobs and economic advancement by not assessing their needs and by steering them away from education. Workfare does not, they say, provide them with valuable training or experience.
"The judge wants to see a genuine process in which an honest attempt is made to determine what an individual needs and to improve his or her chances of becoming employed," said Christopher Lamb, a senior attorney with the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law and a lawyer for the plaintiffs. "The injunction rejects the city's current one-size-fits-all approach, that every single person should be placed into workfare."
City officials say that placing welfare recipients into workfare jobs, which often involve cleaning parks or streets, is the best route to permanent employment.
The city had steered the six plaintiffs into its 35,000-person workfare program, by far the largest such program in the country. City officials say they plan to expand the program to between 50,000 and 60,000 recipients by the end of the year.
One of the plaintiffs, a mother of three, had a 3.72 grade point average as she pursued an associate's degree at the College of Staten Island, with the goal of becoming a teacher. She said she was told she had to drop out of school immediately to take a workfare assignment. She refused and had her public assistance cut.
Another plaintiff had her welfare grant cut by 20 percent because she continued with her high school diploma equivalency, or G.E.D., program rather than reporting to her workfare assignment.
Acting Justice Solomon has asked the plaintiffs' lawyers to draft an order that would tell the city exactly what it must do to satisfy the requirements on individual assessments called for by state law. The city would then respond to that proposed order, and the justice would issue the formal order, probably sometime next month.
Paul Crotty, the Corporation Counsel, said it was highly unlikely that the city would appeal the order. However, his office says that the city is in compliance with the law.
"We have to insure that for each client who comes in, the information is properly recorded and all the questions that should be asked are asked," said Muriel Goode-Trufant, the Corporation Counsel lawyer handling the case.
The plaintiffs disagreed, saying that the city largely stopped doing individual assessments a year ago, and Acting Justice Solomon agreed that the city was falling short of what the New York State social services law requires.
Ms. Goode-Trufant, however, said that the judge, in a series of oral decisions from the bench, rejected one of the plaintiffs' arguments: that welfare recipients should be free to choose whether they want to go into an education program or workfare.
Acting Justice Solomon did grant the plaintiffs' motion to expand the lawsuit into a class action that includes not just the six plaintiffs, but all current and future welfare recipients considered for workfare.

HEADLINE: Roberto Sanchez Vilella, 84, Puerto Rican Governor, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Roberto Sanchez Vilella, the somber, efficient, bespectacled technocrat who in 1964 became Puerto Rico's second elected Governor and then shocked the Commonwealth with an unlikely love affair that left his marriage, party and political career a shambles, died yesterday at a hospital near his home in San Juan. He was 84 and had cancer.
When Luis Munoz Marin, the charismatic figure who had ruled Puerto Rico by virtual fiat, decided to step down after 16 years as Governor, there was no doubt about who would succeed him. 
 Mr. Munoz, a revered figure who is regarded as the father of modern Puerto Rico, had seen to that simply by letting it be known that his choice was Mr. Sanchez, the brilliant administrator who had been his right-hand man for much of his political career.
As a young man, Mr. Sanchez, a native of Mayaguez whose father had been Speaker of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives, had turned his back on politics and on Puerto Rico, obtaining a degree in civil engineering from Ohio State University and accepting a job with the new Tennessee Valley Authority. But Mr. Munoz persuaded him to return to Puerto Rico and devote his talents to the social and economic development of his homeland.
Mr. Sanchez proved so adept at his work and so indispensable to his mentor that when Mr. Munoz organized the Popular Democratic Party and became president of the Puerto Rican Senate in 1940, Mr. Sanchez resigned as city manager of San Juan to become his chief legislative assistant.
Over the next few years, Mr. Sanchez was deeply involved in every Munoz strategy and initiative, from his vaunted Operation Bootstrap, which transformed Puerto Rico from a near feudal agricultural society into a modern industrial state, to his campaign for increased autonomy from the United States.
When Mr. Munoz became the first elected Governor, in 1948, Mr. Sanchez became his chief of staff. It was a measure of his value to the Munoz administration that after Puerto Rico gained full commonwealth status in 1952, Mr. Sanchez served simultaneously as Secretary of State and Secretary of Public Works.
After Mr. Munoz anointed him as his successor, the voters obligingly swept Mr. Sanchez into office with 60 percent of the ballots.
As Governor, Mr. Sanchez continued and expanded the Munoz economic and social programs and promoted younger politicians to the party leadership, stepping on some toes along the way.
But while Mr. Munoz was a gregarious, emotional man who had ruled by the force of his personality, effectively suppressing factionalism within the party, Mr. Sanchez was a colorless administrator in black horn-rimmed glasses who puffed contemplatively on his pipe, gave up his lifelong fascination with horse racing upon taking office and had virtually no political base of his own.
As a result, dissident politicians soon found they were able to form viable factions, which bickered among themselves and undermined Mr. Sanchez's authority, creating some doubts that he could win re-election.
Whatever his chances, Mr. Sanchez, then a 55-year-old grandfather, effectively took himself out of the running in 1967 when he stunned all of Puerto Rico and his largely Roman Catholic constituency by announcing that he was divorcing his wife of 30 years to marry his 35-year-old staff assistant, Jeannette Ramos.
The move was so shattering that although Mr. Sanchez said he would not seek re-election -- a decision that drew swift approval from Mr. Munoz -- his announcement produced a wave of demands that he resign immediately.
Mr. Sanchez not only clung to his office as Mr. Munoz and other party leaders scrambled to find a replacement candidate, he also stunned the nation and his mentor all over again the next year when he announced that he would in fact seek re-election under the banner of a new People's Party, a decision that caused a break with Mr. Munoz that lasted until shortly before his death in 1980.
Mr. Sanchez was swamped in the 1968 election but polled enough votes to sink the Popular Democratic Party candidate as well, handing that party its first defeat for governor. After an abortive race for the legislature in 1972, Mr. Sanchez retired from politics, taught at the University of Puerto Rico, resumed his trips to the track, played dominoes and became a panelist on a television program of political commentary.
Like his first marriage, his second ended in divorce. His survivors include a daughter, Evelyn, from his first marriage, two children from his second, Olga Elizabeth Ramos and Roberto Jose Sanchez, a sister, Olga Sanchez Vilella, and several grandchildren, all of San Juan.

Fed Moves to Increase A Key Interest Rate
The Federal Reserve voted to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years, firing a warning shot at an inflationary threat that remains hidden over the horizon. 
 The central bank raised the Federal funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent. A number of economists applauded the move, saying that without such action, the economy's growth could eventually lead to price rises. But others said the Fed had acted prematurely, saying there were few signs of inflation and that changes in economic fundamentals had shifted since the last time price increases were a problem. [Page A1.]
 
The last time the Fed began raising rates, bond prices, which had been driven up by speculation, went into a slump. This year, the Fed move will probably have less effect on the financial markets, largely because speculation has been fostered less here than it has been half a world away, by the Japanese central bank. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [A1.]
 
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has been saying that productivity is greater than data show, and that it has prevented the inflation that so often accompanies a strong expansion. But with the rate increase, he announced, in effect, that his faith in productivity had its limits. News analysis. [D5.]
 
Dow Falls 29.08 After Fed Move
Stocks slumped after the Fed moved to raise rates. The Dow industrials fell 29.08 points, to 6,876.17, though they had initially risen after the announcement. [D6.]
 
Bond prices also fell, with the 30-year Treasury's yield rising to 6.96 percent from 6.92 percent. [D16.]
 
Short-sellers, who often intend to profit from declines in stock prices, became more active in recent weeks as the Nasdaq stock market declined sharply. [D18.]
 
A Warning From T.W.A.
Trans World Airlines said that its auditors had included a qualification in the carrier's annual report regarding its "ability to continue as a going concern." The timing of the statement, which came as the company said it wanted to raise $50 million in a private offering, suggested that T.W.A. was simply trying to disclose all risks, but analysts saw another sign of a questionable future. [D4.]
 
$2.8 Billion British Insurance Deal
Prudential of Britain, outbidding two other companies, said that it would buy Scottish Amicable Life Assurance for $2.8 billion. The purchase would make Prudential, which is Britain's largest life insurance company, a more powerful force in selling policies through an independent sales force. [D2.]
 
Consumer Confidence Down a Bit
Americans' confidence in the economy has slipped a bit, though it remains high. The Conference Board said that its index of consumer confidence fell to 118.5 in March from a revised 118.9 in February, which was the highest reading in eight years. [D5.]
 
VF to Buy Maidenform
VF agreed to acquire Maidenform Worldwide for an undisclosed amount, shoring up its position as a leading manufacturer of women's intimate apparel. [D18.]

Toasted In China

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
The Vice President stood as still as a terra cotta warrior, facing the cameras in the Great Hall of the People with a fixed smile as the Chinese tossed him bouquets of Buicks and Boeing jet deals worth $2 billion.
But his eyes were darting back and forth. And there, on the periphery of his vision, was a terrifying sight: two women beneath the glistening chandeliers, coming toward him bearing glasses of champagne. 
 He got a Gore-in-the-headlights look, a look that this Vice President, unlike the last, more easily rattled one, rarely gets.
Mr. Gore was outfoxed, maneuvered into a cozy champagne toast at a morning business deal signing ceremony with Li Peng, the man who choreographed the Tiananmen Square massacre. It was the sort of cozy toast that got Brent Scowcroft into trouble when he snuck over not long after the momentous atrocity; the sort of cozy toast that Richard Gephardt is panting to use in a campaign ad in 2000, to suggest that the Clinton Administration's China policy prefers money to morality.
The frazzled Gore crowd clearly underestimated the complexity of this trip and have been caught up in an ever-escalating series of clarifications on diplomatic issues. Yesterday they spent the evening explaining how they got Shanghaied on the toast.
"You rent the room, you get the glasses," Ginny Terzano, Mr. Gore's press secretary, said. But even Leon Fuerth, the Vice President's relentlessly uninformative national security adviser, conceded surprise.
During the marathon negotiations for the trip, the Gore team tried to control every detail and put a news blackout on anything that could seem embarrassing, even American Chamber of Commerce meetings that might include corporate donors. The toasts at Tuesday night's dinner with Mr. Li were cut out, and an Administration official lamely explained that highly unusual action by saying: "This wasn't a banquet. It was just a large social dinner." But it is unthinkable that the Chinese, whose culture is so drenched in protocol, would not have wanted to toast such an honored guest at a formal dinner -- and perhaps leak the pictures, as they did with Mr. Scowcroft.
Besides, Mr. Gore's relationship with Mr. Li is anything but social. Even though the Prime Minister is anxious that the visit go well, so the post-Deng leadership can show it can still get American technology and market share while doing little in return, he could not resist a public jab. He admonished Mr. Gore that the U.S. "should play a more positive role in international affairs."
China resents America for holding up its admission to the World Trade Organization. Many Chinese are also fuming over the assertion in "The Coming Conflict With China," by Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro, that China threatens world peace.
Picnicking with the tiger is never easy. But this time it was folly. The Chinese may have tried to buy our Government. They may have tried to use espionage to penetrate the White House through the Democratic fund-raising operation. They may be engaged in a ruthless attempt to transform themselves into a military and economic superpower.
And here is Al Gore reassuring his hosts that, while the Feds are investigating whether the Chinese tried to corrupt Democrats, or whether the Democrats wanted to be corrupted, this will in no way deflect the Clinton Administration from pursuing its policy of engagement with China.
But Mr. Gore wanted it known that he had told the Chinese the Administration was taking the inquiry "seriously" -- to avoid an unfortunate echo of Mr. Scowcroft's secret reassurances that Tiananmen would not derail engagement with China.
When Mr. Fuerth was asked about complaints that the U.S. has little to show on human rights in China, he dismissed the idea "that it's got to be an on-the-barrelhead exchange."
Mr. Gore raised the issue of human rights in a way he considered "vigorous." But he talked more to his hosts about the environment, whipping out his carbon dioxide emission charts for the Prime Minister. ("No, as a matter of fact they were all fascinated," insisted Ms. Terzano.) He opined about the start of civilization, recalling the last ice age, "when humankind moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture" and then to technology.
He might also have pointed out that, at least in other parts of the world, it moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture to technology to human rights.

Proposal to Exempt Home Improvements

 BODY:
Saying that homeowners should not be penalized for improving their houses, the Nassau County Executive yesterday proposed a state law to exempt additions and other improvements from tax assessments.
"Home improvements should stimulate the economy, create jobs and increase sales tax revenues but not increase property taxes," the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said. 
 Mr. Gulotta, who is running for re-election this fall, said his proposal was being introduced in Albany by Senator Norman J. Levy, a Republican, and Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, a Democrat.
Under legislation approved by Albany two years ago, the assessment for home improvements is phased in over eight years, making for a more gradual rise in taxes on the property.
Mitchell Pally, vice president for legislative and economic affairs at the Long Island Association, the area's largest business organization, said such a change would have a strong trickle-down impact on the region's economy. "We believe that any potential loss in property tax revenue," he said, "would be more than offset by the economic shot in the arm this change would have, including a boost in sales tax revenues from new home furnishings and appliances."

THE BIG PICTURE
By Douglas Kennedy
374 pages. Hyperion. $23.95.
 Here's a thriller that will carry you far away for the weekend: "The Big Picture" by Douglas Kennedy.
 Ben and Beth Bradford seem to have the perfect yuppie life together, with their two adorable children and their half-million-dollar New England Colonial on the Connecticut Gold Coast. He's a rising young lawyer specializing in trusts and estates for a Wall Street firm. She's an antiques collector, favoring items with a historical pedigree. Saturday mornings they mellow out by shopping "in that elegant economic fortress called Greenwich." Ben, the narrator, adds: "Natural habitat of the WASP. Impossible on less than $250,000 a year. And, ergo, free of aspiring middle-class mobs. Especially on Saturdays." 
 But all is not well with Ben and Beth these days. Ben actually wanted to be a photographer and became a lawyer only because his father bullied him into achieving. Now Ben's only outlet is collecting expensive photographic equipment. Beth tried to be a novelist, wrote three books, but couldn't get them published. Now she feels trapped by the compromises she and Ben have made.
As the novel opens, she's barely speaking to Ben. And when she does, she frequently lies, about where she's been all day, about where she got this amazing New Zealand sauvignon blanc called Cloudy Bay that she served at dinner. Ben can't bring himself to ask Beth about a fresh scratch on her back. When Ben tries to buy some Cloudy Bay at the local liquor store, the proprietor has never heard of it.
At a neighbors' party on Saturday night, Ben runs into Gary Summers, a man he loathes, in part because Gary lives on a trust fund and works at photography pretentiously if unsuccessfully. Ben sees Gary presenting the host with a bottle of this great new wine he has discovered. Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc. Many stiff drinks later, Ben sees Beth and Gary touching hands and smiling.
The next evening, recovered from his hangover, Ben drops by Gary's house with the excuse of talking photography. Gary breaks out a bottle of Cloudy Bay. They begin arguing and putting each other down. Gary brazenly admits he's sleeping with Beth. He tells Ben that Beth hates him and ridicules Ben for his sexual failings. Ben takes the bottle of Cloudy Bay and smashes it against Gary's head. Then he stabs the jagged stem into the back of Gary's neck. Geysering blood, Gary falls dead.
Yet believe it or not, "The Big Picture" is not about crime and punishment. It's about second chances and the fantasy so many pressured people entertain of starting over with a clean slate. So instead of going "Dostoevskian," as Ben warns himself not to do, the author takes a plot wrinkle from Patricia Highsmith ("Strangers on a Train," "The Talented Mr. Ripley," among many others) and contrives an elaborate way for Ben to exchange identities.
On the verge of committing suicide out of guilt, Ben happens to see a televangelist exhorting his audience to be born again by accepting Jesus. Ben reflects: "Yes, I must die. For there is no other way out. But after I am dead, why can't I live anew? Why can't I have that second chance? Why shouldn't I be born again?
"The more I considered it, the more clearly I realized: You don't need Jesus to be reborn. You need a lot of careful planning."
The planning is done with great precision and is carried out so that each of its elements sticks in the reader's mind like that bottle of Cloudy Bay. It involves an I.B.M. Thinkpad, a jeweler's hammer, a cookbook recipe, a pair of surgical gloves and sundry other equipment.
Yet what happens is handled with surprising sensitivity, too, particularly considering Mr. Kennedy's punchy prose and his brutal, edge-of-the-seat plot. For instance, a day before the murder, Ben discovers that he has actually taken a worthwhile photograph, of "a hefty middle-aged man -- treble-chinned, his suit crumpled -- emerging from the doors of the New York Stock Exchange, his eyes as wide and fearful as those of a deer blinking into the headlights of an oncoming truck."
Yet on closer examination of "this image of bloated midlife crisis," Ben notices "a flaw in the print: the broker appeared to be shadowed by a second image." That "lurking phantom" will figuratively take on flesh on Mr. Kennedy's plot.
His story is not perfect. As hateful as Beth is, one finds it hard to believe that a woman claiming such integrity would so willingly tear her family apart. The plot teases you several times with threats that turn out to be completely beside the point. The dialogue is sometimes so breezy that small-craft warnings go up. And the ending strains credibility almost to the point of breaking the narrative's spell.
Still, so much of "The Big Picture" is done so well that you ignore its flaws and race through it, hoping it will never end. Mr. Kennedy is an American (born in New York City in 1955) who has lived in Ireland and Britain for the last 20 years, writing radio plays and books. "The Big Picture" is his first novel to be published in the United States. When you finish it, you reflect that while a picture may be worth a thousand words, the author has taken the whole subject of pictures and made them worth an entire transfixing novel.

HEADLINE: GARDEN NOTEBOOK;
Is This City Big Enough For Gardens And Houses?

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, two gardeners sat in the freezing sleet under a pergola in the Garden of the Golden Lions in central Harlem. They were grappling with the news that three community gardens on 121st Street, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and St. Nicholas Avenue, would have to close by the end of this month.
Mary Emma Harris, an art historian and landscape designer, recalled how she showed up at the neighboring Public School 76 four years ago just to give advice, and never left. She helped the children turn a dumping ground into a place of beauty full of native trees. 
 It took more than a year to build a winding path out of brick and stone pulled from the rubble. They called it the Garden of Love because it is the opposite of what one student wrote when her teacher asked her to choose a color for her emotions: "Roses are red, violence is blue."
That still sends a chill through Ms. Harris's heart. "I'm not going to dig up those plants," Ms. Harris said, setting her jaw. "It's not over until the fat lady sings."
If the fat lady isn't singing yet, she has drawn a deep breath. Early next month, New York City will start bulldozing 27 gardens in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, in central Harlem and in the Bronx to make way for low- and moderate-income housing. Green Thumb, the city office that has leased land to gardeners since 1978, is expected to close about 300 of its 750 gardens over the next few years as the city develops the land or sells it to the highest bidder.
And in neighborhoods like Mount Hope, in the South Bronx, with only 0.2 acres of parkland to every 1,000 residents, or the Lower East Side, with 0.7 acres for 1,000 residents, more and more people are asking the obvious question: Why can't much-needed housing and community gardens coexist?
City officials say there are no other suitable sites to build housing. But the Department of Citywide Administrative Services has begun to release about 1,000 vacant lots for the approval process that leads to the auction block.
"We've been directed to either develop those lots or give them back to D.C.A.S." for sale, said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, who formerly headed the Housing Preservation and Development Department. "These properties should go for some useful purpose, rather than lying fallow."
The city's drive to put this land back on the tax rolls will free many parcels in the same neighborhoods where community gardens are slated for clearing. The imminent sale of vacant land has prompted city gardeners, green-space advocates and community members to mobilize.
Last month, about 200 gardeners, members of the new New York City Coalition for the Preservation of Gardens, rallied at City Hall Park to demand a moratorium on all garden closings. Accompanied by 12-foot puppets that towered over toddlers clasping stalks of celery in their strollers, they delivered gifts of vegetables and flowers and hundreds of letters from their supporters to Fran Reiter, who was then the Deputy Mayor for economic development and planning, and other city officials.
The coalition offered to help the City Planning Department inventory all gardens and to offer solutions for preserving the best of them. It also asked the city to acknowledge the value of these gardens -- former dumping grounds and drug dens that now produce vegetables and flowers while providing safe havens for the elderly and children and offering free recreation and community services. Thus far, the city has not responded to any of these demands.
It has, however, extended the lives of about half the 27 gardens slated for demolition this spring, until July 1 or October. But the essential heartbreak is the same: the gardens will be destroyed.
I T was gardeners who first took over these wastelands left in the wake of the red-lining, arson and failed urban-renewal projects of the 1960's, pulling out garbage and junked cars and chasing off drug dealers.
In 1978, Green Thumb began issuing yearly leases to the feisty squatters who were cleaning up their neighborhoods. "We did not have any permits," said Tom Fox, one of the original members of the Green Guerillas, who soon after also started the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition. "We cut fences open with wire cutters, and took sledgehammers to sidewalks to plant trees. It was a reaction to government apathy."
In the 80's, the open space coalition inventoried all the community gardens in the city and assessed the services they provided.
"We found 446 gardens on 121 acres with over 11,000 people involved," Mr. Fox said. "The average price of constructing a city park at the time was $50 a square foot. The cost of a community garden was $5 a square foot, and maintenance was sweat equity."
Creating these little oases for next to nothing, Mr. Fox said, helped people understand that they could change their fate.
In 1994, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration ordered a survey of the city's vast holdings of 11,000 lots to earmark them for uses from garages for the Sanitation Department to housing. Housing, Preservation and Development chose about 3,000 lots suitable for housing -- and about 300 of these now hold Green Thumb leases.
Only five gardens have been granted permanent status under the Parks and Recreation Department; a handful of others will probably be protected. About 30 others have 10-year leases. Three other community gardens have managed, through private funds, to buy their land from the city. The city says there will be very few new leases granted.
Ms. Barrios-Paoli, now the Human Resources Administrator, thinks leases should be issued to only sites that can be made permanent from the outset. "This temporary thing is a heartbreak for everyone," she said. "People get attached to these gardens, and then it breaks their heart."
The Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit group that works to protect green space, has joined with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Green Guerillas and the Parks Council to set criteria for permanent status, like access to the community, productivity and public programs.
The trust has also set up a blue-ribbon committee of donors like the Louis and Anne Abrons Foundation and the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, which funnel $500,000 every year into New York's community gardens. This committee is using its clout to help greening groups gain access to city officials and developers.
"Our big focus is how green space can be saved and made permanent with some concrete benefits to the city," said Andy Stone, the director of the trust's New York chapter. A good community garden raises property values as Central Park turns adjacent real estate to gold, he continued, adding:. "We're playing with ways to encourage developers to support city gardens, like zoning changes that would allow developers to contribute to open space in exchange for height and bulk. If the city will make some policy decisions, we will commit more money to a garden- and park-preservation program."
In central Harlem, home of the Garden of Love, one developer, echoing the experiences of many, said he was surprised by how haphazard site selection could be. Desmond Emmanuel said he was never told by the city that lots offered for development have gardens on them. The Housing Department lists them as vacant.
Mr. Emmanuel, the president of Santa Fe Construction, which has an office at 225 Park Avenue South, won the contract to develop two- to three-family houses on empty lots between 118th and 128th Streets. The Housing Department, he explained, issues a request for a proposal. "They ask you to submit choices in terms of preference," he said. "But nothing they give you tells you if there are gardens there. It's just blocks and lot numbers." He added that he would consider alternative sites if they were comparable in size and viability.
"We're not tied to any site," he said.
Three community gardens have been told to evacuate for his development, but he says he has not decided which sites to build on.
"We don't have a design yet. We haven't hired an architect. I don't have any idea what they'll cost," Mr. Emmanuel said.
Community gardeners in Harlem and elsewhere in the city say they never had a chance to lobby for their gardens.
When Ms. Harris heard that the Garden of Love might go up for sale, she said that Green Thumb's director, Jane Weissman, "told us that there were four gardens in Harlem she would fight for, and ours was one," but later, Ms. Harris said, "she said there was nothing she could do."
News of the March 31 deadline to vacate galvanized the community. One teacher called the press. Children wrote letters to the Mayor. Ms. Harris sent packets of before and after pictures of the Garden of Love to politicians and city officials.
And last week, she got on the phone and didn't stop calling until she reached someone at the Housing Department. "Literally 15 minutes later, Green Thumb called and said, 'We're going to extend your lease until June 30.' "
It was Ms. Harris's bulldog tenacity that brought the temporary stay of execution for about half the 27 gardens slated for bulldozing this year.
ONE city leader has suggested an obvious way to avoid the strife that results from pitting the need for housing against green space. "What the city needs is to treat all vacant city-owned land as a resource and work with community boards and local officials and garden groups to see what makes sense," said Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. In theory, community boards and borough presidents are given the chance to recommend that specific vacant lots be reserved for open space, gardens, housing or commercial use.
Ms. Reiter, who is now running the Mayor's re-election campaign, said that when the city has an opportunity to build housing, it goes to the community board and asks if the board wants to save any gardens. "And they'll say: 'We want the housing, but these three gardens are most important.' And we'll work it out." Sometimes, she added, "you can't work it out, and the ultimate decision lies with H.P.D."
Ned Ames, a trustee for the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, which pours $850,000 yearly into the urban environment, credits gardeners with safeguarding sites when the city abandoned them years ago.
"Then the economics of the situation changed, and it's lucrative to build," he said, "so the city does a flipflop and goes in and begins to sell them off with about the same sensibility it displayed when it abandoned them in the first place -- which is to say, none."
The Brooklyn Bears, who have gardened a triangle of land between Flatbush Avenue and Pacific Street for more than 10 years, learned that a P. C. Richards was going up on the site only days before a tractor crashed through their fence. They stood outside the garden in the dead of winter, gathered 4,000 signatures and lobbied Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn.
They won an agreement from the developer, Bruce Ratner, to reduce his retail space by 5,000 square feet, saving that much land for a garden. But it is a pyrrhic victory: the gardeners have to remove 5,000 bulbs, rare shrubs and perennials, and abandon a grove of 30-foot white birch trees because the site must first be excavated.

How much is the environment worth? A step toward answers.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HOW much, in dollars and cents, is the environment really worth?
No, this isn't a column about some bean counter who has found a clever way to put a price tag on sea otters or redwoods. Nor, for that matter, is it a tree-hugger's essay on the ineffable value of spaceship earth. Rather, it's about the pioneering efforts of some practical ecologists who are eager to make common cause with economists to create self-sustaining markets for "environmental capital." 
 The idea, explains Gretchen Daily, a biologist at Stanford University and the editor of "Nature's Services" (Island Press), is "to assess what we know about the tangible value of environmental resources" like watersheds and pollinating insect species. That, she argues, should set the stage for creating revenue-producing institutions -- public or private -- that make it profitable to invest in environmental resources, much the way one invests in physical infrastructure.
Ask your typical environmental activist how much a first-growth forest should sell for and you're asking for a fight. After all, there's much more to a stand of ancient trees than their value for recreation and lumber.
But the reflexive answer, that first-growth forests (or endangered species or pristine air over the Grand Canyon) have value beyond measure, is no answer at all. "Whether we know it or not," Ms. Daily argues, "we set implicit values" by choosing to preserve some portions of the environment and letting others go by neglect or economic development. So Ms. Daily, who has hugged a tree or two in her day, favors a less confrontational strategy.
The authors of "Nature's Services," which was largely underwritten by the Packard and W. Alton Jones Foundations and the Pew Charitable Trusts, lay out the basics of how big ecological systems protect everyday human activities and, in particular, how relatively small changes can cause devastating losses. "There are big-time non-linearities here," confirms Donald Kennedy, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a contributor to the book.
But the nitty-gritty of "Nature's Services" consists of a dozen overview essays on the tangible value of services from various sorts of environmental capital. Gary Nabham of the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum and Stephen Buchmann of the Department of Agriculture survey research on insect pollination, finding that the substitution of domesticated pollinators for wild pollinators would reduce the value of 62 crops in America by $1.6 billion annually. Katherine Ewel of the United States Forest Service found that specially constructed wetlands -- in plain-speak, swamps -- can treat waste from small towns at one-third to half the cost of steel and concrete. Norman Myers, a British researcher, documents the multibillion-dollar insurance value of preserving wild feed grains that offer resistance to plant diseases
More often than not, Ms. Daily concludes, "modern technology is an expensive substitute" for environmental systems that have evolved over very long periods. Hence, she argues, it usually pays to protect (or enhance) natural systems, even if one ignores their intangible benefits.
In some cases, this knowledge alone should be enough to transform world-weary politicians into environmentalists. Graciela Chichilnisky and Geoffrey Heal, economists at Columbia University's Program on Information and Resources, estimate that New York City's investment of some $660 million in development rights in the Catskills watershed will spare the city the $4 billion cost of building and operating new water purification plants over the next decade.
Environmental capital for drinking water sits on the easy end of the spectrum. Governments are already comfortable with the idea of investing in clean water and covering the costs by charging by the gallon. What about the tougher cases, like insect pollination, where everybody benefits and there is no customary way of recouping outlays?
Ms. Chichilnisky and Mr. Heal would take the general approach a step further, selectively "privatizing the biosphere" by writing contracts with private corporations to invest in conservation and sell the services. Some obvious candidates: flood control, eco-tourism, marine fisheries, carbon sequestration in trees and plant and insect species diversity to assist agriculture and pharmaceutical synthesis. "If Enron can compete with the old regulated utilities in energy sales," Mr. Heal asks, "why couldn't they sell watershed services?"
Hard-line environmentalists are right in the sense that markets can't be expected to price intangible environmental services -- wilderness preservation, species survival -- according to society's long-term values. On the other hand, the authors of "Nature's Services" argue, the best need not be the enemy of the good. And privatization may be an answer where tangible environmental services complement the intangible.
"Why not pick the low-hanging fruit first?" Ms. Daily asks.

The Big Deal of The Day

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There's a "Grand Bargain" just waiting to be struck that could finally reshape America's foreign-policy apparatus, pay off the U.S.'s overdue bills to the U.N. and pave the way for Senate ratification of a global treaty that will ban chemical weapons. We're talking about a big, big deal, and it's just sitting there, ready to be had. All it needs is for three leaders to show leadership: Commander in Chief Bill Clinton, Curmudgeon in Chief Jesse Helms and Republican in Chief Trent (Don't-Ask-Me-To-Do-Anything-Too-Hard) Lott.
The ingredients for the Grand Bargain are this: Clinton wants to get the Chemical Weapons Convention, already ratified by 65 countries, passed by the Senate, and he wants to get his foreign-policy budget increased to pay overdue debts to the U.N. and World Bank and to upgrade the State Department so U.S. ambassadors don't have to burn furniture for heat. But to do both he needs Jesse Helms, a.k.a. "Dr. No," a.k.a. chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Helms is holding up a ratification vote on the chemical treaty, because he doesn't trust arms control and because he wants to use the treaty as a bargaining chip in his campaign to shrink the U.S. foreign-policy establishment. Helms wants to eliminate the Agency for International Development (AID), the U.S. Information Agency (U.S.I.A.) and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and fold their functions into the State Department. 
 So here's the deal: Clinton should give Helms what he wants on reorganizing the State Department. Jesse may be a Neanderthal, but on this one he's right, even if it's for the wrong reasons. AID was designed in the cold war to bribe countries to join the Western camp. It has since evolved into an agency that supports sustainable development and democracy around the world. Those are worthy functions -- so worthy in fact they should be fully integrated into the State Department. A Secretary of State can't do peacemaking in Bosnia or Haiti without having AID resources directly at his or her disposal. As for ACDA, the Secretary of State already dominates arms control negotiations, and folding ACDA into State would only enhance the Secretary's ability to deal with the most important arms control issue of the day -- stopping missile proliferation. Regarding the U.S.I.A., it does valuable polling abroad, radio broadcasting and running of U.S. libraries -- so valuable they should all be integrated into the State Department's public diplomacy.
In addition to giving in to Helms on reorganization, so he can go back to North Carolina and boast, "Honey, I shrunk the State Department," Clinton will have to address (if he wants the votes) any legitimate Republican reservations on the chemical weapons treaty that are not designed to kill the treaty outright. A special committee set up by Lott and Senator Joe Biden has worked through the 30 reservations that Helms has raised and reached compromise solutions for 21 of them. The nine others are treaty killers. Clinton aides believe that given the 21 compromises, they could easily get a majority for the treaty -- including many Republicans -- provided Helms lets it come to a vote by April 29, the deadline for ratification.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went to North Carolina Tuesday and let Helms know that she is open-minded about State Department reorganization. And, in their bizarre Beauty and the Beast relationship, Helms softly growled that if Ms. Albright remains flexible, and if Clinton keeps negotiating on his reservations about the chemical treaty, he might be ready to deal himself.
To close the deal, the President has to confirm to Helms that reorganization will happen, provided Helms lets the amended chemical treaty come to a vote and agrees to finance the U.N. and upgrade the State Department. My fear, though, is that Helms will try to pocket all these concessions and still kill the chemical treaty. In that case, Lott has to step in and bring the treaty to a floor vote on his own.
Lott dreads such a confrontation. He fears that if he overrules Helms he'll be discredited with the Republican right. Tough. If Clinton lives up to his side of the bargain, Lott has all the political cover he needs. If he still won't roll Helms, then we'll know that Lott has surrendered Republican foreign policy to the fringe right and is majority leader for domestic policy only. Where's Bob Dole when you need him?

HEADLINE: Europeans Shut the Door on Turkey's Membership in Union

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 26

 BODY:
Turkey's campaign to join the European Union within the next few years was dealt what appeared to be a fatal blow today when Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany asserted here that Turkey was far from the standard expected of new members.
"It is clear that Turkey will not become a member of the European Union in the foreseeable future," Mr. Kinkel said at a news conference after meeting here with Turkish leaders. 
 He said Turkey did not qualify because of its record on "human rights, the Kurdish question, relations with Greece and of course very clear economic questions."
In recent months senior Turkish leaders declared that early membership in the European Union was the country's principal foreign policy goal.
From the moment the Turkish campaign began in earnest last year, European leaders sought to signal Turkey that it was setting its sights too high. But Turkish negotiators continued to press their case, suggesting that Western prejudice against Muslims was a hidden reason behind the European reluctance.
The campaign appears to have backfired. European leaders evidently decided that since Turkey was pressing so hard for a definitive answer to its application, they should respond with a clear no.
Their rejection was first expressed publicly two weeks ago at a meeting in Brussels of senior European leaders from center-right political parties.
Turkish diplomats sought to play down the results of the Brussels meeting by pointing out that it did not officially reflect the views of the European Union or any member government. But the statement today by Mr. Kinkel was an official declaration by one of the Union's most important member states.
While rejecting Turkish hopes for quick membership in the European Union, Mr. Kinkel assured his hosts that Turkey "belongs to Europe" and is regarded as "an important country with great responsibilities." Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller of Turkey seized on those assurances to try to extract something positive from a strikingly negative message.
"We are on the main track to Europe, not on some outside track," Mrs. Ciller asserted.
Supporters of Turkish membership have warned that a clear rejection like the one that Mr. Kinkel delivered today would strengthen anti-Western factions here, some of which are influential in the Islamist-led Government of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
Mr. Erbakan has publicly supported his country's drive for membership, but he has appeared more enthusiastic about improving relations with Libya, Iran and other Muslim countries.
Perhaps the strongest supporter of Turkey's bid to join the European Union has been the United States, which views Turkey as a vital pillar of European and Middle Eastern security. Nicholas Burns, the chief State Department spokesman, recently said Turkey's future "ought to be grounded in Europe."
"We respectfully submit to our European friends," Mr. Burns said, "that they must strategically think of Turkey as a European country, and not send negative signals to Turkey."
These statements were warmly welcomed in Turkey, but some Europeans found them irritating.
"Whenever the European Union makes a decision favorable to Turkey, the Turks thank the United States," said a German diplomat who was part of Mr. Kinkel's entourage today. "When things go badly for them, they blame us. Frankly we are getting a bit tired of this."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Tells Russians That Bending on the NATO Issue Paid Off

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 26

 BODY:
Answering critics who accuse him of capitulating to the West on NATO expansion, President Boris N. Yeltsin today defended his conciliatory stance at his summit meeting in Helsinki last week with President Clinton.
"Of course, we could have furrowed our brows and pounded the table with our shoes as happened during the cold war years," Mr. Yeltsin said in a radio address broadcast today. "But what would that have achieved? Another round of irreconcilable enmity, a new isolation for Russia." 
 Mr. Yeltsin, who knew at the outset that he would not change Mr. Clinton's mind about expanding NATO eastward, did his best to secure Russia its own partnership agreement with the Western alliance. He told his listeners he had scaled back some of the more dangerous aspects of NATO expansion and had won important concessions on strategic nuclear weapons agreements and economic issues.
But he also boasted of accomplishments that are likely to be disputed in Washington -- let alone Moscow. He said he had won concessions on antiballistic missile defenses. American officials say it was mainly Mr. Yeltsin who gave ground. The Russian President said that Mr. Clinton "promised me that at the next G-7 meeting, Russia will become a full-fledged member of that club." Mr. Yeltsin asserted proudly: "The G-7 will become the G-8."
Russia's ailing economy does not yet meet the requirements for membership. At the summit meeting, Mr. Clinton did say the Group of Seven industrial nations would be renamed G-8, but he hedged on how fully Russia would be allowed to participate, saying he had pledged to "substantially increase Russia's role at our annual meeting."
Today was the first time Mr. Yeltsin publicly discussed the summit meeting since he held a joint news conference with Mr. Clinton in Helsinki last Friday. Even before he got home, his nationalist and Communist opposition denounced his performance. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party, called the agreements "the Treaty of Versailles," and said Mr. Yeltsin had "betrayed Russia's national interest."
But despite acid criticism from opposition leaders, most Russians have paid little attention to the Helsinki meeting. Newspapers and television programs have been more interested in a Cabinet shake-up last week that gave reform-minded officials like Anatoly B. Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, 37, a popular former governor of Nizhni Novgorod, a second chance to jump-start Russia's stalled economic reform program.
And Mr. Yeltsin's Government has been preoccupied by a nationwide strike called for Thursday by trade unions and political opposition groups to protest the nonpayment of salaries and pensions to tens of millions of workers. Union leaders are predicting that up to 20 million people will take to the streets. Protest rallies are planned all over Russia.
Today, while Mr. Yeltsin was explaining his Helsinki negotiating strategy, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin held a news conference flanked by Mr. Chubais and Mr. Nemtsov to plead for time and patience.
"I want everyone to know that we see this problem, we feel and understand this problem," Mr. Chernomyrdin said. He pledged that the Government and private employers would pay $2 billion in back wages and pensions this month.
Mr. Chernomyrdin seemed worried about the day of protest. "We must not get carried away by emotion and provocation," he said. "We have been solving and will be solving these problems."

HEADLINE: U. Alexis Johnson Dies at 88; Led Arms Talks With Moscow

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
U. Alexis Johnson, a career diplomat and one of the shepherds of the first strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union, died on Monday in Raleigh, N.C., where he was living in retirement. He was 88.
Mr. Johnson spent more than four decades in the Foreign Service. He retired in 1977 as ambassador-at-large and chief United States delegate to the strategic arms negotiations with the Soviet Union in Geneva. 
 Previously, from 1969 to 1973, he served President Nixon as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, the third-ranking official in the State Department. He helped to direct arms control policy and all negotiations in that area and became an important advocate for the treaty curbing the strategic arms race when it came up for ratification in the Senate in 1979.
He was present at some of the most momentous negotiations of the era, headed embassies in Czechoslovakia, Thailand and Japan, and more than once narrowly escaped death in Saigon during the Vietnam War.
His memoirs, "The Right Hand of Power," published in 1984, gave insights into many State Department operations of the 1950's through the 70's.
Ural Alexis Johnson was born on Oct. 17, 1908, into a family of Swedish descent in Falun, Kan. His mother named him for the mountain range, of which she learned from a geography book. He dropped the first name upon entering the Foreign Service in 1935, when it was put to him that U. Alexis would resonate more euphoniously in the halls of Foggy Bottom.
He had a rural upbringing and schooling until 1923, when the family moved to Glendale, Calif. Attending high school there, he honed his skills in debate and helped edit the school newspaper and yearbook.
He graduated from Occidental College in 1931, majoring in economics and by then excelling in oratory. Deciding to pursue a diplomatic career, he went to study at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington.
Although he passed the Foreign Service examinations, the Depression brought a hiring freeze for diplomats, forcing him into a run of odd jobs. It was not until 1935 that he won an appointment to the Foreign Service with a posting to Tokyo as a language officer. Fluent in Japanese, his early duties also took him to Korea and China.
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 stranded him in Manchuria, and he remained in Japanese hands until neutral Portugal mediated an exchange of diplomatic personnel in mid-1942. He then was assigned to Rio de Janeiro, but toward war's end the State Department assigned him to train people for the military occupation of Japan.
He advanced in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs and attended the 1951 Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco. He was promoted to deputy assistant secretary later that year and returned to the Far East to help start the truce negotiations to end the Korean War, talks that went on for two years before an armistice was signed.
President Eisenhower wrote him a letter of commendation for his part in the negotiations and kept him in the deputy assistant's job when he named John Foster Dulles as his Secretary of State. He next became Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, a highly sensitive post then, and concurrently attended Geneva talks on the Far East and assisted in talks with China.
He served as Ambassador in Thailand from 1958 to 1961 and, following another stint in Washington, as deputy ambassador in South Vietnam. He was Ambassador to Japan from 1966 until his appointment as Under Secretary in 1969.
Mr. Johnson married Patricia Ann Tillman in 1932. After her death in 1981 he married Dorothy Fee, who died in 1994. He is survived by two daughters, Judith A. Zerbe of Cary, N.C., and Jennifer E. Bishop of Santa Monica, Calif.; two sons, Stephen T. of Arlington, Va., and Dr. William T. K. Johnson of La Canada, Calif.; a sister, Rella Warner of Washington; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Durables Post Surprise Gain; 2d Big Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
In a show of unexpected strength, orders for big-ticket factory goods jumped sharply again in February, suggesting that the economy was gaining momentum as it began its seventh year of expansion.
The latest figure, showing an increase of 1.5 percent, lent after-the-fact support to the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates to avert what the central bank called an increased risk of "inflationary imbalances." The Commerce Department said the Federal Reserve acted without knowledge of its data on durable goods, a closely watched indicator of future economic activity. 
 Daniel Friel, an economist at Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C., said that today's results should make Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman and its dominant policy maker, "feel warm and fuzzy about what he did" in lifting the rate for overnight money in the banking system by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent. The increase, widely anticipated after repeated warnings by Mr. Greenspan, was the first in more than two years.
Although the figures for durable goods -- a category that includes everything intended to last at least three years -- from microwave ovens to antiaircraft guns -- is subject to big monthly swings, analysts said there was little in the data this time that could be considered quirky.
In fact, the hefty 1.5 percent advance was registered despite a big decline in orders for civilian aircraft, a component that was a major contributor to a 4.1 percent surge in January orders.
"The strong back-to-back gains signal a likely acceleration in factory activity in the second quarter," Joseph Liro and Anita Ash of CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York advised clients.
Even more "troubling," they added, was that unfilled orders for durables climbed 1.1 percent for the second consecutive month and for the ninth month out of 10.
"As order books bulge, suppliers fall further and further behind on deliveries, which potentially could cause inflationary bottlenecks further along the production process," they said.
The department's report also showed that factories posted a 1.4 percent increase in shipments of durable goods last month, the second straight sizable increase; they dropped in December.
Although analysts had expected orders to be flat last month, the stronger orders led to only a modest rise in market interest rates. The 30-year Treasury bond's yield rose to 6.98 percent, from 6.96 percent on Tuesday.
Much of the orders increase was in electronic and other electrical equipment, a category that does not include computers. A 7.4 percent gain came on top of a blistering 17.9 percent January increase that offset a December decline, the report showed.
Computers and other industrial machinery orders climbed 2.2 percent while orders for transportation equipment and primary metals fell 3.6 percent and five-tenths of 1 percent, respectively. All types of transportation equipment other than railroad items eased, the department said.
Analysts said they were particularly impressed that orders for nonmilitary capital goods -- a gauge of business investment in new equipment -- jumped 3.7 percent, nearly matching a 4.5 percent January burst.
Moreover, when aircraft sales are excluded, those orders soared 6.9 percent, the highest in two years, a performance that Joel L. Naroff and Veronika White, economists for First Union Corporation in Philadelphia, called "astonishing."
"The February orders data do not contain any signs of an impending slowdown in the manufacturing sector," they declared. "Indeed, manufacturing activity is likely to rise in the second quarter as firms ramp up production to meet rising demand. The Fed's main concern at this point is that inflationary bottlenecks do not develop."
In all, orders for durables last month were a record $178.3 billion, with January and February combined running at a pace 7.1 percent ahead of that for the first two months of 1996.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Lower but Hits A 5-Week High Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached a five-week high yesterday against the Japanese yen but ended mostly weaker against other currencies. It was indirectly hurt by broad weakness in the yen, which had the effect of strengthening a number of other currencies.
In addition, an upward revision in German economic data contributed to the easing in the dollar, stopping the advance Tuesday that resulted from the Federal Reserve's raising of a short-term interest rate. 
 Traders were also taking profits from recent dollar gains, and some were unwilling to take speculative positions before the long Easter weekend.
In trading yesterday, the dollar reached an intraday high of 124.47 yen, the strongest since Feb. 19, before settling in New York at 124.12 yen, up from 123.75 late Tuesday. The dollar fetched 1.6898 German marks, down from 1.6914. The British pound rose to $1.6287 from $1.6184, its strongest level in more than three weeks.
Despite the dollar's easing, traders said the underlying conditions favoring further gains remained strong, particularly the growing disparity between interest rates in the United States and those in Japan and Germany. Higher American rates make assets denominated in dollars attractive.
"It makes too much sense to own dollars, both fundamentally and technically," said Robert Gilmartin, a currency trader at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
The yen weakened against most currencies after the Japanese central bank governor, Yasuo Matsushita, strongly hinted that the bank would maintain its record low interest rates for now. Putting further pressure on the yen, there was speculation that big Japanese investors unhappy with the low rates of return in Japan were buying sterling, dollars and marks to expand their holdings abroad with the new Japanese fiscal year beginning on April 1.
The mark derived some strength from data showing that German industrial output fell less in January than originally reported. This suggested that the extent of weakness in Germany's economy might perhaps be overstated. The German central bank said output declined 1.5 percent in December, compared with 1.7 percent as first reported.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Recover Sharply; Coffee Up on Supply Concerns

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Gold prices rose in trading in New York yesterday following the announcement that the gold deposit at the Busang project in Indonesia may be smaller than originally estimated.
On other markets, coffee futures rose as concerns about this year's supplies heated up and tight roaster stockpiles of coffee fed buying. 
 Gold prices, which fell on Tuesday, rose after Bre-X Minerals of Calgary, Alberta, said that test samples from its Busang property in Kalimantan, the Indonesian half of Borneo island, might have been overstated.
While metal from the deposit would not reach the market for several years, Bre-X said earlier this year that the property contained at least 71 million ounces, which would have made it the most significant find in a century.
"This market was looking for an excuse to rally and the Bre-X news simply sent people scrambling," said Dinsa Mehta, senior chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan. "This was a plank to stage a short-covering rally and also an indicator that it's a dangerous thing to be on the short side in the $340's in gold."
Gold was also bolstered yesterday by sentiment that gold fell too sharply on Tuesday following the Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for April delivery rose $3.30, to $351.50 an ounce. June gold closed $3 an ounce higher at $353.50. May silver was little changed, closing up 0.045 cent at $5.165 an ounce.
At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for May delivery closed up 7.55 cents a pound at 186.85 cents.
"Stocks have only moved up marginally and producers are virtually sold out," said Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "People believe this market is happening again."
Coffee prices hit two-year highs earlier this month, doubling since early December as expected new- crop coffee shipments from Central America and Colombia were delayed by crop damage and labor strikes.
A steady pickup in shipments by producers in recent weeks had eased some supply worries. But lack of more selling of futures by coffee-producing nations has caused renewed speculative buying.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Moderate in House Offers Compromise Plan on the Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
A moderate Republican offered a compromise proposal today to balance the Federal budget and cut taxes, hoping to take advantage of tentative signals of flexibility issued last week by the White House and Congressional leaders.
The plan, set out by Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, is likely to receive attention mostly for its assertion that Congress and the Clinton Administration could cut taxes by at least $112 billion over five years through legislation separate from a balanced budget plan. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich said last week that Republicans might support such an approach. That statement infuriated the determined tax cutters on the Republican right wing, who believe that tax cuts must be bundled into a balanced budget agreement if they are to have any realistic chance of being enacted.
Mr. Castle has been at the forefront of a group of moderate Republicans who believe that the chances of balancing the budget are improved if the emotional and politically potent issue of tax cuts is taken temporarily off the table. Mr. Castle's office said 70 House Republicans, out of 227, had signed a letter to Mr. Gingrich from Mr. Castle and three of his colleagues supporting splitting taxes from the budget legislation. Administration officials have said President Clinton would also be willing to consider tax cuts separately from the budget.
Mr. Castle said his budget plan currently had little political viability, and he noted that he had not yet shown it to any fellow lawmakers.
But he said there was enough support among Republicans and Democrats alike for this approach that his proposal could be a starting point for a broader compromise that would give momentum to budget negotiations between the White House and the Congress. A group of conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs has already offered another compromise plan that has won some limited bipartisan support, although it does not include any tax cuts.
On the spending side of the equation, Mr. Castle's plan rests on several questionable assumptions, including a willingness by the White House to abandon its call for new spending on health programs. It projects a $24 billion budget surplus in 2002 without any tax increases or reductions and without changing the conservative economic assumptions demanded by Congressional Republicans.
After balancing the budget, Mr. Castle said, the two sides could then generate $112 billion to pay for tax cuts over five years. He said he assumed that Republicans would be willing to adopt $35 billion of the $77 billion in tax increases and extensions proposed by Mr. Clinton. And he said that balancing the budget would generate a $77 billion "fiscal dividend" in the form of lower interest rates and stronger economic growth that could go to pay for the tax cut.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expels a Belarus Diplomat, and Warns of Repression There

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The United States ordered the expulsion of a Belarus diplomat today in retaliation for what Washington called the "unwarranted and unjustified" ouster of an American diplomat monitoring an anti-Government march Sunday in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
Washington has recalled its Ambassador to Belarus, Kenneth Yalowitz, as it searches for ways to respond to the former Soviet republic's "accelerating slide toward authoritarianism," as a State Department official, John Dinger, called it today. But American officials say the United States, which has suspended its $40 million in annual aid to Belarus, has few effective levers to pull against President Aleksandr Lukashenko, a popular Soviet-style boss. 
 Mr. Lukashenko has resisted economic and political reform, has cracked down on the opposition with a series of arrests and has expelled the executive director of the Belarussian Soros Foundation, which supports independent media and trade unions.
He has also ordered an audit of the foundation and other nongovernmental organizations and clamped down on Russian journalists trying to cover events in Belarus.
"Why Lukashenko feels the need to poison relations with the United States just now we don't know, but he's doing it, and if he doesn't know he's doing it, he needs better advisers," a senior American official said. "The effort to intimidate embassies, muzzle the press and crack down on Soros and other private foundations is all of a piece. It's an effort to neutralize any possible organization outside Government control, and shows a man without the confidence to act democratically."
Even Russia has criticized Mr. Lukashenko, issuing a statement on Tuesday rebuking Belarus for hampering Russian journalists working there. "The very fact that Russian television channels have been denied the right to send information material from Minsk prompts deep concern in the Kremlin," said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, President Boris N. Yeltsin's spokesman. "We have the right to expect that the principles of freedom of information will be restored in full."
Mr. Lukashenko, a former head of a Soviet collective farm who was elected in 1994, "is taking Belarus in a direction antithetical not only to that of Europe but also to that of his own neighbors, the Poles, Lithuanians and the Russians themselves," the senior American official said.
The official played down the likelihood that anything will come of an agreement last April 2 on the economic and political reunification of Russia and Belarus, which was among the first republics to declare independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Lukashenko are supposed to sign a more concrete agreement on Wednesday. But any economic unification would require Belarus to make the kinds of economic and legislative reforms that Mr. Lukashenko refuses to contemplate.
The opposition in Minsk, which American officials regard as not very effective, is planning another large protest march like the one on Sunday that the expelled American diplomat, First Secretary Serge Alexandrov, had been monitoring. Mr. Alexandrov, who is of Belarussian origin, left on Monday.
Today Washington expelled Vladimir Gramyka, First Secretary of the Belarussian Embassy, giving him 24 hours to leave.
The executive director of the Belarussian Soros Foundation, Peter Byrne, who was expelled last week, said here that Mr. Lukashenko had cut off private groups from sources of money abroad, while investigating Belarussian businesses that advertised in independent papers.

HEADLINE: Giving Away the Airwaves

BYLINE: By Bob Dole; Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader, was the 1996 Republican Presidential candidate.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission are about to make the already difficult job of balancing the Federal budget harder than it has to be. In just a few days, the F.C.C. is going to give away the first broadcast licenses for digital television to broadcasters for absolutely nothing. If the Government sold this new spectrum, it could be worth $12 billion to $70 billion.
The network news programs are proud of their commendable watchdog segments like "The Fleecing of America," "Reality Check" and "Your Money." But the networks and many newspapers that own TV stations have largely ignored their own fleecing of the taxpayers. 
 The broadcasters insist that they need these airwaves -- on which they will duplicate their programming in digital -- to make the transition to high-definition television. O.K., but why not pay a fair price?
Since 1993, wireless phone and direct-broadcast satellite companies have paid for airwaves to upgrade or offer new services. Just last year, the Government auctioned off licenses for lower-quality spectrum, raising a whopping $20 billion. We don't give away trees to newspaper publishers. Why should we give away more airwaves to broadcasters? The airwaves are a natural resource. They do not belong to the broadcasters, phone companies or any other industry. They belong to the American people.
The stakes in this debate are high. The national debt now exceeds $5 trillion. This year, the budget deficit is expected to top $112 billion. Balancing the budget with the help of proceeds from the new digital spectrum could lower interest rates by two percentage points, reducing costs for home mortgages and student loans.
While the needs of less economically viable stations and those in rural areas should be considered, broadcasters should be expected to pay for additional spectrum. After all, broadcasters have a long history of paying top dollar for existing channels. And the new technology will allow them to cram other potentially lucrative services -- additional TV stations and CD-quality radio broadcasts -- into the same amount of spectrum that currently accommodates one TV signal.
The Clinton Administration and a majority of the F.C.C. commissioners insist that the transition to the digital spectrum will allow the Government to sell the old analog spectrum by 2002. Indeed, the projected money from this sale is used by President Clinton to claim a balanced budget by then. But few believe Mr. Clinton's budget is really balanced, and even fewer believe the transition to high-definition TV can be completed according to his timetable.
As it is, this mandated transition to digital television is going to cost taxpayers plenty. Consumers will find their current televisions rendered obsolete by digital broadcasts. Replacing all 222 million TV sets in the country could cost upward of $200 billion. That's pretty serious sticker shock for "free" broadcast television.
Before leaving the Senate, I secured a written commitment from the Congressional leadership and all five F.C.C. commissioners to prohibit the distribution of digital-TV licenses until Congress passed legislation concerning the use of these airwaves. Strangely, no new laws have been passed, and the resolve of members of Congress has melted (with the exception of Senator John McCain). And despite their commitment, F.C.C. commissioners plan to proceed with the giveaway.
Given recent developments, what's the rush? Broadcasters are scrambling to meet the Government's timetable. President Clinton belatedly proposed that in exchange for the licenses, broadcasters provide free time to political candidates. Still others propose trading licenses for a stronger TV-ratings system. At the very least, the next step should be to let the free market work and delay the giveaway until politicians and regulators get their priorities straight.
Taxpayers should demand better from the President, Congress, the F.C.C. and the broadcasters. After all, we're talking about billions of dollars -- and that's your money.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Whim

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith, an economist, teaches at the Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Why did Alan Greenspan raise interest rates? Because he could. Because two of the more independent members of the Federal Reserve Board, the pro-growth conservative Lawrence Lindsey and the moderate Janet Yellen, have departed. Because he has been under pressure from banks and bond traders for two years; why not throw them a bone? Because he knows the Clinton Administration will say and do nothing in protest. And, especially, because he can get away with it.
Here is the Fed's official explanation: "The action was taken in light of persisting strength in demand, which is progressively increasing the risk of inflationary imbalances developing in the economy that would eventually undermine the long expansion." These words had been carefully foreshadowed in Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony four days before, which is why the action was not a surprise. 
 But in that testimony Mr. Greenspan offered no serious evidence of increasing inflation. Instead, he spoke of the low and "benign" inflation of the past year. And he said that "competitive pressures here and abroad should continue to act as a restraint on inflation in the months ahead."
The only risks Mr. Greenspan sees are these: First, a continued tight labor market. Second, the rising minimum wage later this year. And third, the possibility that "larger increases in fringe benefits could put upward pressure on overall compensation."
The gentleman could not have been more clear. He is not concerned about inflation. He is concerned about the possibility, remote and uncertain though it is, that the American worker might start to demand, and receive, a slightly bigger share of the economic growth that has occurred over the past seven years.
Repressing wages is the essential thing, and the way to do that is to slow economic growth, raise unemployment and make sure that the job insecurity that Mr. Greenspan explicitly credits for suppressing wage growth does not diminish or disappear.
But repressing wages is not the only thing. The Fed is also the tax collector for the commercial banks, which instantly raised their prime rate and thus their revenue from every adjustable-rate loan they make. (Higher rates paid out for savings will be very slow to follow.)
Mr. Greenspan has also hinted that he wants to deflate the stock market. Why? Not to protect middle-class families from a bursting bubble, but to scare them out of stocks and back to the banks and their measly money market funds!
Finally, the market churning that accompanies speculation over the Fed's next rate move is good for bond traders, who have pined and whined through the quiet times of the past two years.
"L'etat, c'est moi" could well have been uttered by Alan Greenspan this week.
