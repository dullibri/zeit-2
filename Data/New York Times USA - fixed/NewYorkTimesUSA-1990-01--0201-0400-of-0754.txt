HEADLINE: Futures Buying Lifts Stocks; Dow Up 21.12

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose moderately yesterday, spurred by futures-related buying about an hour before the close. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.12 points, to 2,794.37.
Yesterday's advance was not a broad one, as gains on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbering declines, 805 to 717. At the same time, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.59 points, to 353.79, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index tacked on 0.69, to 195.33. 
Volume on the Big Board was relatively slow, with only 140.1 million shares changing hands, compared with 158.5 million on Friday.
 
Cutting of Prime Rate
Traders said the decision of some major banks to cut the prime rate to 10 percent from 10 1/2 had little initial impact on the market. Investors continued to be concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, they said, a factor that kept yesterday's advance in check.
''Prime rate cuts could be what's needed to spur a test of recent highs,'' said Harry Laubscher, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day. ''But even breaking into new high territory won't help much without the aid of a discount rate cut.'' He said that with commodity prices about to rise in 1990, the Federal Reserve Board might be reluctant to lower interest rates anytime soon.
''The first five trading days in January now show a gain, implying a positive performance for the month,'' Mr. Laubscher added. ''As January goes, oftentimes so goes the year. But 1990 could be different.''
Philip Morris was the most active stock, falling 1 1/8, to 41, on a volume of 3.3 million shares. Tobacco stocks fell on the belief that a Federal appeals court, in throwing out a damage award against the Liggett Group on Friday, had made it easier for smokers and their survivors to sue tobacco companies.
 
Decline in Taobacco Group
Attorneys for the plaintiff said that he appeals court ruling favored future plaintiffs because it revived certain standards of liability that had been barred from this and other tabacco cases.
Elsewhere in the tobacco group, Loew's fell 2 7/8, to 120 7/8, and American Brands declined 1 5/8, to 68 3/4.
Pan Am was the second-busiest Big Board stock, rising 1/4, to 3 1/2, on a turnover of 3.1 million shares. Business Week reported in its Jan. 15 issue, that the AMR Corporation, which owns American Airlines, was interested in buying some or all of Pan Am's operations. The article also said there was speculation that Trans World Airlines Inc.'s chairman, Carl C. Icahn, viewed Pan Am as a possible merger candidate for T.W.A.
The Manhattan National Corporation was the biggest percentage leader, rising a point, to 6 5/8. The company said it would begin a tender offer for up to two million shares, or about 24 percent, of its common stock outstanding, at a price of $5.50 to $7.50 a share.
Active blue chips included General Electric, up 3/8, to 66; A.T.&T., up 1 1/8, to 45 3/4; I.B.M., up 5/8, to 100 3/8; Chase Manhattan, down 1, to 33 5/8, and Exxon, up 3/4, to 49 1/2.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.83, to 381.62. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index added 0.49, to 458.71.

HEADLINE: Engineer Leads Morrison Knudsen Unit

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Walter C. Bell, an engineer who has overseen construction projects in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, has been named president and chief executive of international activities of the Morrison Knudsen Corporation. He has been given the mission of directing the giant construction and engineering company's aggressive re-entry into the worldwide market. 
Mr. Bell serves as president and chief operating officer of the international subsidiary, the Morrison-Knudsen International Company. He replaces Richard E. Kohne, who retired as the subsidiary's chief executive after 34 years with the company.
The Boise, Idaho, parent company operated abroad for more than 80 years, but, said Mr. Bell, who is 55, ''We retracted in the 1980's because of economic conditions internationally and differences in the dollar that made U.S. companies less competitive.''
Since 1988, however, when William K. Agee took over the $2 billion company, a new emphasis was put on overseas operations. Within the last year, the international subsidiary opened offices in Tokyo, Manila, London and Warsaw, and now has a $400 million backlog of international work.
Mr. Bell grew up in New York City, where several generations of his family had been involved in construction. He graduated in 1955 from the Polytech Institute of Brooklyn, then served 25 years with the Army Corps of Engineers and joined a Morrison Knudsen subsidiary in 1981.
He and his wife, Barbara, live in San Francisco. They have three grown children.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Declines Sharply As U.S. Rate Drop Continues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against key foreign currencies in active trading yesterday, skidding to a 20-month low against the strong West German mark amid continued concerns about declining United States interest rates.
Currency dealers said a cut in United States commercial banks' prime lending rate yesterday, to 10 percent from 10 1/2 percent, helped depress the dollar in foreign exchange trading. Traders said that the cut, which lowers borrowing costs for a number of businesses and consumers, reflected more liberal credit policies by the Federal Reserve since late 1989. 
Lower interest rates tend to depress the dollar because they make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners.
At the same time, interest rates have been holding steady overseas, particularly in West Germany, where the crumbling of the Berlin wall promises to spur economic growth, dealers said.
Strong interest in the mark pushed the dollar to its lowest level against that currency since late April 1988, according to Ronald H. Holzer, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
The dollar fell to 1.6685 marks, from 1.6895 marks late Friday.
''Continued purchase of marks favors a lower dollar scenario,'' Mr. Holzer said. German rates are holding firm, he said, while the Fed policy is to provide stable to easier credit.
Enthusiasm for the mark was also renewed by Friday's 3.68 percent devaluation of the Italian lira against the other currencies in the nine-member European Monetary System, dealers said.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar closed in New York at 144.15 yen, down from 144.50. Earlier, in Tokyo, where trading ended before Europe's business day began, the dollar closed at 144.52 Japanese yen, up from 144.15. It traded at 144.10 yen in London.
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.6530 in London from late Friday's $1.6375, and to $1.6535 in New York, up from $1.6350.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.5245 Swiss francs, down from 1.5445; 5.6965 French francs, down from 5.7777; 1,250.00 Italian lire, down from 1,276.25, and 1.16035 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16075.
Gold prices slipped after a mixed performance overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $403 a troy ounce, down $3.30 from Friday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $401.80 an ounce, off $4.45.
Gold rose in London but fell in Zurich on profit taking.
The late gold bid in London was $404.75 an ounce, up from $404.50 Friday. The late Zurich bid was $404.05 an ounce, down from $405.50.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $403.05 an ounce, up from $401.85 Friday.
Silver prices were also mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery closed at $5.244 a troy ounce, down from $5.318 Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.28 an ounce from $5.27.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cuts Funds to U.N. Food Agency Over P.L.O.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The United States has sharply cut its financial contribution to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization as a result of disputes over the agency's support for the Palestine Liberation Organization and its new budget.
Last week, the State Department told Edouard Saouma, Director General of the F.A.O., that the United States would pay only $18 million of its 1989 budget assessment of $61.4 million for the Rome-based agency. That is just enough to keep the United States from losing its vote in the food agency's 49-member governing Council. 
The Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, John R. Bolton, who is the Bush Administration official in charge of United Nations matters, wrote a letter to Dr. Saouma expressing concern about the agency's ''politicization'' and asking Dr. Saouma to ''minimize the chances that the F.A.O. will become futher politicized and endanger even more the support of all its members.''
He also asked Dr. Saouma ''to explore with the Government of Israel how the F.A.O. could most effectively contribute to a nonpolitical, technical study of the agricultural conditions on the West Bank and Gaza,'' which, he said, might lead to ''valid technical assistance programs for the Palestinians.''
In November, the food agency's governing General Conference overwhelmingly approved a resolution asking the agency, which is charged with promoting agricultural development in the third world, to study the farming needs of Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories.
The resolution also contained a clause mentioning in general terms ''the need for providing the Palestinian people with the assistance necessary for their economic development in close cooperation with the Palestine Liberation Organization.''
The Bush Administration called the clause an attempt to lend international legitimacy to the P.L.O.'s assertion that it represents a Palestinian state. Other countries asserted that it did not confer recognition on the P.L.O. The United States and Israel were the only agency members to vote against the resolution; 14 nations abstained.
In his letter to the Director General, Mr. Bolton also called the agency's $569 million budget for the years 1990-91 unrealistic. He said the new budget ''failed to win the support of members who will be expected to provide over half the resources required'' and that it also provided for a real increase of 3 percent over the previous level, which he said was unjustified.
The United States has a policy of maintaining ''zero real growth'' in spending by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.
Although the budget was approved by the General Conference, the United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Israel, New Zealand and the Netherlands voted against. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Poland and Switzerland abstained.
By paying the agency $18 million last week, the United States reduced the total it has withheld from $143 million to $125 million, and preserved its voting rights in the agency because its unpaid contributions now equal less than two years' assessments.
The Bush Administration and several Western countries tried unsuccessfully to block Dr. Saouma's reappointment for a third six year term in 1987, accusing him of turning the agency into a personal fiefdom.

HEADLINE: Wilder Holds to the Middle as Governorship Nears

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND

 BODY:
Virginia's Governor-elect, L. Douglas Wilder, who captured the historical and sociological imagination of the nation two months ago when he became the first black ever to be elected governor of any state, appears to be relying on the same political principle in setting up his new administration that he relied upon to run his successful election campaign: He is sticking to the middle of the road, avoiding extremes.
The 58-year-old Democrat, who will be sworn in Jan. 13, is off to a notably low-key start, promising no wholesale shakeups and choosing appointees from the state's political mainstream, including some women and blacks, almost all with solid experience in government and politics.
Facing a serious budget deficit because of a fall-off in the Virginia economy and steadily increasing demand for state services, he is searching for ways to rework and modify old programs rather than initiate bold new ones.
Mr. Wilder says he is fully aware that much of the nation, not just Virginia, is watching his moves and that expectation and speculation are factors he must deal with more than most governors, especially when it comes to his future in national politics. But he insists that he has no plan or inclination to turn the state on its political and governmental ear, as his November opponent, former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman, repeatedly warned he would do. 
 
Keeping on the Track
''It's not my nature,'' Mr. Wilder said in an interview. ''I won the governorship by avoiding extremes and by appealing to a cross section of the state, the mainstream, and I intend to keep on that track. I think there's a message in that for the Democratic Party as a whole, not just in Virginia.''
A typical appointment is that of Col. Robert L. Suthard, the Superintendent of State Police, to be Secretary of Public Safety. In many ways, Virginia's state troopers are the most visible protectors of law and order in a state whose voters have always responded to law-and-order themes. By choosing Colonel Suthard, a widely respected officer with more than 35 years of police experience, Mr. Wilder seemed to be sending a signal of continuity and reassurance.
In a similar manner, when the Governor-elect chose a Secretary of Finance for the Old Dominion, one of the most fiscally conservative states in the country, he reached for experience and continuity and came up with the state's Budget Director, Paul W. Timmreck.
Mr. Wilder has named four blacks to high-level positions in his administration thus far, all with previous government experience, and he has said he intends to increase minority appointments throughout the heavily white Virginia bureaucracy, though he has steadfastly avoided any commitment to quotas.
 
Mainstream Appointments
He chose James W. Dyke Jr., a prominent Richmond lawyer and a member of the State Board of Education, to be Secretary of Education, and Ruby G. Martin, another Richmond lawyer and former director of the Office of Civil Rights in the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, to be Secretary of Administration.
The two other blacks chosen are Eddie N. Moore Jr., the comptroller of the College of William and Mary and a former assistant comptroller in the Virginia Department of Accounts, who has been named State Treasurer, and Dorthula H. Powell, a lawyer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia and a former assistant state attorney general, to be Director of Personnel and Training.
In other appointments, as his chief of staff Mr. Wilder has chosen J. T. Shropshire, the clerk of the Virginia State Senate, where Mr. Wilder served for a decade and a half.
Friend and foe alike call Mr. Shropshire the ''Silver Fox,'' as much because of his artful political ways as his graying mane. He is at once a broad-gauge strategist and an incurable gossip, a back-slapper and an arm-twister, a man who can scheme a Republican foe's demise in the morning and then talk fishing with him in the afternoon.
 
''Off to a Very Good Start'
''The reading that I get around the state is that Doug is off to a very good start and that most people are very pleased with what he has done so far,'' said State Senator J. Granger Macfarlane of Roanoke, a close Wilder ally.
The traditional political honeymoon accorded many newly elected officials is probably a factor here. Still, the fact is that not just Democrats but also many Republicans have been hesitant to snipe at Mr. Wilder, although there has been some grousing that the pace of appointments is a bit slow. There will be 4,200 in all, 75 of them full-time jobs.
''He's picking people who know their jobs and who won't shake up things too much, and if it's going slow, that still makes for quiet times,'' said Steve Haner, director of the Republican Caucus in the Virginia General Assembly.
As Mr. Wilder prepares to take over the Governor's office in the porticoed old Capitol here, the hard economic reality is that he will be taking over a state that, while not bankrupt, is facing economic hard times after a long, leisurely stroll down Easy Street. By some calculations, there will be a revenue shortfall of close to $1 billion by 1992, about 5 percent of the state's annual budget.
Unlike Federal law, Virginia law mandates a balanced budget. Since Mr. Wilder opposes any tax increase and the General Assembly seems similarly inclined, he finds himself making plans to fine-tune and slash existing programs. Plans for offsetting inflation in old programs and plans for new programs in areas like education and human services have largely been abandoned.
''It's crunch time,'' the Governor-elect said. ''The easy times are over.''
Still, Mr. Wilder managed to find a bright side.
''All this means I must be innovative,'' he said. ''It's actually an opportunity, a chance to prove I can lead, to put into practice all I have learned over the past 20 years as a state senator and lieutenant governor. Just because I've been elected governor doesn't automatically mean I'm a success.''
Was that not the talk of a politician with an eye on higher office?
''I've got all I can handle here in Virginia,'' Mr. Wilder replied. ''I'm not thinking about anything else.'' Others are. Once in office, Mr. Wilder will increasingly be compared with black politicians elsewhere, especially the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
''It's a real opportunity for Doug Wilder to show that he can run a government, and run it from the mainstream, which is something Jackson has yet to try or do,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia who specializes in analyzing Virginia politics.
 
Relations With Legislature
''Success would likely have real appeal in the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Sabato said. ''And the budget crunch actually might help Wilder succeed, in a way, because it will provide him leverage for forcing priorities and make it a lot easier to say 'no' to all the people coming at him for something.''
Mr. Wilder's Democratic allies in the Virginia General Assembly would like to see him succeed, of course, with few exceptions. And since Democrats easily dominate both houses of the Assembly, they are in good position to help. But that said, no one expects the legislators to surrender the power of the purse to the new governor without a struggle.
Mr. Wilder, for his part, says that he seeks no fight with the General Assembly and that it is his political nature to avoid fights.
''But there's no getting around that the time has come when we have to take a hard economic look at things,'' he said. ''There's going to be some pain, but there's also got to be a consensus out there somewhere on all this. I'll work to find it. I always do.''

HEADLINE: User Fee to Expand Airports Gains Favor

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Aviation officials in government and industry are expressing growing enthusiasm over the idea of letting airports levy a departure fee on every passenger to help pay for expanding the nation's air transportation system.
Congress has for many years banned such a fee, or head tax. Airline passengers already pay an 8 percent Federal ticket tax, and the departure fee has been viewed as duplicative.
Some Bush Administration officials favor departure fees because they could provide millions of dollars for expanding airports without increasing Federal spending or raising Federal taxes. The linchpin of President Bush's economic policy is opposition to any new Federal taxes. 
Airport officials backing such a fee note that it would be set and collected at the local level, with all the money used for airport projects. The money raised could be used as a down payment to underwrite large borrowings for their expansion plans.
 
'The Time May Be Right'
''I think the time may be right for that,'' said Adm. James B. Busey, the retired naval officer who is head of the Federal Aviation Administration, when asked in an interview Monday if the law should be changed to permit an airport head tax.
The amount of any new fees would be set by airports, but they would probably be about $2 or $3 a passenger, which proposents say is not enough to be onerous to individual passengers but is enough to raise tens of millions of dollars annually at busy airports.
At a seminar on airport financing in Washington today, several aviation industry officials enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and even groups representing passengers seem amenable to the idea.
John J. Corbett, the counsel for the Airline Passengers of America, said that the idea would benefit passengers. They are, after all, the ones hurt by flight delays at crowded airports, he said.
While the aviation agency's most pressing task is to expand the capacity of the nation's air system, in the expectation that air traffic will continue to grow, its most vexing question is how to pay for the expansion.
 
Other Options to be Proposed
Admiral Busey said that the question of increasing fees paid by aviation consumers would be addressed in the Transportation Department's forthcoming national transportation policy paper, scheduled to be published in about a month. Other officials said that the paper, without endorsing a particular form of user fee, would offer a wide range of options for fees that could help pay for expanded spending on all forms of transportation, including highways, mass transit and aviation.
Federal money for aviation programs, including grants to individual airports, now comes primarily from a special trust fund financed largely by the Federal tax on tickets. The trust fund has a surplus of several billion dollars and takes in $3.5 billion annually. But the admiral said the fund will not cover all of the Federal Government's share of expanding airports and the air-controllers system.
And Congress has been reluctant to spend the surplus, which would increase the Federal deficit.
Admiral Busey said that the aviation agency's current plans for modernizing the radar sets, computers and radio networks of the nationwide air traffic control system, along with the costly expansion projects planned by many airports, would rapidly deplete the money now held for such purposes in the Federal aviation trust fund.
Admiral Busey said that the aviation agency must double the amount of money it spends each year on the air traffic control system, which is in the midst of a major modernization program. He estimated the five-year cost of this program at about $13 billion. $7.4 Billion Requested Industry officials say that there are about $7.4 billion of requests for airport grants already on file, while the agency's program of airport improvement grants pay out only about $1.5 billion a year.
Admiral Busey acknowledged that the Administration might, instead of letting airports charge head taxes to pay for their own local expansion projects, decide to raise the 8 percent Federal ticket tax as another way of financing the expansion of the nation's aviation system.
Either approach would require new legislation. Congressional aides said that key committees plan to hold hearings into the subject this year.
Whatever source of new money is chosen, the airlines and airports would be sure to insist upon legal guarantees that all the money actually is spent on aviation programs.
The industry has argued for years that the trust fund has been mismanaged as Congress has kept aviation spending down, using the trust fund's surplus to offset the Federal budget deficit.
 
Airlines Open to Fee
''The present system just plain isn't working,'' said Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association. ''It also has to be said that the costs of doing what needs to be done have reached a level at which, even if the trust fund were being fully spent, the present taxes might not be enough. So under that set of circumstances, I think it is fairest to characterize our industry's position as being open minded.''
Airport owners, many of them counties and cities, have long sought permission to charge head taxes on passengers, saying they would be willing to accept legal restrictions on how the money could be spent. Airports major sources of money include bonds, landing fees charged the airlines and private planes and fees charged airport concessionaires like restaurants and automobile rental companies.

HEADLINE: $50 Billion Plan Is Called For to Train Minorities

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The president of the National Urban League called for a $50 billion ''domestic Marshall Plan'' today to train minority workers to help the United States compete in the international marketplace in the 1990's.
John E. Jacob, the president of the 80-year-old civil rights group, said the need for skilled workers to enable American industry to compete with foreign businesses presented a rare ''window of opportunity'' for blacks and other minority groups.
He said the plan, which the league likened to the American aid program in Europe after after World War II. could be financed by money diverted from military spending, which is likely to be cut because of the relaxation of East-West tensions. 
 
Proposal Is Included in Report
Dr. Jacob's proposal was included in the organization's 15th annual report on ''The State of Black America.'' The report emphasized the persistence of problems in education, health, housing, and the judicial system. The problems were addressed in 12 essays by black academicians, physicians, lawyers and other professionals.
The proposed $50 billion program, which would be ''predicated on national need,'' would help alleviate all these problems, Mr. Jacob said.
''America is looking at herself against the Japanese and Europeans and saying, 'We have jobs - how can we fill them?' '' he said.
''America will become a second-rate power unless we undertake policies to insure that our neglected minority population gets the education, housing, health care and job skills they need to help America compete successfully in a global economy,'' Mr. Jacob said.
In the report, Dr. David H. Swinton, dean of the business school at Jackson State University, wrote, ''Despite the momentous changes taking place in other arenas during the 1980's, the movement to gain economic equality for blacks stalled.''
 
Bush 'Was Most Responsive'
Mr. Jacob said the group had presented the program to President Bush last November, and ''I am pleased to report that President Bush was most responsive to the proposals that we put to him.''
But Administration officials have cautioned against expectations of a ''peace dividend'' resulting from the relaxation of East-West tensions. They have warned that military expenditures would not be quickly reduced and that the money saved would go toward shrinking the budget deficit.
In the report, Julius L. Chambers, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that in the last year, the Supreme Court had issued a number of rulings that have led minority members to question whether the Court would continue to be ''an ally'' on civil rights issues.
''The decisions were so chilling that they have even prompted some to question whether the Court is still an appropriate forum to address the remaining obstacles to equal rights and equal opportunities for black Americans, or even to preserve past gains,'' Mr. Chambers wrote.
Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., chairman of the department of surgery at the Howard University School of Medicine, addressed life expectancy in his essay. ''In general,'' Dr. Leffall wrote, ''black Americans have a death rate one and one half times that of whites, and black life expectancy is declining - from 69.7 years in 1984 to 69.4 years in 1986.''

HEADLINE: Farm Debate to Center on Pesticides

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Proposals intended to make American agricultural practices safer and less polluting are likely to emerge as the most contentious issues in the Congressional debate over national farm policy, farm groups, trade organizations and influential farm policy makers say.
The appearance of environmental issues in the farm policy debate reflects a recognition not only that consumers want food produced with fewer chemicals, but also that the farm economy is substantially better and thus less of an issue now than in 1985, when the last national farm policy law was written.
''We'll spend a great deal of time debating conservation and environmental issues,'' said Randy M. Russell, an agricultural consultant in Washington. ''The farm community, from an economic perspective, is doing relatively well, and the debate this time around will not be on a major rewrite on the underlying farm legislation but rather on a series of other issues, including these environmental issues.'' 
 
Matter of Balancing Needs
The comments by Mr. Russell and other experts who help formulate rules governing the supply of farm products like corn, wheat, rice, cotton and milk came a day after President Bush and Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter unveiled a broad outline of the Administration's proposal for agriculture at an American Farm Bureau Federation convention in Orlando, Fla.
On Monday the President signaled his intention to introduce proposals that will balance the needs of farmers to use toxic chemicals in crop production and the concerns of Americans fearful of increasing pollution and the amount of pesticides on food.
''Many of you here today come from farms that have been handed down from parents and grandparents,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You know that to protect the land is to protect not just your livelihood, but your heritage. We must recognize that productive agriculture and a sound environment can be compatible, especially in terms of water quality.''
Dr. Charles E. Hess, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for science and education, said today that the Administration's farm policy proposals would not be made public until next month. But he and other department officials listed some of the broad changes in policy sought by the Bush Administration:
* Farmers who choose to rotate corn or wheat with other crops should be able to do so without financial penalties. Such rotations, which provide environmental and economic benefits, are discouraged under current rules because they reduce the amount of money a farmer is eligible to receive from the Government.
* More money and attention is needed for research on farm practices that reduce the use of toxic chemicals and expand the ability of farmers to control pests and diseases through less polluting techniques.
* New rules would reduce pollution of streams and water supplies from pesticides and fertilizers.
 
Environmentalists Are Opposed
But the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group, and other environmental organizations will propose measures aimed at sharply restricting the use of pesticides.
In 1985 the Reagan Administration and Congress established a program to pay farmers an annual fee for planting grass or trees on millions of acres of fragile land to control soil erosion. There are currently more than 33 million acres in the Conservation Reserve Program.
One proposal under consideration by the Agriculture Department and Congress to reduce water pollution would identify land that is most likely to enable farm chemicals to seep into groundwater or streams. Farmers could be offered fees to establish wide buffer zones along streams and lakes or to take land out of production.
The emergence of environmental issues were propelled in 1985 with new and sweeping provisions to reduce soil erosion.
''As far as the environmental provisions of the farm bill, farmers are going to be receptive to a number of things done in moderation,'' said Mark A. Maslyn, assistant director of national affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation. ''Conceptually there is a lot of room for agreement between farmers and the environmental community. The question is how far we go.''
In his speech on Monday, Mr. Yeutter said the Administration will continue policies aimed at aggressively exporting American farm products and reducing Federal farm payments. The value of American farm exports reached $40 billion in 1989, more than 40 percent higher than in 1986. according to the Department of Agriculture.

HEADLINE: The Next Summit's in June. Hurry.

 BODY:
The next Bush-Gorbachev meeting is five months away - only five months. What happens starting now will show whether the two leaders can ride the tigers Mikhail Gorbachev has set loose or whether they'll lose a momentous opportunity to reduce weapons and promote peace.
Mr. Gorbachev needs to keep doing what he has been doing - reforming the Soviet economic and political systems, allowing greater autonomy for Soviet republics and independence for Eastern Europe, showing restraint in the third world and agreeing to arms controls. 
Since the Malta summit meeting last month, President Bush has been talking about a U.S. policy of helping his Soviet counterpart to ''keep going forward.'' Now he has to start delivering.
The first task is to push the U.S. bureaucracy to make the compromises necessary for arms control agreements. Arms cuts are the surest, quickest way to relieve Mr. Gorbachev's economic pressures.
Mr. Bush's second task is to work with Congress to aid the beleaguered Soviet economy.
Finally, the President will need to work to insure that nothing happens in Afghanistan, Central America or elsewhere that derails the improvement in Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Gorbachev knows he can find precious rubles and talent in Moscow's vast military establishment. Accordingly, he has offered to make enormously disproportionate reductions in conventional and nuclear arms. It is overwhelmingly in America's interest to nail down those treaties, fast, while Mr. Gorbachev has the backing of his military. Given the traditionally slow pace of arms talks, Mr. Bush will have to do exactly what he has promised: kick his quarrelsome bureaucrats toward compromises.
Meantime, he'll have to do some stroking in Congress to clear the way for Soviet exports. Soviet goods will continue to face high tariff barriers until Moscow changes its laws on emigration. Those changes are imminent and Congress should then move expeditiously to give the Soviet Union equal trading opportunities. At the same time, Congress should lift the ridiculously low $300 million ceiling on credits and credit guarantees to Moscow.
Neither of these actions would produce a flood of Soviet exports. But they would demonstrate Washington's good will and give Moscow the right kind of economic incentives.
The way is also being cleared to reach an accord on Afghanistan. A deal here to relieve Moscow's costly military aid burden might induce the Soviets to press Fidel Castro to curtail arms shipments in Central America.
Many other issues will arise in the coming months - like Soviet membership in international economic organizations, exchange programs, talks on the future of Europe and cooperation on the environment. But they will have to be subordinated; each of them can be addressed more profitably after force reductions begin. Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush cannot afford to let these vital arms treaties slip away.

HEADLINE: Apartment Rules Will Stop Landlords From Heartless Evictions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''We Now Pronounce You a Family'' (editorial, Dec. 15), on new tenant succession regulations of the New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal, rests on unfounded assumptions. While lesbian and gay couples will be important beneficiaries of expanding protection for family members of deceased tenants in rent-regulated apartments, most of the litigation of this issue has not involved lesbian and gay couples.
Since the Court of Appeals decided Braschi v. Stahl Associates last July, all published lower court decisions relying on that case have involved other than lesbian and gay couples. Frequent beneficiaries have been children taken in by distant relatives or nonrelatives who live as part of a household without formal adoption or official foster care placements, a practice common among the city's poor. 
The proposed regulations adopt objective tests and exclude evidence or inquiry about sexual relationships between household members. The ''egregious invasions of tenant privacy'' you evoke are unlikely. The successor to a lease after the death of a tenant will not be able to ''pass it on to an endless succession of future invitees'' unless that individual establishes the requisites of a ''family'' relationship under the demanding regulations.
The regulations are calculated to deal with the most harmful fallout of rent regulation. The economic incentives for landlords to evict and to repossess apartments (vacancy decontrol or turnovers accompanied by sharp increases in rent) frequently overtake human compassion, resulting in the heartless evictions of grieving survivors, sometimes after decades of residence. Legislative action is needed, but the legislature, politically divided, with the Senate implacably opposed to legislation that might be seen to benefit lesbians and gays, is unlikely to answer your call for action. The new regulations are the next best thing.

HEADLINE: Kean Stresses Need to Help Urban Poor

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In a joyous and familial farewell to the state he governed for eight years, Gov. Thomas H. Kean delivered his final State of the State address today, warning New Jerseyans not to forget the problems and people left behind after an era of buoyant economic growth.
Speaking to a joint session of the new Democrat-controlled Legislature that took office today, Mr. Kean offered a reprise of the state's accomplishments since he took office, including new jobs, reforms in education and a new self-image for the state's 7.5 million residents.
''We forged an identity, we reaffirmed a sense of purpose and we built a new pride in this place called New Jersey,'' said the Republican Governor, who leaves office next Tuesday when James J. Florio, a Democrat, will be sworn in as Governor.
Mr. Kean warned that New Jersey's future now depends on preventing overdevelopment and helping the urban poor in a state where the gap between affluent suburbs and poor cities grew dramatically through the boom years of the 1980's. 
 
'Natural Treasures'
''How much longer can we pile condo on top of condo, strip mall on top of strip mall, in some mad race to fatten the wallets of a few,'' he said, ''while destroying the natural treasures that can be enjoyed by so many?''
''As we settle into our reclining chairs at night surrounded by our VCR's and remote controls and CD's and Nintendo games, do we think of the children in our inner cities who are not worried about escaping the Pac-Man on the video screen but the drug dealer in the tenement on the corner.''
''We will not allow the sturdy foundation of democracy, painfully constructed over two centuries, to be nibbled to pieces by the three termites of selfishness, indifference and greed,'' Mr. Kean said.
Although the outgoing Governor delivers the formal State of the State address this year, it will be left to Mr. Florio to present the Legislature with this year's budget proposal, in an address that is certain to be filled with specific proposals to deal with the state's growing budget problems. Experts say the state may be facing a revenue shortfall of several hundred million dollars this fiscal year, which ends June 30. Mr. Florio is expected to deliver his budget proposal sometime in the next two months.
Mr. Kean's speech was more of a paean to the policies of his administration and a time of good feeling, in which the Governor became the state's greatest booster and a personification of its new image. He is leaving government to become president of Drew University, a small private university in Madison.
''I stand before you with a mind crowded with wonderful memories of eight great years, with a chest filled with pride for the tremendous progress we've made together,'' Mr. Kean said.
He said New Jersey had entered its 84th consecutive month of economic growth, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs for a state that had been suffering the decline of old industries and the recession of the early 1980's.
Under his leadership, Mr. Kean said, school test scores had climbed, drinking water and park land had been protected and innovative programs had been introduced to fight drug abuse and attempt welfare reform.
 
'Real Impact'
''The real impact of our work will be felt by generations to come,'' he said. ''By today's teen-agers who will work in the high-tech labs we built together. By today's first graders who will learn in schools filled with better teachers, higher standards and stronger values that we provided together.''
Mr. Kean admonished the Legislature for not changing the current formula used to distribute state aid to school districts, a troubled system that has raised property taxes. The formula is the subject of a State Supreme Court case that is expected to be decided this year.
The speech was received warmly by hundreds of legislators and current and former state officials who interrupted numerous times with applause. They did not seem to notice what was probably Mr. Kean's least fortunate phrase: ''My tongue tasted irresistible evidence of the patchwork quilt that is New Jersey.''
The new Democratic president of the Senate, John A. Lynch, in introducing the Governor, praised Mr. Kean highly and thanked him for having ''brought notoriety to our state.'' Later, Mr. Lynch criticized Mr. Kean, saying his recital of accomplishments did not include his failure to deal with increasingly bitter tax and fiscal problems facing the state.
''Tom Kean was a Governor who did not want to tackle those issues that would require political capital,'' Mr. Lynch said.
 
Children and Animals
True to the style that earned him wide popularity in the state, Mr. Kean, a member of one of the state's oldest leading families, filled his address with references to little children, small animals and Hollywood celebrities.
Last year, for example, Mr. Kean invoked the image of Vanna White, a star of the television show ''The Wheel of Fortune.'' This year, he compared himself to Sally Field, who portrayed ''The Flying Nun'' in the 1960's television series, and recalled the aid he rendered to a family threatened with the loss of their unlicensed pet raccoon named Gerry Cooney.
He also recounted letters he received from children around the state. Among his favorites, he said, was a letter from a child named Reni.
''Good old Reni,'' Mr. Kean recalled. ''He wrote probably the most candid line I've heard in the past eight years. He said, 'I'm sorry you're leaving office, but that's life, Bud!' ''

HEADLINE: City to Suburb: Commuting Turns Around

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
With a glass-walled apartment 32 floors above the Upper East Side and plenty of friends below, David Perlmutter is happily ensconced in Manhattan. But each weekday morning, the 27-year-old developer drives to work here in the suburbs.
His reverse commuting, up Interstate 87 and the Sprain Brook Parkway and then along the Cross-Westchester Expressway, suits him, he said. ''I get to see a few trees during the day, and then I have my pick of theater, movies and restaurants at night.''
Tens of thousands of New Yorkers -white-collar and blue-collar - are traveling to work against the commuting flow into Manhattan each day. By car, train and bus, they go to the office parks and manufacturing centers of the suburbs, where job growth in the 1980's was more than twice that in the city. On Interstate 95 and the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester, the cars going north in the morning to corporate hubs like White Plains and Greenwich and Stamford, Conn., now outnumber those going south, planners at the New York State Thruway Authority say. Similarly, the east- and west-bound lanes of the Long Island Expressway are equally crowded, planners at the New York State Department of Transportation say. 
On the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which serves Westchester County and Connecticut, ridership out of Manhattan during the morning rush climbed by 61 percent from 1982 to 1989. In the same period, ridership into the city climbed by 9 percent.
The actual number of reverse commuters is still small.
But the railroad is working to make it as easy to leave the city by train as by car through improved schedules, express trains and bus connections on the other end.
''It is the fastest growing market on the railroad,'' said Howard Permut, the director of planning and marketing for Metro-North. ''There's just been a tremendous increase in jobs in the outlying areas, and we've made an effort to improve our service there.''
Christine Johnson, director of transportation planning for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said, ''All of our forecasts indicate that reverse commuting will be the growth area of the future.''
A recent study for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by the Regional Plan Association, a private nonprofit organization, projected 60,770 new daily trips out of New York City against the commuting flow by the year 2015. 'It's a Breeze' - Or Is It? That would be a 28 percent increase over the estimated 220,100 reverse trips now. And it is more than twice the projected growth in the number of trips coming into the city.
Still, the number of commuters riding into the city each day is many times higher than the number riding out. Metro-North counted 64,900 incoming riders during the morning rush last year and 4,560 outgoing riders.
Many who commute out of the city boast of roomy trains and lighter traffic. ''It's a breeze,'' said William O. Melvin Jr., a 52-year-old managing director for a White Plains investment concern who usually takes the 7:15 A.M. from Grand Central Terminal.
But some say it is not so easy. ''People think that just because you're a reverse commuter you don't have a single car to deal with, but there are tons of people reverse commuting,'' said Helene Bruneheim, an account executive for an advertising agency in Stamford who lives on the Upper West Side.
 
Like the Spokes of a Wheel
Even more common than the reverse-commuting trip is what transportation officials call the intra-suburban trip, from one suburb of New York to another. The dispersal of jobs across metropolitan regions have made this the dominant commuting trip not only in the New York region but also in the nation.
In New York, according to Federal employment data, the number of jobs in the city grew by 10 percent in the last decade, from 3,287,000 in 1979 to 3,627,000 last year. In the 18 counties surrounding the city, the number grew by 21 percent, from 3,766,000 to 4,575,000.
''Even though this was New York City's greatest period of job growth since World War II, you had this extraordinary economic development taking place in the rest of the region,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The network of railroad tracks around New York City resembles the spokes of a wheel, designed to whisk people in and out of the central business district south of 59th Street in Manhattan.
 
New Express Trains for Peaks
As one sign of the growing importance of the suburb-to-suburb trip, Metro-North is spending $1 million to study the possibility of running a new rail line across the Hudson River, either by bridge or tunnel, which would link Rockland and Orange Counties on the west side and Westchester and Fairfield Counties on the east side. It would also connect the railroad's existing north-south Harlem, Hudson and New Haven lines.
In the meantime, Metro-North and other agencies are improving service for reverse commuters. Metro-North has done the most, adding express trains from Manhattan to Greenwich and Stamford during rush hours. Many reverse departures are now minutes apart during peak periods, compared with an hour apart years ago.
The Westchester County Department of Transportation has worked with Metro-North to get people from train stations in White Plains, Rye and Port Chester to offices along the Platinum Mile, as the county calls the corporate stretch along the Cross-Westchester Expressway.
New bus routes were created a few years ago to bring people directly to the office parks housing corporations including Nestle S.A., Nynex, the Bank of New York and General Foods.
 
Considering a 3d Track in Mineola
''It's a good mix of white-collar and blue-collar jobs,'' said Eric B. Langeloh, the county's Commissioner of Transportation. ''We like the fact that they're taking mass transit, and we do need labor here.''
N.J. Transit has also responded. In 1984, reverse train service on the busy Northeast Corridor line, running through Edison, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, was increased from hourly to half-hourly departures. And in the last five years, the agency has greatly expanded bus service from New York City to the Meadowlands area and from Newark to outlying jobs.
The Long Island Rail Road, with 3,800 reverse commuters during the morning rush, is considering laying a third track in Mineola. L.I., to reduce time between departures, now more than an hour on some lines.
''There are some gaps in service, because we only have two tracks, and we need both for the majority of people who commute into New York City,'' said Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the railroad.
 
'The Same in Both Directions'
Some reverse commuters say they feel neglected. Sean Dennis Cashman, who lives in Greenwich Village and is dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Adelphi University on Long Island, said, ''The railroad's priority is the people going from the suburbs to the city, and if there is a problem, it's your train that gets bumped.''
Also on Long Island, the New York State Department of Transportion acknowledged the tremendous movement on the Long Island Expressway away from New York City by scrapping a plan to relieve congestion that would have added a single lane for traffic toward the city in the morning and away from it at night.
''We're not even considering it anymore, and the reason is that the traffic flow is about the same in both directions, morning and evening,'' said David Ernst, the director of communications of the Department of Transporation.
Mr. Ernst said labor shortages, especially at the low end of the job market, have pulled many people from Brooklyn and Queens to work in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and from the Bronx to clerical, service, maintenance, warehousing and manufacturing jobs in Westchester and Fairfield Counties.
''Anyone on Long Island will tell you the difficulty of finding employees at the lower pay levels,'' Mr. Ernst said. ''Those people simply can't afford to live on Long Island, and so they commute from the city.''

Coopers & Lybrand Leases New Offices

DATELINE: MANHATTAN

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins took time out from the city's financial woes yesterday to announce a new tenant for a large portion of one of Manhattan's midtown office towers, which he said was proof that ''in good times and bad New York City remains at the heart of the international economy.''
A lease was signed by Coopers & Lybrand, the worldwide accounting and consulting concern, which will move more than 2,000 employees into nine floors of 1301 Avenue of the Americas as of Sept. 1. The building, owned by theTishman Speyer partnership, occupies the west side of the avenue between 52d and 53d Streets.
Coopers & Lybrand said it will retain its United States headquarters at its present address, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, three blocks to the south.

Lessons

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
Donna Wall, a substitute kindergarten teacher, was half an hour into a crayons-and-scissors exercise at the Bartlett Elementary School in Lowell, Mass., when she realized that some of the students, having finished their assignment, were wandering all over the classroom.
Suddenly, a seventh grader came through the door, introduced herself as a volunteer aide, clapped her hands and brought the class to order. ''There I was, a high-powered educational policy-maker, and it took a seventh grader to bail me out,'' Ms. Wall said.
Until April, Ms. Wall was Commissioner for Basic Education for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a post from which she supervised 501 public school systems and wrestled with problems like a $99 million deficit in the special education budget. 
Last spring, she decided to forsake the power lunches and political horsetrading and return to the classroom. In October she put her house on the market, bought a new car and began touring the country as a substitute teacher. Her travels have already taken her to 12 schools in the Northeast. This week she is off to Maryland, with plans to reach the West Coast by the end of this school year.
''I wanted to teach and to talk to principals and teachers and children,'' she said. ''My children are grown, so I had the time, the flexibility and some savings.''
By now she also has interesting new insights into how public schools look from the bottom as well as from the top.
Ms. Wall, who is 51 years old, started as a high school home economics teacher, but for the last 14 years she has served as a superintendent of schools and state official. As a newly minted substitute teacher, her first collision with educational bureaucracies came soon. ''My idea was to get paid as a substitute teacher to offset some of my travel costs,'' she said. ''But I discovered it's usually not worth the time it takes to do the paperwork to get certified. So I usually volunteer my services.'' Her first assignment was a seventh-grade language arts class in Torrington, Conn. ''I was scared,'' she said, ''and I was surprised at how scared I was. I was trained to teach high school, and my other jobs were pretty well defined. The idea that anyone can teach young children is nonsense.''
By the second day, however, Ms. Wall was in control. ''I had a small class of boys with behavior problems,'' she recalled. ''Some of them tried to convince me that they should be dismissed 10 minutes before the bell, but one kid said, 'You know she won't buy that.' It felt good that they accepted me as being in charge.''
When not teaching, Ms. Wall has had the chance to observe what she called some ''marvelous teachers,'' including Judy Platt, an English teacher at the Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in Massachusetts. ''They were doing Othello, and she was an actress as well as a teacher,'' Ms. Wall said. ''I discovered afterward that this was a mixed-ability class, but it was obvious that all the kids understood the play. We don't set high enough expectations for our students.''
There were emotional downers, too - like the kindergarten class in a poor section of Lowell. ''There was this one little boy whose clothes were absolutely dirty, and he couldn't sit still for more than two minutes,'' she said. ''I'd try to teach the other children, and every few seconds I would have to stop and move him back to his seat. I realized afterward that I had done almost nothing for him, and that the time I had spent with him impacted on the other children.''
Ms. Wall said her travels have altered her perspective of how school systems really work. ''I now realize how many people there are who make decisions affecting schools - from legislators and education committees to professional organizations that support every phase of the enterprise,'' she said. ''I also realize how few of these people have any background in running schools and classrooms.'' If she ever returns to running a school system, she said, she has resolved to spend more time educating such people about what she is doing.
She said that she was also impressed by the lack of accountability at the lowest levels. ''In the business world there is a bottom line,'' she said. ''People know what they are supposed to produce. In education, there is no bottom line that people agree upon. We've got to come up with one.''
Ms. Wall is keeping notes on her journey for some articles and maybe a book, and she is thinking about trying to establish a foundation to allow others to follow in her footsteps.
''It's important to break down the distance between policymakers and teachers,'' she said. ''I'd like to see teachers working as interns in state education offices, and I'd like to see more bureaucrats in the schools, not just to observe but to teach.''

Plan Unveiled for Improving Minority Education

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Citing a ''glaring gap between minority and nonminority educational achievement'' in the United States, a group of educators and business and community leaders presented an extensive plan today to improve the education of minority students.
The main recommendations call for revamping schools so that teachers, administrators and curriculums respond to the individual needs of the students. The report gives examples of schools in Rochester, Miami, New Haven and other cities that have been reorganized so that ''student achievement is the main criterion against which teachers, principals, and administrators are judged and rewarded.''
The group, the Quality Education for Minorities Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, based its report a two-year national study financed by a $1.2 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. 
 
'Demographic Revolution'
Shirley M. McBay, who directed the work, said of the study: ''We believe this project is timely, for our nation is now experiencing the beginning of what we call an American demographic revolution. Nearly one-quarter of all Americans are minority and by 2020, at least one-third of the nation will be non-white.
''Yet despite these momentous changes, and despite the passage of more than 35 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, minority students still attend schools that are both separate and unequal.''
In Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the Supreme Court overturned the doctrine of separate but equal education and ordered public schools desegregated.
The study focused on black Americans, American Indians, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans who Ms. McBay said are ''traditionally underserved'' by the educational system.
Among the proposals, many of which the group said would help all pupils, are that schools improve nutrition programs for young pupils so that they are ready to learn in classes, revise curriculums so that the cultures of minoritiy groups are emphasized, reduce class sizes, require participation in community service programs, extend the school and year, establish summer residency programs on college campuses for older students to improve mathematics and science skills and extend Federal and state school aid to cover all children whose families are on welfare.
Other recommendations include increasing family and community involvement in education and raising teachers expectations of students.
''A rising tide lifts all boats,'' said Thomas W. Cole, Jr., president of Clark Atlanta University, who spoke on behalf of the organization.
But the report said financing all the recommendtions for one year would cost $27 billion.
 
Response Is Positive
Initial response to the report was positive.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is a leader among the governors on education issues, said the report corresponds to the proposals drawn up by the governors and the White House after the ''education summit'' last fall, which was attended by President Bush.
Gov. Gary Carruthers of New Mexico said that many of the recommendations in the report are ''right on target'' and are in line with programs he has tried to implement in New Mexico. ''I believe that restructuring is in order because we must focus on the needs of the students as opposed to those of the institutions,'' he said.
David Merkowitz, director of public affairs at the American Council on Education, also praised the report.
''It is important to recognize that the obstacles and opportunities of different groups are different.'' He said the report also ''exploded some of the myths'' about minorities and education, like minorities are less capable of learning, that educating minorities is impossible because of problems like drugs and poverty and unemployment.
Over the course of the two-year study, the organization held nine regional hearings to determine what works in educating minorities. The group says that it found many successful programs, which it will use as models in implementing its plan, such as the two schools with new programs aimed at minorities in New Haven by James Comer and his colleagues at the Yale Child Study Center.
Ms. Mcbay said that such programs are usually under financed and ''operate mainly outside the traditional educational system.'' The goal of her project is to make these exceptions the norm in American education.

HEADLINE: Children's Names: Mirror of a Society

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IF a child's name tells more about the parents than it does about the child, then the 1980's may well be remembered as a decade in which some parents were self-indulgent, ambitious, proud of their heritage and just a little outrageous.
Luci was spelled with an i and Tyffany with two y's. Michael became Mykell. There were Jennifer Wongs and Ashakulu Johnsons. Boys were Leslies; so were girls.
''I don't think anyone could imagine how ingenious the America public could be when it comes to names,'' said Dr. Leonard Ashley, a professor of English at Brooklyn College and the author of ''What's in a Name?'' (Genealogical Publishing, 1989). 
Unlike the 1960's, when parents were naming their children with social and environmental concerns in mind (Sunshine, Moon and Peace), in the 1980's, more and more parents chose names that reflected their heritage and ethnic origins and their economic status. Many chose names that were gender-neutral or names they believed would set their children apart from others.
''People no longer go to the Bible or literature in choosing names for their children,'' Dr. Ashley said. ''They go to television or their ethnic roots, or they simply use their imaginations.''
Last month, at a regional meeting in Washington, the American Names Society, whose members often serve as consultants to corporations that want to find appropriate names for products, devoted two days to exploring the differences in choosing personal names based on race, region and sex. Such concerns are also reflected in the public's fascination with personal names and surnames.
''For over a hundred years, there have been naming fads and trends,'' said Dr. Cleveland Kent Evans, an assistant professor of psychology at Bellevue (Neb.) College, who has researched white, black and Hispanic names in the United States. ''Today, I think people, blacks especially, are more into finding different and unusual names for kids.''
For example, one black woman, Kelly A. Tillers, a commercial real-estate broker in Manhattan, was going to name her daughter Bianca until one of the characters on a her favorite soap opera, ''All My Children,'' chose that name for her television offspring. ''Then it became too phony,'' said Ms. Tillers, whose daughter is now a year old.
So she called her Chiara, a name she overheard in an Italian restaurant. ''It just sounded right,'' she said.
Zahmu and Malyka Rose Burgin, a Philadelphia couple who adopted their African names several years ago, looked no further than the carved wooden African map on their living-room wall to choose a name for their son, Zaire, now 2 months old.
Dr. Ralph Slovenko, a professor of law and psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit and an expert in onomastics, the study of the origins and uses of names, believes the new trends reflect a growing ''appreciation and awareness'' of ethnicity as well as social changes, in particular the women's movement.
''Whereas before everybody wanted to be in the melting pot and have assimilated names, some of the new immigrants are keeping their names,'' Dr. Slovenko said.
The women's movement has resulted in gender-bending names like Beverly, Carol (or Carroll), Kerry, Shawn or Chris, which are being used for both girls and boys.
Indeed, some women consider traditional feminine names a handicap in the business world and are choosing neuter names for their children. Dr. Slovenko said: ''Usually, it's a statement by the mother that this is still a man's world. Said one mother who gave her daughter a man's name, 'It'll look good when she applies to medical school.' ''
While these changes were taking place, most parents were still choosing traditional names for their children. For the 25th year in a row, more New York City parents named their newborn sons Michael than any other name in 1988, the latest year for which statistics are available from the City Health Department.
Jessica led the list of names for baby girls for the third year in a row. In 1988, a Gallup Poll produced similar results, with Michael leading the list for boys, followed by Christopher, and with Mary leading the list for girls, followed by Jessica.
''In the 1990's, more and more names will come from television and soap operas, said Dr. Ashley, the Brooklyn College professor, ''so you'll have Ashleys, Alexises and Crystals. Matthew will be around for a long time, as will names that are feminized versions of boys' names like Danielle, Stephanie and Michelle.''
Many black Americans began adopting names from authentic African or Islamic sources during the civil-rights and black-power movements of the 1960's and 1970's, rejecting the names given to slaves by their English-speaking masters. They have been joined by new immigrants to the United States who are not Americanizing their traditional African and Caribbean names.
In the 1980's, some younger black parents went a step further by creating names that many readily admit come out of thin air. This trend has been the subject of considerable controversy, highlighted recently by an essay, ''Names Can Hurt,'' in the April 1989 issue of Essence magazine.
The essay's author, Cathy M. Jackson, a freelance writer, denounced ''cumbersome, unpronounceable, phonetically awkward names for the rest of his or her life.'' In another section, the author wrote, ''Little black children don't need any more bricks added to the societal load they were born with.''
Mrs. Burgin of Philadelphia said her mother voiced similar concerns about the name her grandson would be given.
''Don't give him a name we can't pronounce or he can't spell,'' she recalled her mother's saying before Zaire's birth. ''My feeling was that if we named him Zachary, he would have to learn how to pronounce it and spell it. Our culture is African-American, and we shouldn't feel embarrassed by embracing our culture.''
Dr. Ashley also sees the trend as positive: ''People say Afro-American names are getting weird. They're just weird to people who expect tradition. I think they're just becoming more original.''
But some blacks worry that as names become readily identifiable as being black, their children will be stigmatized.
''It depends,'' said Dr. Evans of Bellevue College. ''Part of it is whether you think it is positive or negative to have a name which is identified with one race or the other. When a person applies for a job, it could make it easier for those who are prejudiced to consciously or unconsciously discriminate.''
Dr. Ashley said that the 1980's were also a time when more American Jews either chose traditional Hebrew names like Ari, Moshe and Rebecca for their children or returned to their families' original surnames.
At the same time, many Asians turned their names around, so that the surname or family name no longer comes first, Dr. Ashley said. And many Hispanic parents are giving their children traditional English first names: Robert Rodrigo Lopez, for example.
Other parents have tried to avoid names that would pigeonhole children or seem dated later.
''You have to consider that the child will have to live with this name for the rest of their lives,'' said Eileen Taylor of Ellicott City, Md., who is the mother of five, including 2-year-old twin girls. She and her husband, Jack, settled on the names Katherine (who is called Katie), Brendan and Laura, and for the twins, Mary Clare and Meg.
''They're all classy names, yet not too trendy,'' Mrs. Taylor said. ''So years from now someone won't turn to them and say: 'Oh, that name was popular in the 80's.' ''
For years, experts have been divided on whether a name can be predict or affect future achievement. On one side of the argument are those like Drs. Slovenko and Ashley, who cite anecdotal evidence that people assume their identities through their names.
''Consider that John Minor Wisdom, Pleas Jones, William Justice and Learned Hand are judges,'' Dr. Slovenko wrote in the April 1980 issue of the American Journal of Psychotherapy. ''Russell Brain is a brain surgeon, William Dance is a dancing instructor, William Key is a jail warden, Cardinal Sin is an archbishop, Groaner Digger is an undertaker.'' But in a 1985 study of 25,000 children in the St. Paul-Minneapolis school system, Dr. Martin E. Ford, a developmental psychologist who teaches at Stanford University, found no correlation between names and academic achievement or social competence.
''What truly happens, once people know the person behind the name, the name becomes insignificant as a factor in their psychological development,'' Dr. Ford said.
Yet those on both sides of the argument agreed that parents obviously believe names will have an effect on their children's lives. This explains why upwardly mobile and working-class parents alike are choosing what Dr. Ashley describes as ''Waspy'' sounding names like MacGregor for girls and Maxwell and Winthrop for boys.
''The image they want for their kids is something wealthy and glamorous,'' Dr. Evans said. ''That's why you have so many names taken from television or famous stars. Whitney became popular overnight when Whitney Houston got big. The irony is that names that have that glitzy image are actually not what wealthy people name their kids.''
Deborah Cofer, the executive assistant to the president of North General Hospital in Manhattan, said she was thinking more about a ''rare, precious jewel'' than about the renowned Fifth Avenue jewelry store when she named her daughter Tiffany. That was 13 years ago, before Tiffany became one of the 80's most popular girls' names (No. 7 in New York).
''To say the least, I was a bit annoyed at all these Tiffanys,'' Ms. Cofer said. But her daughter has ''grown into'' the name, she added. ''My Tiffany only wants the finest, most expensive things. This name thing is costing me a bundle. Maybe I'll have it changed.''

HEADLINE: Revival Bought With Tourist Dollars

 BODY:
A small but growing number of American towns, no longer able to prosper from the industry, mining or farming that once defined them, are using imagination and ingenuity in hopes of snaring some of the tourist dollars that usually flow to big metropolitan hot spots.
Some of these communities are spending millions of dollars on sometimes offbeat and risky ventures that often have little relation to their history or image.
Chicopee, Mass., wants to turn its Connecticut River waterfront into an Amazon jungle, complete with monkeys and exotic birds. Kemmerer, Wyo., plans to become a virtual J. C. Penney theme park. Gary, Ind., is promoting casino gambling. And places that do not already have football field-sized aquariums are quickly drawing plans for them. 
Officials of these towns say they hope that a metamorphosis that involves revamping their downtowns and imposing new building codes will create places that people will drive out of their way to visit and to spend money.
''It's happening overnight,'' said David Edgell, director of policy and planning for the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, an agency of the Commerce Department. ''What people are doing may seem unbelievable.'' But, he added, many communities had proved that tourism can rebuild economies that might have otherwise faded with the paint on the town hall.
Already there is a Swedish theme town - albeit with palm trees - in California, and Bavarian-style towns are springing up across the West. Festivals that were once held annually for just the local community have expanded into gigantic productions that celebrate everything from squid to Shakespeare.
Behind these changes is the recognition that tourism is the third-largest retail service industry in the United States, employing six million people. In 1989, travelers in the United States spent more than $330 billion on goods and services, according to a Commerce Department study.
That study said spending by visitors was becoming an increasingly effective economic development tool for rural areas. Tourism can replace agriculture and industry as a community's livelihood, the study said.
''One of the major changes in thinking is tourism,'' said Matt Kane, a policy analyst for the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a economic research group based in Washington. ''Before it was part of a diversified approach. Now everybody is putting their eggs in one basket.''
 
May Be a Fad
But Mr. Kane, the author of ''Economic Development: What Works at the Local Level,'' warned that tourism might be a fad. ''In the 70's, you saw the building of industrial parks. In the 80's, it was the microchip industry. The major push now is tourism.''
Mr. Kane said tourism could be part of a good strategy, but it could be disastrous for towns to rely on tourism alone. ''Tourism is very seasonal and very cyclical,'' he said. ''When the economy flattens and people have less money to spend, just watch what happens to all the fancy hotels that have been built.''
Still, there are some long-term success stories. One is Leavenworth, a town in the mining and logging area of central Washington state, about 120 miles from Seattle. Leavenworth is often lauded as the oldest and most successful example of a dying town that was resuscitated by tourism.
Leavenworth's downturn, which began in the early 1940's, followed the pattern of many other communities hit hard by a changing manufacturing base and the resulting unemployment. By the end of World War II, Leavenworth's timber and mining industries had pulled out, stores were boarded up and more than half its population had moved. The final blow came when the railroad stopped serving the town, which is in a valley of the Cascade Mountains.
In the late 1960's, after two decades of economic decline, the town of 1,600 people emerged as a Bavarian village, even though it had no real ethnic German community. Today the town, framed by mountains and waterfalls that inspired the Bavarian theme, is a picture postcard of prosperity.
The boarded-up storefronts have been replaced by antique shops and beer halls. Chalet-style motels cannot be built fast enough to keep up with demand. Retailers, many of whom dress in Lederhosen year round, say that 1989 was their best year.
''It was pretty scary going in,'' said Laura Jobin, director of the Leavenworth Chamber of Commerce, who grew up in the town. ''People said the idea would never work, but we had hit rock bottom. What were our choices?''
Leavenworth transformed its face in less than five years, and by 1970, tourism was the town's major industry. Even though the nearest large city, Seattle, is two hours away, a million people a year visit the town. Leavenworth officials get 50 to 60 inquiries a year from as far away as Japan asking how they did it.
 
Massachusetts Rain Forest
On the East Coast, Chicopee, a Western Massachusetts industrial city of about 50,000 just north of Springfield, has seen scores of manufacturers pull out since the 1970's. Officials paid a design firm, Cambridge Seven Associates in Cambridge, Mass., $75,000 to come up with an idea to attract new business using an abandoned electrical plant where toxic wastes are stored.
The first idea was to build an aquarium large enough to gain national recognition, but too many other places, including Baltimore and Mystic, Conn., already had them. So the design firm proposed turning the aging plant on the muddy Connecticut River into a $25 million Amazon rain forest.
''It's a very ambitious concept,'' acknowledged Thomas Haberlin, Chicopee's community development director. But he said feasibility studies had shown that projected economic growth would justify the conversion.
''With the state government turning from poor to terrible, we've had some doubts expressed,'' Mr. Haberlin said. ''But there really aren't any alternatives.''
Cambridge Seven is involved in other town projects. It designed a $30 million freshwater aquarium on the banks of the Tennessee River in Chattanooga, Tenn. That city, like many of the firm's other clients, is economically depressed and hopes tourism will help. ''It's like changing a city with one building,'' said Peter Chermayeff, the firm's founder and vice president.
 
Homage to J. C. Penney
Not all places have the aspiration or can raise the millions of dollars needed to bring large projects to life. But the economic development offices in towns even as small as a few thousand are scurrying for a niche that might tap new sources of revenue - sometimes with quirky ideas.
Unemployment and an exodus of young people have plagued Kemmerer, Wyo., home of the nation's largest open coal pit. That moved Kemmerer to try to capitalize on its place as the home of the original J. C. Penney store.
The southwestern Wyoming town, which is near the Utah border, already has a J. C. Penney museum and a J. C. Penney boardwalk. There are now plans to restore the original store and the boarded-up downtown area, all using the J. C. Penney theme. ''People get real excited about J. C. Penney here,'' said Steve Golnar, the city's administrator. He said the project had prompted interest from top Penney executives.
Thomas Griffo, a J. C. Penney Company district manager whose territory includes Wyoming, emphasized that the company was not behind Kemmerer's plan. But he added that J. C. Penney ''may be spending some monies to bring in some of the old look'' of the original store.
 
Indiana Casino Plan
Not all of the places taking bold steps are rural. Gary, Ind., a city of about 130,000 in the Chicago metropolitan area, has lost a third of its population since the steel industry collapse. It is counting on the Indiana Legislature to approve the construction of five casino hotels along Lake Michigan. The city's Economic Development Office projects that the hotels will generate $800,000 million in gaming revenues annually and employ thousands.
''Nobody else is going to employ 25,000 people off the bat,'' said Karen Williams, a city spokeswoman. ''Casinos have the most impact in the shortest amount of time. We simply can't wait 10 or 15 years.''
Though some projects may appear frivolous, some say it may be more foolish not to try.
''Structurally, the economy has changed so much that the economic conditions that created these towns 100 and 200 years ago just aren't there any longer,'' said B. J. Reed, an associate professor of public administration at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, who advises community and business leaders in dying towns.
''In the long run, it is desperate,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Unless these towns can find a viable economic base or just retain what they have, they simply have no justification to exist.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Subsidy, Not Tax, To Spur Recycling

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
LIKE a desert cloudburst, a Bush Administration initiative to encourage recycling made a brief splash last week and then disappeared without a trace. But the idea of taxing manufacturers who do not make maximum use of recycled materials, reportedly shot down by Administration political operatives distressed by the mere mention of the T-word, is likely to rise again - if only because Washington is under increasing pressure from state and local officials to do something about the municipal garbage mountain.
At first glance, Federal ''user fees'' on bulky paper, glass and plastics made from virgin materials might seem heaven-sent to those who favor market-oriented solutions to environmental problems. In fact, the idea may prove too clever by half. A more practical alternative, some economists suggest, would be to subsidize recycling where there is a direct payoff to municipal budgets. 
It is hard to find a big-city mayor these days who is not losing sleep over where to put the garbage. And it is even harder to find a community willing to stow more debris underground or vaporize it in incinerators. William Rathje, who is in charge of the University of Arizona's Garbage Project, estimates that only a small percentage of the 3,000 landfills closed between 1982 and 1987 have been replaced. That is why the Environmental Protection Agency wants to cut the output of waste by 25 percent in the early 1990's.
The E.P.A.'s target would seem realistic. Barry Commoner, the biologist and environmental advocate, has estimated that 84 percent of household waste could be recycled without heroic effort. But for every willing supplier of recyclables there must be someone willing to do the recycling. And it is by no means clear that it would pay industry to reclaim a substantially greater flow of used materials, even if the stuff was delivered free to the factory gate.
That is where demand-side tax incentives might fit in. The Administration plan, apparently modeled after a proposal circulated by the Coca-Cola Company, would have put a tax on the production of the bulky materials that ultimately clog the waste stream. Manufacturers would get offsetting rebates for the tonnage of recycled material they used.
Such taxes are appealing because they look a lot less Big Brotherish to business and a lot more efficient to economists than, say, regulations requiring the use of a fixed proportion of recycled material in manufacturing. But as Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, notes, there are still plenty of problems.
To work efficiently, the tax on each offending substance would have to equal the savings achieved by not burying or burning it. Yet no one really has a handle on what these savings would amount to, Mr. Lave argues. Nor does anyone know how they will change over time as the technology of disposal changes, or whether legislators will be able to excercise the political flexibility to adjust the tax rates once they are in place.
What is clear, though, is that the costs of garbage disposal vary widely from place to place. A ton of old newspapers, for example, costs a lot more to dump on crowded, ecologically vulnerable Long Island than on the dry plains of Texas.
Administrative issues further cloud the practicality of fees on virgin materials. Would the tax be waived on exports? How about imports, where the quantity of recycled materials used would be hard to measure?
A more modest but less problematic approach, Mr. Lave says, would be to leave disposal decisions to localities, some of which already have ample reasons to offer financial incentives for recycling. For example, a city that is paying $60 a ton to bury unsorted garbage in a distant landfill would be wise to insist that residents separate old newspapers, and then pay a paper mill $50 a ton to take them off the sanitation department's hands.
It goes against the grain to give those who produce garbage a free ride. But there would be far less political resistance to subsidy carrots for recycling than tax sticks for not recycling. And the incentives could be far better directed. It makes little sense, for example, to pass on the financial burden of recycling old telephone books to small towns and cities with plenty of room for environmentally safe landfills.
Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future, in Washington, offers a variation on the same theme. The garbage problem may be obvious, he says, but the least-cost solution is not. And the risk is that Washington will impose an elegant fix when in some cases it would be cheaper, if messier, to get rid of the garbage in the old-fashioned ways.

HEADLINE: U.S. Forgives Portion Of Kenya's Loan Debt

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The United States today formally agreed to forgive all economic-assistance loans to Kenya, as part of an effort to give economic relief to Africa, including some of the continent's poorest countries.
The debt-relief effort, which was announced last July, is also aimed at rewarding African countries that have started to tighten their belts to improve their weak economies.
The United States Ambassador here, Smith Hempstone, signed an agreement that covered $44.7 million of Kenya's total outstanding debt of $175 million. The remaining $130 million will be forgiven over the next two years, if Kenya adheres to an economic reform program reached with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
 
Total of $735 Million
In all, the United States has pledged to cancel debts of $735 million owed by 12 sub-Saharan African countries. The per-capita incomes in those countries range from a low of $150 in Zaire to a high of $390 in Ghana.
The debt forgiveness reflects continuing concern about declines in Africa's well-being. ''Over all, Africans are almost as poor today as they were 30 years ago,'' the World Bank said in a major report in November.
Of the 44 countries of black Africa, more than half are severely in debt and have structurally weak economies, the World Bank said last month in an assessment of world debt. The economies are weak because of heavy dependence on volatile commodities, like coffee and tea, for exports; rapidly growing populations, and very little investment. Many of the economies have also been buckled by official corruption.
 
Differs From Reagan Policy
The decision to forgive the United States' debt is part of a policy adopted by the Bush Administration last year to do more to help the poorest countries. The Reagan Administration had refused to go along with some other Western nations, notably Britain, France, Canada and West Germany, which began canceling the official debts of sub-Saharan countries after an economic summit meeting in Toronto in 1988. The Reagan Administration chose instead to give the countries more time to pay.
By the end of 1988, the foreign debt of sub-Saharan Africa was about $140 billion, the World Bank reported. In comparison with Latin America's debt of hundreds of millions of dollars, the sub-Saharan debt is relatively small. But unlike the Latin debt, much of which is owed to commercial banks, Africa's is mostly owed to governments and multilateral agencies like the World Bank.
Economists have pointed out that the annual cost of servicing Africa's debt is about $12 billion. As poor as it is, Africa continues to be a net exporter of resources, paying more in debt service than the total of what it receives in foreign aid and earns from commodity exports, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
Don Harrison, deputy chief of the Planning Analysis and Research Division at the United States Agency for International Development, said that servicing the debt consumed much of the foreign exchange needed to purchase goods and services and supply investment capital for economic growth and development.
 
Kenya Among the Better Off
Of the 12 countries where Washington is forgiving its loans, Kenya is one of the most prosperous, with a per-capita income of $330. But even so, Western donors including the United States have expressed concern at the Kenyan Government's growing reliance on foreign aid to pay for spending and budget deficits.
The donors have also informed the Kenyans that the Government is seeking too many large-scale commercial loans from abroad for items like aircraft for the national airline and a 60-story office tower.
The United States is canceling its economic loans for countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Malawi and Madagascar. Some of the loans, dating back 25 years, when Kenya obtained independence from Britain, were granted largely for spending on public works.

HEADLINE: A Slow Start Is Seen for The Infiniti

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The initial sales of the Nissan Motor Company's Infiniti, the newest Japanese entrant in the profitable luxury car segment, have not been as strong as expected, some industry analysts and dealers say.
More than 1,700 of the cars were sold from the time of their introduction, in early November, to the end of December. Some analysts said they had expected greater sales, based on the 50 dealers lined up to sell the cars, the volume of shipments from Japan and the heavy consumer traffic in Infiniti showrooms.
Analysts say the Infiniti's initial results can be attributed to the industrywide slump and the timing of the car's introduction, which coincided with the normally slow holiday period, rather than to any flaw in the car or its marketing strategy. 
''The issue of Infiniti's slow sales does not center on the product or its distribution,'' said Christopher W. Cedergren, an analyst for J. D. Power & Associates. ''It is linked to something that Nissan has little control over, and that is the decline in overall auto sales.''
 
Nissan Expects Steady Growth
Nissan executives defended the Infiniti's early record, saying they expect the car's sales to grow steadily.
''We would be really pleased if no one could keep the Infiniti in their dealerships,'' said Don Spetner, a spokesman for the division. ''But two or three years from now, no one will remember what time of the year we launched the car or whether it had any impact on sales.''
The Infiniti's initial results have also focused renewed attention on Nissan's unconventional advertising campaign, which features images of natural settings and talks about a Japanese instinct for balance and harmony in design, but never shows the car.
Several dealers credited the ads with distinguishing the Infiniti from other models and generating curiosity among prospective buyers. But fewer than 5 percent of the more than 35,000 customers lured to Infiniti showrooms by late December decided to drive the car home, according to Nissan. The figure is considered somewhat lower than normal, Mr. Cedergren said.
 
'A Lot of Negative Reaction'
To the relief of some dealers, Nissan plans to include glimpses of the car in new ads. ''At this point, not showing the car on television has been a hindrance,'' said Mike Charapp, executive vice president of Rosenthal Infiniti in Tysons Corner, Va. ''We're getting a lot of negative reaction from the customers.''
But Mr. Charapp said the sale of 35 Infinitis in December ''put us right about where we wanted to be.''
Ron Hrapsky, who manages an Infiniti dealership in Houston, said sales had been ''a little lower than we expected, and our inventory is a little higher than we would like.''
 
'We've Done Very Well'
Robert M. Dekoy, sales manager of Loeber Infiniti in Chicago, said, ''For a largely unknown, brand new product at the slowest time of the year, we've done very well.'' Mr. Dekoy said he had less than a month's supply of cars, suggesting that sales had been adequate since the dealership opened on Nov. 8.
Over all, the end of the year was mixed for the luxury car makers, including those in Europe that stand to lose the most from the new thrust by Toyota and Nissan into the prestige segment. December was the best month of the year for Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo posted record sales in the fourth quarter. But BMW, Porsche and Jaguar had weak results in December.
The Toyota Motor Company's Lexus, the other major new luxury offering from Japan, fared well in December, with sales of 4,500 cars. The Lexus has thus topped Toyota's target of 16,000 sales since the car was introduced in August.
But given the growing competition in the luxury car segment and industry conditions, Toyota executives have decided to scale back their sales targets for 1990 by 20 percent, to 60,000 Lexus sedans and coupes from 75,000.
''As we get into 1990, both Lexus and Infiniti will have to work harder than they expected to sell cars,'' said Mr. Cedergren of J. D. Power. ''In a sluggish sales environment, no one will have a guaranteed situation, no matter how good their cars are.''

Adding Noise to Cut a Car's Noise

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Automobile engineers seeking to make a car quieter have typically padded body panels with a bit of cloth or fiberglass and added rubber to motor mounts. Now, researchers at Lotus Engineering in Britain have devised a way to cut interior noise with microphones and microchips, a technique dubbed ''anti-noise.''
The basic principle of anti-noise -stifling sound by creating the acoustic mirror image of the unwanted noise - has been known for decades. But it is the recent use of specialized computer chips, called digital signal processors, that made it possible for Lotus to develop a lightweight noise-muffling gear that should add only about $150 to a car's price if the car already has a stereo. 
Lotus has tested its anti-noise device in a variety of vehicles and expects to produce the system commercially within two years.
The engineers at Lotus, which is owned by the General Motors Corporation, have tackled one of the few areas of automotive technology that has improved little in recent years. Cars have become faster and more frugal with a gallon of gasoline, but most have not become quieter. And the smaller-engine models tend to be noisier than heavier cars.
Indeed, the four-cylinder engines now commonly used are more economical, but have more inherent vibration than six- or eight-cylinder versions, and lightweight bodies are more resonant, amplifying engine vibration, exhaust and road noise into a constant drone of background noise. Traditional noise reduction techniques add weight and are only partly effective.
 
Sound Is Analyzed
So Lotus researchers turned to electronics. They mount microphones, which monitor noise, in the car's passenger compartment and feed the information to a small computer. The computer analyzes the sound and produces a signal, through the car's stereo speakers, that is identical in pitch and volume but reversed, so that the peaks of its sound waves coincide with the troughs of the original noise, effectively canceling most of what is known as the resonant boom. The anti-noise signal is not audible on its own and does not interfere with music reproduction.
While the concept of reducing noise by producing twice as much of it seems odd, it is by no means new.
''The first patent we dug up was filed in the U.S. in 1934,'' said Malcolm McDonald, general manager of noise, vibration and harshness for Lotus Engineering, the research and consulting unit of Group Lotus, the British sports car company. The procedure has been made possible recently by ''advances in digital signal processing and the modern digital signal processing chip,'' Mr. McDonald said. He added, ''We are using not just one speaker, but four or six and feedback from six microphones; it's the ability to process that all very rapidly which has made it possible.''
 
A Computer on a Chip
Like the microprocessor at the heart of a personal computer, a digital signal processor is essentially a computer on a chip. But it is optimized for certain intense kinds of computation rather than the general purpose input and output functions of a standard microprocessor. Thus, digital signal processors, like the Texas Instruments Inc. chip used by Lotus, are extremely fast and can process several tasks at once.
Digital signal processors are also relatively inexpensive, allowing Lotus to add an anti-noise system to a car already equipped with a good stereo system for about $150. Previous anti-noise systems, also known as active noise cancellation devices, have cost $18,000 to $25,000, limiting their use to aircraft cockpits and industrial installations. Mr. McDonald said the cost could drop as low as $15 in a few years.
Mr. McDonald declined to name customers for the system as Lotus's consulting contracts are confidential. But he said the company was working with a number of auto makers around the world and had installed anti-noise devices in more than 30 cars. The greatest noise reduction was 27 decibels in a van; in typical cars, the noise level was reduced by 10 to 20 decibels. Every 10 decibels cut is half the noise, on a logarithmic scale.
 
'It Gets Far Quieter'
''It's quite dramatic,'' said Peter Egan, senior editor of Road & Track magazine, who drove several antinoise-equipped cars at Lotus's headquarters. ''You can get in a cheap little econobox car that's pretty noisy; flick the switch and it gets far quieter, much smoother sounding,'' he said.
Mr. Egan noted that four to six pounds of anti-noise equipment could accomplish more than 100 pounds of sound-deadening material. ''I think there will be a lot of interest when people understand what it is and what it can do,'' he said.
The Lotus anti-noise system is designed to curb mainly lower frequencies, where most ''booms,'' or crests of resonant background noise, occur. In addition, the Lotus unit cancels only constant noise, so sounds like speech and police sirens are not affected. But an advantage of the system over traditional methods is that it can simultaneously reduce noise from several sources, and at different points in the car.
''When it was cut in at full boom, the noise-reducing effect of the system was immediately impressive,'' Steve Cropley, editor of the British magazine Car, wrote after driving an antinoise-equipped Toyota Celica. The magazine has often described this model as ''boomy'' at British freeway speeds. ''It wasn't that the engine itself seemed to get much quieter, but the oppressiveness of the boom vibration, which seemed to arrive at the ears from every direction, was simply eliminated,'' Mr. Cropley wrote.
 
Starts Auto Vibration
Booms are a problem to auto manufacturers because the insides of car bodies have a resonant frequency, much like the inside of a guitar. Noise that excites that resonance sets the car to vibrating, creating a standing wave of sound that is almost self-sustaining. But this same principle actually works for the Lotus system when anti-noise is applied.
Because the boom is a resonance, ''You need very little power to excite it, very little to cancel it,'' Mr. McDonald said. The Lotus system uses only one watt of power to cancel a standing wave by 20 decibels, he said. In contrast, one headlight consumes 55 watts. This means the car need not have a huge stereo system to employ anti-noise devices.
Lotus will offer anti-noise systems to all automobile manufacturers when the system is produced, within two years, the company said. But it has no plans to incorporate it in its own cars, neither the $80,000 Turbo Esprit nor the just-introduced $35,000 Elan. Part of the reason is that these cars are quite boom-free by design, Mr. McDonald said, but he added that part of the reason was that ''a sports car needs to sound like a sports car; it has to make a certain amount of noise.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Finish Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Concern about a rush of new longer-term securities continued to build in the credit markets yesterday as dealers prepared to place bids on $7.5 billion of seven-year Treasury notes.
The worries, expressed by many over the course of the session, had little ultimate impact in the secondary market for Treasury securities, where prices were little changed and volume remained light.
Once again, participants said that the bulk of the day's activity was concentrated among longer-term issues, which have been under selling pressure since the start of the year. Meanwhile, prices of bills and shorter-term note were firm. 
 
Worry About the Japanese
''In the long end, there is concern about upcoming supply, and there is a real worry about whether the Japanese will be players this year,'' one government bond trader said. ''The Japanese bought 40 percent of the last two bonds that were auctioned, and they probably won't do that again. There is a fear factor out there, and as a consequence there is nobody home in the long end.''
The flow of new issues begins today, when the Treasury is expected to auction $7.5 billion of new seven-year notes. In coming weeks dealers will be asked to cope with an expected $5 billion worth of new long-term bonds from the Resolution Funding Corporation and the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions in February.
Concern about potential Japanese interest in upcoming Treasury auctions - a trait of the 1980's that has been carried into the new decade -was heightened recently by a dramatic narrowing of interest rate differentials around the world.
With yields on securities in strong-currency countries like West Germany and Japan at levels that have not been seen in years, some market participants and analysts are concerned that foreign capital once headed for the United States may flow elsewhere.
''As of Tuesday's close in Japan, the yield on the 10-year Government bond stood at 6.18 percent,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''That is less than 200 basis points under comparable yields on 10-year Treasuries. In April and May, that spread was over 400 basis points.''
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Worries Called Overblown
But some market participants said the worries were overblown because making money in an environment where interest rates were declining was easier to accomplish than in a market where rates were moving higher.
''Over the last three or four months, my colleagues in Tokyo have had a stance that rates in Germany and Japan were going up, and the only market where the trend was not up was the United States,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''As long as the belief continues to exist that those forces are in motion, it doesn't make a difference what the spread is.''
Treasury prices ended the day little changed, despite all the worries. In late trading, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 100 13/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 8.08 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/8, unchanged on the day, to yield 8 percent.
Meanwhile, the seven-year notes to be auctioned this afternoon were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.99 percent.
 
Bill Rates Off a Bit
Treasury bill rates eased slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.52 percent, down three basis points. Six-month bill rates dipped by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.41 percent. One-year bill rates fell by a like amount, to an offered rate of 7.25 percent.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by a competitive bid offering of $120 million worth of general obligation bonds from the State of Washington.
A bid from an investment group led by Goldman, Sachs won the issue, which consists of serial and term bonds.
Maturities on the serial bonds range from 1991 to 2010, with coupons from 5.70 percent in 1991 to 6.80 percent in 2010.
The term issue, which matures in 2015, carries a coupon of 6 3/4 percent.
The issue is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary corporate bond market said that prices of most issues were unchanged to down an eighth of a point. Municipal bond prices dipped by about an eighth of a point, according to traders.

HEADLINE: THE U.S. AND PANAMA;
PANAMA TO ASSIST U.S. ON DRUG WAR

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Panama's new civilian Government signed an accord with the United States today in which it pledged to cooperate in efforts to crack down on narcotics trafficking and money laundering.
The broadly worded agreement was announced here by Melvyn Levitsky, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters. It was described by American officials as a necessary legal prelude to restoring a variety of preferential trade agreements that were suspended by Congress over the last two years, during the step-up in American efforts to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
But Mr. Levitsky made it clear that he and other officials hoped that in signing the pact, the three-week-old Panamanian Government had committed itself to a whole range of measures to combat drug traffickers, including rules to discourage the use of the banking system for disguising deposits of drug money. 
 
Secrecy Laws in Question
Ideally, American officials said, this would involve modifications in Panama's strict bank secrecy laws, which were instituted more than 20 years ago by General Noriega's predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, and which helped transform this country into a major international banking center.
But the prospect that the Government might move to loosen rules insuring the confidentiality of bank accounts has disturbed many bankers and entrepreneurs here, and could become a major point of friction between the Bush Administration and President Guillermo Endara.
Some United States officials suggested that Panama could subject its bankers to the same requirements as American banks.
''It's what we want a lot of countries to do,'' a senior American diplomat said. ''They should keep records of transactions in the same way we do in the United States, that is, of deposits of U.S. dollars over $10,000 and then make those records available to us on request.''
 
Up to Panama, the U.S. Says
Mr. Levitsky insisted that the United States would not try to impose controls on Panama.
''It's for the Panamanian Government to decide how to structure its banking regulations,'' Mr. Levitsky said. ''We have some ideas, and we can certainly talk with them, but it's ultimately their decision.''
''But,'' he added, ''I think the bankers will see that if Panama is pictured as a place where you can still launder money, it's not good for banking, it's not good for commerce, it's not good for the country.''
President Endara had no immediate statement on the four-page ''mutual cooperation agreement,'' which was signed by Ramon Lima, Deputy Minister of Government and Justice and Secretary Levitsky.
But an American official involved in talks with Mr. Endara on Tuesday said that specific measures that might grow out of the pact were not discussed, and a senior Endara aide said later that ''it's too early to say what we're going to do.''
 
Police Force May Be a Problem
Besides possible changes in banking regulations, American officials also said the Panamanians would have to decide how to structure their newly created police force to deal with drug trafficking, a decision that would undoubtedly be complicated by the fact that many members of the new Public Force served under General Noriega and may themselves have been involved in drugs.
''It's going to be hard to find wholly clean people,'' the senior American diplomat said. ''They'll have to watch their officer corps very carefully.''
During the talks on Tuesday, the senior diplomat said, American officials told the Panamanians that it would be important to keep their drug-enforcement units separate from the rest of the police ranks.
''The money is so big that you want to insulate whatever kind of organization you have working on drugs against the temptation,'' the diplomat said.
He and other United States officials acknowledged that bringing Panama into partnership in the war on drugs would be a delicate and probably long-term problem.
''We do not want to give an indication that we're taking advantage of the situation to impose a bunch of stuff on the Panamanians,'' one American official said.
''In the first place, if you try to impose it, it will bring resentment later and it won't be as effective. So we want to work with them gradually to do this.
''That's why,'' he said, ''this is a very general agreement today, and we'll have to come back here and talk about some of the specifics when they're ready to do it.
''But they're not ready yet,'' the diplomat said, ''because you've got a very small number of people at the top who are very committed but who do not yet have a support structure to deal with it.''
 
Money-Laundering Center
Although President Bush and other officials have characterized the American overthrow of General Noriega last month as a major victory against drug trafficking, many law-enforcement officials say that over the years Panama was far more important as a money-laundering center for billions of dollars in drug profits than as a narcotics transshipment point.
The institution of the bank-secrecy laws here helped build a network of more than 600 banks and bank offices in Panama, whose deposits totaled $40 billion in 1987. At the time, law enforcement officials say, banks here were laundering untold amounts of money.
But after the imposition of a series of economic sanctions by the Reagan Administration - which led to a general strike and the shutdown of the banking system in March 1988 - deposits shrank to $15 million as customers took their money and ran.
As a result, American officials say, Panama's importance as a money-laundering center waned as drug traffickers shifted their accounts to other offshore accounts in such places as the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Uruguay and Europe.
For that reason, Panamanian bankers say that modifying the bank secrecy laws is equivalent to closing the barn door after the horse is long gone. Worse, they say, it will new customers at precisely the time when Panama needs all the help it can get rebuilding its shattered economy, whose gross national product dropped 20 percent in 1988 alone.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Seek Lower Federal Role in Transportation

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In a preview of the Bush Administration's national transportation policy, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner today called for state and local governments to pay more of the costs of programs that have been financed primarily by the Federal Government.
''We believe recipients of Federal transportation aid should pay a larger share of project costs,'' Mr. Skinner said in a speech at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board, a private, nonprofit organization.
''Reduced dependence on Federal money,'' he said, would be a fundamental precept of the new transportation policy, which is to be published by the Administration in February after President Bush delivers his State of the Union Message and submits his budget for the next fiscal year to Congress. 
Mr. Skinner's speech suggested that the policy, under development at the Transportation Department since Mr. Bush took office a year ago, would bear the hallmark of economic conservatism: reliance on deregulation and on state and local government and private enterprise.
 
Policy Seen as Compromise
Officials involved in developing the policy said it represented a compromise between the views of Mr. Skinner, who is considered an economic activist, and the President's more laissez-faire economic policy advisers, including Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
But the officials maintained that the Administration's internal review of the transportation policy was not a fight between competing views of economic policy. As evidence, they said Mr. Skinner last month accepted without argument the budget office's outline of his department's budget for the fiscal year 1991. By contrast, some departments often return to the budget office with a final plea for more money after receiving its recommendations.
Moreover, Mr. Skinner, a former Bush campaign aide who was head of Chicago's mass transit authority, has frequently said that he is committed to the President's declared policies of not raising taxes and of generally freezing Federal spending levels.
In his speech, the Secretary agreed with the mainstream opinion of transportation experts: that the nation's congested and decaying network of roads, railways and airports must be rebuilt, and that the investment of billions of dollars in the transportation system will virtually pay for itself by promoting economic growth and productivity.
 
The 'User Fee Principle'
But his message is sure to disappoint some in the transportation industry, including the operators of urban mass transit systems, who have been urging a sharply higher level of Federal spending paid for by increases in taxes, including the Federal gasoline tax. That tax helps pay for the construction and maintenance of Federal highways, but it also helps subsidize mass transit systems.
Mr. Skinner said in his speech today that the Government's transportation policy would seek ''new and creative ways to apply the time-tested user fee principle.'' He said this would include ''making it easier for other levels of government to levy user fees for transportation improvements.''
Ideas favored in the Transportation Department include allowing local airports to charge departure fees on all passengers. The policy will also call for more private investment, like the operation of toll roads by private corporations, Mr. Skinner said, and will seek further deregulation of interstate trucking.
At a Washington seminar on airport financing on Tuesday, several aviation officials endorsed the idea of letting airports levy a departure fee on passengers to help pay for expanding the air transportation system. Airline passengers already pay an 8 percent Federal ticket tax. A departure fee has been viewed as duplicative, and Congress has banned such fees for many years.

HEADLINE: Turnaround on the Farm As Price of Milk Rises

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAIZE, Kan.

 BODY:
Gene Woodward stood looking out over a barnyard where his cows stood chewing, a cold drizzle dampening their black and white flanks. Their bellies were full and their udders heavy with milk.
This was clearly a healthy and productive herd in an industry for which things are looking up after a long history of problems. And as a result of a six-month surge in milk prices, Mr. Woodward is enjoying healthy profits. 
''Dairying is good right now, with prices at $15 a hundredweight,'' Mr. Woodward said as he sought shelter from the rain. But he added that feed prices have also been rising and that nobody can predict how long the sudden jump in milk prices will last. Some experts say a downturn is already in sight.
Mr. Woodward's mood, like that of his neighbors, Paul Siler and his son, Bob, reflects a general ebullience in dairy regions. But industry experts doubt that a long-lasting resolution of the dairy industry's problems and tight profit margins has been found.
 
Farmers Glad, but Cautious
''The mood has been one of elation for six months because of the prices,'' said Zane Akins, chief executive officer of the Holstein-Friesian Association, an organization of breeders and herd owners. ''The rise has made it possible for them to pay off some debts, but you don't see anybody rushing out to buy a lot of new equipment. They've been operating in a business without much of a profit margin.''
In what the experts call a sort of economic accident, prices paid to dairymen started rising last July, when payments to farmers in the major dairy states of Minnesota and Wisconsin averaged $11.76 per 100 pounds. By December the price had risen 31 percent. At the same time retail prices in the north-central states were rising more than 10 percent.
For a long time the number of dairy farmers, like that of farmers in general, has been falling, despite costly Government efforts to support prices and profits. From 1978 to 1988, the number of dairy operations dropped 40 percent, to 220,880 from 369,210.
 
Outpacing Consumption
In 1949 Congress passed legislation that, with few basic changes, continues to regulate dairy operations. It mandates that the Government buy dairy products at prices calculated to enable processors to pay at least a specified price - now $10.60 a hundred pounds -to dairymen for their milk.
As a result, while dairies produced more than consumers could use, the surpluses piled up. By 1983 nonfat dry milk in storage totaled over 1.3 billion pounds, about a year's supply. Supporters of the program viewed this as a cushion against scarcity; its critics saw the surplus as needless and costly.
In 1985 and 1986 the Government began a concerted effort to reduce the surpluses and cut the dairy program's cost. It began buying herds of cattle for slaughter to cut milk production and sought to get rid of the surpluses by giving millions of pounds of cheese and dry milk to programs like school lunches and soup kitchens.
The cattle-buying appears to have had little impact. Though it helped continue a long-term decline in the number of dairy cattle, genetic improvements in the remaining herds went on increasing milk production.
 
Roller Coaster and Surge
Disposing of the surpluses was another matter. In mid-1989, drought and forage problems resulted in a rarity for the industry - a decrease in production. It came at the same time as an unforeseen drop in foreign milk production produced a surge in demand for American dairy products.
But because American warehouses had been emptied of the surpluses of nearly everything except butter, the cushion against scarcity was no longer there. Prices spurted.
The surge came after a roller-coaster ride of sorts for industry profits. Operating margins - the difference between cash costs and money received after an allowance for depreciation - amounted to $322 a cow in 1987, but fell to $134 in 1988.
''That's poverty wages for most farms,'' said Mr. Akins, the industry expert. ''For a farm with 100 cows -and that's a good-size farm, usually involving several members of a family and often more than one family -that's only $13,400 a year.''
With the surge in prices, the net income from dairying rebounded in 1989, according to Department of Agriculture estimates, to $253 a cow. For a 100-cow farm, that would amount to about $25,300 a year.
 
Farm Pays for Educations
Experiences, of course, vary widely from farm to farm. In 1987, according to an Agriculture Department study, operating margins ranged from about $5,900 for dairy farms with milk sales of $30,000 a year to an average of more than $500,000 a year for those with sales above $1 million.
Mr. Woodward, who is 45 years old, runs an efficent 106-cow operation with his father and a brother. Their cows produce about 18,700 pounds of milk a year, he said, about 4,800 pounds more than the national average. The farm, which helped send Mr. Woodward to college many years ago, has also paid for college educations for his son and daughter.
Mr. Woodward's neighbors, the Silers, offered figures showing even greater production, about 20,800 pounds a cow for their 99-cow herd. They also showed figures indicating a profit margin of $580 a cow this year, far above the national average.
''It's the production that does it,'' Paul Siler said, citing improvements in his herd. ''In the last 10 years we've come up about 5,000 pounds. If we were still making the 15,500 pounds a head we made 10 years ago, we wouldn't be in business.''
Mr. Woodard said dairying ''can be a good life if you enjoy it enough to work seven days a week every month of the year.''
''When most people were devoting Christmas Day to their families, we still had to take care of the cows,'' he said. . ''It's hard work, but I wouldn't have it any other way.''

HEADLINE: Lean Budget Plan in California

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 10

 BODY:
Gov. George Deukmejian today proposed a lean $53.7 billion budget for California, calling for freezes in spending on health, welfare, AIDS programs and other social services.
The spending plan for the next fiscal year, Mr. Deukmejian's last year as Governor, represents an increase of 7.3 percent over the current year's budget, and is double the state budget proposed when he took office seven years ago. But it does not keep pace with rapid increases in state program costs, chiefly for welfare and prisons.
Although the budget left little room for new programs, Mr. Deukmejian, a Republican, did propose a new $2 billion loan program to aid first-time home buyers and $15 million to build low-income housing in areas devastated by the earthquake in October.
 
Objections by Democrats
Final negotiations on the budget will begin in May, when the latest revenue figures are available. But early indications are that Democrats, whose votes are need for passage in the Legislature, will fight for increases in money for health and welfare services and cuts elsewhere in the budget.
Governor Deukmejian said the state's revenue grew by 8.4 percent last year, but mandatory cost-of-living increases in benefits under programs like Aid for Families with Dependent Children and Services for Home-Bound Elderly and Disabled Californians would force the state budget to grow by 11 percent.
He proposed that the Legislature enact bills to freeze such aid programs at current levels so as to balance the budget.
''We must face reality,'' the Governor said. ''Any government whose base budget is on autopilot to grow 11 percent a year - beyond inflation and population growth - is headed for trouble.''
Budget drafters are also hamstrung by an initiative approved by the voters in 1988 that requires that 40.9 percent of tax revenues go to the public schools.

HEADLINE: Several Governors Oppose Plan on Acid Rain

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Several governors whose states have already cut the air pollution causing acid rain today denounced a plan that would have them help pay for reducing the problem in other parts of the country.
At a news conference here, the Alliance for Acid Rain Control, a coalition of governors, environmentalists and business leaders from states that have made a substantial investment to reduce the smokestack emissions that lead to acid rain, said the plan was unfair.
''It's hard to see why consumers in states that have already done their part should be paying a second time for those who have dragged their feet on environmental protection,'' said Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, co-chairman of the alliance. He was joined by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Gov. Mike Sullivan of Wyoming. 
The alliance issued a study indicating that utilities in lower Midwestern states like Ohio, Indiana and Illinois that were responsible for much of the pollution charged substantially lower electric rates than power companies in states that have already acted to clean up their emissions. But government officials and utility spokesmen in that band of states disputed the rate survey findings. They also said that, under pending Federal legislation, their states would be required to bear too heavy a share of the economic burden of reducing acid rain.
Legislation proposed by President Bush to strengthen the Clean Air Act, awaiting action in somewhat revised form in Congress, would require, among other things, that coal-fired power plants reduce their smokestack emissions of sulfur dioxide, a major contributor to acid rain, by 50 percent, or 10 million tons, by the year 2000.
Acid rain is created when sulfur and nitrogen oxides flow up into the atmosphere and fall back to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog and dust. Much of this pollution originates in the industrial Midwest but is deposited in the Northeast and Canada, where, according to scientific studies, it destroys aquatic life, damages buildings and may play a role in damaging forests.
 
Utilities Want Costs Shared
Utilities from the lower Midwestern states, supported by their state governments, contend that acid rain is a national problem and that the cost of dealing with it should be shared by the entire nation. Several members of Congress from the Midwest have called for the addition of a cost-sharing provision to the pending legislation.
Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee, said the pending legislation ''is fundamentally unfair and flawed because it asks 13 states to make emissions reductions not only for themselves but for others as well.''
The President opposes the cost-sharing proposal on the ground that it would be tantamount to a tax on the states with lower sulfur emissions and a subsidy for the heavily polluting states.
''Asking other states to pick up the tab for their cleanup is like asking a middle class family to help a rich family absorb the financial shock of losing a tax loophole,'' Governor Thompson said.
But John L. Stowell, chairman of the Coalition for Acid Rain Equity, a group of utilities and companies that is pressing for cost-sharing legislation, said that the alliance study released was misleading and that there was actually little difference in rate structures.
Mr. Stowell said the study lumped industrial rates, which are lower because they are offered at a discount to heavy users, with residential rates. Because the Midwest is more heavily industrialized than other areas, the combined rates are lower, he said. But he added that residential consumers in the Midwestern states pay just as much as in other parts of the country.
In addition to those at the news conference, the alliance includes the Governors of Colorado, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey and North Carolina. Former Governors Scott M. Matheson of Utah, Anthony S. Earl of Wisconsin and Bruce E. Babbitt of Arizona are also members.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
For Judge in Keating Case, Being on the Bench Is Not Sitting on the Sidelines

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
It was a moment that Judge Stanley Sporkin obviously relished.
Seated in his elevated chair in a packed Federal courtroom in downtown Washington last Friday morning, Judge Sporkin peered down at a nervous Charles H. Keating Jr., the man the Government has accused of causing the largest savings and loan failure on record. For the first time, Mr. Keating was testifying under oath about the savings and loan collapse.
Over the next six hours of a preliminary hearing, Judge Sporkin questioned, interrogated, debated and chatted with Mr. Keating about Mr. Keating's contention, spelled out in a lawsuit, that the Government had unfairly seized his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Judge Sporkin's performance ran the gamut - from expressions of near-compassion for Mr. Keating to blunt anger at the banker's lawyers. 
''We knew Sporkin liked to ask questions, but we didn't know how much he liked to ask questions,'' said one Keating attorney.
 
In the Middle, Again
To his friends and critics, it was classic Stan Sporkin, variously provocative and gentle, witty and tough, skeptical and respectful, a no-nonsense judge who does not shrink from getting into the middle of a good legal debate.
Beyond this, Judge Sporkin's performance on the bench marked the latest chapter of a highly visible and unpredictable Washington career, 30 years of Government service that has left both strong supporters and detractors.
''You've just got to call them the way you see them,'' said Judge Sporkin, whose favorite posture in the courtroom seems to be leaning back in an almost supine position on his chair with his half-rim glasses perched on his forehead, eyes peering at the ceiling. ''But you've got to be fair and treat people decently.''
And to the surprise of Mr. Keating's attorneys, who had warned the Phoenix real estate developer that he might be in for some rough attacks by Government lawyers or Judge Sporkin, the 57-year-old judge at times seemed almost friendly to the man regulators say embodies the abuses of the savings and loan industry.
 
The Lawyers Are Scolded
As the day progressed, Mr. Keating turned from a subdued, almost uneasy witness to a man emboldened in his pronouncements that he had been wronged by regulators, obviously welcoming the public forum Judge Sporkin had granted him.
But the judge did not have kind words for Mr. Keating's lawyers. When one stood up in the afternoon and objected to the scope of questions his client was being asked, Judge Sporkin's temper flared.
''You're not going to strong-arm this court,'' he scolded the lawyers.
It was hardly the first time in recent weeks that Judge Sporkin has drawn attention. A 'Keystone Kops' Operation? Presiding over the Charles Lewis case, in which the former employee of the District of Columbia was charged with dealing cocaine, Judge Sporkin would not permit the Government to have Mr. Lewis testify in secret that he had sold drugs to Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. So the allegation, denied by Mr. Barry, came out in open court, drawing front-page attention and dominating local television news shows.
Judge Sporkin also criticized as a ''Keystone Kops'' operation the drug arrest in Washington's Lafayette Park set up by the Government to use as an illustration in a nationally televised speech by President Bush.
Indeed, in a city where many public people fall into a knee-jerk ideological mold, whether liberal or conservative, the person of Stanley Sporkin, a Republican who switched his registration to independent, is complex and unpredictable For years, he was a thorn in the side of the conservative business establishment. As head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division from 1974 to 1981, he brought dozens of highly visible and embarrassing cases against corporate giants, accusing them of making payoffs to foreign officials.
 
A Strange Leap in Seen
But to his liberal friends, he made a strange leap, taking the job as general counsel at the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 under his friend William J. Casey. Mr. Sporkin later paid a major role in formulating a legal justification for the covert sale of arms to Iran. (Later, some of the profits from the sale went illegally to the Nicaraguan contras, a deal that Judge Sporkin denies knowing about.) ''Stanley has a feeling for proper conduct that overrides everything else,'' said Irving M. Pollack, a former commissioner of the S.E.C.
''That is what people don't undertand,'' he said, adding that they mistake his aggressiveness for meanness. ''It's just the opposite. He understands that all of us are not godly.''
For his part, Judge Sporkin maintains that the various twists in his career fit neatly into what he terms a view of public policy tinged with ''naivete.''
 
Doesn't Like Compromise
''The premise I operate on is that this is the greatest country the world has ever known, that the freedoms we have and the free enterprise system are the reasons it's so good, and that you cannot afford to compromise those freedoms,'' he said.
''The bribery cases were done on that premise,'' he added. ''I was told that this was done all over the world. My answer was that it is not legal, and it is wrong, and that you cannot accept these shortcomings just because everyone is doing it. The system must work as nearly perfect as possible.''
Judge Sporkin justifies his work at the C.I.A. in the same way, that an effective intelligence network is essential to national security. Moreover, he had become very close to Mr. Casey when he was with the S.E.C. So when Mr. Casey offered him a job at the C.I.A., he jumped at the opportunity.
''Casey was probably the brightest man I have ever met in my life,'' Judge Sporkin said. ''I believe in our country, and I believed in what the C.I.A. was doing, and it was fine.''
 
His Father's Footsteps
Now, on the Federal bench, he sees his work as only an extension of the earlier phases of his career.
And indeed the appointment to the bench was the fulfillment of a lifelong desire for Judge Sporkin, whose father, Maurice Sporkin, was a Federal judge in Philadelphia when Stanley Sporkin was growing up.
After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Pennsylvania State University, where he majored in accounting, he earned a law degree at Yale in 1957, beginning a 29-year path that ended in his appointment to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.
Judge Sporkin is married to an artist, Judith, and has three grown children.
 
Don't Fence Him In
As he has done in other positions, he moves beyond the immediate scope of his office. Since the stock market crash of 1987, he has repeatedly made speeches on the need to reform the nation's securities markets, drawing on his S.E.C. experience, and has proposed a very controversial proposal for reform that would call for considerable governmental intervention.
Among other things, he would support a law that would ban certain highly popular types of computerized program trading, creating a system in which speculators would not be able to use such new investment tools as stock-index futures to influence the value of the stock market.
''Our markets are extremely important and becoming more so every day, particularly as more pension fund money is put into them,'' Judge Sporkin said. ''But just think of the guy who had to cash out his pension fund the day after the market crashed. It went down because of speculation, not because the underlying economic value of those stocks had changed dramatically. We have to protect those people from this type of volatility.''
 
The World Is Smaller
He says there is a growing need for an international securities commission to regulate global trading as securities market become more and more linked internationally.
Judge Sporkin has also been outspoken on another issue that has become, in a chilling way, very real to him and his colleagues: the protection of Federal judges.
A member of a task force studying that problem, he says judges need to have, at a minimum, mobile telephones issued to them in order to stay in touch with their offices. But ultimately, he predicts the Congress will have to appropriate funds for security personnel.
He notes a judge now only gets protection when there is a known threat.
''There is a tremendous gap between the protection we get and what other government officials get,'' said Judge Sporkin, who declined to discuss whether he personnally had received any threats.
 
Wide-Ranging Curiosity
Some say the activities outside his immediate caseload indicate that Judge Sporkin finds his current position somewhat confining, that he is seeing too many drug-related cases and that his wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, as well as his penchant for plunging into public policy debate, is not being satisfied.
He acknowledges that the speeches he has made on the need for market reform and for a more centralized regulation of the banking and securities industries are an effort to ''keep my mind from getting dull.''
The only other time his temper flared at Mr. Keating's attorneys was last August, when they filed a motion that Judge Sporkin disqualify himself because he was head of enforcement at the S.E.C. when the agency brought a securities-fraud case against Mr. Keating.
''That's what I call a chutzpah argument,'' the judge told Robert K. Huffman, a Keating lawyer. ''It doesn't make any sense that I have to now recuse myself in every case that came under my supervision over 20 years, that ridiculous.'' Something to Prove? But if Judge Sporkin has something to prove to his critics, he seems to be trying to do that in the Keating case.
In his days at the S.E.C., he was called heavy-handed and unfair by his critics, who said he brought cases that were more embarrassing than substantive. To some extent, that reputation has stuck.
Now, in his comments from the bench and in interviews, he seems bent on setting the record straight. And he might succeed. Attorneys on both sides give him high marks for his fairness.
''He has gone out of his way to be sure everyone has the opportunity to present what they wanted to present,'' said John E. Lundin, a Keating attorney who is a partner at the Phoenix law firm of Gallagher & Kennedy. ''I have become very comfortable being before him.''

HEADLINE: Letter: On Yugoslavia;
Why Not Ethnic Self-Determination?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''A Single Yugoslavia, Pluralized'' (editorial, Dec. 29) identifies the two main political and economic trends that exist in Yugoslavia: Slovenian and Croatian push for pluralism and market economy, and Serbian quest for recentralization. Your endorsement of pluralism is commendable.
However, by advocating a continuation of ''a single Yugoslavia'' as the only solution to the political and international problems in the country and in the region, you are a priori limiting the freedoms of the component nations to determine their own future. Thus, beside your support of a genuine pluralistic society, you should also encourage implementation of the principle of self-determination, and for once the rest of the world should respect the wishes of those peoples. 
Furthermore, you imply that the nations in that part of the world are not mature enough to choose for themselves, and therefore Washington, Moscow and others should ultimately decide their fate. While the international involvement is perhaps unavoidable, that should not limit the freedoms of those nations even before the process of democratization has begun. Why, for example, should the Slovenes, Croatians and others not be free to choose if they wish to continue as part of the Yugoslav state or not, just as the Baltic nations are questioning their union with the U.S.S.R.?
There is no reason why these and other nations cannot participate directly in the European and world community. By forcing them to continue to be a part of an undesired union (historical evidence strongly supports this claim), we are not resolving but prolonging the international and political crisis in that region. We should support the processes that will bring about genuine personal and national freedoms. Half-measures will resolve little and please few.

HEADLINE: Don't Despair of the World the Young Will Build;
Wrong on 60's and 80's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's not hard to discern that Christopher Lasch is another frustrated unfulfilled 1960's protester who agonizes over the economic and political successes that our country has experienced in the 80's. In speaking of today's youth he states: ''They do not find it easy to think that things are going to get any better. The dream of a better world collapsed in the late 60's, and nothing has taken its place.'' 
Professor Lasch is wrong on both counts: he doesn't understand today's youth, and he doesn't understand the 60's. I was a college student from 1966 to 1970, and I can assure today's youth that the spirit of the 60's was full of hypocrisy and a false perception of the outside world. Doing drugs was the popular culture; it was safe to drop acid and get in touch with yourself. Today's youth would find this shocking, but in the 60's Communism was in.
It was chic to have a copy of Mao Zedong's little red book, and some chanted in protest ''Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, N.L.F. is going to win.'' They wanted the United States out of Vietnam, so that peace could come. We got out, and the boat people let us know what it was like living under ''peaceful'' Communist tyranny. The youth of the 1960's have come to understand their immature babble, and that's why they have become the entrepreneurs of the 1980's, and most assuredly today's youth will follow right in our tracks.
Nor does Professor Lasch portray today's youth accurately. He says: ''they doubt the existence of the future . . . it is no wonder that young people long ago ceased to trust their elders.'' Excuse the bluntness, but this tired, unoriginal language is liberal claptrap.
I have 20 nieces and nephews, 6 have recently graduated from college, another is in college, and 2 more are in high school. Not one, among them or all their friends I've met, comes nearly close to the negative social character Professor Lasch portrays. Indeed, I am struck by how optimistic and, dare it be said, patriotic these young people are. They even translated Bruce Springsteen's antiwar, anti-Vietnam ''Born in the U.S.A.'' into a star-spangled patriotic anthem.
Professor Lasch seems to like malaise and just hopes that the sky will fall. It's sad, because it won't, and all the joy of life will pass him and his ilk by.

HEADLINE: Albany's Optimism Wanes As Budget Shortfall Grows

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 10

 BODY:
After several months of maintaining what analysts said was an overly optimistic view of New York's finances, the Cuomo administration today acknowledged that the state would end the fiscal year with a shortfall of almost $700 million.
Just a few weeks ago, administration officials had been denying reports that the shortfall would top $500 million.
The new estimate puts the shortfall at almost three times the last official estimate, which was released in November. The administration's latest revision of its budget figures reflects a pattern established during the last fiscal year, when the administration revised its financial estimates at least a half-dozen times. 
In a statement issued late this afternoon, the state's Budget Director, Dall W. Forsythe, attributed the growing budget gap to lower-than-expected tax collections in a number of areas.
 
Diminished Expectations
''Throughout the Northeast region of the United States, an economic slowdown has undermined projected revenues,'' Mr. Forsythe said.
The figures were released just six days before Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is to present his budget for the next fiscal year, which starts April 1. The dire circumstances they portray are likely to further diminish the already low expectations that most officials here have for the Governor's budget.
Because the budget gap has been acknowledged only late in the fiscal year, administration officials said it is unlikely that action will be taken to correct it before the next fiscal year. This means that the state will probably have to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars to meet its expenses through March. It also means that the shortfall for the fiscal year that starts in April is likely to grow to more than $2 billion. It is estimated now to be almost $1.5 billion.
Cuomo administration officials said that in the budget they will release on Tuesday they will present a plan to deal with the current year's gap as well as next year's.
 
Decline in Revenue
In November, the administration forecast a shortfall for the current fiscal year of $270 million. At that time, officials said costs for Medicaid and foster care were higher than anticipated and business-tax collections were lower than expected. By cutting state agency budgets by 2 percent, the administration was able to save roughly $130 million. This left a gap of $140 million in a total budget of almost $30 billion.
Until recently, adminstration officials insisted that the gap would not grow because tax collections would pick up in the second half of the fiscal year. But they said today that most taxe revenues had continued to decline.
Mr. Forsythe said that by the end of December, personal-income-tax collections were $260 million less than projected in November, while business taxes were off $166 million from earlier estimates. User fees and taxes were down $67 million and other tax revenues were off $73 million.
Financial analysts said they were disturbed by the new figures. ''The news is worse than we anticipated,'' said Hyman Grossman, a managing director of Standard & Poor's. ''We're going to have to see how the Governor tackles this next week.''
The state's worsening financial problems parallel those of New York City. Recently, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has said the city is facing a budget gap that would total $200 million, indefinitely delayed hiring a class of more than 1,800 police recruits to save money.

HEADLINE: An Office Tower On Park Ave. Will Be Rebuilt

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
The 32-story former ITT building in Manhattan will be redesigned and substantially rebuilt starting early next year, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday, making it ''the first new building project on Park Avenue in more than a decade.''
Plans for the redevelopment of the building at 320 Park Avenue at East 51st Street, which is owned by Olympia & York, were announced by Mayor Dinkins and ITT officials at a City Hall news conference.
The project, expected to be completed in 1993, will create an estimated 1,160 temporary jobs in the construction field and another 480 in supporting fields, as well as generate more than $17 million in taxes and other income to the city, said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. 
John E. Zuccotti, the president and chief executive officer of Olympia & York Companies (U.S.A.), the American subsidiary of the Toronto-based real-estate giant, emphasized that the redevelopment involved no city subsidies or tax abatements. Mr. Zuccotti, whom Mr. Dinkins described as ''an old friend in a new job,'' was First Deputy Mayor in the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame.
 
Asbestos Removal
It was the second time this week that the Mayor had held a news conference at City Hall to help announce a private project.
As he did earlier, when the accounting concern of Coopers & Lybrand announced it had leased 600,000 square feet of office space at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Dinkins pointed out that New York City, despite its financial problems, ''continues to produce and to generate jobs and revenue as companies and individuals invest in the future and grow.'' Coopers & Librand did not receive any city subsidies nor is it creating any new jobs.
The Park Avenue building, which was built in the 1960's, was acquired by Olympia & York, the largest commercial landlord in the city, in 1977. The building's primary tenant, ITT, will move early next year to another location - ''within New York City, of course, '' the Mayor said.
''With the building vacant,'' Mr. Dinkins added, ''Olympia & York will address an asbestos problem there.'' But he said that the owners will undertake ''a total redesign of the building, stripping it down to its original steel structure.''
The reconstructed building, like the current structure, will contain about 660,000 square feet of office space, said Meyer S. Frucher, the subsidiary's executive vice president for development. But he added that the existing steel frame will be reconfigured, providing larger tower floors and smaller base floors, giving the building a new look. It will be reclad in granite and reflective glass.
Mr. Frucher said the redevelopment would not affect an automobile showroom and a Japanese restaurant in the building. ''We will build around them,'' he said. The New York office of Skidmore Owings & Merrill will do the architectural work.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Casinos Fight Plan for Taxes On Gifts to Gamblers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 10

 BODY:
Atlantic City's casinos today tried to head off talk of a new tax on the complimentary items they dole out to high rollers with a study that they say shows Nevada is a far more hospitable place to do business.
Thomas Carver, head of the Atlantic City Casino Association, said at a news conference today that the casino industry is feeling the pinch of dropping profits. He said the industry is also hoping that Governor-elect James J. Florio will address some of the serious problems that plague the seaside resort. 
''It's often been said to us, 'You knew the rules of New Jersey when you came here,' '' Mr. Carver said. ''That's probably a fair statement. But one segment could change, and that's the issue of taxation.''
Some lawmakers have talked of extending the luxury tax on Atlantic City hotel rooms to cover the complimentary rooms, food, and beverages given out by the gaming halls to heavy bettors. Talk of such a tax expansion has been coupled with a search for sources of financing for a new convention center.
 
Lower Taxes in Nevada
A study by a Rutgers University professor, David Listokin, showed that the casino industry has paid $3.6 billion in local, state and Federal taxes and regulatory fees since the start of gaming in 1978; 58 percent of that has gone to the state.
New Jersey casinos pay taxes at a rate twice as high as those in Nevada, the study said.
''If New Jersey taxed us at the same rate that Nevada taxes its casinos, then we would have earned approximately $250 million more between 1978 and 1988,'' Mr. Carver said.
He said he is not proposing that New Jersey lower its 8 percent tax on casino revenues. But he said lawmakers should move with caution if they want to raise taxes.
He said that casinos are already weathering tough financial times, and that placing a greater burden on them could hurt a critical source of state revenue and the underpinnings of the economy in the Atlantic City area.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
FOR many adults, the amount of money they make and how they choose to spend it is the most private of affairs. Money is a topic laden with symbolism, a source of pride or of shame, a standard for measuring success and competence after concern with school grades or football touchdowns has passed. It also brings about conflicting feelings of competitiveness between parents and children, who can be both proud and jealous of each other's success.
For many families, financial facts and figures are at least as private as their sex lives. The adult who talks freely about sexual partners will almost always consider an inquiry about salary invasive. Information shared with accountants is treated with roughly the same concern for privacy as a confession heard by a priest. 
Money is also a topic filled with emotions and memories, for the ability to make important financial decisions without getting one's parents' permission is a marker of adulthood. All of this makes money a stressful subject for many adults and their parents to discuss, especially if they have disparate incomes or different approaches to family finances.
''I don't talk to my parents about money at all, except to let them know that we're doing fine,'' said Darlene A., a 31-year-old office manager in Minneapolis who asked that her full name not be used. She has not broached the subject since she left her parents' home in rural Wisconsin after graduating from high school.
''When the topic comes up, I feel very uncomfortable,'' she said, adding that her parents would be upset by the way she and her husband handle their financial affairs. ''I think they would feel bad because I have more education and make more money.''
''We don't save money; we're more into make it now, spend it now,'' she explained. ''They paid $5,000 cash for their home in the 1950's. They got their first credit card three years ago and may use it once a month to put gas in their car.''
The intense emotions that Darlene associates with money are not unusual. She worries about her parents' approval, even though she and her husband are financially more successful than her parents. The mere mention of family finances makes her feel as if she is being judged and reminds her of childhood experiences. She handles the situation by avoiding the topic. Other adults and their parents find that discussing family finances usually leads to arguments.
''I see this in families where money means a lot in terms of who's worthwhile and who holds the power,'' said Dr. Carol Rubin, a psychologist in Newton, Mass., and a co-author of ''When Families Fight'' (William Morrow, 1989, $16.95). ''When adult children and their parents fight, the issues often go back to childhood.''
Each generation's approach to personal finance reflects childhood experiences. People who grew up during a financial depression imbue money with different characteristics than do those who grew up when high inflation meant that saving was foolish and buying on credit was prudent. Those whose parents viewed money as a symbol of their love or authority sometimes have difficulty distinguishing between the two, especially during times of crisis.
Dr. Kenneth O. Doyle, a financial counselor and a professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, has been studying how family members handle money at different ages. He has found that the symbolic ways in which an adult uses money are based upon the type of loss a person fears most.
''Money is often used as a talisman against a loss of affection, competence, reputation or control,'' he said.
Dr. Bernard Poduska, a professor of family sciences at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who has taught psychological counseling skills to financial advisers, said, ''One of the things that money can do is make the intangible tangible.''
''Some children grow up hearing things like, 'How much do you love me? Look how much I spent on you,' '' he explained.
 
Making It Easier to Talk
EXPERTS on family relationships recommend the following steps to make it easier for adults and their parents to discuss finances.
Acknowledge that money is an emotional subject. ''When you talk about finances you're talking about feelings,'' said Dr. Bernard Poduska, a professor of family sciences at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Discussing money will be more difficult if you do not acknowledge that you associate net worth with self-worth.
Avoid falling back into old, outdated roles. It is very easy for either generation of adults to take on the role of young child or all-knowing parent. This simply aggravates the problem.
''If the parents help out a child financially, that can be a throwback to an earlier style of relationship,'' said Dr. M. Duncan Stanton, the director of the family division of the department of psychiatry at the University of Rochester. ''The parent wants to be benevolent, but the adult children may feel like they're no longer independent and are being pulled back into a child's role.'' Be willing to accept each other's differences. Recognize that each of you has the right to determine your own goals and the amount of risk you are willing to take. Respect the recipient's dignity. Parents, for example, sometimes find it uncomfortable to accept even much-needed money from their children. Asking for money or even endorsing a check from their children can hurt their sense of pride. It is often less emotionally painful to arrange for a regular automatic transfer of funds from the donor's bank account to the recipient's. A little formality in handling loans can be good for everyone. If you lend money to a family member without specifying the terms in writing, both the lender and the borrower can be unsure of what is expected of them. This can foster feelings of dependency and anger on the part of the borrower, especially if he or she is an adult.
Typically, this happens when adults borrow money from their parents for a major purchase like a house. Each generation can become confused about how much of a say they have in how that and other money is spent. Does accepting a loan or a gift mean you must abdicate some control over your life? Do you have the right to put some constraints on the money you are lending?
''Making a loan as a businesslike transaction helps the adult child's self-esteem,'' Dr. Stanton said.

HEADLINE: Ozone Issue: Economics of a Ban

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
As industrial nations move toward a ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons - the refrigerant used in air-conditioners and refrigerators -by 2000, another problem looms: the likely replacement, although an improvement, also harms the atmosphere.
The problem grows out of the Montreal Protocol, an agreement signed by most of the developed nations in 1987, pledging to cut by half the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's for short, by 1998 to preserve the earth's protective ozone layer. This summer, chemical industry officials and environmental groups predict, the agreement will likely be strengthened to a complete ban on production by 2000.
The issue now being debated is how long the likely replacement for CFC's will be used. Environmental advocates are pushing for an early phase-out date for the best available replacement - hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC's - as a means of spurring research to find alternatives that do not damage the ozone layer. 
But chemical companies reply that moving quickly to phase out the replacement for CFC's could result in a critical shortage of refrigeration fluids that will be essential to preserve food and drug supplies later in the decade. The chemical producers explain that unless they are assured enough production time to recoup their investments, they will not build factories to make the replacement.
The chemical companies contend that they need assurances of up to 60 years of production of the replacements to justify making multibillion-dollar investments in new factories to meet the projected demand.
 
Difficult Trade-Off
The result is a public policy debate that pits environmentalists against chemical makers led by the Du Pont Company. And the dispute illustrates the kind of difficult trade-off that will increasingly be encountered as the global drive to protect the environment runs into economic and practical obstacles.
Shortages of refrigerants, should they occur, would be more than an inconvenience. Some 75 percent of the nation's food supply depends on chilling at some point along the processing and distribution chain, while blood supplies and many medicines also need to be continuously chilled.
More than two billion pounds a year of CFC's are used worldwide, about a third of that total in the United States; the uses include not only refrigeration but fields like insulation and electronics.
When released to the air, the CFC's and other chlorine-containing gases rise to the upper atmosphere and break into their constituent elements by solar radiation. The chlorine released is widely believed to attack the layer of ozone that shields the earth's surface from harmful solar waves. CFC's are estimated to constitute almost 60 percent of the man-made ozone-depleting elements that enter the atmosphere.
Substitutes for CFC's that are not hazardous have been found for many applications. But the best replacements in cooling equipment, refrigerant producers say, are hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Yet HCFC's contain ozone-depleting chlorine, too, although at a much lower level than CFC's.
''HCFC's represent a significant improvement,'' said F. Anthony Vogelsberg, environmental manager for Du Pont's Freon Products division. ''They have one-tenth the lifetime and one-tenth to one-twentieth the ozone-depletion potential. But they do not represent zero risk.''
Most big chemical companies insist that HCFC's are the best replacement until a new generation of compounds can be developed that do not contain chlorine. But environmental groups, seeking to force the pace of technological development, are urging that an early date be set for elimination of HCFC's as well.
Michael S. Clark, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said CFC makers did little to develop non-chlorine replacements after CFC's were removed from aerosol cans in this country in 1978 because of concerns about the atmosphere. ''There ought to be a lot more research on refrigerants,'' he said. ''There certainly was not much done in the 1970's.''
 
Research 'Hiatus' Feared
David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has pushed for the CFC ban, has similar concerns. He said development of HCFC's, as well as the chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbons, was placed ''on the back burner'' in 1980. ''We lost six to eight years of research,'' he said. ''We do not want another hiatus in development.''
Other materials can be used as refrigerants, but are either unproved or have known drawbacks. Ammonia, widely used before CFC's were developed, is toxic. Other potential candidates are flammable, corrosive or need to operate at pressures too high to be practical for home appliances.
A provision to ban HCFC production by 2010 is expected to be introduced in the Senate this year when legislation to renew the Clean Air Act comes up for debate.
Some companies, including Du Pont, which produces half the CFC's used in this country, are balking at building plants to produce HCFC's unless they see a way to recover their costs. ''We need a 20-year life cycle to pay for these investments,'' Mr. Vogelsberg said. ''So if you say, 'Phase out by 2010,' that means do not build after 1990.'' Du Pont favors using the materials until sometime between 2030 and 2050.
 
Estimated Cost in Billions
Mr. Vogelsberg said the company would have to invest about $1 billion over the next decade to have enough HCFC production to supply its share of the current CFC market. Worldwide, he said, $4 billion to $6 billion will have to be spent to produce substitutes to CFC's.
Du Pont has built several pilot plants to make HCFC's in small quantities, but is holding back on large operations until the deadlines for phasing out HCFC's are clarified. Other chemical producers are going ahead with production plants, but with misgivings.
William M. Corcoran, an official of Allied-Signal Inc,, said the company believes its HCFC investments represent a ''great risk.'' Officials of ICI Americas Inc. have said that if the United States attempts to impose more stringent standards than other countries, the whole movement to phase out CFC's may be thrown into confusion.
Users of refrigerants are also concerned. Most are still trying to figure out how to adapt their designs to use HCFC's, which have less lubricating ability than CFC's, in equipment that customers expect to run for 15 to 20 years without maintenance. Industry officials say there is $135 billion worth of cooling devices in operation in the United States that are dependent on CFC's.
 
'A Wrench in Planning'
''Talking about putting time limits on HCFC's throws a wrench in corporate planning,'' said Kevin Fay, director of the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, an industry group. ''These are products they expect to be still selling in 2010.''
But it is equally unrealistic to decide now to permit HCFC's until 2050, argues Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, since the effect of chlorine on the atmosphere is still not fully understood. ''It does not make any sense to talk about dates beyond 2020, because it is beyond the planning horizon of businessmen,'' he said.
He said Congressional sponsors of proposals to put time limits on HCFC's might compromise on when the phasing out would begin, giving the producers more time to recover investments. ''This is a very important moment,'' he said.
As supplies of CFC's dwindle, they will also become more expensive, if only because of a special tax imposed by Congress last year. The producer price of CFC had been averaging about $1 a pound. But starting this year, the most commonly used compounds will be taxed at $1.37 a pound, and the tax is to increase to almost $5 a pound by the end of the century. The average refrigerator needs a few pounds of the material.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Market Uneasy On Fears About Soviets

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Fears about political turmoil in the Soviet Union helped undermine a record-setting stock market rally, causing prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to skid over the last week in an increasingly nervous investment climate.
On Wednesday, investors on the Tokyo Stock Exchange succumbed to concerns that ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union threatened President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hold on power, sending the Nikkei average of 225 stocks down 254.95 points, to 37,696.51, after a 343.50-point decline Tuesday.
Last Friday, the index tumbled 438.12 points on another rumor, which proved unfounded, that Mr. Gorbachev had canceled all of his scheduled January meetings with foreign leaders because of growing political unrest. The 3 percent decline from Friday to Wednesday yis comparable to about an 80-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Bond prices have also fallen steadily this year and interest rates have popped upward. 
There was evidence today that the fears may have begun to ease as the stock market rallied. The Nikkei index gained 473.62 points, or 1.3 percent. to close at 38,170.13.
 
'Realistic Appraisal'
Still, the market remains worried.
''Perestroika was a theme that had been driving the market last year because people thought it would stimulate a whole new round of global economic growth,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, senior analyst at the Nikko Securities Company. ''What the rumors have shown is that people are now making a more realistic appraisal of the economic prospects for Eastern Europe.''
Reflecting the unsettled state of the markets, the dollar has risen against a weakening yen. The dollar reached 145.30 yen in Tokyo Wednesday, up from 144.95 in New York late Tuesday, despite heavy dollar selling by the Bank of Japan. Currency traders said the central bank has intervened in the foreign-exchange market every day this week, in a largely unsuccessful effort to stabilize the yen.
Even though the dollar selling was apparently ineffective, the central bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, said at a news conference Wednesday that the bank would continue to intervene when necessary.
 
Overreaction Seen
''I think in part people were too optimistic at the end of last year and so they were surprised when interest rates rose at first, so they have overreacted by selling the yen and bonds too much,'' said an executive at the Industrial Bank of Japan. ''But there is a real edge to what is happening. Everybody is anxious about everybody else, what the other person is doing.''
Some analysts described the tumble as more a symptom of a growing nervousness here than a direct result of concerns about troubles in the Soviet Union. In particular, there are worries about the domestic political situation, with an election approaching. There have been reports in the Japanese press that another stock and influence-peddling scandal may be brewing.
In addition, the stock market has been falling on relatively light volume, a sign that big institutions have not joined in the selling.
Shares of smaller companies listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange have continued to reach record highs, indicating that speculative interest in the market has not died, analysts said.
 
'Red Chip' Stocks
Nonetheless, the stories about the Soviet Union have clearly hit a raw nerve among investors, who had been betting, perhaps too heavily, that Japanese companies were poised to capitalize on the opening of the Eastern bloc economies.
The market rally late last year had been led by what came to be known as ''red chip'' stocks, shares of companies expected to benefit from the economic opening of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Share prices of the major trading companies, heavy machinery makers and electrical equipment producers all rose sharply in the expectation that they might be able to increase their exports to Eastern Europe.
The recent rumors have hit these shares particularly hard. Two trading companies, Mitsui & Company and the Marubeni Corporation, fell Wednesday, as did Komatsu, which produces tractors, and Toshiba Machinery.

HEADLINE: Banks Told to Add Reserves

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Federal regulators have ordered banks to more than double their reserves for loans to Argentina, an official said today.
The move is expected to reduce bank profits in the fourth quarter. 
In letters to the nation's largest banks, banking agencies instructed them to increase loss reserves on loans to Argentina to 35 percent of the loan amounts, from 15 percent, when they report October-December results, said an official of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who asked not to be identified.
The move stems from a recomendation by the Interagency Country Review Committee, which coordinates third-world lending matters among banking agencies, including the F.D.I.C., the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency.
Some banks probably already have loss reserves large enough to cover 35 percent of their loans to Argentina. But others, like Citibank and the Bank of America, have proportionately smaller loss reserves for third-world debt than their competitors.
Jim Mitchell, a spokesman for the BankAmerica Corporation, said the bank was aware of the new reserve requirement but declined to say how it would affect his institution.
In the third quarter, the nation's 12,800 commercial banks collectively recorded a $744 million loss. The industry was pushed into the red by $5.3 billion in third-world debt losses at five large banks.
Argentina owed $6.2 billion to United States banks at the end of September. Its economy has deteriorated sharply and its currency, the austral, has lost 99 percent of its value over the last year. Citicorp

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields End Week Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the week ended yesterday.
According to analysts at Donoghue's, yields are returning to near-normal levels after rising because of end-of-the-year factors. Yields will move down, they said, but it will take longer because of pressures on the domestic market resulting from rising interest rates abroad. 
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund fell 29 basis points, to 8.10 percent, while the 30-day yield fell 2 basis points, to 8.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Up
Assets of taxable funds rose $9.6 billion, to $366.6 billion. Donoghue's analysts said much of the increase came from consumer funds, whose assets increased by $6.9 billion, to $287.7 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios declined by one day, to 38, as managers played on higher short-term rates.
Best among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's were the Alger Money Market Portfolio, distributed by Fred Alger & Company of Jersey City, and Dreyfus World Wide dollar Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., Both funds had a return of 9.04 percent, or about 94 basis points better than the average yield in the week.
Tax-exempt assets increased by $4.7 billion, to $69.9 billion, reflecting a rise in rates. These higher short-term rates made money market funds more attractive since the yields usually lag behind market changes and remain higher for a few weeks longer. The average seven-day compounded yield decreased 43 basis points, to 5.64 percent. The taxable equivalent was 7.83 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 8.41 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
The top-performing fund during the week was the Evergreen Tax-Exempt Money Market Trust, distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation in Boston. Donoghue's said the fund posted a return of 6.40 percent, or about 76 points better than the average.
By contrast, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed bank money market accounts down 2 basis points, to 6.33 percent, and the average yield for six month C.D.'s fell 2 basis points, to 7.90 percent.
Certificates with longer maturities were down, except for five-year C.D.'s, which were unchanged at 7.91 percent. One-year C.D.'s fell 2 basis points, to 7.93 percent, and two-and-a-half-year C.D's dropped one basis point, to 7.89 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue to Slide; Dow Off by 15.36

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
The stock market continued to retreat yesterday on sharply higher volume.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 15.36 points lower, at 2,750.64. Futures-related program selling was given some of the blame. Volume rose to nearly 176 million shares, from 155 million on Tuesday. 
The loss for the day was the fifth in six sessions since the Dow opened the new year with a gain of 56.95 points on Tuesday, Jan. 2, to close at 2,810.15, its highest level ever. Since then, the Dow has given up 66.55 points, with its only daily gain coming in Monday's session, when it was up 21.12 points.
Other, broader indicators have also fallen below levels they reached on the first trading day of the year. Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.31 points, to 347.31. It had closed the first day of the year at 353.40. The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.23 points yesterday, to 192.12. It had finished at 195.04 on the opening day.
 
Concern Over Rates
''The market's slippage is tied to the anticipation of lower interest rates, which do not appear to be in the cards before April,'' said Alan Titunik, executive vice president and managing director of the Davis/Dinsmore Management Corporation. He cited bullish signals in the economy that might dissuade the Federal Reserve from easing credit further.
Mr. Titunik suggested that many traders were waiting to see what the bond market would do before they committed further to stocks. Yesterday, the credit markets showed little movement, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond unchanged at a price of 100 16/32, to yield 8.08 percent.
The 1,053 stocks that declined in price on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday were more than double the 516 issues that advanced.
Among individual issues, Citicorp slipped 1/4, to 27, and was the most active stock, with a volume of nearly 3.7 million shares. Canada's financially troubled Campeau Corporation, owner of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, is under pressure to come up with a restructuring agreement that will satisfy Citibank, Citicorp's banking subsidiary and Campeau's senior creditor. Traders said that if this is not accomplished, Citibank can declare $2.34 billion of debt in default on Monday.
 
Mining Issues Advance
Gold stocks were buoyed by rising gold prices, nervousness about the Japanese and United States stock markets and uncertainty over the outlook for the dollar. Gold soared $8.20 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $412.40 an ounce. In response, ASA Ltd. jumped 2 3/8, to 59 5/8; Homestake Mining, 7/8, to 20 3/4, and Sunshine Mining 1/4, to 3 3/4.
Newmont Mining, also a precious metals producer, rose 2 3/4, to 50 3/8. A Drexel Burham Lambert analyst, Nicholas Toufexis, re-emphasized his ''buy'' rating on the stock, citing it as being relatively inexpensive.
Pepsico dropped 1 5/8, to 60 3/4. Analysts estimated that the company's earnings would come in at $3.35 to $3.40 a share for 1989, up from $2.90 a share in 1988.
Active blue chips included Philip Morris, off 1/2, to 39 3/4; General Electric, up 1/8, to 64 3/4; A.T.& T., off 1/4, to 45; I.B.M., down 3/8, to 99; G.M., off 3/8, to 43 1/2, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 3/4, to 56 1/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 2.15 points, to 378.29, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 6.07 points, to 450.70.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Seven-Year Notes Well Received

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A successful auction of $7.5 billion worth of new seven-year Treasury notes helped to bring prices in the credit markets off their lows yesterday. As a consequence, prices in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds closed narrowly mixed.
Sellers emerged early in the session, encouraged by a sharp run-up in energy prices. But the results of the auction, plus a fall in stock prices, helped to offset developments in the oil markets. 
Market participants said the auction went smoothly, even though Japanese interest in the securities seemed minimal.
''Considering everything that has been going on lately, from the worries about inflation to selling of long-term securities by the Japanese, it was a terrific auction,'' said Neil Dubrow, a vice president at Voute, Coats, Stuart & O'Grady, a bond trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''The seven-year is a very attractive piece of paper.''
At the auction the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.02 percent, down from the 8.08 percent average yield produced at the last seven-year note auction on Oct. 11.
Mr. Dubrow and others said that much of the demand for the new notes emanated from speculative accounts that would use the securities in arbitrage-related trading activity. Such trading commonly involves a swap between two similar issues based on an anticipated change in price spreads.
 
Interest in Notes Intensified
Interest in the notes intensified after the auction results were released, and by late yesterday the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.98 percent.
The results had a salutary effect on prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities. By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 100 1/2, up 3/ 32, to yield 8.08 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 2/ 32, down 2/32, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 10/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.90 percent.
Meanwhile, Treasury bill rates dipped further. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.48 percent, down by four basis points, or hundreths of a point. And six-month bill rates dipped by six basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.36 percent.
The decline in bill rates coincided with a slide in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market. Yesterday the Federal Reserve did not conduct open market operations when the funds rate was at 8 1/4 percent, the level most analysts see as the Fed's target.
Later in the day the rate slipped to a low of 7 7/8 percent, but analysts said the decline was due to technical factors associated with the end of a two-week bank reserve maintenance period.
''We expect funds to open the new reporting period on Thursday at 8 3/ 16 percent,'' analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, said in their daily market commentary. They added that ''we expect the funds rate target to remain at 8 1/4 percent at least through early February.''
 
New Taxable Bonds
New taxable bond issues priced yesterday included a $250 million offering from the Province of Manitoba and a $500 million asset-backed transaction for Sears, Roebuck & Company.
The Manitoba offering, 8.80 percent 30-year debentures that mature Jan. 15, 2020, was priced at $99.682, to yield 8.83 percent, or 73 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/8 percent 30-year Treasury bonds at the time of pricing. The debentures are noncallable for life.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Sears, Roebuck offering, which is backed by receivables from the retailer's consumer credit cards, matures on Jan. 15, 1995. The 8.75 percent notes were priced at $99.459, to yield 8.80 percent, 87 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 7 3/4 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Dean Witter Reynolds acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The securities are noncallable for life.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Florida's State Board of Education offered $125 million of general obligation bonds at competitive bid. A bid from an investor group led by First Boston won the issue, which consists of serial and term bonds.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 5.60 percent in 1990 to 2010 on bonds maturing in 2010. The term issue, which matures in 2019, carries a coupon of 7.10 percent. The issue is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the high-yield ''junk bond'' market, completion of RJR Nabisco's sale of its Del Monte processed foods business for $1.48 billion to a group led by Merrill Lynch & Company was the focal point of activity.
Traders said a flurry of buying activity followed the announcement, but that by late in the day prices of most RJR securities were down by about a quarter of a point.
News that the Campeau Corporation will make timely payments to suppliers did not help lift prices of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores, Campeau's major retailing subsidiaries.
Despite the news, most traders said they still expected Campeau's huge debt burdens to force the company to file for bankruptcy. But they added that such a development would not have a big effect on prices of Allied and Federated's outstanding bonds.
''We are all waiting for the Campeau shoe to drop,'' one junk bond trader said. ''But once they do file there will probably be little change in prices. Allied and Federated debt is already trading at levels associated with companies that are in Chapter 11.''
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of seven-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
European and Asian Buyers Push Gold Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Precious metals prices climbed yesterday, led by increased demand for gold in Europe and Asia.
Dealers attributed much of the renewed buying to the weakness of the domestic and Japanese stock markets in recent days.
Concern about the ability of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union to overcome political and economic problems has also contributed to the rise in gold. 
At the close of the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for delivery this month settled at $412.40 an ounce, up $8.20 on the day. The same silver contract climbed 8.2 cents an ounce in sympathy, to $5.316. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, spot January platinum futures settled at $497.90 an ounce, up $9.
 
Tokyo Stock Slump Cited
''Aside from increasing concern about President Gorbachev's position in Europe and elsewhere, this week's slump on the Tokyo and other Asian stock markets prompted more investors to turn to gold,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''Later, when the New York stock market began to weaken further, it also helped the gold market.''
Ms. Raptopoulos said reports that the Soviet Government had doubled prices of gold jewelry to discourage consumers from exchanging their paper money for precious metals, gems and other traditional stores of value also buoyed the precious metals market.
Bradford H. Hughes, energy analyst at Cargill Investor Services, said the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute showed a sharp decline in the nation's stocks of gasoline and a modest decrease in heating oil but only a slight reduction in the supply of crude oil.
''Compared with a year ago, stocks of gasoline and heating oil are way down, while crude oil supplies are sharply higher,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''As a result, gas prices led the advance, followed by heating oil. Crude oil prices rose in sympathy, largely on the belief that the strong byproduct markets would eventually help crude.''
In any event, the close of the New York Mercantile Exchange found the spot, or nearest, unleaded gasoline delivery, February, up 3.45 cents a gallon, at 64.33 cents, while the same heating oil contract soared 1.83 cents a gallon, to 66.88 cents. The spot February delivery of the high-grade West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 83 cents a barrel, to $22.90.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Volatile Day; Central Bank Action Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday against major foreign currencies in volatile trading following reports of central bank intervention.
Currency dealers said the dollar initially fell because of the continued strength in the West German mark. But they said the dollar was later lifted by reports that the Federal Reserve bought dollars for marks and that West Germany's central bank sold marks for yen.
''That was the story of the day,'' said Linda McLaughlin, a trader with Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
Dealers said the market was awaiting new data that will shed more light on the United States economy. Tomorrow the government is set to release reports on December producer prices and retail sales.
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 145.55 yen, up from 144.92 yen late Tuesday. The dollar again weakened against sterling, which rose to $1.6625, from $1.6585.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6825 marks, up from 1.6730; 1.5165 Swiss francs, up from 1.5145; 5.7265 French francs, up from 5.7025; 1,257.25 Italian lire, up from 1,251.25, and 1.15855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16055.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday, were: 1.6795 West German marks, down from 1.6823; 1.5120 Swiss francs, down from 1.5260; 5.7145 French francs, down from 5.7305; 1.8815 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,255.00 Italian lire, down from 1,257.75, and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1610.

HEADLINE: Bush Hails a Thaw in China; Congress Is Skeptical

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
President Bush today hailed the lifting of martial law in China as ''a very sound step,'' but he found little support in Congress for his view that China's action was significant or that his policy toward Beijing was effective.
Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers said they were not persuaded by Administration statements that China had taken an important step toward ending political oppression there.
Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the lifting of martial law ''is more blue smoke and mirrors and would not fool anybody in Congress into believing that the Chinese leadership was moderating its oppressive rule.''
In Beijing, a few people strolled in Tiananmen Square, which was reopened with the lifting of martial law on Wednesday, and quietly speculated about whether the shifting political breezes may be carrying the first signs of a thaw. [Page A3.] But Mr. Broomfield said the Government's move ''simply shifts the responsibility for oppression from the military to the police.'' 
 
An Unusual Rebuff
The unusually stern rebuff from a Republican normally supportive of the President suggested that Mr. Bush's high-level diplomacy with Beijing had not produced enough results to reverse sentiment in Congress.
Lawmakers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of economic, military and political sanctions against China, which imposed martial law in Beijing in a violent crackdown on dissent in early June.
Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, said tonight: ''I am pleased that China has lifted martial law. But I don't think that suggests that a policy of democratization is suddenly taking place, or that China is any more worthy of our friendship.''
''We should not forget what happened in Tiananmen Square,'' said Mr. Edwards, who holds the fourth-ranking position in the House Republican leadership.
With conservative Republicans saying that there was bipartisan opposition to Mr. Bush's policy, and that the United States should not support any World Bank loans to China, the President's handling of Beijing appeared to be returning to the forefront of debate here. The issue has been overshadowed in recent weeks by the invasion of Panama and by events in Rumania.
 
Other Possible Steps
But Congressional aides and Administration officials said the criticism of Mr. Bush's policy might diminish if China takes a few more steps, like freeing some of the student leaders from prison and allowing the dissident Fang Lizhi to leave China. Mr. Fang, an astrophysicist, took refuge in the American Embassy in China after the violent crackdown in June.
Administration officials have declined to say whether Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, asked the Chinese to lift martial law when he visited Beijing in July and in December. It is widely believed here that Mr. Bush was hoping for such a step, and that the White House expected the lifting of martial law to help turn Congressional sentiment in favor of the President's policy.
On Wednesday, liberal Democrats criticized Mr. Bush for easing his opposition to World Bank loans for China. Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said that the lifting of martial law was ''an empty gesture.''
In an interview today, Representative Dan Burton, a conservative Republican from Indiana, said, ''There are an awful lot of conservatives who feel just as strongly as Nancy Pelosi.''
Opposition to Mr. Bush's policy on China ''cuts across party lines,'' Mr. Burton said. ''I am a great supporter of President Bush and Vice President Quayle. But I believe that this opening to China, this easing up on China, without any substantial changes there is totally wrong. People on both sides of the aisle in Congress - Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives - feel disappointment with the trips to China'' by Mr. Scowcroft and by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.
 
'Why Can't China Do It?'
Mr. Burton said the United States should continue to oppose World Bank loans to China because the lifting of martial law was ''a superficial, cosmetic change.''
''For us to give any assistance to a continuing repressive regime like Communist China, when the countries of Eastern Europe are making dramatic progress toward democracy, is just ludicrous,'' he said. ''If East Germany and Rumania can make democratic changes, why can't China do it?''
Mr. Bush described the end of martial law as ''a good sign.'' He reaffirmed his policy, saying: ''I do not want to isolate China by no contact and set the clock back. And, of course, we welcome the lifting of martial law, a good sign.''
''I view the lifting of martial law as a very sound step,'' he said at a brief picture-taking session at the White House. ''For those that are interested in human rights and the reform that was on the move and that we'd all like to see go forward, there's no way you can look at that and not say it is very positive.''
 
Passports Revoked
Lian-Chao Han, vice president of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars, which represents most of the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States, said that Beijing was trying to ''track down leaders of the democracy movement at the same time it tries to improve its international image and show the world that China is back to normal.''
The New China News Agency, the official Chinese press agency, said Sunday that Beijing was revoking the passports of three prominent Chinese exiles who had founded the overseas Federation for Democracy in China.
The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said that the three were wanted as criminals because they had ''incited, plotted and directed the turmoil and counterrevolutionary revolt in China.''
The three are Yan Jiaqi, president of the federation, which was founded in Paris in September; Wan Runnan, one of China's leading businessmen, and Chen Yizi, who advised Zhao Ziyang before Mr. Zhao was ousted in May as leader of the Chinese Communist Party.
The State Department declined today to specify additional steps that China should take to establish democracy. But in response to a question, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said that China, like other countries, should allow ''peaceful demonstrations.''
Although Tiananmen Square was reopened to the public, police officers and other security personnel were on the alert for signs of trouble.
Responding to news reports, State Department officials said they did not have evidence to determine whether China was keeping its commitment not to sell medium-range missiles in the Middle East.
China dismissed press reports that it was planning to sell M-9 ballistic missiles to Syria as ''utterly groundless,'' and Miss Tutwiler said, ''We take these public comments at face value.'' An Arabic-language newspaper in London said this week that China had promised to sell ''advanced weapons'' to Syria.

HEADLINE: A European Market for Consumer Goods Opens

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Recent developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe offer the United States an opportunity to establish conditions that will serve both its domestic economic needs and its interests in promoting world peace and stability. Unfortunately, to judge by published reports, the United States appears to be missing the boat.
A principal reason for the unrest in Eastern Europe is the inability of controlled economies to satisfy the longings of their people for basic consumer goods. It is unlikely that the industries in these countries can satisfy those needs in the near future. Nor are the countries likely to produce the necessary foreign exchange to buy them in the West. However, if these goods do not soon become available, the reform movements may wither, and repressive regimes may take their place. 
The United States should embark on a major program to make available to the countries of Eastern Europe the dollars to buy consumer goods in the United States. The United States should create a fund for this purpose and agree to receive in return nonconvertible foreign exchange pegged at a fixed exchange rate in relation to the dollar to be used for investments in the foreign countries or to be converted into dollars at some future time.
Such a program would enable the reform movements in Eastern Europe to meet longings for basic consumer goods without spending foreign exchange they do not have. Such a program would create unparalleled opportunities for American industry to gain a foothold in what may become enormous future markets. It would capitalize on the reputation American consumer goods still enjoy in Europe and create markets for American goods for a long time in the future. Such a program would also stimulate American industry to do better in seeking out new markets. It would permit American industry to give the Japanese and Europeans a run for the East Europeans' money.
And it need not add a penny to the United States budget. For the United States could simply use whatever it can take out of its military budget and put it into this program for the heart of Eastern Europe. Furthermore, American industry would not have to suffer from military cutbacks because it could focus on making products more likely to contribute to human happiness. And it would give the United States a long-term policy for economic growth and optimum employment.
The program can readily be implemented with the cooperation of Eastern leaders. They appear to have little choice but to hail the United States for its initiative.

HEADLINE: Saints Ready for Indoor Season Opener

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, L.I., Jan. 11

 BODY:
Introducing some of his players at a news conference today, Tom Flatley, the general manager of the New York Saints, described Scott Huff as an enforcer. Huff seemed to preen.
There is no position entitled enforcer in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League and its officials are chary of promoting violence as a feature of the game. ''We don't want to scare away the mothers,'' Flatley said. 
''But let's face it,'' said Huff, who is a midfielder. ''This is a contact game. What we're selling is speed, hitting and scoring. Me and Richie are the hitters.''
Rich Mullen, like Huff, played a little football in college, at C. W. Post, and they go into the corners to ''dig the ball out like in ice hockey,'' Huff said.
Indoor lacrosse is a blend of outdoor lacrosse and ice hockey, played by six-man teams on an artificial turf surface about the size of a hockey rink with boards around it. The Major Indoor Lacrosse League is in its fourth season and seems to have found an audience.
The Saints will open their season Friday night here in Nassau Coliseum against the Philadelphia Wings, who beat them, 11-10, in last season's championship game. The Saints-Wings rivalry is the most intense in the league and Coliseum officials are hoping for a crowd of 10,000.
According to Coliseum figures, the Saints averaged 8,600 in four home games last year and that average has climbed since the first season, when the team played at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
 
The Other Teams
Other franchise locations are the Baltimore Arena for the Thunder; Joe Louis Arena in Detroit for the Turbos; the Centrum in Worcester, Mass., for the New England Blazers, and the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh for the Bulls. The Washington Wave was moved to Pittsburgh by Chris Fritz and Russ Cline of Kansas City, Mo., who own all of the franchises.
Fritz, who is president of the league, and Cline, senior vice president, are partners in an entertainment promotion business in automobile, concert, convention, sports and trade show areas. Cline said that the league is marginally profitable and that the gross revenues, for example, went from $800,000 the first season to $3 million the second.
They plan to put franchises in several other cities beginning with Chicago and Los Angeles. But expansion will wait until economic stability is achieved, Cline said.
Indoor lacrosse features constant action through four 15-minute periods, a 45-second shot clock and an average of 72 shots and 24 goals a game. It's a rough game in which boarding, slashing and cross-checking can draw penalties.
''From a spectator standpoint I think we've got an edge on hockey and soccer because we've got scoring and they don't,'' said Flatley, a longtime high school lacrosse coach at Sewanhaka High in Elmont, L.I.
The players are former college athletes who hold conventional jobs, but have a passion for their sport and play for little money. The salary scale runs from $100 a game for a first-year player to $300 for a four-year veteran.
The season, eight games for each team plus playoffs, ends in late March and then many of the Saints will change into the uniforms of the Long Island Lacrosse Club to play the outdoor game.

Havel Traces Passage 'From Jail to the Castle'

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Jan. 11

 BODY:
President Vaclav Havel's third-floor office in the Prague Castle these days has the urgent chaos of a theater stage the day after opening night. Mail is piled on the floor. Young secretaries and assistants rush in and out. Unwanted paintings stand around against the wall like discarded scenery. Telephones ring and ring and often go unanswered.
The Czechoslovak President, tieless in black denim jeans and a lavender shirt, is a world-renowned playwright who looks younger than his 53 years. He said in a brief interview today that the theater was not where he had found the most useful guideposts in what he called ''this curious passage from jail to the castle.'' 
''Jail gave me extremely good preparation for my work in this office,'' he said. ''In the first place, it taught me not to be surprised by anything. Second, it cultivated in me some instincts which I need in this office, and third, it facilitates for me the solving of one of the many problems we have to deal with, such as the state security and the dark forces in our country.''
 
Five Interviews in a Day
One was apparently the instinct of choosing his words carefully. But he has yet to learn how to husband his time, something he had plenty of in his five years in jail over the past 21 years. His staff, not yet fully organized, had scheduled five separate interviews for him today, and to save time, he answered questions put to him in English by replying in Czech without a consecutive translation. He spoke into a tape recorder only after reflecting, and insisted on switching it off at the end of each answer.
Czechoslovakia has begun talks with the Soviet Union on withdrawing the 70,000 soldiers that have been stationed in the country since the Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968, a pullout that the Czechoslovaks want to be completed by the end of this year.
When he was asked whether Czechoslovakia would remain a member of the Communist alliance after that, Mr. Havel said: ''If a totalitarian system is dismantled, some peculiarities remain. Some things I cannot discuss with The New York Times before I discuss them with President Gorbachev in Moscow.''
Aides said Mr. Havel would make his first official visit to Moscow next month. He said he also expected to take a trip to the United States soon to visit President Bush, Congress and other representatives of American civic, cultural and business life. Expectations of U.S. ''I expect from the United States several things,'' he said. ''First, understanding for some peculiarities of Czechoslovak foreign policy.''
He added: ''I expect moral support for the processes taking place in Czechoslovakia. I expect significant economic help, on the basis of equality, and not on the basis of somebody big and rich giving presents to somebody small and poor.''
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who plans to go to Moscow early next month, may also stop in Prague, some officials here say.
Mr. Havel was unanimously elected President by the Czechoslovak legislature at the end of last month, but immediately said he saw his mission as insuring that a new Parliament was democratically elected later this year. Asked whether he would be willing to serve a new term after that, he replied:
''The President of the Czechoslovak Republic is elected for five years. He has to be elected 40 days after the first meeting of the Federal Assembly after elections. Who this President will be, naturally, I do not know. Nor do I know whether I will or will not be among the candidates, or if I am among the candidates, whether I will accept.
''Nevertheless, I know that I am capable of estimating how long this country needs me in this office and when it needs somebody better than I, or simply somebody different. As soon as my homeland does not need me in this office, I will with great appetite devote myself to my original profession, and write or even work in some kind of theater.''
 
Attends One of His Plays
On Wednesday night, he attended a Czechoslovak performance of his 1975 play, ''Audience,'' set in a provincial beer brewery like the one in Trutnov where he worked during one of his correctional periods. The 45-minute play is an extended, beery encounter between an intellectual in exile and his brewmaster-overseer. Mr. Havel stayed talking to the two companies doing the play here, the American Actors' Studio and a Czechoslovak group, until well past midnight, according to Michael Zantovsky, his new press aide.
Asked today whether any of his former jailers or interrogators had written to congratulate him on his office, Mr. Havel referred to the piles of unanswered mail and said perhaps there were some letters in there.
''I was visited in the Civic Forum by a delegation from Bory Prison, where I was jailed,'' he said. ''There were three people in civilian clothes who were trying somehow to attract my attention. I did not recognize them, and said to them, well, since your release you've grown beards and gotten fatter, and I apologized for not recognizing them.''
''They said, 'We are not prisoners, we are representatives of the correctional institute in Bory, and we have come to tell you that you should immediately dismiss the head of the jail,' '' Mr. Havel said. ''At that time our friend Dagmar Buresova was already Minister of Justice. So I passed on their messsage and I assume that she took care of it.''
 
Moral Authority an Asset
In Mr. Havel's new job, his greatest power is the moral authority he gained in two decades of persecution by the discredited Communists who took over in 1968. The day-to-day running of the machinery of state is in the hands of the Government, now led by a Communist, Prime Minister Marian Calfa.
Mr. Havel's 20 or so close aides, mainly personal friends, said they were still not sure how many people were on the President's staff, or what all of them did.
Unlike his predecessor, Gustaf Husak, Mr. Havel lives in an apartment downtown, is driven to work in his own dark-green Renault 21 four-door car, presented as a gift by President Mario Soares of Portugal, and has put modern art up on his office walls, including a painting of two nudes by the Czechoslovak artist Jiri Sobko.
''I knew that if I accepted this high state office, that I would have to deal within minutes, hours, and days, with problems that had been growing and accumulating for 50 years,'' Mr. Havel said.
One of these was tensions between Czechs, Slovaks and other ethnic groups in the country, but he said he believed this problem was not as acute in Eastern Europe as in the Soviet Union. By convention in Czechoslovakia, the President has had to be a Czech and not a Slovak, but Mr. Havel said in a New Year's Day speech that he did not see why the highest office in the land should be barred to them.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the rise of Vaclav Havel to the presidency of Czechoslovakia misstated the country's system for dividing high offices between Czechs and Slovaks. A conference last year between the Government and the opposition agreed that the President must be a non-Communist Czech since the Prime Minister, Marian Calfa, was a Communist Slovak. In the past, Slovaks have held the presidency.

HEADLINE: Fewer Flights, but More Air Traffic Delays in 1989

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
The number of air traffic delays rose sharply last year, especially at the nation's five most congested airports, Government officials reported yesterday. Aviation experts found the figures particularly disturbing because delays increased even though the number of flights fell slightly.
Government and industry officials attributed the increase to unusually severe weather, which they said accounted for more than half the delays. They also cited a shortage of air traffic controllers and intermittent computer failures. And they pointed to the proliferation of hub airports, where flights are concentrated, and the bunching of flights at peak hours. 
Some experts warned that with only one large airport slated to be built over the next ten years - in Denver - and air traffic expected to increase steadily, the nation is heading for more congestion.
The data are based on numbers from 22 of the nation's busiest airports.
Other figures from the Transportation Department show that the number of flights that arrive late has held steady, in part because airlines have altered their schedules to accommodate air traffic delays. #5 Airports With Half the Delays The Federal Aviation Administration defines delays as planes held up at some point in the flight by air traffic controllers for 15 minutes or more. Such delays increased 13 percent last year to 308,393. At the same time, the number of flights fell by about 1 percent, to 4.6 million. Seven percent of all flights encountered air traffic delays.
Five airports, three of them in the New York area, accounted for more than half the delays. They were La Guardia Airport (delays up 113 percent); Kennedy International Airport (delays up 52 percent); Newark International Airport (delays up 17 percent), and San Francisco International and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago (both with delays up 11 percent).
''This was a bad year,'' said David Hurley, director of air traffic operations for the F.A.A.
Stan Matthews, an official at the aviation agency who investigated the problems at La Guardia, said the sharp rise there was caused by unusually bad weather, especially in the spring, and the increasing use of larger jets, which means controllers must space takeoffs farther apart. In September, a USAir Boeing 737 slid off the end of a runway, killing two people and forcing controllers to close one of the two runways for five days, causing additional delays.
 
Increasing Flight Times
While the F.A.A. figures in flight delays show a marked increase, figures from the Transportation Department that measure the number of late arrivals do not.
The department found that the number of flights arriving 15 minutes late or more have remained steady, with about 78 percent of all flights arriving on time.
Industry analysts said one reason for the discrepancy is that airlines have been increasing their scheduled flight times, so planes being delayed by controllers might still arrive on time. ''To a certain degree, they are massaging the numbers,'' said George James, president of Airline Economics, a consulting concern in Washington. ''If they stretch that schedule a little bit, they're going to have happy passengers.''
But not everyone is happy. ''I've been delayed seven hours and waiting in line for four,'' said Ron Johnson, speaking recently in Detroit of his effort to fly to Virginia Beach, Va., from Colorado Springs - a trip with stops in Denver and St. Louis as well as Detroit.
Some people emphasized the shortage of air traffic controllers. R. Steve Bell, president of the controllers' union, said that the Government is still short 3,000 fully trained contollers. Mr. Hurley of the F.A.A. said he could not confirm that number, but he acknowledged that the agency is short of fully trained controllers. He added, ''We're satisfied with the number of people we have in the pipeline.''
 
A Ripple Effect
About 90 percent of controllers responding to a recent General Accounting Office survey said airline scheduling practices were their biggest headache.
''When it comes to scheduling, the airlines control their own destiny,'' said Joe Bellino, Great Lakes region representative for the controller's union.
When weather deteriorates, controllers must space planes farther apart and sometimes need to direct planes around storms. Rather than have planes enter holding patterns at their destinations, controllers delay planes on the ground.
Bad weather at an airline hub causes delays far beyond that city. ''If something happens at Chicago early in the morning it will have a ripple effect thoughout the entire nation,'' said Duane Dupon, a controller at O'Hare.

HEADLINE: Business Wary About End Of Martial Law in Beijing

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 11

 BODY:
While foreign companies welcome the lifting of martial law in the capital, the action is unlikely to have an immediate effect on their commercial or investment activities here, officials of a dozen companies said today.
The foreign business executives in interviews described the lifting of martial law, effective today, as a necessary condition for a better business climate. But they added that except for improving the prospects for the tourism industry, the move would be largely cosmetic and symbolic.
''The Chinese can, of course, put soldiers at will overnight back where they were before, and we all know that,'' said an American businessman who asked not to be identified. ''The same problems remain whether or not they move a few people dressed up in fancy uniforms from one particular, visible location to one that is not so visible.'' 
 
Deteriorating Economy
For most companies, the dominant concerns are the result of China's deteriorating economy: tight credit, reduced demand and shortages of raw materials and foreign exchange.
''A lot of people were experiencing problems well before June 4 due to recentralization and a credit squeeze,'' said Matthew D. Bersani, an associate at the Beijing office of the American law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. ''None of those problems go away, even if Sino-American relations were perfect.''
The tourism industry stands to gain the most from the lifing of martial law, which was imposed in certain areas of the capital on May 20, and hoteliers say the change will allow tour operators to offer more travel packages without insurance restrictions. Many insurance companies either raised their prices or were reluctant to give insurance for companies offering tours to China as long as martial law was in effect.
The cold winter has been a particularly bleak one for the tourism industry, and some hotel managers say they believe this year's tourist season, which begins in March, will start slowly.
 
Unlike a Faucet
''You can't just say there is no more martial law, and then have everyone willing to come to China,'' said Gerhard R.E. Schmidt, general manager at the Palace Hotel, which he said is currently operating at 50 percent occupancy. ''It's not like a faucet you can switch on and off.''
Many companies hope for a softening of tensions between China and the United States, Japan and other Western countries. Once bilateral relations improve, their logic goes, Government lending will follow, paving the way for more trade and better business opportunities, greater confidence, and then more commercial lending and investment.
American businesses still say they are looking to the resumption of lending by the World Bank, and particularly the Japanese Government, for a stimulus to their commercial activity. In some cases, such loans are expected to provide the financing for a number of big-ticket imports that companies in China say they cannot afford without outside financing.
For the World Bank, the lifting of martial law will not directly lead to a change in its lending policy, but there will probably be an indirect effect if the action substantially improves the view of China taken by the World Bank's pivotal shareholders, like the United States.
 
Change Is Needed
Commercial banks, however, will not necessarily jump into the market once the World Bank resumes lending. Foreign bankers say a great deal more substantive change is needed before the capital market for China resumes its former scale and vibrancy.
For a lending market to re-emerge, a sizable number of banks must be willing to share the risk of underwriting or participating in China loan syndications, and at least some of the preconditions for this are that the World Bank and the Japanese Government resume their lending programs.
''Lifting martial law is a small step in the right direction,'' said an American banker in Beijing. ''The World Bank loans being re-established is a little bit of a bigger step in that direction, and an official position by the Japanese banks toward China is another pretty big step in that direction.
''When there is a large enough universe of banks that are prepared to go back to China and take China risk, then we can do our business.''

HEADLINE: Pleased With Past, Kean Looks to Future

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Eight years ago a former Assemblyman named Thomas H. Kean moved his belongings and a wobbly new administration into the Statehouse here, after stunning the public and himself with a 1,797-vote victory over Representative James J. Florio.
This week Mr. Kean is packing up. He is taking with him a reputation as one of New Jersey's most successful governors. What he leaves behind are a daunting set of problems for his successor, the man he so narrowly beat in 1981.
Mr. Kean today is praised by Democrats and Republicans as the leader who presided over New Jersey's economic rebirth and who helped transform the state's image from a troubled, toxic land bridge between New York and Philadelphia to a tourist haven and a home of good government. He also carved a place for himself in the Republican Party with his dedication in the Reagan era to the environment, education and extending an appeal to black voters. 
 
'It's Wrong for Democracy'
In an interview this week in his office, where moving boxes still littered the floor, Mr. Kean, who is 54 years old, said he looked forward to his new life at Drew University, where he takes over as president next week, as a time to think and talk about subjects beyond New Jersey: United States foreign policy, which he hopes will remain warily anti-Communist, and the Republican Party, which he says must stop writing off minority voters.
''It's wrong,'' said Mr. Kean, who won re-election in 1985 with 62 percent of the black vote. in 1985. ''It's wrong for the party. It's wrong for democracy. It's wrong for the people you are trying to help.''
When Mr. Florio is sworn in as governor on Tuesday, he will confront a budget crisis that, experts say, could require hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes or cuts in services.
He will also be under pressure to repair an automobile insurance system that outraged voters and vexed Mr. Kean year after year. And within months, he is likely to face a State Supreme Court decision on the financing of public education that could result in a painful overhaul of the state's tax system.
To many Democrats, the problems that Mr. Florio inherits are proof that despite Mr. Kean's popularity, his years in office were not flawless. They fault him for not doing more to help the state's poor cities, to relieve rising property taxes and to limit the growth that brought more traffic jams and urban sprawl to the nation's most densely populated state.
Unlike other governors who rode the Northeast's economic boom to popularity in the 1980's, like Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut, Mr. Kean was able to get out while the getting was good, many Democrats say.
 
Russo's Review
As those same states now face growing deficits and their governors see their popularity erased or falling, Mr. Kean is leaving the unpopular dirty work of balancing budgets to his successor.
''I give him high grades,'' said John F. Russo, a Democrat and the departing president of the New Jersey Senate, who at times was at odds with the Governor. ''But he was so popular that he was in a position to do the politically hard things that he never got around to, like taxes and the cities.''
When Mr. Kean took over in 1982, after waiting through a month of recounts to confirm his election, unemployment in New Jersey stood at nearly 10 percent. Thousands of manufacturing jobs had been lost in the 1970's and state government lurched from crisis to crisis.
In his first year, Mr. Kean seemed at times overwhelmed by the problems of a state parodied for its crime, pollution and corrupt politicians. But by 1986, New Jersey's sprawling suburbs had become magnets for high-technology industries and corporate offices. During the Kean years, the state gained 600,000 new jobs, unemployment dropped to 4 percent and each year the state reported large surpluses.
 
Economic Boom
''It is a brilliant success story of the 1980's,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''There were very few states that showed that kind of improvement.''
Much like Mr. Dukakis in Massachusetts, Mr. Kean would later take credit for the spectacular growth that passed through the entire Northeast, an economic turnaround that would have lifted New Jersey's economy no matter who was governor. Critics point out that despite Mr. Kean's anti-government rhetoric, New Jersey's budget doubled to $12 billion from $6 billion during those years.
But economists, business leaders and academics familiar with the policies of many states during those years generally praise Mr. Kean for encouraging business growth.
''As we look at the Northeast and the New England states we see governors of varying abilities who all looked very good, who were buoyed by the reinvention of the Northeast, '' said George Sternleib, university professor of urban studies at Rutgers University.
''But did Tom Kean optimize the stirring of the economy? Here you have to give him a very positive grade. He restored confidence in the state.''
Mr. Kean, the scion of a wealthy family that includes the first constitutional governor of New Jersey, William Livingston, cultivated his role as the state's promoter, appearing in television commercials to extol the state's strengths, from the casinos in Atlantic City and the beaches along the Jersey Shore, to the Giants, Jets and Nets lured to the Meadowlands from New York.
 
Public Relations and Pride
He also had the state invest heavily in roads and transportation, passed numerous environmental measures and won a series of educational measures, including a rise in the minimum salary for teachers and a plan to permit the state to take over poorly run public school systems.
Polls showed that New Jerseyans' pride in their state jumped, while the Kean public relations campaign and his landslide re-election in 1985 caught the eye of the national press and Republican politicians around the country. Mr. Kean appeared as the keynote speaker at the 1988 Republican convention.
''The coalition that Kean was able to assemble in the 1980's is precisely the coalition the party needs to acquire to survive,'' said Roger Stone, a conservative Republican consultant in Washington who worked on the Reagan, Bush and Kean campaigns: ''the party of civil rights, the party of fiscal conservatives and social moderates.''
During a 90-minute interview in his office this week, Mr. Kean demonstrated the same unpredictable amalgam of ideas and symbols that proved so successful in his years as Governor, a blend of liberal social instincts and conservative economics, a proud patrician's detachment and a folksy street-corner charm.
 
Concern About 'Peace Dividend'
In a rare departure, he repeatedly raised his concerns on issues of national and foreign affairs. He said he will urge the party to vie for black voters while continuing its commitment to a strong defense and pro-business tax policies of the Reagan years.
One concern he voiced was the temptation to dismantle quickly the military buildup achieved under Mr. Reagan.
No matter how alluring voters this year find the prospect of the ''peace dividend'' that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York suggested in his State of the State message last week, Mr. Kean said, the politics of Eastern Europe are too unsettled and the future of Communism too unclear to reduce America's military capacity.
''The world is going through a dangerous period,'' Mr. Kean said. ''I don't think you let your guard down in a time of uncertainty.''
The Governor, who often listens to tapes of Paul Robeson on the way to work, talked of his days as a college student when he experienced a first blush of admiration for Fidel Castro, and of the wrenching disillusion that followed, an event he described as the root of his strong anti-Communism.
 
'Tremendous Shock'
In the late 1950's, Mr. Kean said, his older brother, Robert, was married to a Cuban woman, and Mr. Kean, on visits to Havana, was inspired by reports of a romantic revolutionary in the mountains who promised to end the tyranny of the Batista regime.
But after the 1959 revolution, Mr. Kean said, he quickly learned through his sister-in-law's family of the brutality of the Castro regime, the suppression of freedoms and the Communists' torture and imprisonment of democratic opponents to Batista.
''It was a tremendous shock and disillusionment, and yet it was an educational experience,'' Mr. Kean said. ''Very honestly, what I had seen in Castro, I spotted in Ortega.''
Although it was little noticed, Mr. Kean, as Governor, supported aid to the Contras fighting the Sandinista government of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in Nicaragua. Today, he said, the United States must continue to apply pressure to the Governments of Nicaragua and Cuba and the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
Of his political accomplishments, Mr. Kean said, he was most proud of surveys that showed he has sustained his popularity with black voters even after eight years in office. Republican politicians around the country, he said, were resisting evidence that black voters could be enticed away from the Democratic Party.
''Look at the facts,'' Mr. Kean said. ''If they had less than half the votes I got on a percentage basis across the country, they would control both houses of the United States Congress. If nothing else moves them, that ought to.''
 
Possible Job in Washington
The one thing that could draw Mr. Kean quickly back into debate over New Jersey issues, he said, is if Mr. Florio decides to follow the advice of many of Mr. Kean's Democratic critics who say the state must raise its income tax.
Mr. Kean said the new governor may be forced to raise taxes on items like gasoline, liquor or cigarettes to make up the difference between expenditures and disappointing state revenues. But raising the income tax would destroy the probusiness environment that he said spurred the boom of the 1980's.
Mr. Kean has been mentioned in Washington as a possible replacement for the Secretary of Education, Lauro F. Cavazos, or for another position in the Bush Administration. If the Administration wants him, he said, he would not rule out a future job in either domestic or foreign affairs after a stint as president of Drew, a small private university in Madison, not far from his home in Livingston. But now, Mr. Kean said, he needs a hiatus from public life.
''This position, as wonderful as it is, is somewhat isolating,'' Mr. Kean said of the governorship. ''I need to touch again. I need to find out what people are thinking, particularly to touch base with this new generation.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Pledges Rise in Spending In Range of 4%

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Pledging to keep state spending increases in the next fiscal year below the inflation rate, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he would present a tight budget next week that would grow by a little more than 4 percent.
If Mr. Cuomo holds to his pledge, the budget increase would be the lowest in more than a decade.
Speaking at a news conference here today, the Governor said the budget that he will present to the Legislature next week ''should grow no more than the inflation rate.'' He estimated that the inflation rate for the coming year would be 4.5 percent. 
The Governor's remarks came just one day after his administration acknowledged a budget gap for the current fiscal year of almost $700 million. That figure is almost three times the gap that the administration projected in November.
In pledging to hold spending growth under the inflation rate, Mr. Cuomo cautioned that he was speaking only about the state's general fund, which is made up of most tax revenues that are not dedicated by law to special uses. He said he was not making the same pledge about the state's overall budget, which includes Federal funds as well as money earmarked for specific purposes.
 
Shifting Inflation Estimate
The state's overall budget usually grows substantially faster than the general fund budget, and Mr. Cuomo has sometimes been accused of moving money out of the general fund to make the state's spending increase appear lower. The Governor has denied those accusations.
Last year, too, Mr. Cuomo pledged to keep the state's general fund spending increase below the inflation rate. He fulfilled this pledge but only after agreeing to increase his estimate of the inflation rate. It is now projected that state spending for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, will be roughly 5 percent higher than the year before. The inflation rate is now projected to be 5.2 percent.
In recent years, it has not been uncommon for state spending to grow from year to year by more than 8 percent, even in times of relatively low inflation.
Maintaining overall spending growth at less than the inflation rate is likely to require substantial cuts in some areas. That is because there are many areas, like health care and prisons, for which spending is likely to increase at a rate faster than inflation.
 
Reaction Is Mixed
At today's news conference, Mr. Cuomo appeared to be trying to take steps to blunt the criticism that will inevitably greet his budget proposal. ''You have to be able to say no,'' he said. ''And please don't talk to me about excruciating privation. Because that's not true.''
But advocates for the poor said that despite the Governor's statements they were concerned that his spending proposal would cause real suffering. ''I think it's going to be a disaster,'' said Patricia Croop, executive director of Senses, a coalition of religious and social services groups.
Business groups, in contrast, praised the Governor for his emphasis on spending restraint.
''Governor Cuomo hit the nail right on the head today when he said that the solution to this year's budget puzzle is to control spending,'' said Daniel B. Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York.

HEADLINE: POP/JAZZ;
2 Successes In the Quest For Creative Uniqueness

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
Two of jazz's great individualists, the singers Betty Carter and Abbey Lincoln Moseka, will step on stage tonight and give a lesson or two on how to secure a place in jazz history. After a phrase or so, the singers will show off carefully constructed personalities built not out of economic necessity, but out of an act of the imagination. Living examples of a jazz law that demands originality in exchange for greatness, they know just how to turn the nuances of the personal into something powerfully evocative. The most repressed audience crumbles under their emotional weight; the two women can draw tears from a rock.
''I don't sleep well if I'm compared to someone else,'' Ms. Carter said. ''To be creative you have to do something different. My style has evolved because I know more about Betty Carter than I did 20 years ago or 2 years ago or yesterday. I'm constantly trying to learn about me. 
''That search for self-knowledge comes out in the risks I take, changing tunes around, making something familiar into something else. And that's risky because you can offend the composers' intent. My peers, the audience and musicians my age, like their standards the same way every time, and if I come up with a new idea, that they don't dig.
''On a simpler level, I avoided other people's material, and never listened to them, unless I heard them accidentally on the radio. There are a lot of singers who spent a lot of time copying other singers; they're still in Cincinnati or in Philadelphia. I knew that what I had to develop was Betty Carter.''
 
Billie Holiday Was First
Ms. Moseka said she learned about originality ''from witnessing other people.''
''The first singer I heard was Billie Holiday, when I was 14,'' she recalled. ''I had heard singers in church, and I was singing in school. But she was the first singer I ever heard who was an individual; I heard Coleman Hawkins around the same time, and it did something for me. For a while, I would listen to Sarah Vaughan on the radio, Nat (King) Cole, Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, all of whom had an individual sound. Back then, it was shameful to sound like someone else - the point is to value yourself.''
Since both Ms. Moseka and Ms. Carter are singers, they have an added emotional advantage over jazz instrumentalists. Using well-thought-out arrangements, both women block off and underscore meaning in their tunes. By adding unpredictable time signatures to a standard, Ms. Carter will wake it from a slumber. And both singers have utterly distinct sounds.
 
'Betty Be-Bop'
Ms. Carter has been receiving her fair share of attention recently; not only has her album ''Look What I Got'' spent months on the jazz charts, but she also won a Grammy last year and appeared on an episode of ''The Cosby Show.'' She first gained acclaim as a member of Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1951, when she was labled Betty Be-Bop for her be-bop virtuosity. Her voice, from the earliest recordings on, is immediately distinct, an alto that can be insistent when working through a modal piece, or delicate and nuanced - dusty one moment, polished the next - when navigating her molasses-slow ballads.
''I knew I couldn't be Sarah Vaughan,'' she said. ''I never bothered buying records, because I knew that I was an individual, and knew that I had to get to that, to explore the individuality.''
 
Tackled Tougher Subjects
Ms. Moseka's ascent has been different. Early on in her career she spent time working on the cabaret circuit. In the late 1950's, she became involved in ground-breaking projects with Max Roach, to whom she was married for several years, and started tackling tougher subjects, joining the jazz elite, recording with Sonny Rollins and Kenny Dorham. Her voice, at times tinged with sarcasm and anger and at other moments filled with a joyous intelligence, makes tunes shiver with intensity.
''It really started when I was a child, between 5 and 6,'' Ms. Moseka said. ''I'm 1 of 12 children. My father always had a piano in the house, and when I would go to the piano I must have done it respectfully, because people left me alone. That's where I learned to concentrate.''
Both women have actively supported young musicians. At Fat Tuesday's through the weekend, Ms. Carter will be using the newcomers Marc Cary on piano, Tarus Mateen on bass, and Troy Davis on drums. Over the last decade, Ms. Carter has been turning out fully formed jazz musicians at a rate equaled only by that other jazz academy, Art Blakey. Her bands, invariably tight and always thrilling, are training grounds for young musicians to learn the discipline necessary to attack some of jazz's larger problems.
''It's marvelous; the music is really turning around,'' Ms. Carter said. ''There are more young musicians than I dreamed would be possible, and they're not as overwhelmed by the commercial thing as five years ago. People want things with substance, so they have to deal with this music.''
 
'One of the Elders'
Ms. Moseka, who will be backed by James Wiedeman on piano, Kenny Davis on bass, and Mark Johnson on drums in her sets at Condon's, keeps her musicians longer. One recent graduate of her academy is the saxophonist Steve Coleman, who brought most of the other members into her band.
''The musicians in my band are as good as any I worked with when I first started out,'' Ms. Moseka said. ''They're brilliant. For me, there is an increase of young musicians around, but I don't know how inclined they are to breaking the rules, throwing the baby out with the bathwater. When Clifford Brown came through town, everybody knew his sound, and he was only 26 when he died. I know there are a lot of young musicians who have expertise and are our next crop. It makes me feel older. Times have changed, and I'm one of the elders now.
''But it's exciting when somebody is imaginative and does something different. Then the music grows. When a musician has something specific to say - not how smart you are, or how good you can play - that's what it's all about.''
Betty Carter will be performing at Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street. Shows are at 8, 10, and midnight, tonight and tomorrow, and 8 and 10 P.M. on Sunday.

HEADLINE: TV Weekend;
Mexican-American Drama on 'Wonderworks'

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
One of public television's more adventurous and distinguished excursions into family entertainment, ''Wonderworks,'' returns for a new season this weekend, having been moved to 10 o'clock on Sunday mornings on Channel 13 from early prime time. The series is produced by a consortium of stations that is headed by WQED in Pittsburgh and that, perhaps significantly, does not include Channel 13.
In any event, the premiere is a two-hour two-part production called ''Sweet 15.'' Marta Delacruz (Karla Montana) is a 14-year-old Californian of Mexican descent and, in typical teen-ager fashion, squeals a lot with her friends about makeup and boyfriends. In Mexican tradition, a girl's 15th birthday is a special ''coming of age'' occasion celebrated with a mass and a quinceanera party. The more elaborate, the better. 
Viewers first meet Marta at her friend's lavish quinceanera, where she notices the streetwise Ramon Sanchez (Panchito Gomez), a Puerto Rican teen-ager who has recently shown up in the neighborhood with what one wary young woman describes as ''no plans, no suitcase and no manners.'' Marta's protective father, Samuel (Tony Plana), goes on instant alert.
The Delacruz family is slowly climbing the economic ladder. Samuel has been made a manager at his factory. He brags about owning his own house and having his own secretary and even having his own parking space. Listening to his wife, Inez (Jenny Gago), he agrees to give Marta a proper quinceanera, though insisting that she be escorted by her cousin - a lummox.
Then come the complications, with something of a vengeance. The father has led his children to believe that he is a United States citizen, but, in fact, he is an illegal alien facing deportation unless he can prove he has worked in this country for a certain number of years. Though he has held many jobs, he mostly used aliases and he sees little hope of his former bosses remembering him. Rather than face the humiliation of begging for mercy, he begins talking about returning to Mexico. The new circumstances force him to cancel the quinceanera, further straining the relationship between Samuel and the justifiably puzzled Marta.
The plot logistics are patly contrived, but ''Sweet 15'' provides unusual glimpses into ordinary Hispanic-American lives, which, on television, are too often limited to the circumscribed worlds of drug dealing and gang violence. But with the accelerated growth of Hispanic communities across the nation, more serious attention is clearly warranted. PBS is a main conduit, not least because Congress has appropriated $9 million for more programming about minorities.
Curiously, although ''Sweet 15'' is produced by Richard Soto, who co-produced and edited the fine film ''The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez,'' its writer, Sharon Weil, and its director, Victoria Hochberg, are not of Hispanic heritage. A question has indeed been raised in some quarters: given the scarce opportunities for minority talent, who should be employed to tell a story about Hispanic teen-agers? Mr. Soto is unfazed. ''I don't think ethnicity matters,'' he said. ''I think it's the sensibilities that count.''
The solid proof is in his production. A cast of fine Hispanic actors, supported in small roles by Jerry Stiller and Susan Ruttan, gets an invaluable chance to shine. Ms. Montana is positively beguiling. There are a good many Hispanic names in the closing technical credits. That's going in the right direction. On the whole, ''Sweet 15'' makes the process all the more pleasant. Welcome back ''Wonderworks.''

COMPANIES
 
The directors of the Campeau Corporation took steps to allow the company's American retailing divisions to operate independently. After four days of meetings at the company's Toronto headquarters, the directors said Campeau's U.S. operations would be overseen by a new board, with a majority of American residents. The board will appoint a new chief executive and chairman, and Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate entrepreneur who founded the company and remains its chairman, will no longer have a voice. [Page A1.] 
 
Some of the biggest losses from Campeau's spending binge for department stores have been borne by individual investors who bought into ''junk bond'' mutual funds that invested heavily in bonds issued by the Campeau Corporation. Some of those bonds are now worth only 10 percent of what investors paid for them. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
 
The chairman and chief executive of UAL warned employees that a recapitalization of the company, which owns United Airlines, would ''cripple United financially.'' In a letter, he urged them and their unions to begin to put together a buyout plan that would give employees a majority stake in the company. [D1.]
 
J. P. Morgan & Company reported a 40 percent decline in its fourth-quarter profits and a loss of $1.27 billion for the year. Analysts were disappointed at the quarter's results and said they would remain depressed until the short-term cost of funds fell relative to the long-term return on investments. [D1.]
 
A leading mergers and acquisitions adviser resigned. Eric J. Gleacher will leave Morgan Stanley, where he has worked since 1983, to start his own firm. Morgan Stanley named two managing directors in the merger area, Bruce D. Fiedorek and Stephen M. Waters, to be co-heads of the department. [D1.]
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Japan's ''voluntary'' quotas on automobile exports to the U.S. will be extended, the Japanese Government is expected to announce soon. But Japan's primary manufacturers say that the action is now an annual political gesture that has no effect on the sales of Japanese cars. [D1.]
 
General Motors said it was in advanced stages of negotiations to assemble cars and engines in Hungary. The arrangement would be the first direct involvement by a U.S. auto maker in what is expected to be a huge market in Eastern Europe. [D2.]
 
The lifting of martial law in China is likely to have little immediate effect on commercial or investment activities, officials of a dozen foreign companies said. [A3.]
 
MARKETS
 
Stocks rebounded as investors sought bargains in the wake of the market's recent weakness. The Dow Jones industrial average, closed the day up 10.03 points, to 2,760.67, after giving up in previous days all of the 56.95 points it gained on Jan. 2. [D6.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in sluggish trading as dealers moved to the sidelines before the Government's reports on producer prices and retail sales, which are scheduled to be released this morning. [D14.]
 
The dollar ended slightly lower in late New York trading in which dealers focused mainly on the cross rates between foreign currencies and the dollar. Gold prices rose modestly. [D15.]
 
Grain prices fell and soybean prices rose in light volume as traders awaited details of several Agriculture Department reports released after the close. [D15.]

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Trade Pressures On the Japanese

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE drop in the Tokyo stock market earlier this week, attributed partly to fears of turmoil in the Soviet Union that could weaken the outlook for Japanese involvement in Eastern Europe, knocked down the yen and lifted the dollar. The weakening yen is likely to worsen the huge United States trade deficit with Japan and intensify the increasingly bitter dispute between the two countries.
But the Japanese may be facing troubles in Europe as well. Kenneth S. Courtis, market strategist and chief economist of the Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, said the yen was also undervalued against the European currencies. He said he thought the yen ''could rise to the 150's against the dollar'' from its current 145, and said he feared that a serious trade crisis was boiling up between Japan and the United States and Europe this year. 
While pressing Japan to open its markets to correct the trade imbalance, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has been putting heavy stress not on currency values but on ''macroeconomic factors,'' especially the high United States budget deficit and low national savings rate, and the high Japanese savings rate.
Mrs. Hills said in an interview on Wednesday that the decline in the dollar after 1985 had little effect on the trade imbalance because ''Japan has maintained its export prices near their 1985 levels, to avoid losing market share.'' In a news conference earlier this week, Mrs. Hills said, ''When the yen gets stronger or the yen gets weaker, the trade balance does not change.''
But Edward M. Bernstein, the first research director of the International Monetary Fund, said he considered that the undervaluation of the yen had been crucial to Japan's persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, not only with the United States but also with the rest of the world. This, to him, suggests a serious and universal exchange-rate misalignment, because of the yen. Abolishing Japanese import barriers, though desirable, would do relatively little toward cutting the United States trade deficit, Mr. Bernstein said. He regards the increase in the American budget deficit since 1981, the last year the United States had a surplus in its balance of payments on current account, as a factor in the trade deficit, but finds it only half as important as the fall in the personal savings rate since 1981. That rate, historically steady at about 7 percent of disposable personal income, plunged from 7.5 percent in 1981 to a low of 3.2 percent in 1987. It recovered partly in 1988, to 4.2 percent, and in 1989, to 5.4 percent.
With this improvement in its savings rate, and the decline of the dollar after 1985, the United States trade deficit did improve with other countries, but not with Japan. The American deficit peaked in the third quarter of 1987 at an annual rate of $162.4 billion. In the third quarter of 1989 it was down to an annual rate of $111 billion. But of that $51.4 billion fall, the deficit with Japan came down only $6.4 billion, while the deficit with Europe fell $26.5 billion, almost to zero.
Mr. Bernstein, now a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, believes the chronic American trade deficit with Japan, hanging on at $50 billion or more, is chiefly the result of the undervaluation of the yen. And he believes this represents deliberate Japanese policy. He said in a letter last month: ''I think we ought to ask ourselves why the dollar has depreciated by 12 percent against the D-mark since the end of August but has been unchanged against the yen. I think the answer is in the billion-dollar bond buyer of Japan who is encouraged by Japanese legislation and policy.''
Japanese funds invested in dollar bonds, money market assets and deposits will lose money in terms of yen, he said. But in strengthening the dollar and weakening the yen, this policy spurs Japanese exports and helps explain why the securities of Japanese export companies have been so strong even in the softening Tokyo stock market. ''With massive investments and new capacity coming on stream, and a weakening yen headed for the 150's against the dollar,'' said the Deutsche Bank's Mr. Courtis, ''Toyota looks like Mike Tyson.'' So do other Japanese exporters.
The danger to Japanese producers is that import-competing industries in the United States and Europe will press their governments to take countermeasures against them.
One way for Japan to head off such measures would be to let the yen appreciate relative to the dollar and other currencies, to reduce its trade surplus. That surplus reached $95 billion in 1988, of which 55 percent was with the United States.
Another solution would be for Japan to raise the wages of its workers, to match the economic value of their productivity, thereby raising consumption, reducing savings and the foreign trade surplus.
Such measures, however, are unlikely to appeal to capital-rich Japan. Mr. Courtis believes that the strategies more likely to gain Japan's support are these: ''Invest like there's no tomorrow''; seek to tie corporate America's interests into its own, as through joint production and capital transfers; yield to American pressure when the going gets tough, as in the present plan to give favorable tax treatment to importers; diversify to other foreign countries, especially in East Asia, and use the Japanese stock market as a means of generating ''oceans of low-cost capital.''
The current nervousness of the Tokyo market, however, suggests that none of these approaches is foolproof.

HEADLINE: G.M. Near Agreement On Venture in Hungary

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it was at an advanced stage of negotiations to assemble cars and engines in Hungary.
Such an arrangement would be the first direct involvement by a United States auto maker in what is expected to be a huge market in Eastern Europe.
The plan puts the auto maker a step ahead of its American rivals in the quest to become positioned to exploit Eastern Europe's growing car market and its low-cost labor, industry analysts said. 
''Potentially, car sales in Eastern Europe can double or triple in the next decade. If G.M.'s not there early on, then Volkswagen and Fiat will be,'' said John Casesa, analyst with Wertheim Schroeder in New York.
 
Up to 200,000 Engines
While a General Motors spokesman refused to discuss details, the Hungarian news agency MTI-Econews said today that the auto maker and a Hungarian company called RABA will soon sign a preliminary agreement.
MTI-Econews said the joint venture would produce between 100,000 and 200,000 car engines a year and assemble 10,000 to 15,000 of G.M.'s Opel Kadett cars, mainly for export, at a plant near the Hungarian border with Austria.
''There is an incredible need for personal automotive transport product in Eastern Europe,'' said Joseph Phillippi, analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
Mr. Casesa, of Wertheim Schroeder, said there are currently 115 vehicles for every 1,000 people in Eastern Europe, compared with 728 vehicles for every 1,000 people in the United States. He said the Eastern European figure could rise to 300 to 400 vehicles for every 1,000 people in the next 20 years.
 
Others Moving Quickly
While General Motors might become the first United States manufacturer to assemble cars in Eastern Europe, other car companies are moving quickly to capitalize on the political and economic reforms sweeping the region.
The Suzuki Motor Company of Japan announced earlier this week a joint venture with a Hungarian concern and other partners to build subcompact cars in Hungary.
Two other well-positioned car makers are West Germany's Volkswagen A.G., which already has an engine venture with East Germany, and Italy's Fiat S.p.A., which has been helping the Soviet Union and Poland develop cars for years.
But Michael Luckey, who heads the Luckey Consulting Group, said one of the problems companies face in Eastern Europe is bringing the work force up to Western skill and productivity levels.
Expanding in Eastern Europe is particularly critical for General Motors because the car maker's European operations currently produce the bulk of its profits. Its North American operations are losing money.

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's leading indicator rebounded in December as United States semiconductor shipments and orders increased, signaling a recovery from the summer slowdown, the Semiconductor Industry Association said today.
The trade association, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1 for the three months ending in December, up from 0.93 in November and a revised figure of 0.92 in October. The book-to-bill compares orders to shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $100 was ordered, indicating steady demand.
At $1.22 billion, three-month orders for December were up 4.2 percent from $1.172 billion for the period ended in November and 6.5 percent higher than the figure posted a year ago, which was $1.15 billion.
Three-month average shipments for December totaled $1.22 billion. At $1.28 billion, United States market shipments for December were 6.7 percent higher than November's $1.20 billion and 3.7 percent higher than the figure posted a year ago, which was $1.24 billion.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Security Prices Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in very sluggish trading yesterday, as dealers moved to the sidelines in advance of two important economic reports today.
The market's lethargic tone came as a surprise to some participants, who said they thought there would be some positive follow-through from Wednesday's successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes.
''The auction was a catalyst for people to do something,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''But today there is complete and utter inaction.'' 
This morning the Government will release producer price and retail sales data for December. Since most analysts are expecting that the December cold snap caused a big jump in producer prices, Mr. Capra and other participants said the retail sales numbers were likely to generate more interest.
 
Retail Sales Estimate
In advance of the report, most analysts were expecting that retail sales rose by a healthy six-tenths or seven-tenths of a percentage point last month, after a gain of eight-tenths of a point in November.
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that an increase of that size could well overstate consumer activity because of last month's weather.
''Retail sales may appear to be strong, but they could be influenced by one-time factors,'' Mr. Kahan said. ''Because of the cold weather, energy prices went up, which may boost overall sales figures for gasoline and heating oil. Similarly, there could be some boost to spending in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake.''
Unlike most of his colleagues, Mr. Kahan is forecasting that the sales figures will show a decline of 1.2 percent.
As often occurs, dealers chose to sell Treasury securities in advance of the release of the reports.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 100 5/32, down 11/32, to yield 8.11 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 29/ 32, down 5/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 15/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.92 percent.
 
Auction of One-Year Notes
Yesterday the Treasury sold $9.5 billion worth of one-year notes at its monthly auction.
The bills were sold at an average discounted rate of 7.21 percent, up from the average 7.14 percent rate recorded at the auction in December.
Reflecting recent strong demand for short-term securities by individual investors, the Treasury received $1.1 billion worth of non-competitive bids for the new bills. The amount was more than double the size of non-competitive bids at the last one-year note auction, and was the largest since the one-year bill auction held Jan. 11, 1989.
Meanwhile, rates rose in the secondary Treasury bill market.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.54 percent, up six basis points, or hundredths of a point. And six-month bill rates rose by three-basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.39 percent.
Activity in the corporate bond market was dominated by a $750 million offering from the Eastman Kodak Company. The 9.20 percent five-year issue was priced at $99.897, to yield 9.226 percent, 1.30 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 7 3/4 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The issue, which was increased from $500 million because of strong demand, quickly sold out. Investor reaction to the sale of Kodak debt stood in stark contrast to a $350 million offering of 15-year notes by the company in the fall of 1988.
That issue was the first deal to be priced in the aftermath of the takeover of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm. Investors, fearful that the RJR transaction might be a harbinger of other huge corporate takeovers, reacted negatively to the Kodak offering.
 
Kodak Issues Snapped Up
But investors snapped up yesterday's sale of Kodak securities even though the issue did not contain ''event risk'' language that offers bondholders protection in the event of a takeover.
As the interest rate on yesterday's offering suggests, Kodak paid dearly for choosing not to include event-risk language.
According to data from Salomon Brothers, new issues of A-rated ten-year bonds issued by industrial companies were priced at an average spread of 1.13 percentage points over 10-year Treasuries in the week ended Jan. 4. For five-year issues the spread would normally be much narrower.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most intermediate-term issues were unchanged to up an eighth of a point. Most long-term issues, meanwhile, dipped by about an eighth of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most actively traded issues were unchanged to down by about an eighth of a point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Bank reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Jan. 1. The third, most closely watched measure, M-2, fell by $5.9 billion. The report had no effect on prices in the fixed-income markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Down a Bit; Gold Prices Up Modestly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower yesterday after a session in which dealers focused mainly on cross rates between foreign currencies rather than the dollar.
Gold prices rose modestly, with bullion for current delivery gaining $1.60 an ounce, to $414, on the New York Commodity Exchange.
''It's essentially been a cross market,'' said Robert White, manager of corporate trading at the First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. ''It isn't so much the dollar. It's the yen against the market. It's the market against the Swiss.'' 
The Swiss National Bank's president, Markus Lusser, said that Swiss interest rates might remain above rates in West Germany for some time to prevent the Swiss franc from weakening further against the German mark.
 
Swiss Franc Up Sharply
Higher interest rates would make the currency more attractive for investors to hold, and Mr. Lusser's comment drove the franc sharply higher.
''The market is just a bundle of nerves'' because there is no clear trend for the dollar, Mr. White said.
Dealers are watching political developments in Eastern Europe closely for signs of instability, which might lead investors to rush into dollars as a safe haven, he said.
Traders are also keeping a keen eye on United States interest rates for any sign of credit easing by the Federal Reserve, which would tend to make the dollar less attractive, he said.
In late New York trading, the dollar slipped to 145.45 yen, down from 145.55 late Wednesday.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.6795 marks, down from 1.6825; 1.5065 Swiss francs, down from 1.5165; 5.7215 French francs, down from 5.7265; 1,253.75 Italian lire, down from 1,257.25, and 1.1562 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1585.
The dollar rose slightly against the British pound. The pound fell to $1.6597 from $1.6625.
Silver for current delivery closed unchanged at $5.306 an ounce on New York's Comex.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up 4.8% in '89, Most in 8 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Paced by big increases for energy and tobacco, producer prices jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in December to bring 1989 inflation by this measure to 4.8 percent, the highest rate since 1981.
Last month's rise was somewhat more than expected, and traders said the report contributed to a skid in stock prices and a further creeping up of interest rates in the credit markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.46 points, to 2,689.21, and bond yields rose as traders worried that the report would make the Federal Reserve reluctant to ease interest rates further. [Pages 35 and 38.] But many analysts contended that the latest figures were not so bad as they seemed. The markets focused on the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which these analysts said was heavily influenced last month by special factors. They also noted that an index based on earlier stages of production showed a decline in prices. 
''It doesn't appear to us to represent an acceleration'' of the pressures that lead to higher consumer prices, Alfred G. Smith, an economist for the NCNB Corporation, based in Charlotte, N.C., said of today's report.
Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members pay the prices used in calculating the indexes, said, ''I don't see any cause for fundamental concern.''
When food, energy and tobacco are excluded, he noted, the December increase was only one-tenth of a percent. Food and energy are subject to big month-to-month swings, and tobacco prices jumped 4.5 percent because of a year-end industry price increase that has not yet been fully incorporated into the index's seasonal adjustment process. Tobacco accounts for nearly 3 percent of the index.
Still, some analysts shared the markets' worries that today's report might prompt the Federal Reserve to be more cautious about cutting interest rates. And Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation, cautioned against trying to explain away each statistic showing a jump in inflation. He said it was disappointing to find inflation ''this stubborn'' after many months of slower economic growth.
On the other hand, a separate report today showed a meager rise of two-tenths of a percent in December retail sales, and the Federal Reserve will undoubtedly regard that as a reason to consider some additional credit-easing, analysts suggested.
The 4.8 percent annual increase for finished goods compared with 4 percent in 1988 and 2.2 percent in 1987 and was the highest since the 7.1 percent increase of 1981, the year when oil prices peaked.
The Producer Price Indexes reflect the prices received by domestic producers for commodities in various stages of processing. Unlike the Consumer Price Indexes, imports and services are not included.
One Producer Price Index tracks finished goods, which are defined as those ready for sale to the final individual or business user; an intermediate-goods index gauges the prices of semifinished items that require further processing or completed items that are used as parts of other products, and a crude-goods index measures prices of items entering the production chain for the first time. For example, wheat would be a crude good, flour an intermediate good and bread a finished good.
One striking sign of weakness in American industry was that the producer price category for durable manufacturing materials, like metals, tumbled 1.6 percent in December, the biggest monthly decline since April 1980. The durable materials component, which is part of the intermediate index, fell 3.4 percent for all of 1989, in sharp contrast to surges of 10.1 percent in 1988 and 11.6 percent in 1987.
Over all, intermediate goods edged down one-tenth of a percent for the second straight month, after showing no change in October. For the year, intermediate goods rose 2.4 percent, less than half the 5.6 percent advance in 1988.
Crude goods, whose prices fluctuate widely, jumped 1.8 percent in December, to bring the 1989 increase to 6.9 percent, more than twice the 1988 increase of 3.1 percent. Crude oil soared 35 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979, after it fell 18.1 percent in 1988.
 
Energy Up 10% for Year
Among finished goods, energy costs climbed 1.4 percent after falling 3.3 percent in November, ending the year up nearly 10 percent; in 1988, the index's energy component fell 3.4 percent. The index's gasoline prices last month were unchanged, after seasonal adjustment, but on an unadjusted basis, prices were down 2.4 percent, according to the Labor Department report.
Food prices advanced five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with an eight-tenths increase in November, as increases for beef, dairy products and eggs slowed, and pork and turkey prices turned down. Prices rose, however, for fresh vegetables, processed fruits and vegetables, and pasta.
For the year, foods rose 5 percent, with eggs up 40.9 percent, the second straight leap of that magnitude, partially because of higher feed prices and the reduction in flocks caused by the 1988 drought.
Much of last month's rise for consumer goods other than food and energy reflected the advance in tobacco prices and higher prices for cars and light trucks.
In recent years, the tobacco industry has been raising prices twice a year, but the Government's statisticians have not yet been able to adjust fully for this since their seasonal patterns are based generally on the most recent five-year period.
Prices of capital equipment rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month to finish the year 3.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
The index for finished goods now stands at 115.3, with 1982 equaling 100. That means a basket of goods that cost $100 in 1982 now costs $115.30.
 
Wide Monthly Variations
For the first five months of 1989, the index averaged monthly increases of more than seven-tenths of a percent, but three of the next six months showed price declines and the average increase was less than one-tenth of 1 percent. December's increase was the biggest since September, which upon revision today showed an increase of eight-tenths instead of the nine-tenths first reported.
Price declines for manufacturing and construction materials were even more widespread in December than in November. Copper and brass mill shapes dropped 6.4 percent, while aluminum shapes declined for the seventh straight month. Lead and zinc also fell, as did nondurables like plastic resins, industrial chemicals, phosphates and inedible fats and oils. Construction materials and components fell for the second straight month, with their full-year 1989 rise at 2.4 percent.
In crude goods, energy and food prices rose more than in November, while decreases slowed for basic industrial materials. Crude energy jumped 2.2 percent as petroleum and natural gas rose faster than in November, while coal fell, offsetting its big November increase.

HEADLINE: As Market Struggles, So Do Some Co-op Buildings

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
At least 88 residential cooperatives with nearly 9,000 apartments in the New York City area are facing severe financial difficulties. And the number of such co-ops is growing, causing concern among owners and in the State Attorney General's office, which monitors co-op conversions.
''I am expecting that figure to escalate with the downturn of the market,'' said Fred Mehlman, the assistant attorney general in charge of the state's Real Estate Financing Bureau.
The main problem, lawyers and regulators say, is the struggle by some professional co-op converters to pay the monthly maintenance costs on apartments they have not yet sold.
 
Trouble in a Weak Market
These converters - also known as sponsors - are in trouble because of cash shortages resulting from the weakening real-estate market. A handful of condominiums are also affected. 
Maintenance payments cover the installments on a building's underlying mortgage as well as its utility bills, staffing costs and real-estate taxes, among other expenses.
If the bills are not paid, creditors, like the bank holding the underlying mortgage, could foreclose on the building. In these extreme cases, owners could potentially lose the money they have invested in their apartments.
The problem was first acknowledged by Mr. Mehlman last November. At that time, only a few modest buildings in Brooklyn and Queens were known to be facing financial problems. But now all types of buildings in various kinds of neighborhoods - including two in Westchester County and one on Long Island - are on the Attorney General's list. Among them are the 2,700-unit Tudor City complex in midtown Manhattan, a luxury building at 1045 Park Avenue, at 86th Street, and a small co-op at 305 Eighth Avenue in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.
 
Looking for Saviors
But state officials and lawyers are working on solutions, including finding new investors with deeper pockets to take over the sponsors' obligations.
The people most likely to be affected are those who bought apartments in the 2,300 buildings converted in the last four or five years, because these buildings have the most unsold units. Until now such troubles occurred rarely, and only in cases of personal mismanagement; now they are more a function of the economy.
Among the buildings being studied by the state finance bureau are 50 sponsored by Time Equities Inc., one of the largest converters in the city. It has filed statements notifying state authorities that it is trying to renegotiate loan payments with its lenders so it can continue to meet its obligations to its co-ops. Maintenance payments are still up to date in these buildings, although it is uncertain if they will remain so.
Thirty-eight more buildings are the subjects of investigations that were started by Mr. Mehlman's office after tenant-shareholders complained that their sponsors had failed for several months to make maintenance payments or to meet other financial obligations to the co-op corporations.
 
Recalling the Depression
In addition to the buildings reported to the Attorney General's office, lawyers specializing in co-op clients say they are handling several such cases after rarely seeing them before. They said they will be collecting definitive numbers later this month.
If the troubled buildings go into foreclosure or bankruptcy, buyers could be left with worthless investments, something that has not occurred in New York since the Depression, said Harold Lubell, chairman of the Co-op and Condominium Committee of the Real Property Section of the New York State Bar Association.
In other buildings, maintenance payments are rising sharply and special assessments are being levied to help cover the money lost through the disappearance of sponsor income, Mr. Mehlman said.
In all, some 5,000 buildings have been converted from rental to co-op status in New York City since the first wave of mass conversions started in 1976. Thousands of units in these buildings are still owned by sponsors because state conversion laws permitted rent-regulated tenants to remain as renters if they did not want to buy. In most cases, the rents these tenants paid did not cover the monthly maintenance charges that the sponsor-owners had to pay on their apartments.
 
Loss of Deductibility
This was not a problem when values were rising and sales were brisk, Mr. Lubell said. Sponsors were able to make up the cash-flow losses by using them as tax deductions, by making hefty profits when tenants died or moved away and by selling occupied units to investors at deep discounts.But the Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited the deductibility of the losses. Then the co-op market softened, values began falling and sales became harder to make. As a result, some sponsors no longer have the cash reserves to cover their monthly shortfalls. In other instances, vacancies did not occur at the expected rate.
''The balloon is bursting on these deals,'' said Alan Kazlow, a lawyer with Dreyer and Traub, a firm specializing in co-op matters.
The first rumblings of trouble came in November, when Time Equities filed statements with the Attorney General confirming ''an adverse change'' in the company's financial circumstances. The statements have covered 50 buildings to date, although Francis Greenburger, the chairman, said there may be more. Such a filing must be made to fulfill requirements on disclosing a building's finances to buyers.
The Council of New York Cooperatives, an alliance of co-op buildings, is receiving calls ''on a daily basis'' about such troubles, said Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director. It has scheduled a workshop on the topic for Jan. 24 and will hold a call-in TV show on Cable Channel 25 on Feb. 13.
The Co-op and Condominium Committee of the New York State Bar Association is sponsoring a seminar on the topic on Jan. 19. Questionnaires will be circulated to determine ''just how widespread the problem has really become,'' Mr. Lubell said. The committee will discuss actions that might be taken ''so that shareholders do not lose their investments,'' he said.
 
Calling in the Loans
Lawyers say there is another reason the problem is likely to spread. When the market was at its height two years ago, many occupied units were financed for as much as 50 percent of the full market value they would have had if vacant. Now, many such units are worth even less. Thus lenders, as they see the value of their collateral sink, may start calling in the loans they provided to sponsors to carry these units.
''It's going to become very, very complicated,'' said Stuart Saft, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
What is expected to happen is the development of two classes of co-ops: those that will retain value because the units are almost totally owner-occupied, and those whose values may drop because so many units are still under sponsor control.
For the ordinary shareholder this can have costly implications. Randall Carnahan, an insurance broker who is the former president of the 31-unit co-op at 305 Eighth Avenue in Park Slope, saw the monthly maintenance on his two-bedroom apartment rise from $250 to $500 after the sponsor, who still owned 19 units in the building, defaulted. When Mr. Carnahan was transferred to Rhode Island recently, he did not even try to sell, ''because nobody would even think of buying until we sort ourselves out,'' he said.
 
Proceed With Caution
Anyone purchasing a co-op is now being advised by lawyers to request a copy of the co-op corporation's financial statement from the building's managing agent. The lawyers say questions should also be asked about how many apartments are still owned by the sponsor. If the number seems large - a third or more - the buyer might wish to proceed cautiously. The buyer might also check with the Real Estate Financing Bureau of the Attorney General's office to see if complaints about the sponsor have been filed.
Mr. Mehlman said his office is discussing regulatory changes; one would make the filing of liens on co-ops compulsory. The bureau is also discussing legislative changes, like increasing the number of units that must be sold before a conversion can be approved. Under current rules, a conversion can take place only after 15 percent of the units are sold.
But officials and lawyers specializing in co-op matters insist that there are other solutions. Some co-ops are exercising their rights under corporation bylaws and lease provisions to take over the defaulting sponsor's units and use the rents or sales to cover costs. Others are negotiating with the banks to refinance loan delinquencies.
Still others are finding buyers who see disaster as opportunity. One is Arthur Cornfeld, president of ABC Properties, an investment concern. He has taken over the sponsor's holdings at 140 West 58th Street, a 31-unit co-op building, paying what he considered a fire-sale price for the apartments - $3 million for 25 units plus 6 units structured as condominiums for use as offices by professionals like doctors and dentists. Three apartments have already been vacated and sold for a net return of $500,000, Mr. Cornfeld said. He has also pumped sorely needed capital into the building.
Gary Aigen, treasurer of a 50-unit co-op at 320 West 83d Street, said his co-op was solving the problem by accepting installment payments. Its sponsor, Mr. Aigen said, fell $30,000 behind on maintenance, failed to pay $100,000 owed to the reserve fund and was not paying contractors on schedule. So far, the co-op has recouped $100,000 of the outstanding balance.
The buildings where apartments are still owned by Time Equities have not been adversely affected so far. Beatrice Berkowitz, president of the largest of the Tudor City buildings, insisted that nothing had changed. Annice Alt, treasurer at 250 Cabrini Boulevard in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where Time Equities still owns 48 of the 76 apartments, agreed. ''Of course we are concerned,'' she said. ''But there is really nothing we can do except wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Imposes a Hiring Freeze That Could Eliminate 50,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced today that he had imposed a freeze on civilian hiring through Oct. 1, a move that Pentagon officials said would probably eliminate more than 50,000 jobs from a work force of 1.05 million civilians.
Pentagon officials said they hoped to let attrition reduce the number of civilian employees over the next nine months, averting the need for layoffs on Oct. 1 when the 1991 fiscal year begins.
Mr. Cheney has said publicly that he expects military spending to decline in the next few years, but the hiring freeze announced today is one of his first concrete steps in that direction.
President Bush is to present his 1991 budget on Jan. 29, and officials have said it will call for cuts in both military personnel and civilian employees as well as propose what Mr. Cheney has termed extensive base closings. 
''As the armed forces are reduced over the long term in light of limited budgets, a changing world situation and future negotiated agreements,'' Mr. Cheney said in a statement issued by the Pentagon, ''the department must make corresponding reductions in the size of the civilian work force that supports the armed forces.''
Today's announcement came several hours after Mr. Bush, in a speech to the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, warned Congress against cutting ''the muscle out of our defense'' as a way to provide more money for other programs. [Page 11.] Mr. Cheney announced on Thursday that he was making management changes for the 1991 fiscal year that would eliminate 8,000 civilian and 8,000 military jobs from the Pentagon's acquisitions and logistics bureaucracy.
A senior Pentagon official said that some of those jobs being eliminated would be among the total lost during the freeze, although it was not possible to predict how many. He explained that budget planners expect that some of the employees whose jobs have been identified for elimination would resign this year before the 1991 budget takes effect and they would not be replaced.
The Pentagon hiring freeze and the Bush comments both appeared aimed at persuading Congress, which returns to work on Jan. 23, that the Administration is moving on its own to reduce the Pentagon budget and bureaucracy, and any effort by Congress to make deeper cuts would be damaging to national security.
The Pentagon last imposed a hiring freeze in 1982, but it lasted only for a few months.
Pentagon officials have said that Mr. Cheney will propose a budget for 1991 that amounts to $295 billion in outlays. a cut of about 2 percent from 1990 with inflation taken into account.
 
Some Urge Deeper Cuts
As Mr. Cheney prepares to defend his proposal, some lawmakers are already calling for far deeper cuts, and Pentagon officials say they must at least plan for the possibility that Congress will appropriate significantly less money than $295 billion.
''It's better not to hire people than it is to fire them,'' said one Pentagon official. ''By the time the dust settles and October rolls around, it's going to be a lot easier to make these decisions.''
Pentagon now has about 927,000 full-time civilian employees around the world and another 123,000 on a part-time basis.
According to Pentagon figures, as many as 80,000 civilians leave the payroll each year. If the freeze is in place for about nine months, from Jan. 11 to Oct. 1, officials estimated that the total number of jobs eliminated would be more than 50,000.
Officials said they could not predict how this would be divided between full-time and part-time positions.
 
Exceptions to the Freeze
In a directive to the Pentagon's civilian employees and military officers, Mr. Cheney provided for some exceptions to the prohibition on hiring civilians. They included these:
* Hiring commitments made before Jan. 11.
* Medical, safety and security workers.
* Political appointees, subject to the approval of the Defense Secretary or his deputy, who are working on management improvements or the President's anti-drug program.
* People identified by the heads of the military department, the inspector general or the directors of other Pentagon agencies who are deemed ''essential to maintain an important national defense capability.''
It was unclear how many people might be hired under these exceptions.
 
Freeze Called 'Inefficient'
Lawrence Korb, who served in the Reagan Administration from 1981 to 1985 as Assistant Secretary of Defense for manpower, installations and logistics, termed a hiring freeze a ''grossly inefficient way to reduce personnel.''
''It's very difficult to fire Federal employees,'' Mr. Korb said. ''It's easier to avoid the tough decisions, and take the flak from people you haven't hired yet.''
With a freeze, Mr. Korb said, reductions will come ''willy-nilly.''
''Maybe this year all the typists will retire at once, and you'll have too many metal workers and not enough typists,'' he said. ''Or the opposite could happen.''

HEADLINE: Rebels' Allies Stand Firm in Salvador

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Every morning he combs the local newspapers, looking anxiously for the names of captured and killed guerrillas.
He knows that one morning the newspaper may break his heart, informing him that one of his two sons fighting with the rebels has been killed.
This Salvadoran did not flinch, however, when his sons were recalled to active duty three days ago after several weeks of rest following the big rebel offensive in November. 
Although both sides in the civil war have accepted United Nations mediation, this man and many other Salvadorans expect another major military strike by the rebels in the next few days.
 
Faith in the 'Revolution'
''There's no solution without revolution,'' he said, requesting anonymity. When his teen-age daughter told him recently that she wanted to become a scientist, he says he told her, ''What this country really needs now is revolutionaries.''
The man's story illustrates the deep commitment of rebel supporters. It also suggests why a quick end to El Salvador's civil war is unlikely, even if the two sides promptly begin negotiations.
The announcement on Thursday that the rebels had decided to accept United Nations mediation appears likely to usher in a period of intermittent negotiations and fierce fighting. In this country, at least, talking and killing can proceed simultaneously.
The war has aggravated the deep social divisions that drove the rebels into the hills in the first place. Economists say that the country's distribution of wealth is even more lopsided now than it was in the years leading up the outbreak of fighting. This is the case despite a much-heralded land-reform policy introduced in the mid-1980's.
 
The Lost Decade
In El Salvador, as in much of Latin America, the 1980's are often called ''the lost decade.'' Although the economy has expanded somewhat, few of the benefits have trickled down to the poor. Half of all adult Salvadorans are unemployed or underemployed.
The war, the flight of capital, a hurricane, a devastating earthquake, two droughts and persistent corruption have offset $4 billion in United States aid, of which $1 billion was military.
Poor families have been hit the hardest. The average Salvadoran family struggles to survive on an income that is about a third less in real terms than at the start of the war. Infant mortality has surged as rural access to safe drinking water has plummeted.
Nonetheless, the country has managed to hold five relatively fair elections since 1982. And last year, power was transferred for the first time this century from one civilian Government to another.
 
A Bit More Breathing Room
The military has resisted numerous right-wing calls for coups, and the power of the civilian President, while still limited by the armed forces, has increased.
The slaying of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter here on Nov. 16 refocused world attention on human rights abuses by El Salvador's rightist forces. President Alfredo Cristiani said this week that an inquiry had shown that the country's military was behind the attack on the priests, who had vigorously argued for a negotiated end to the civil war.
But while most guerrillas in the early 1980's said they joined the movement because of savage brutal rightist repression, rebels are now more likely to cite the country's desperate economic situation than human rights abuses.
The November offensive showed that the guerrillas retain broad support, more than enough to continue their military struggle. ''While it's doubtful the guerrillas can win, they can't lose, at least in the short run,'' one Western diplomat said as the November offensive wound down.

HEADLINE: Cairo Ousts Hard-Line Interior Minister

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 12

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak dismissed his Interior Minister today in what seemed intended as a show of increased authority. The announcement signaled the most dramatic change of the political lineup here in months.
A presidential decree announcing that the Interior Minister, Zaki Badr, had been replaced by a police official, Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa, gave no explanation for the dismissal.
But Egyptian commentators linked the move to coarse outbursts by the hard-line Interior Minister against newspaper columnists, writers, opposition figures and Islamic scholars. The outbursts were reported this week. 
''Is this the position of the Government? Is this how the state is going treat us?'' a commentator, Mustafa Amin, said in an editorial today, referring to what he said were reports that Mr. Badr had ordered assaults on Egyptian men with beards, the usual emblem of Islamic fundamentalism.
 
Accused of Going Too Far
''I think our political theater has gone too far,'' said Ahmed Baha Ed-Din, another commentator, comparing Mr. Badr to actors departing from the scripts that they were supposed to follow.
Mr. Badr had led the Government's crackdown against Islamic fundamentalists and had sanctioned tough measures against thousands of detainees. The measures brought outcries from Egyptian and foreign human rights groups about police behavior and reports of torture.
He had also scuffled in Parliament with opposition legislators accusing his ministry of human rights abuses and was known for his ready recourse to obscene language about his adversaries. The authorities said last month that he had been the target of a car-bomb attack in Cairo, but the circumstances are unclear.
This week an opposition newspaper began a chorus of calls for the resignation of the 53-year-old Mr. Badr when it published a report on a meeting he addressed in a provincial town. There, he was said to have used crude epithets to describe opposition politicians and newspaper commentators, including those who questioned his activities in today's official press.
 
Held Office Since 1986
Some diplomats said today's newspaper commentaries may have been intended to prepare Egyptians for the announcement of Mr. Badr's dismissal, a move that many Egyptians seemed to welcome in private conversations.
Since 1986, when he took office, Mr. Badr has acted as Mr. Mubarak's iron fist in the official campaign against purported cells of Islamic militants from the organization that assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. He was once quoted as saying he viewed Islamic extremists as ''mad dogs, with all respect to dogs.''
The Minister made widespread use of the emergency powers in force since then to jail adversaries without trial. The authorities have pursued a two-track approach to fundamentalism in Egypt, the most populous nation in the Arab world and Washington's most prominent Arab ally in Middle East diplomacy.
While those fundamentalists ready to renounce violence are tolerated, those seeking the violent overthrow of the secular Government faced constant harassment and pressure from Mr. Badr's ministry and from the police forces under its command.
Western diplomats said the policy was likely to continue, possibly in a less flamboyant manner, under his successor, Mr. Moussa. Before his appointment to the Interior Ministry, Mr. Moussa was Governor of Asyut, one of Egypt's most troubled provinces, where Islamic fundamentalism has deep roots. Last month hundreds of people were detained after street battles between the police and Islamic protesters there.
 
New Assertiveness Seen
Mr. Moussa, 59 years old, has also worked as the head of the Interior Ministry's public security department, until October 1987.
Mr. Mubarak took office after the assassination of Mr. Sadat and has since been seen as a cautious figure, relying on aides to carry out his policies, in contrast to the styles of his predecessors, Mr. Sadat and Nasser.
Last year, however, the President dismissed his powerful Defense Minister, Mohammed Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala, showing what diplomats depicted as a new assertiveness.
But Western financiers have registered concern at Mr. Mubarak's increasing desire to take charge of all decision-making, saying it slows the already ponderous process of economic change that Cairo is pursuing in inconclusive negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Obsession in Boston: Mystery of Couple's Deaths

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The story of Charles and Carol Stuart has become an obsession here, from the drawing rooms of Back Bay to the bar stools of Revere, the working-class suburb where Mr. Stuart grew up.
Radio talk-show hosts say they have difficulty making callers discuss anything else. Previous preoccupations like the Massachusetts economy and the specter of more taxes have been pushed aside by revelations about Mr. Stuart.
''The last time this happened was when the Red Sox were in the World Series,'' said Jerry Williams, the host of a weekday radio show on WRKO. 
Investigators say Mr. Stuart leaped to his death in Boston Harbor from the Tobin Bridge last week after learning that he had become the prime suspect in the deaths of his wife, Carol, and baby boy, Christopher.
Mr. Stuart's account to the police was that a black gunman jumped into their car and shot him and his wife after they left childbirth classes at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Oct. 23. Mrs. Stuart, seven months pregnant, died of a gunshot would to the head; Mr. Stuart was hospitalized for a stomach wound; their son, Christopher, was delivered by Caesarean section and died 17 days later.
 
Calls for Resignations
The moods of those who phone the talk shows range from disbelief, as in, ''How could he shoot his pregnant wife?'' to fury, as in, ''How could he have fooled the whole city?'' Callers are highly critical of the Boston police and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office.
Today a Suffolk County grand jury resumed hearing witnesses in the case, but the focus shifted to Mr. Stuart from the earlier suspect, a black man arrested on the basis of what Mr. Stuart had told the police. Mr. Stuart was found dead in Boston Harbor on Jan. 4.
Among the witnesses were Gary McLaughlin, a State Police radio dispatcher who took Mr. Stuart's phone call reporting an attack on his wife and himself, and David Maclean, a high school friend of Mr. Stuart. Law-enforcement officials say Mr. Maclean has told them Mr. Stuart asked him late last summer to help kill Mrs. Stuart.
 
Misplaced Sympathy
For the most part Bostonians seem upset that they poured out sympathy for a man who turned out to be a killer. Boston has 100 or fewer homicides a year.
''Mr. Stuart has ruined everybody's faith and trust in Boston,'' said Richard O'Connor, a real estate agent. ''Boston is a small town and I've always enjoyed living here, being able to walk through the Esplanade at night with my dogs or strike up a friendly conversation with someone on the street. What he has done has really hurt everyone in some way or another.''
Bob Cataldo, an insurance salesman in Revere, said, ''This was a shock to everyone and a blow to the city.''
There have been calls for the resignations of Mayor Raymond L. Flynn and Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache, said Stephen Hill, host of a morning call-in show on WILD, an A.M radio station whose programs focus on issues important to blacks.
Mayor Flynn rewrote his State of the City speech to discuss the case and its effect on the people of Boston. ''I must report with more than a little sadness that the state of the city, or better, the mood of the city, ranges from disbelief to cynicism to anger,'' the Mayor said in the speech Wednesday night.
He defended ordering ''an aggressive police response'' in the Mission Hill neighborhood, where Mr. Stuart said the shooting occurred. People have charged that in the police search for the suspect Mr. Stuart described, their doors were broken down and their apartments ransacked.
A group of black legislators have asked the United States Attorney here, Wayne A. Budd, to look into possible civil rights violations. ''Was I wrong? I don't think so,'' the Mayor said. ''But it turned out we were all victims of a sinister hoax.''
 
Book Hunters in Town
Publishers and literary agents have descended on reporters (and been descended upon by them). ''We've already been faxed a proposal by two Boston Herald reporters,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Bantam Books in New York.
Kevin Cullen, a reporter for The Boston Globe who is covering the case, said he had had five or six calls, book offers and screenplay proposals. ''I've said, 'Listen. I've got too much work to do,' '' said Mr. Cullen. ''It didn't surprise me. It just confirmed everything I thought about California and the movies and books and all that. When they smell blood, they don't wait around.''
A producer for ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' said she thought Matthew Stuart, Mr. Stuart's younger brother who went to the police with information that made Charles Stuart the chief suspect, might consider discussing the episode on national television but said her call was not returned.
 
Television Special Planned
CBS has announced plans for a television special based on the footage its ''Rescue 911'' film crew shot the night of the shootings. The camera crew were riding in a Boston ambulance when the call came in from Charles Stuart's car phone: ''My wife's been shot! I've been shot!''
Home Box Office, the cable television company, says it would like to produce a movie as well. Sheila Shayon, assistant to the company chairman and director of special projects, said: ''This guy was like a lot of people all of us know. You want to say, 'Whoa, there but for the grace of God go I and a lot of other people.' ''

HEADLINE: Congress Is Warned by Bush Not to Cut Pentagon Budget

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Seeking to fight off deeper cuts in the military budget than those proposed by the Pentagon, President Bush today warned Congress against trying to ''naively cut the muscle out of our defense'' to provide more money for other programs.
In the second of a series of speeches leading to his State of the Union Message, which he is to deliver on Jan. 31, the President warned that he would not support new domestic programs paid for with money taken from the military budget.
Mr. Bush spoke of his ''excitement'' about the changes sweeping Eastern Europe. ''But in this world of change,'' he told members of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, ''one thing is certain: America must be ready.'' 
The President renewed an attack on Congress that he began Monday in a visit to Orlando, Fla., complaining that four big bills he sent to Congress last year have not yet been acted on: legislation to cut the capital gains tax, a child care measure, amendments to the Clean Air Act and tougher penalties against drug dealers.
 
'Jungles of Capitol Hill'
These issues are expected to be considered by Congress in the coming session, and Mr. Bush appears to be assured of winning the cut in the capital gains tax rate that he sought last year. The President, who irritated Democratic lawmakers on Monday by denouncing the ''demagogues who call this a tax cut for the rich,'' said the four issues ''are bogged down in the jungles of Capitol Hill.''
''The clock is running,'' he said, ''and America's patience is running out.''
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said he was disappointed with the President's comments. ''George Bush was offering his hand to the Congress, and now he appears to be giving Congress the back of his hand,'' Mr. Gephardt said in Washington.
''Frankly, the President hasn't given us much of an agenda,'' Mr. Gephardt added. ''He's complaining now that we're not acting on his agenda. As I remember last year, we worked on almost everything he asked us to do, and what we didn't get done we're likely to complete in the first few months of this year. There hasn't been any foot-dragging.''
Commenting on events in Eastern Europe, Mr. Bush said he welcomed ''the dynamic changes'' taking place in that region. ''I strongly support Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika and his commitment to peaceful change and openness,'' he said, referring to the Soviet President and his economic and political policies. ''But this is not a time when we should naively cut the muscle out of our defense posture.''
 
Panama Illustrates the Need
Mr. Bush suggested that his invasion of Panama underscored the need to maintain a high level of military readiness. The United States needs ''a strong defense, a ready and highly effective defense force,'' he said, adding, ''If proof of that were ever needed, we saw it last month in the courage of our troops in Panama.''
The President noted that there has been increasing pressure to cut military spending because of the reduced tensions in Eastern Europe and that some lawmakers have advocated using this ''peace dividend'' to increase spending on social programs.
''That's like the next-of-kin who spend the inheritance before the will is read,'' Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: At 85, Shirer Rounds Out His Story

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
William L. Shirer, now 85 years old and, by his own admission, slowing down a bit, gives this illustration of what he calls his lucky habit of being in the right place at the right time.
He was traveling by train in 1930 from Afghanistan to Europe and while going through Iraq he noticed a conspicuously biblical signpost identifying his train station as Ur Junction.
''I thought that there might be a story there,'' he said, remembering that Ur was the native place of the patriarch Abraham. He quickly interrupted his journey and found the famed British archeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, who was in the process of discovering the first signs of Sumerian civilization. Mr. Shirer said he had stumbled entirely by good luck on an important event, which he duly reported for The Chicago Tribune, his employer in those days. 
Mr. Shirer then resumed his travels, eventually to stumble - as he might put it - across such other ''good stories'' as the rise of Hitler, the appeasement at Munich, the fall of France, World War II and the trials at Nuremberg. Mr. Shirer is a man who knew Gandhi, attended press conferences by Goebbels, spoke to the French Prime Minister Eduard Daladier, and observed Hitler at close quarters, watching carefully his facial expressions, for example, at the 1936 Berlin Olympics when the American Jessie Owens left in ruins the Aryan theories of racial superiority. And so, not surprisingly, he has called his just-completed three-volume memoir of his life and times ''Twentieth Century Journey.'' The last volume, ''A Native's Return,'' will be published this month by Little Brown.
 
'Egotism' With a Purpose
''It's certainly an act of egotism,'' Mr. Shirer said during an afternoon talk at his home in Lenox, Mass., referring to the practice of autobiography. ''But in the back of my mind,'' he continued, ''it was to make it a part of 20th-century history.''
These days Mr. Shirer lives a quiet life, spending a part of the winter in Florida to escape the cold. Photographs in his earlier volumes show him stout and dark-haired with a bristling mustache. Now a white fringe of hair and a white beard give him a bit of the look of a 19th-century Russian novelist (appropriate since he is hard at work on a book about Tolstoy's last years).
''A Native's Return'' covers what might be the least unusual period of his long life - from 1945, when he returned from Europe for good, to 1988 -though the last episode he describes in detail is a return trip he made in 1985 to Paris and Berlin, where he had passed so many years of his youth.
But even if the events of the latest volume are less turbulent and momentous than those of earlier volumes - particularly ''The Nightmare Years,'' which covers his experience of the rise and fall of European fascism - it describes plenty of events. Mr. Shirer was dismissed from CBS in 1947 because, he suggests, he was too ''liberal'' in the Sunday radio commentary he gave every week. He was blacklisted during the MacCarthy years after he was listed, falsely, as a Communist in the journal known as Red Channels.
 
Drew on Nazi Archives
There followed several economically difficult years, during which Mr. Shirer lectured, wrote a couple of not very distinguished novels, and slowly depleted his savings. In the mid-1950's, he got the idea to write a history of Nazism, drawing on the vast numbers of German archives seized during the war and kept in various warehouses in this country.
The idea was rejected, Mr. Shirer says, by several publishers who seemed to believe that nobody was still interested in Nazism. But Simon & Schuster paid him a $10,000 advance and he spent five years in what he now calls a ''delirium'' of writing to produce - in 1960, with the creditors knocking on the door - his extraordinarily successful ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.'' The book is still the standard volume on the history of Nazism for the general reader.
Mr. Shirer has in a sense lived the central episode of his long life, the Nazi experience, three times - the first as a journalist, the second as a historian and the third time as memoirist - and each time the experience was different.
''When you're there as a newspaperman you know that you're just scratching the surface,'' he said. Then, acknowledging that he was tempted at times to practice a bit of self-censorship as a CBS Radio reporter to avoid being expelled from Germany, he continued, ''You often wonder, should I publish this or should I keep it to myself?''
 
The Madness Was Grasped Later
As an example of scratching the surface, Mr. Shirer said that he and his colleagues often kept watch on Nazi Party headquarters, and when there was a large collection of cars outside they knew that some kind of meeting was being held. But the full madness of the Hitler years could be grasped only through scrutiny of the extraordinary Nazi archives - Mr. Shirer calls them ''the greatest single historical find ever'' - captured by the Allies after the war.
''Take the Munich agreement, for example,'' Mr. Shirer said. ''I was there that day.'' Mr. Shirer was referring to the day in 1938 when the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the French Prime Minister, Edouard Daladier, attempted to appease Hitler by acceding to his demand to annex the German-speaking portions of Czechoslovakia.
''I attended two press conferences by Chamberlain and spoke briefly to Daladier, but I didn't get to the bottom of the agreement,'' Mr. Shirer said. ''I didn't know how things had come about.''
Years later, Mr. Shirer continued, ''the minutes of the Munich meetings showed that Chamberlain and Daladier were over-anxious to give Hitler anything he wanted.''
Asked if he could offer some insight into the meaning or spirit of the era he had lived through and chronicled so thoroughly, Mr. Shirer responded with a recollection of his father who, he said, was a devout Presbyterian from Chicago and a criminal prosecutor whose views of the world were utterly different from those of his wayward son. His father, he said, was a deeply religious optimist, a believer in progress who was in these respects a product of an optimistic time. Mr. Shirer himself, influenced by the worst horrors of history, emerged without religious conviction and, if not pessimistic - since that is a word he does not like - certainly more skeptical about human prospects.
 
Opposing Experiences
''My father lived through a period when there was peace in the world,'' Mr. Shirer said. ''He took it absolutely for granted that life was getting better, more civilized.''
''But it isn't true.'' Mr. Shirer said. ''My experience was the opposite in the sense that I became aware of how savage men can be. Also the fact that we now have acquired the means of blowing up the world means that all thinking had to be radically changed. The bomb marks a great dividing line in history. You can't talk about wars anymore because of the atomic bomb.''
''My father was an orthodox Presbyterian and I'm sure he believed in heaven and hell and that sort of thing,'' Mr. Shirer said. ''For me all that is gone.''
He hesitated at this point in the conversation, worried, he said, about sounding ''pontifical.'' But when pressed to describe the images that remain brightest in his mind, he said, after a moment's thought:
''One of the things that has given me a tremendous amount of admiration is the indomitability of the human race. I remember the refugees from Nazi Germany who didn't know what tomorrow would bring. But they had some indomitable quality. They were not weeping. They were determined to survive. And they did.''Time Warnerd(Little Brown)

HEADLINE: Japan Does Good, and Well

 BODY:
It's a stylized performance. The politician up for re-election dons the statesman's mask and travels abroad in search of good visuals. But the trip to Europe by Prime Minister Kaifu of Japan is no mere ritual play for attention. It's the clearest sign yet that Japan is ready to use its economic power for responsible political ends. 
The world's largest donor of foreign aid, Japan has largely confined its largesse to Asia. Now it's reaching out, with a constructive package of $1 billion in aid for Poland and Hungary.
Washington has long encouraged Tokyo to put economic aid to political use. The United States might now take its own advice by increasing its own aid to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Japan, with half the G.N.P. of the U.S., gives as much aid as the U.S. to these countries. So does West Germany, with one-fifth America's G.N.P.
Japan had already pledged $150 million to Poland. Now it offers $500 million in loans, and an equal amount to Hungary. More important than loans, which these heavily indebted countries will have trouble using, Japan is trying to stimulate private Japanese trade and investment.
Japan's statesmanship is hardly selfless. The Japanese expect to accrue economic benefits from aid. One is direct: earmarked aid boosts Japanese exports. A second benefit is less immediate: to develop Eastern European markets as a hedge against any closing of Western Europe. And Japanese products there could enter the European Community as it opens its import gates to the East. That's one reason Suzuki is investing in an automobile plant in Hungary and Daihatsu plans another in Poland.
But Japan's aid to the East may be tied as much to political as to economic ends. To a Soviet Union anxious not to be left behind Eastern Europe's economic advance, it's an inducement to normalize relations with Japan.
The two countries have remained technically at war since 1945. But Tokyo won't sign a peace treaty unless Moscow gives back four small islands it seized then. An exchange of visits by President Gorbachev's Politburo ally Aleksandr Yakovlev and by Japan's Foreign Minister have raised expectations of the islands' return. Mr. Gorbachev may find a way to accommodate Japan when he goes to Tokyo next year. Then, Soviet-Japanese rapprochement could lead to restructuring of the Soviet economy as well as Far East diplomacy.
That's the sort of political payoff for foreign aid Washington needs to think about.

HEADLINE: Japan Goes Full Throttle on Tests of Magnetic Levitation Trains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We wish to correct errors and misperceptions on high-speed magnetic levitation transport in the letters by Frederick Lightfoot and Fletcher Prouty (Dec. 30).
Mr. Lightfoot is confused about the principles of superconducting maglev when he asserts that it is not practical to maintain thousands of miles of superconducting cable at low temperature. Maglev guideways are not superconducting. They use aluminum loops or sheets at normal temperature. The only superconducting magnets are on the vehicle, which induce currents in the guideway directly underneath. As long as the vehicle keeps moving, these induced currents levitate it inches above the guideway. 
Superconducting magnets for maglev vehicles are simple and practical. Thousands of more sophisticated magnets operate in magnetic resonance imaging medical machines, as well as in scientific laboratories. In the next few years the United States plans to build the superconducting supercollider, using magnets more complicated than those for maglev. If the same length of magnets contemplated were used in maglev vehicles, they could provide 30 percent of total United States transport (auto, truck and air).
Mr. Lightfoot is also wrong about superconductivity in fusion. It is not a difficult problem to shield superconducting magnets from heating by fusion neutrons and gammas.
Mr. Prouty questions the safety of operating magnetic levitation vehicles above the 160 to 180 miles per hour maximum speeds for high-speed rail trains because of potential for increased damage if vehicles collide with foreign objects or trash on a ground-level guideway. He also questions high-speed operation in tunnels or enclosed guideways.
In our view, 300 m.p.h. maglev can be as safe as the best high-speed trains. Maglev guideways will generally be elevated well above ground level to clear obstructions. This is practical and economical because maglev vehicles are light compared with trains, and the guideways need virtually no maintenance. Keeping trash and objects away from elevated guideways will be much easier than for ground-level tracks. Moreover, maglev vehicles float above the guideway, making them less likely to hit objects than conventional trains.
Japan has operated the high-speed ''bullet train'' at 140 m.p.h. for 25 years with no fatalities and the world's highest traffic volume. The speed is constrained by track maintenance limits, not safety. Every night, 3,500 people work on the ''bullet'' route to maintain the track. Higher speeds would require more maintenance and wear it out even faster.
Japan Railways has been testing full-size superconducting maglev vehicles in the last decade. The Japanese system is based on the concepts we published in the late 1960's and early 70's. They have demonstrated safe operation at 300 m.p.h. Japan Railways next plans to build a 50-kilometer first section of a 300 m.p.h. maglev system from Tokyo to Osaka. Most of the route will be in tunnels because of mountainous terrain and high population density near cities.
Clearly, Japan does not agree that 300 m.p.h. maglev is potentially unsafe or that operation in tunnels is not feasible.

HEADLINE: Is New York's Tax Cut Slipping Away?

BYLINE: By Roy M. Goodman; Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, is chairman of the State Senate's Taxation Committee.

 BODY:
It appears Gov. Mario Cuomo is preparing to torpedo the state income tax cut millions of New Yorkers were expecting this year. No other conclusion can be drawn from his State of the State message, where in 178 pages of text he never once mentioned the pending reduction. The omission casts a shadow over the final phase of the four-year Tax Reduction Act, which became law in 1987.
The last reduction, scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, would lower the maximum income tax rate to 7 percent from 7.5 percent. It forms part of a tax cutting program the Legislature first began back in 1978, when taxes on earned income were as high as 12 percent. 
The income tax cut the Legislature promised this year would put $400 million back in New Yorkers' pockets in the 1990-'91 fiscal year, which begins April 1, and more than $1.3 billion in the 1991-'92 year. The Legislature must stand by its promise.
Stability and predictability are critical factors in business planning, and tax rates are the most crucial consideration when a business decides whether to stay the course or leave New York for more congenial tax climates.
Despite our cuts, New York taxes paycheck income at far higher rates than neighboring states: New Jersey (3.5 percent), Connecticut (0 percent), Massachusetts (5.4 percent), Pennsylvania (2.1 percent).
The rationale for tax cuts is to keep business in New York, and provide more jobs. There are more than one million jobs in the state now than in 1983. In the last two years, 100,000 people have left welfare rolls. Since we started to cut taxes, tax revenues have increased, not decreased. According to Cuomo administration figures, revenues have grown by about $5.4 billion since the current tax reduction program began in 1987 - an average growth rate of 7.7 percent a year. These increases occurred largely because lower tax rates stimulated economic activity and created new jobs. Higher corporate earnings and more salaried workers mean more tax revenues.
Opponents of income tax cuts say such cuts favor the wealthy and hurt the less affluent. Actually, low income taxpayers have been the biggest beneficiaries of tax reduction so far. We have removed 320,000 low income taxpayers from the tax rolls, and the final tax cut, if implemented this year, would remove 480,000 more.
The remaining cut would have the most beneficial impact on taxpayers with incomes ranging from $35,000 to $75,000 - middle class taxpayers who form the backbone of our economy.
And if the state faces a deficit in the next fiscal year? We continued the tax cut program in the current fiscal year in the face of a $1.7 billion budget deficit. We handled the deficit not by cancelling the tax reduction but by refinancing some debt, increasing some excise taxes and cutting back planned spending.
We can again cut the planned spending in order to preserve the final phase of the tax cut. The essential budget problem is that although state revenues have risen, they have not risen fast enough to keep up with ever-higher state spending.
In the current fiscal year, spending will have gone up by about 8.5 percent, compared with an expected national inflation rate of 4.2 percent. If we can hold further spending near the inflation rate, as Mr. Cuomo has pledged to do, while reducing waste, we can keep the tax cut on schedule and still provide essential services for the poor and downtrodden.
In pursuing these economies, we should have a strong ally in Governor Cuomo, who on Sept. 14 told the New York State Business Council: ''I am opposed to the idea of deferring the tax cut, or raising taxes. . . . We must keep the tax cut we promised. . . . And, if you have to deal with this problem of revenues, then find a way to deal with it by restraint in spending, by fighting waste.''

HEADLINE: Wilding Is a Crime, Except in Law

BYLINE: By Andrew Stein; Andrew Stein is president of the New York City Council.

 BODY:
Whatever else needs to be done in New York City, we must maintain law and order. No constructive social program can work if we descend into chaos.
On Halloween last year, the fear of mob violence kept many New Yorkers at home. Thousands of teen-agers went on bloody rampages in several boroughs. They moved spontaneously in packs of 20 or 30 and assaulted people at random. Many of the victims were women and the elderly. In commercial neighborhoods there was mass thievery. Dozens of stores were trashed. The police arrested more than 250 of the young hoodlums, but many times that number walked away scot-free. 
Unfortunately, many of these kids, and others like them, are out on the streets terrorizing the public again. That's a safe statement to make because most of the youngsters arrested for the rampages won't serve a single day in jail. The majority are under 16 and can only be charged in family court, where incarceration for such offences is rare. Even those indicted as adults can probably plea-bargain the charges down to misdemeanors and avoid serving any time.
Because the public was truly outraged about the most notorious ''wilding'' incident - the rape and near murder of a jogger in Central Park -no doubt anyone convicted of that attack will get a stiff sentence. But there has been little response by the city government to the widespread concern over wilding in general.
After the Central Park attack, violent incidents continued to occur with depressing regularity. People were beaten up on the subways, stores were trashed and shopkeepers terrorized. Since no one was murdered or raped, however, very little attention was paid to the problem by the criminal justice system.
Recently I attempted to gather data on these violent crimes. I was amazed to discover that the statistics do not even exist. One reason cited by police and criminal justice officials is the absence of any specific charge for group assault. Under the criminal code, an individual arrested for participating in an assault with 10 or 20 or 30 others is charged no differently than someone who acts alone. Since arrest figures are compiled on the basis of the charge made in court, the police say they are unable to track wilding or wolfpack crimes.
But you can't fight a crime problem if the crime fighters can't even track the problem. New Yorkers who have been physically victimized, or who live in fear as they ride the subways or walk the streets, know these crimes as a category apart.
With society so immobilized, the kids who do the wilding become more brazen. According to news reporters, gangs who come into Manhattan from Brooklyn now chant: ''Manhattan makes and Brooklyn takes.''
Many argue that harsh criminal punishment is not an effective response to the rising problem of youth violence, that we must deal with the root causes such as poverty, lack of recreational activities and youth unemployment. No doubt such measures are necessary, but there must be the deterrent of certain punishment - meaning real jail time - as well.
Spreading terror on the city's streets and subways is serious, and the criminal code must be changed to reflect that reality. Participation in a group attack should be made a separate crime with a stipulation for automatic minimum sentences. And group assault should be added to the list of those crimes under which a juvenile is tried as an adult.
Such legislative changes will take time. In the meantime, the city must deploy its cops to combat these mobs. The police should begin to gather intelligence on wilding attacks, identify the schools and subways where they are most likely to occur and beef up their presence there. School officials should be encouraged to warn all students that if they are caught, the authorities will try to send them to jail.
Society has a right to declare that some crimes are more menacing and injurious than others. Now, kids on the streets are easily enticed into wilding by their peers because they believe it to be a risk-free activity, virtually a sport. We must begin to send them the message that the criminal justice system regards this as a very serious crime.

The Economy
 Producer prices jumped 0.7 percent in December, bringing inflation for 1989, by this measure, to 4.8 percent, the highest rate since 1981. The monthly rise was somewhat more than expected, and traders said the report contributed to a skid in stock prices and higher interest rates in the credit markets. But many analysts said the figures were not so bad as they seemed. [Page 1.] Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in December, the Government reported, and holiday spending was the weakest since 1985.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose 0.2% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Retail sales rose two-tenths of a percent in December, and holiday spending was the weakest since 1985, the Government reported today. For the year, sales increased 5 percent, the slowest gain in seven years.
Analysts said the figures reflected a steepening slide in consumer spending, once an area of strength in last year's economy.
''It seems that consumer spending is dead in the water,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fugi Securities Inc. in Chicago. 
Walter Loeb, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said, ''The consumer basically is in hiding.'' He credited bargain promotions for most of the consumer spending that did occur.
 
Slowest Since Recession
 The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled $1.71 trillion last year. The 5 percent gain compared with 7.1 percent in 1988, and was the slowest since the 2.9 percent rise in the recession year of 1982.
December sales, which totaled a seasonally adjusted $144.4 billion, followed a gain of five-tenths of a percent in November.
Because many consumers begin their Christmas shopping just after Thanksgiving, many analysts combine sales in both months to assess holiday spending. Half or more of retail profits come from business done between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The combined November-December sales were just 3.8 percent above the corresponding period of 1988, which posted a 6.6 percent gain over those months of 1987. The 1989 holiday gain was the most sluggish since a 2.9 percent rise in 1985.
David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York Government securities dealer, said consumers were spending only when they got a bargain.
''That's obvious in the case of auto incentives and all of the discounts at Christmas,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Consumers did come out of their shell and spend at Christmas, but only because department stores offered them discounts.''
 
Decline at Department Stores
 Even so, department store sales did not fare well and were down four-tenths of a percent in December.
Many analysts said consumer spending would continue to be dominated by bargain-hunting, at least through the first half of the year.
Sales of durable goods - expensive items like cars and household appliances expected to last more than three years - fell six-tenths of a percent in December after edging up one-tenth of a percent in November.
Durable goods, which are often financed by loans, have been particularly affected by tighter Federal Reserve credit policies and have been the subject of extensive promotions, especially for automobiles.
But most auto incentives ended with the introduction of 1990 models in October, and vehicle sales dropped seven-tenths of a percent in December on top of a decline of four-tenths of a percent in November.
Auto sales, which represent about 22 percent of retail sales, ended the year up just 2.2 percent, compared with a 10.3 percent gain in 1988. It was the lowest since 1980, when sales registered a decline of 8.1 percent.
Excluding autos, overall sales in December were up four-tenths of a percent.
 
Furniture Sales Drop
 Sales of durable building materials rose one-tenth of a percent, on top of a rise of seven-tenths of a percent in November, while furniture and other home furnishings declined 1 percent, after an increase of seven-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
Sales of nondurable goods rose six-tenths of a percent, after gaining eight-tenths of a percent in November.
Sales were up six-tenths of a percent at grocery stores and 1.3 percent at gasoline stations, both partly the result of higher prices. Apparel sales advanced one-tenth of a percent.
Despite the holiday season, sales at restaurants and bars were down nine-tenths of a percent, and drugstores posted a decline of 1 percent.
For the three months from October through December, overall retail sales were up 3.6 percent.

HEADLINE: 71.46 Drop Puts Dow At 2,689.21

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday amid new concerns about higher interest rates and a resurgence of inflation. The drop followed declines in other important stock markets around the world.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.46 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,689.21.
Yesterday's drop in the Dow industrials was the largest in 13 weeks, since a plunge of 190.58 points on Oct. 13. In terms of points, it was the 13th-largest drop on record. For the week, the Dow fell 84.04 points, or 3 percent. 
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 183.9 million shares, from 154.4 million on Thursday. Traders said large institutions were buying and selling in only moderate volume.
 
1,483 Declines on Big Board
 The declines were broad based, with stocks that fell in price outnumbering those that rose by 1,483 to 217.
One factor in the decline, analysts said, was a report by the Commerce Department that the Producer Price Index rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, sharply higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent many economists had predicted. For the full year, producer prices rose 4.8 percent.
The Commerce Department also reported that retail sales rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December, in line with what most had expected.
But some people on Wall Street contended that developments in the overseas financial markets, particularly in Japan, had a greater impact on stocks in the United States than the two economic reports.
 
Higher Global Interest Rates
 ''Global interest rates are rising dramatically,'' said John Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company in New York, ''which put pressure on our bond market and, of course, our stock market. This is no time to be a hero.''
Mr. Groveman pointed out that the interest rate on the benchmark long-term Japanese bond rose to yield 6.45 percent, from 6.265 percent. It was the first time the yield on that issue had exceeded 6.35 percent since Oct. 5, 1987, shortly before the worldwide plunge in stock prices on Oct. 19, 1987.
Lower bond prices, a decline in the yen and political uncertainties continued to unnerve Japanese investors yesterday. In Tokyo, the 225-stock Nikkei index lost 653.36 points, or 1.71 percent, to 37,516.77.
In London, the Financial Times 100-stock index lost 37.8 points, or 1 percent, to 2,380.1. The West German market avoided the sell-off, with stock prices mixed.
David B. Bostian, managing director and chief investment strategist at Jesup & Lamont Inc. in New York, said renewed apprehension about the political situation surrounding President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union continued to unnerve markets around the world.
Mr. Bostian added, ''The immediate concern that I have is that if the market does not stabilize next week it could touch off mutual fund switch selling, which was one of the dominoes in the 1987 decline.''
Switch selling involves switching from stock funds into money-market funds, and vice versa.
''It's just a technical decline,'' one trader said about the drop. ''The break below 2,700 was the last blow for the Dow. Other market measures were trading below their year lows at the opening.''
Analysts said data on producer prices and retail sales also depressed dollar and bond prices, which exacerbated the weakness in equities.
The dollar opened sharply lower, but recovered to rise against both the Japanese yen and the West German mark. By late in the day, the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was off 20/32, to 99 17/32, with the yield climbing to 8.17 percent, from 8.11 on Thursday and 8.06 percent a week ago.
Among broader measures of the market, the Big Board composite index dropped 4.46 points yesterday, to 188.32, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.60 points, to 339.93.
The 12-point circuit breaker on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was put into effect at 2:06 P.M., Eastern standard time, but was activated for only a few minutes.
When the S.&P. 500 declines 12 points, the circuit breaker goes into effect and trades in stock-index futures cannot be made below that level for 30 minutes. Offers can be made at the limit price, however, or above it.
The Dow industrials fell 53 points in the first hour of trading. By 11:30 A.M., the loss had narrowed to 38 points before the drop continued. The average remained about 42 points lower through the early afternoon but by 2:30 had fallen 69 points. It extended that deficit to about 79 points about 3:30 P.M. before rebounding somewhat toward the close.
 
Airline Stocks Decline
 The Dow transportation average fell 25.07 points, to 1,140.65, pulled down in part by UAL's 4 3/4-point drop, to 159 1/2.
Philips Industries was a big percentage loser, dropping 2 3/8, to 15 5/8. Analysts said the company's announcement after the close of trading on Thursday that it could not obtain financing for its proposed leveraged buyout reflected its lower profit estimate, the dull outlook for its main markets and disarray in the arranging of such buyouts.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 7.12 points, to 372.23, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.14 points, to 439.72.

HEADLINE: Stretch Limousines: Is Party Over?

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
The market for stretch limousines - the new-money status symbols of the 1980's - is shrinking.
Production is falling, companies are folding, and the car surgeons in this once-booming industry are predicting lean times. A slowing American economy, layoffs on Wall Street and a depressed real estate market have all crimped the pocketbooks of the former free spenders who were so fond of the sleek, smoked-glass behemoths. In fact, the stock market crash in October 1987 marked the real turning point for the industry, analysts say. 
The loss of the economic exuberance of the early 1980's has cut into the sales of the dozens of companies that convert top-of-the-line Cadillac and Lincoln models into stretch versions and reduced demand for the services of hundreds of livery companies in cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
A sure sign of the troubles of the stretch limousine business came last week when the A. H. A. Automotive Technologies Corporation, unable to make payments on its loans, went bankrupt. The Canadian company was one of the largest makers of outsized limousines in North America.
''There has been a tremendous shakeout in our business,'' said Jack Schwartz, president of Dillinger-Gaines Coachworks Ltd., a big New York-based producer of stretch limousines. ''You'll see a few more people who will go out of business in a little while.''
Few products have inspired as much devotion and animosity as the stretch limousine. Its proliferation during the 1980's tended to divide people, especially those with high-paying jobs like investment bankers, lawyers and others, into two camps: riders who viewed the limousines as a well-earned reward for hard work, and naysayers who refused to set foot in what they viewed as a hallmark of nouveau riche bad taste.
 
Some Strong Attachments
 So undoubtedly, a decline in the business will get a mixed public reaction. Nonetheless, many apparently view the limousines as a necessity. For some people, said Dr. Elliot Wineburg, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the stretch limousine ''is almost as important to them as wearing a necktie is to other people.'' Dr. Wineburg recalled that one of his patients was as attached to his limousine as he was to his gold pinkie ring.
And in the stretch limousine industry, there is nothing but concern. Reliable statistics are scarce but the available figures portray a sharp contraction.
There are 57 companies making 5,800 stretch limousines annually, down from an output of 7,000 in the peak year of 1987, according to Limousine & Chauffeur magazine, a California-based trade publication. For most of the 1980's, stretch-limousine production grew steadily, from 2,500 in 1980.
 
Production Trimmed
 Even conversion companies that say their business is thriving have become more conservative. Mr. Schwartz of Dillinger-Gaines, for example, said his company recently closed a plant in Florida, which had supplemented the output from its main factory, in Lindenhurst, N.J.
The Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury division said sales of its Lincoln Town Car line have declined 60 percent in the current model year, which began last October, compared with the period a year earlier. Ford blames a delayed introduction of the 1990 model for some of the falloff. Reporting its most recent available figures, General Motors said it sent 1,069 of its special ''coach builders'' Cadillac Broughams to converters during the 1989 model year, down from 2,070 the previous year.
The demise of A. H. A. Automotive Technologies was apparently hastened by an anti-dumping suit filed last August by John Gore, president of Southampton Coachworks Ltd., of Farmingdale, L.I. The suit itself, analysts say, was an indication of the intense competition and straitened circumstances of the stretch-limousine industry. Mr. Gore said his company's sales fell more than 15 percent last year.
After a four-month investigation, the Commerce Department announced on Jan. 3 that because A.H.A. had been charging significantly less in the United States for the same model limousine it sold in Canada, it would have to pay a 4.84 percent dumping penalty on each limousine exported to the United States. Two days after the ruling, A.H.A., which in December had defaulted on loans, was placed in receivership.
Stretch limousines have been around for decades. But until the 1960's, they were always custom-built. During that decade two companies, the Lehmann-Peterson Company and Hess & Eisenhardt started buying luxury Cadillacs and Lincolns, chopping them in half, adding 60 or 72 inches to the chassis and the body and loading the interior with expensive gadgetry.
The new wealth generated by the economic growth of the 1980's created a golden era for limousines and, it seemed, the bigger the better. The expanding demand brought in a flood of new limosine services, often one-man operations.
Converters pay about $27,400 for Cadillac Broughams and $29,000 to $30,000 for Lincoln Town Cars. Cars sold to converters contain special features, like bigger engines, larger transmissions, reinforced shock absorbers and either more powerful or more efficient alternators to run the gadgets.
Prices for stretch limosines, the bulk of which are sold to livery companies, range from $40,000 for the basic model to more than $80,000 for the more extravagant.
''The only option is a fax machine,'' Mr. Schwartz said. Price tag for the car: $85,000.
The industry is one of intense personal rivalries and flamboyant rhetoric. A handful of companies all claim to be the largest in the industry.
In addition to falling demand, the producers are coming under increasing pressure to comply with safety requirements.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Global Investing For the Cautious

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
The tumultuous events of Eastern Europe in recent weeks have given rise to capitalist hopes, and many small investors have rushed to buy shares of companies that they expect to profit from trade with East Germany, Poland, Hungary and other East bloc nations.
West German companies in particular should profit, many investors reasoned, and the Frankfurt stock market rose 13 percent in five weeks. The Germany Fund surged 157 percent on the Big Board last year. But seasoned professionals, cautioning against euphoric buying, say that the Frankfurt market rose too far too fast and that Asia actually offers better buying opportunities. 
Simon G. Fenton, vice president of Kleinwort Benson International Investment Ltd., called such gains ''overanticipation.'' Although he sees greater returns in the markets outside the United States than in the United States market over the next year, in part because of a marginally weaker dollar, he expects it will take several years to realize substantial profits from the business opportunities being created in Eastern Europe.
''The best opportunities are in Far Eastern markets,'' Mr. Fenton said, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, while uncertainties in Europe make the continental markets less attractive.
Looking toward 1992, when trade barriers are to fall in the European Community, he said, ''the jury is still out as to which way the E.C. will lead the world's economy'' - toward greater trade freedoms or toward greater protectionism by creating a more formidable Western European bloc.
The domestic unrest that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev faces in the Soviet Union add to Europe's uncertainties, he said.
But even if overseas markets make only small gains, an American investor in those markets would profit even more if foreign currencies outperform the dollar, as Kleinwort Benson predicts. The firm expects the yen to rise 8 percent against the dollar in the next year and the West German mark to rise 5 percent.
Of course, few market experts thought the dollar would be as strong as it has been in the last year, when by and large American equity investors made their greatest gains at home. Still, Mr. Fenton said, a well-diversified portfolio should have at least 10 percent of its holdings overseas, and ideally 40 percent.
Kleinwort Benson, a London-based firm with offices in New York, manages international investments for institutional and individual investors and is adviser to the Kleinwort Benson International Equity Fund, a no-load mutual fund that focuses on foreign markets. Over all, Kleinwort manages $15 billion.
William S. Stack, managing director and chief investment officer of the Lexington Management Corporation, Saddle Brook, N.J., whose funds include the Lexington Global Fund, looks for companies that perform well throughout the world. He also expects the dollar to weaken.
''We don't look country by country,'' he said. ''There is a big world market. Honda has 60 percent of its earnings inside the United States; Coca-Cola has 60 percent outside. Which is the American company?''
By holding assets worldwide, investors can iron out exchange-rate risk and achieve more diversity and a greater return with less volatility, he said. On a total-return basis, Lexington Global has risen 59.8 percent since it was founded in March 1987 -and it made money even in that crazy year of the October stock market collapse - compared with a 36.4 percent gain on a total-return basis for the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index and a 33.1 percent rise by the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in the year.
At present, however, Mr. Stack says, ''I'm cautious.'' The fall of the Berlin wall helped catapult West German stocks upward. But the buyers were foreign, he noted, while Germans took the opportunity to sell into the rising market.
Over the long-term, the stunning events of Eastern Europe will be good for Europe economically, he said, but a quick mass migration of East Germans into West Germany could strain Bonn's social and economic system. That means West Germany has an incentive to invest in East Germany, building up the country's infrastructure and making it attractive for East Germans to stay at home, he continued, but that is a long-term proposition.
Mr. Stack sees opportunities for long-term gains in the Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japanese markets, where Lexington Global has 30 percent of its holdings. He sees some of the best opportunities in third world nations that need foreign investment in both public works and consumer goods.
''I'm a long-term bull,'' he said, but near-term, he said he believes that there could be corrections in Japan, West Germany and the United States.

HEADLINE: Air France Buying Into 2 Carriers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 12

 BODY:
In a move likely to trouble the European Community's antitrust regulators, Air France announced today that it would acquire control of two French airlines: Air Inter, the large French domestic airline, and Union de Transports Aeriens, a long-haul carrier.
Air France said it would pay $670 million to acquire a 54.58 percent stake in U.T.A. from Chargeurs S.A., a Paris-based holding company that owns 82.9 percent of the carrier.
Since Air France already owns 37 percent of Air Inter and U.T.A. owns 35.8 percent of that airline, Air France emerges with majority control of Air Inter as well. Air Inter, which carried 15.7 million passengers last year, is Europe's largest domestic airline and ranks fifth in total passengers carried. 
Last October the European Commission, the community's executive branch, found that a cooperative agreement between Air France and Air Inter was anti-competitive because it called for sharing revenues, profits and losses.
 
Commission Might Act
 Analysts suggested that the commission might conclude that today's accord was intended to circumvent that decision. But French officials say the accord gives France's flag carrier the same hold over its foreign and domestic markets that other European flag carriers have in their own markets.
Air France and Air Inter compete on several domestic routes, as well as on five international routes that Air Inter recently started to serve.
''The problem here is that the European Community likes to get involved in these matters,'' said Peter Bergius, an airline analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. ''This could end up being delayed for some time.''
Today's agreement could create tension between the European Community and the French Government, which has sought to regroup France's airlines to strengthen Air France's competitive position.
 
Improved Performance Expected
 In a joint statement, Air France's chairman, Bernard Attali, and the Chargeurs chairman, Jerome Seydoux, said the agreement would permit ''the formation of a group that will be better able to compete on an even footing with large global companies.''
Industry analysts said the transaction was part of an effort by European airlines to increase their size to compete with giant American and Asian carriers.
The accord said Air France and U.T.A. would maintain their respective identities. U.T.A. has many routes from France to Africa and Asia, and last year it started flying to Newark International Airport from five provincial French cities, including Marseilles and Bordeaux. It also flies between Paris and San Francisco.
Under pressure from state-owned Air France, the French Government in 1988 denied U.T.A. permission to fly from Paris to Newark. The European Commission has been conducting an antitrust investigation over France's denial of routes to U.T.A.
 
'Some Economies of Scale'
 ''There will clearly be some economies of scale for U.T.A. and Air France,'' said Mr. Bergius, the analyst.
Before the deal was announced, U.T.A. stock was trading at 2,770 francs, or $486, a share. Air France, which by some measures is Europe's No. 2 airline, behind British Airways, said it would buy 930,000 shares at 4,083 francs, or $716, a share.
U.T.A. owns 19 aircraft and earned $137.4 million on revenues of $1.07 billion in 1988. Air Inter owns 53 aircraft and earned $26 million on revenues of $1.3 billion in 1988.
Under the accord, Air France has the right of first refusal to buy the other U.T.A. shares owned by Chargeurs. The agreement still needs the approval of the boards of Air France and Chargeurs.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices tumbled and yields climbed yesterday, largely because of heavy overnight selling of domestic and United States securities by Japanese and European institutions.
A sharp rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for December also put pressure on bond prices. The increase resulted in new fears about inflation and reduced the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would ease credit further.
Dealers said plunging prices in the Japanese stock and bond markets spilled over into Europe and then depressed stocks and bonds in the United States. 
 
Benchmark Bond Up to 8.17%
 In late trading in New York, the Treasury's benchmark long-term bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, were being offered at 99 17/ 32, down 20/32. This caused the yield to climb to 8.17 percent, from 8.11 percent Thursday and 8.06 percent a week ago. At 8.17 percent, the long-term bond's yield is the highest since just before stock prices fell sharply on Oct. 13.
Among other representative Treasury coupon issues, the 7 7/8 percent notes of 1999 fell 12/32, to 98 17/32, for a yield of 8.09 percent, and the new 8 percent issue of 1997 lost 10/32, at 99 22/32, to yield 8.06 percent, up from the average 8.02 percent produced by the auction of this issue last Tuesday. The 7 5/8 percent issue of 1993 dipped 1/32, to 98 28/32, for a yield of 7.96 percent, and the 7 5/8's of 1991 were unchanged at 99 15/32, with the yield remaining at 7.92 percent.
The wave of selling began after the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasushi Mieno, said in a speech that the central bank's priorities were to strengthen the yen and hold down inflationary pressures.
These remarks caused the yield on the benchmark Japanese long-term bonds, the No. 119 4.8 percent issue of 1999, to climb quickly to 6.45 percent, from 6.265 percent. It was the first time this bellwether Japanese bond yielded more than 6.35 percent since Oct. 5, 1987 - two weeks before stock prices plunged around the globe.
 
Fears Over Election
 ''The Japanese markets have become increasingly unsettled as next month's national election nears,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the large Japanese financial house. ''There are fears among Japanese investors that the election, which is scheduled for Feb. 18, may lead to more stringent controls on the economy and perhaps moves to renationalize some major industries.''
Some of the selling in Japan was also attributed to the approach of a three-day national holiday, when many financial houses seek to square their accounts. In Japan, Monday is Adult Day and the United States cash market in Treasury securities will also be closed in observance of the Martin Luther King holiday.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said ''the decline in domestic Treasury securities prices would have been far greater were it not for the even weaker stock market.''
He added, ''Aside from the weakness in the Japanese and other overseas markets, the fixed-income sector had to contend'' with the sharp rise in December producer prices.
Mr. Harris said the rise in wholesale prices raised the specter of renewed inflation and was viewed by many investors as precluding any further easing of interest rates by the Fed.
Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said fears that the day's economic data would inhibit the Fed from easing credit could be attributed to the central bank's action early in the session. The Fed drained reserves from the banking system through four-day matched sales of Treasury paper to dealers and other financial institutions. The Federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge one another for temporary loans, was 8 1/8 percent at the time and closed at that level.
Meanwhile, discount rates were mixed on Treasury bills, which are immediately influenced by any change in the funds rate. The 90-day bill rate fell 7 basis points, to 7.49 percent, partly on shifts of funds from the stock market. The rate for the six-month bill rose 3 basis points, to 7.44 percent, and the one-year bills gained 2 basis points, to 7.23 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Uncertainty Over Gorbachev Cited as Dollar Rises in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A wave of uncertainty over the political future of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pushed the dollar mostly higher in domestic dealings yesterday, overshadowing two bearish reports on the United States economy.
Gold prices generally rose. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price of $414.50, up 90 cents an ounce. But on New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 80 cents a troy ounce, to $413.20. 
The dollar fell overseas and traded sharply lower in domestic dealings after negative reports on United States inflation and retail sales.
But late in the session, traders said that speculation that Mr. Gorbachev may not survive the intense political pressure surrounding Lithuanian demands for secession caused the dollar to climb.
During a trip to Lithuania, Mr. Gorbachev promised a referendum on a law that would require the Soviet republics to hold their own votes on breaking away, but currency traders said there were rumors that he was not supported by Moscow.
''The speculation is that Gorbachev is not dealing from a large power base anymore,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
''And when in doubt, buy the buck,'' he said, referring to the dollar as the ''safe haven'' currency during times of political instability.
Despite the uncertainty, Marc Chandler, an analyst with Chicago-based Money Market Services International, stressed that ''the economic fundamentals continue to work against the dollar.''
Indeed, the Labor Department reported that prices at the producer level rose by a higher-than-expected seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, lifting 1989 inflation to 4.8 percent for the worst annual showing in eight years. Separately, the Government said retail sales edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in December after rising five-tenths of 1 percent in November.
The reports, which point jointly to higher inflation and an economic slowdown, initially rocked the dollar and took their toll on stock prices, pushing the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down by more than 71 points at the closing bell. The financial markets interpreted the reports as a sign the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates in the near future.
In New York, the dollar finished at 145.74 yen, up from 145.45 yen on Thursday. Against the West German currency, the dollar rose to 1,6860 marks, up from 1.6795.
In London, one British pound cost $1.6705 late yesterday, more expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6575. In New York, it cost $1.6610 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6598 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.4975 Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 5.7410 French francs, up from 5.7215; 1,256.00 Italian lire, up 1,253.75, and 1.1573 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563.
Gold prices ended the week at a bid $416.25 a troy ounce in London and $416.75 in Zurich, a $4-an-ounce rise in both centers. Dealers said trading was active. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $414.35 a troy ounce, up from $411.75.
Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery finished at $5.330 a troy ounce, up from $5.306 on Thursday.

Grains Mixed, Soybeans Off After Crop-Report Release

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of grain futures were mixed and soybeans futures closed lower yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the release of a crop report by the Agriculture Department.
On other markets, orange juice prices rose, precious metals were mixed, copper fell, energy futures dropped, and livestock and meat futures declined.
Wheat settled 3 1/4 cents lower to 3/4 cent higher, with the contract for March delivery at $4.01 1/2 a bushel; corn was 3 3/4 cents to 4 1/4 cents higher, with March at $2.42 1/4 a bushel; oats were one-half cent to three-fourths of a cent lower, with March at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were one-half cent to 4 1/4 cents lower, with January at $5.65 1/2 a bushel. 
The Agriculture Department report, released on Thursday, showed that farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for harvest this year, up 3 percent from the previous crop. The department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5 billion bushels and soybean production at 1.9 billion bushels; both estimates were lower than expected.
Soybeans were sharply higher at the opening, but fell back because of weak cash prices and strong growing conditions in South America.
The smaller-than-expected corn harvest bolstered corn futures prices.
The reduced number of seedings sent wheat futures higher at the open, but only the July new-crop contract ended on the plus side because of somewhat dry conditions in pockets of winter wheat.
Orange juice futures were sharply higher on New York's Cotton Exchange as the Agriculture Department's first estimate on the orange juice crop since the December freeze indicated losses were as severe as anticipated. The agency had projected a 1989-90 orange harvest of just 130 million 90-pound boxes, but that estimate has been slashed 29 percent, to 92 million boxes. That is the smallest production estimate since the 1964-65 season.
Frozen concentrated orange juice was 5 cents to 12 cents higher, with January at $1.975 a pound.
Copper prices were off sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York as concerns about the economy and the slumping stock market led to selling. Copper was 2.40 cents to 3.30 cents lower, with February at $1.063 a pound.
Energy futures were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 41 cents lower, with February at $23.13 a gallon; heating oil was 0.57 cent lower to 0.33 cent higher, with February at 69.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.50 cent lower to 0.01 cent higher, with February at 65.09 cents a gallon.

Charge Cards That Pick Up the Pieces

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Now that American Express has set the pace, Mastercard and Visa are running close behind in providing charge-card programs that insure purchases against loss, damage or breakage.
Until recently, only holders of what are known as ''gold'' or ''preferred'' credit cards qualfied for these plans. But now a growing number of banks offer them with standard cards.
''That's definitely becoming the trend for the new year,'' said Robert B. McKinley, the editor and publisher of Bankcard Update, an industry newsletter published by Ram Research and Publishing in Frederick, Md. 
The first program was introduced by American Express in 1987. Under it, merchandise bought with one of the company's charge cards will be replaced, or its cost will be refunded, if it is lost, stolen or damaged within 90 days of purchase. A companion program extends the manufacturer's warranty on a product, sometimes for as long as a year.
 
Card Wars
 Both Mastercard International Inc. and Visa U.S.A. Inc. now offer similar programs as part of the standard benefits on their preferred or ''gold'' bank credit cards.
The purchase protection programs are the latest skirmish in a continuing credit-card war. Many banks are using various incentives as well as low annual fees and interest rates to lure preferred card holders from rival banks or to entice regular card holders to take the preferred cards. Added to that is stiffened competition between Visa and Mastercard, on the one hand, and American Express on the other.
The purchase-insurance programs come at a price to the issuers. Gregory Holmes, a spokesman for Visa, said the annual cost to the company was about $4.34 million, or about 62 cents for each of its 7 million accounts. Since the program began, some 3,400 Visa card holders have made claims under the program.
Many recent credit-card incentives, like travel services, have not drawn great consumer interest. But the purchase protection plans are getting high marks, even from critics of charge cards.
''These appear to be the first credit-card enchancements to have any value,'' said Elgie Holstein, executive director of Bank Cardholders of America, a consumer organization with headquarters in Herndon, Va.
He should know. Last year, Mr. Holstein lost a new watch worth about $125 shortly after buying it with an American Express card. He said that after putting in a claim, he was asked to furnish copies of his homeowner's insurance policy and the receipt for the watch. Some four weeks later, he received a check for its full price.
''It didn't happen overnight, and I had to take a couple of steps,'' Mr. Holstein said. ''But it happened.'' The protection plans offered by the three major charge-card companies are similar. All are supplemental to any homeowner's insurance held by a customer. As a result, they pay only those amounts that are not covered by the policy's deductible or that exceed its limits. Annual payments are generally limited to $50,000 on each account, though the limit on jewelry, watches and furs is lower: $2,500.
There are important exceptions. Things like traveler's checks, negotiable instruments, pets and plants are often not covered by credit-card insurance. And in a claim involving a theft from a car, the vehicle must have been locked and must show signs of forced entry. As in Mr. Holstein's case, refunds can take a month or more, rather than the blink of an eye suggested by recent television commercials.
In a large claim, an insurance inspector may also pay the card holder a visit, said James M. Erlick, an American Express vice president for card member services. He declined to say how big a claim would have to be to bring such an inquiry or how many claims had received such scrutiny.
The documentation required on claims depends on the type of loss, Mr. Erlick said. A police report is needed, for example, to substantiate a theft. In damage cases, smaller items must be mailed to the charge-card company, while larger items can be photographed. Claims must be filed within 45 days after an item is lost or damaged.
Those who monitor the credit-card market said consumer reception of the programs had been good. ''We have not heard any complaints about them,'' said Spencer Nilson, the publisher of the Nilson Report, a charge-card industry newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif.
The choice of a charge card should be based on interest rates, not incentives, consumer advocates say. But efforts by some banks to attract preferred card customers has led to wide differences in both interest rates and annual fees.
 
The Fine Print Bears a Look
 The biggest benefits are reaped by those who qualify for preferred cards without annual fees and can afford to pay their monthly bills before interest is due, said Mr. McKinley, the Bankcard Update publisher.
Some bank cards require a minimum savings account balance. Other bank offers may lose their attraction on closer examination.
For example, the First Deposit National Bank in Tilton, N.H., is offering a preferred Visa card without an annual fee. But the card does not offer a grace period, which means that interest on purchases begins accruing immediately.
 
SAYING GOODBYE TO AN OLD CARD
 
Here are some tips from Bank Cardholders of America, a consumer group, on changing credit cards:
* Wait to cancel a high-interest card until you have selected - and received - a lower-interest one.
* Tell the new bank you want to close your old credit-card account. That bank may advance you cash at the lower interest rate to pay off the old card's balance. But be sure the fee for the advance is minimal.
* Cut your old card in half and mail it to the issuing bank with a note saying you want your account closed.
 A list of banks that issue low-interest credit cards is available for $1.50 from Bank Cardholders of America, 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, Va. 22070.

HEADLINE: U.S. WEIGHS SHIFTS IN AFGHAN POLICY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
President Bush sent a delegation of senior American officials to South Asia today to accelerate efforts to find a negotiated settlement of the war in Afghanistan.
Nearly a year after Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, the American-armed guerrillas seem no closer to military victory in the effort to establish a non-Communist government in Kabul. .
The mission to South Asia, led by Robert M. Kimmitt, the No. 3 official at the State Department, is unlikely to produce a reversal of longstanding American policy itself. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visits Moscow early next month, and officials are clearly analyzing all the options on Afghanistan. Among the possibilities are a cutoff of arms from both superpowers, a coalition government, or a larger role for the United Nations. 
The Kimmitt trip comes as the United Nations is also stepping up the pace of its Afghan diplomacy with a visit to Moscow by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is to meet on Monday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. [Page 15.]
Mr. Kimmitt will meet in Pakistan with Afghan guerrilla leaders and Pakistani officials. He also plans to visit Saudi Arabia, which helps finance some Afghan guerrilla groups. The delegation will also visit India, where Mr. Kimmit may meet the new Prime Minister, V. P. Singh, to discuss Afghanistan and other issues.
The delegation led by Mr. Kimmitt, who is Under Secretary for Political Affairs, includes Peter Tomsen, the special American envoy to the Afghan rebels; Michael E. Malinowski, a former consul in Peshawar, Pakistan; A. Peter Burleigh, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research; William J. Burns, deputy director of the State Department's policy planning staff, and Sandra Charles, a member of the National Security Council staff.
Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the trip did not signal a change or formal review of American policy toward Afghanistan. But Afghanistan will be high on the agenda when Mr. Baker meets Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow on Feb. 6 and 7.
Among the policy options are a larger role for the United Nations, simultaneous termination of arms deliveries by both Moscow and Washington, and the creation of a coalition government including Afghan guerrillas and some Communists not closely identified with the current Government. Another option is to ask the exiled King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, to return to Afghanistan and help unify the country.
 
A Hard-Liner's Softer Views
The United States insists that Najibullah, the Afghan President, resign as part of any political settlement. But the Soviets refuse to abandon him and note that he has shown much more staying power than Washington expected. In February 1989, American officials were predicting that the Najibullah Government would crumble within a few months.
Representative Charles Wilson, a Texas Democrat who is a staunch supporter of the Afghan rebels, visited Moscow this month at the invitation of the Soviet Government, and he came back saying he would no longer insist on military victory for the Afghan guerrillas.
Mr. Wilson once explained that he wanted to help the rebels in Afghanistan because ''it's the only place in the world where we are killing Russians.'' But in an interview this week, he said: ''The trip to Moscow softened me. I got a better understanding and appreciation and sympathy for the Soviet position. I saw what a God-awful mess they're in. My No. 1 objective now is a negotiated solution.''
''The mujahedeen have got to be more flexible,'' Mr. Wilson said, using the Arabic word for holy warriors, as the Afghan rebels style themselves. ''It's not desirable now for anybody to be hanging from lampposts.''
The Congressman said he detected ''some flexibility in the Soviet position'' and ''an extreme desire on their part to get this irritation out of the way.''
 
Objections to Najibullah
Richard N. Haass, director of Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said the Afghan guerrillas ''will not sit down and talk with or work with Najibullah'' because he is ''seen as being responsible for too much destruction and devastation.'' Mr. Najibullah is associated with the Soviet invaders of Afghanistan and ''has lost political legitimacy,'' he said.
''The Soviets have only departed Afghanistan in form, not fact,'' Mr. Haass asserted. ''What enables Najibullah and his associates to hang on is Soviet military and economic assistance, now estimated at $250 million to $300 million a month,'' or $3 billion to $3.6 billion a year.
American military aid to the Afghan guerrillas is estimated to have totalled $600 million last year, but the exact figure is a secret.
The departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ''does not provide much opportunity for cheering,'' Mr. Haass said. ''The fighting and the suffering continue. Afghans continue to die. More than three million Afghans remain refugees in Pakistan.''
Mr. Haass said that ''Najibullah and his closest associates will have to agree to transfer political power as part of a process leading to a settlement.'' Beyond that, he said, ''we are not wedded to any single political course or political outcome.''
 
Inflexibility Is Assailed
Selig S. Harrison, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has followed Afghanistan for 35 years, said he was disappointed with the Administration's position, as described by Mr. Haass. ''It does not indicate any flexibility on a key issue: support for the U.N. as a vehicle for bringing about a political settlement,'' Mr. Harrison said.
Nor, he said, does the Administration show any willingness to halt arms deliveries to the guerrillas in return for Moscow's willingness to halt military aid to the Kabul Government.
The United States supports the rebels' government-in-exile based in Pakistan.
''In effect,'' Mr. Harrison said, ''the United States is hostage to Pakistan's policy, which is to stall movement toward a political solution until the Afghan interim government becomes capable of prosecuting the war more successfully. That means indefinite American involvement in the Afghan civil war because the interim government was created under Pakistani sponsorship and is seen by many Afghans as a Pakistani tool.''
State Department officials said they were encouraged by reports of serious rifts in the Afghan armed forces and the recent defection of more than two dozen Afghan Army officers. Such reports emerged last month after many officers, including several generals, were arrested for plotting against the Kabul Government.
But the Washington policy suffered a setback this week when France announced plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, becoming the first Western power to be represented in the Afghan capital since the Soviet pullout last February. The United States has encouraged the diplomatic isolation of the Najibullah Government.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: The Oil States -- A special report:
3 States, Once Fat on Oil, Try to Break With Past

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Fearfully contemplating a future without oil, Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma are trying to reinvent themselves.
From the populism of the bayou to the conservatism of the old frontier, political cultures molded by the economy of oil are under siege. Business mores symbolized by the handshake contract have become outmoded. Powerful elites who held sway over city halls and country clubs have been swept aside.
The outcome of all these changes is so uncertain that experts offer a remarkable range of business and economic forecasts. 
A. Robert Abboud of Houston, chairman of the First City Bancorporation, is so optimistic that he calls the business opportunities in Texas ''a ticket to heaven.''
But Adm. Bobby R. Inman, who has headed two major Texas-based computer firms since he left the Central Intelligence Agency in 1982, said there is a serious risk that ''if we do not make some tough decisions or we make the wrong decisions, this region could end up like a very large Mississippi.''
The decline of oil deprived the region of the natural advantages that once put it so far ahead in the race for economic health and gave it the boastful self-confidence that has become its international image. Now business leaders and politicians are discovering that the transition to an age in which success rests upon brains rather than brawn requires profound changes in attitudes and expensive changes in public policy.
 
Loss of Security
Gone with the bust is a deep sense of security that flowed from a rich natural endowment. It has been replaced by a sense of all-out competition that starts with neighboring communities and extends to San Diego and Osaka. Oil patch cities like Dallas, which once considered themselves irresistible magnets, now see themselves as contestants in a desperate race to lure the businesses that will create jobs in the next century.
''We can't settle for just being cotton pickers anymore,'' said Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana, one of the major proponents of change in the region.
''Our natural resources were so plentiful,'' he said, ''that all we had to do was harvest them to get rich, whether it was cotton or oil and gas or lumber or cattle. But in this world today it is no longer enough to be asset-rich unless your No. 1 asset is human beings.''
 
The Bust
 
End of Dependency On Oil Money
 Two years of steady but unspectacular recovery have not dimmed the memory of the painful oil price busts of the 1980's.
The oil and gas industry provided Texas with 28 percent of all state taxes collected in 1981 but by last year that had dwindled to 9 percent. In Louisiana employment in oil and gas extraction dropped by more than half from 1981 to 1987 as the state lost about 9 percent of all its nonagricultural jobs.
The search for new vocations was evident in September among the 440 young, mostly affluent Texans who danced the two-step and devoured brisket at a barbecue at the Y. O. Ranch, a hill country spread that is considered a Texas icon for its 110-year history and its herds of longhorn cattle.
Charles Schreiner 4th, one of the ranch owners, commissioned a polling firm to survey his guests and found that nearly 39 percent of his friends thought the best investment opportunities in Texas for the 1990's lay in high technology industries. Among the revelers, who came from many of Texas's oldest and most influential families, only about 9 percent favored putting money into oil and gas ventures.
The ranch barbecue was called to commemorate ''The New Spirit of Texas,'' but the celebration may have been premature. The region has experienced a slow, steady recovery since the oil bust bottomed out in late 1987, with the Houston area showing particular resilience. But experts put many question marks in their long-term forecasts.
In all three states the relationship between the public and private sectors is being realigned. Government's basic responsibilities, especially regarding education, are being re-examined and final decisions are coming hard.
Traditionally a region where individuals paid low taxes, the oil states have had to defy the national trend during the era that made ''no new taxes'' a rallying cry to make up for lost revenues from the oil industry. Texas and Oklahoma have enacted substantial tax increases since the oil busts that have brought their levies close to the national average. Now there is talk of raising taxes some more.
 
Fiscal Luxuries Under Attack
In Oklahoma, Gov. Henry Bellmon, a Republican who is retiring this year, has been battling much of the conservative establishment that backed him through a long political career. He is asking for the second $250 million tax increase in three years along with a program of drastic school reform.
In Louisiana, Governor Roemer, a liberal Democrat, has been trying to wean the state from the populist largess instituted by Gov. Huey Long in the 1930's. Governor Roemer insists that fiscal luxuries like a homestead exemption, which frees most homeowners from property taxes, were viable only when the oil industry made vast contributions to the state treasury. So far, however, he has had only limited success in overhauling the tax system to transfer some of the burden from businesses to ordinary citizens.
In Texas, the ''good business climate'' has been as sacred as the Alamo. But now there is growing debate as to what exactly promotes the growth of business.
Joe R. Feagin, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin said: ''A large and powerful number of people in Texas still adhere to the frontier notion that low taxes, low services and minimal government is the way to prosperity. But the true Texans have been diluted by people who moved here during the boom, bringing along the notion that government is worth paying for if it is efficient and effective.''
An indication of how much Texas has changed came last October when Lieut. Gov. Bill Hobby, a Democrat, shocked the state by suggesting that Texas would have to enact an income tax soon, thus losing its status as the only big industrial state without either a personal or corporate income tax.
The Lieutenant Governor, also a lame duck, argued that an income tax was the only way to comply with a Federal court order that requires an overhaul of public school financing. Neither Gov. William P. Clements Jr., a Republican, nor any of the 14 candidates vying for his office in elections this year accepted the idea despite an estimate from the State Board of Education that the schools will need an additional $5 billion over the next five years.
While the education issue preoccupies much of the country, it is especially potent in these three states because they have consistently come in well below the national average in spending per pupil and in graduation rates. Across the region the business community has taken the lead with executives like Paul F. Roth, president of the Texas division of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company arguing that a weak school system ''wasn't such a crucial factor when oil and cotton fueled the Texas economy.''
''Today,'' Mr. Roth said, ''this weakness represents an economic time bomb.''
 
The Adjustments
 
Ostentation Is Out; Basics Are Back
 As the politicians debate the future, millions of individuals are adjusting to rapidly changing perceptions of economic opportunity.
In a region once marked by a highly speculative business mentality, executives have been chastened first by massive losses and now by a credit market that finances only the most solid proposals.''It's back to basics on all kinds of deals,'' said Scott Ziegler, of Ziegler Cooper Inc., a Houston architecture and design firm. ''If the fundamentals aren't right, the deals don't get made because that euphoric period of breaking the rules and taking big risks is long gone now. No one is building monuments to themselves anymore.''
Ostentation is out, even in the oil business. Old boy networks have been shattered by bankruptcies. ''Diversification and high tech have become the buzzwords,'' said Barton Smith, chairman of the economics department at the University of Houston. ''Diversification just means anything but oil, and no one knows what high tech means.''
And even two years of economic recovery have yet to repair some of the region's human losses.
''Families have lived in New Orleans for generations with no thought of leaving, but no more,'' said Walter R. Stuart 4th, one of five brothers who are heirs to a prominent banking family that traces its history in Louisiana to antebellum days. The five Stuarts, a lawyer, two doctors, an interior designer and an investment banker, have all left the state, primarily for economic reasons, and they are scattered across the country.
The dispersion of talent has been widespread. As oil drilling activity began to pick up again last year, rig operators in west Texas reported a shortage of ''roughnecks.'' the skilled handlers of oil field machinery. They simply moved on when the rigs went idle. Recent studies have documented a steady emigration by Oklahoma's most talented high school graduates.
''The downside to this situation is that we'll never get our kids back,'' Governor Roemer said. ''If the price of oil shoots up and we decide we don't need reform because things are O.K. again, we'll never see all those people who have left, especially the young people, because they've realized there is no future here without fundamental change.''
Some scholars argue that these events are a more drastic version of changes taking place nationwide.
Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist at Rice University in Houston, said: ''As the world enters the post-industrial age the United States is shifting gradually from an economy based on wealth in commodities to one that primarily exploits knowledge. The oil states are facing that shift sooner and more dramatically than the rest of the country, and so we can see the process more clearly here.''
Mr. Klineberg added: ''People feel that the old formulas proved inadequate, and there is some sense of what the new formulas should be. But there is not enough certainty or confidence about what needs to be done for people to make hard decisions.''
 
The Future
 
Brighter Prospects, But Clouds Remain
 A cautious view of the future should be expected in a region that has been on an economic roller coaster ride unlike anything experienced by any other part of the country in the postwar era.
During the 1970's the price of oil increased fivefold primarily as a result of turmoil in the Middle East and actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As oil rigs blossomed in areas previously considered too costly to explore, personal income grew much more rapidly than in the nation as a whole, drawing streams of workers fleeing recessions elsewhere.
Then, in 1982 and again in 1986, oil prices tumbled, falling from $37 a barrel to a low of $10. The collapse of exploration and drilling was only one point of pain in the demise of an entire economy based on heavy borrowing and a belief that the boom could never end. In Houston the value of real estate dropped as much as 30 percent, a larger loss than most cities experienced in the Depression.
 
Oil Prices Have Risen
Since the dark days of 1986 the price of oil has climbed back up, and for a year has remained stable in the range of $18 to $22 a barrel. The cheap price of crude and a more competitive dollar led to an expansion of the region's substantial petrochemical industry. And with the national economy growing steadily, the availability of cheap land, labor and services in the oil states has helped the recovery, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. In Houston, business bankruptcies in the first half of last year were down 44 percent as against the same period of 1988, and sale prices for single-family houses rose more than 7 percent.
To varying degrees across the region people are now at least certain that the worst has passed. While unemployment is still above the national average, job growth over the last two years has scored steady gains of from 1 and 2 percent across most of the region, as against an average that has hovered near 3 percent for the nation overall. The exception has been the Houston metropolitan area, which suffered the fastest crash in Texas and experienced the most rapid recovery, scoring employment growth of 3.5 percent in late 1988 before leveling off last year at a rate of about 2.8 percent.
''The Texas economy has turned around, no doubt about that, but it still has some turning to go,'' said Tom Frost, chairman of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., the only one of the 10 largest bank holding companies in Texas to survive without a buyout or a bailout.
''Some people have started feeling good about how far they've come from the dark days.'' he said. ''Even so the economy down here doesn't have much zip. Local entrepreneurs are just building up enough confidence to get back into action, and many of us in banking are still in the trenches.''
Experts are only now trying to measure how the economic and social landscape was altered so they can start predicting what it will look like in the future. And economic performance in the next few years will powerfully influence the process of long-term change that started during the bust.
Although the oil market remains somewhat unpredictable and vulnerable to political events in the Middle East, most experts agree that the price of crude is unlikely to reach a level that would justify the kind of high-cost exploration of the oil patch.
A wave of increased drilling activity appears to be getting started as the industry bets that the price of natural gas will rise in the long term. But for the next several years, experts predict that the industry will remain consolidated and somewhat cautious. Many businessmen believe opportunities still exist in the oil business, but that the nature of those opportunities is changing.
For instance, John Calaway, president of the Edge Petroleum Company, which specializes in seismic research, argued that the region will be ''the place where you find the brains and the technology, the home of the people you need to get energy out of the ground anywhere in the world, but not necessarily the home of the people who own the reserves.''
The decline of oil is such that even that role may be difficult to secure. The petroleum engineering faculties at the University of Texas in Austin and at Texas A & M University were once the chief training grounds for the American oil industry. In 1982 they had 2,729 undergraduate majors between them. Last fall they enrolled only 208. ''The region is now much less dependent on oil, and in Texas especially the mix is much more similar to that of the country as a whole,'' said William C. Gruben, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''As the number of jobs related to oil and gas extraction was shrinking, whatever growth there was took place in other sectors, especially in manufacturing and some services. Even if prices go up, the chances of oil taking a dominant position again are very slight.''
The past year has brought a number of positive signs. The Exxon Corporation joined the march of other major corporations, like the GTE Corporation, in moving its corporate headquarters to Dallas. Texas used all its clout in Washington to land the superconducting supercollider, a massive atom smasher that will cost at least $5 billion and is expected to produce high-tech spinoffs. More modest efforts also got off the ground, among them San Antonio's Texas Research and Technology Foundation, a marriage of nearly $70 million in private money with the University of Texas system. The foundation broke ground on a research park where scientists will have a chance to turn their discoveries into commercial products.
 
High Tech: A Painful Lesson
But people in the oil states are painfully learning that high tech sometimes just glitters. Austin has had consistent success in luring major computer firms, like Sematech, the Government-industry consortium for semiconductor research. But it is suffering through zero growth and a glutted real estate market.
Moreover, a huge cloud hangs over the recovery in the bust's twin legacy of an overbuilt real estate market and a debilitated financial sector. Vacancy rates have shown the first signs of shrinking in some cities. But now the Federal Government is about to begin selling off the more than 30,000 properties it inherited from failed financial institutions. Some 65 percent of those parcels are in the three oil states and the sale threatens to further depress prices.
In the view of some of the region's leaders, a quick end to the lingering pain of the oil bust might harm the region in the long run. ''If there is a real slackening of the depression mentality,'' Governor Roemer said, ''we won't finish the education reform, we won't finish the fiscal reform, because people won't feel things are bad enough to require fundamental change.''

HEADLINE: Pope Warns on Rekindling of Rivalries in East

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II today hailed the ''irrepressible thirst for freedom'' that has ''broken down walls and opened doors'' in Eastern Europe, but he warned that the rapid political changes could unleash nationalist feelings and ethnic conflicts.
The Pope did not single out any country by name, but his comments suggested concern about such developments as nationalist tensions in the Soviet Baltic republics and the anti-Turkish sentiments that have surfaced anew in Bulgaria in recent days.
''The aftereffects of World War II, let loose 50 years ago, call for vigilance,'' he said in an address to the Holy See's diplomatic corps. ''It is always possible for secular rivalries to re-emerge, for conflicts between ethnic minorities to be rekindled, for nationalisms to be exacerbated.'' 
In his speech, a review of world events over the last year, John Paul in effect spun the globe, touching on leading international issues, continent by continent. He included a brief reference to Panama that some diplomats said later could be interpreted as a request that the United States withdraw its troops quickly.
''Here, too, the civilian population suffered more than anyone else,'' he said. ''It is hoped that the Panamanian people can return to a normal life without delay, in the dignity and freedom to which any sovereign people have a right.'' The mention of ''normal life'' and sovereignty struck some who heard the Pope as an allusion to American troops.
For the most part, though, he concentrated on the remarkable shifts in Eastern Europe, which Vatican diplomats maintain were brought about in part by the Polish-born Pope. He helped promote these changes, they say, by lending moral and religious support during difficult years, especially in Poland, where the downfall of the Communists last summer set in motion similar developments throughout the Eastern bloc.
In speaking to the diplomats, representing 120 countries, the Pope noted the presence of the Polish Ambassador, Jerzy Kuberski, as a symbol of improved relations between the Holy See and the East. The Vatican restored diplomatic ties with Poland last year.
More indirectly, the Pope seemed to praise the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a reference to ''responsible politicians'' who had made possible Eastern Europe's ''long pilgrimage toward freedom.'' John Paul met Mr. Gorbachev at the Vatican last month in the first encounter between a Kremlin leader and the Pope.
It was now time, he said, for the West to help the emerging democracies of the East to ''regain fully a place that belongs to them in a Europe of today and tomorrow.'' But at the same time, he offered a lament that Western Europe, while democratic and prosperous, was not the best tutor for nations ridding themselves of Communism.

The West is burdened with ''countervalues like egoism, hedonism, racism and practical materialism,'' he said, adding that it would be a mistake for Eastern Europeans to follow the same path as they expand liberties.
''Too often, unfortunately, the Western democracies have not known how to use the freedom won in the past at the price of hard sacrifices,'' he said. ''One can only regret the deliberate absence of every transcendental moral reference in the management of so-called developed societies.''
This has been a recurring theme for John Paul, who sees spiritual values in general, and the Catholic Church in particular, as having been threatened as much by Western secularism as by overt Communist hostility to religion. But in emphasizing matters of the soul, the Pope did not neglect Eastern Europe's material needs.
He met this afternoon with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, and reportedly said Eastern Europeans could use the Japanese work ethic to rebuild their devastated economies.
According to Japanese officials, Mr. Kaifu asked what Japan could offer in the way of assistance, and John Paul replied, ''One thing I have to ask you is that the diligence of the Japanese people be introduced in these countries.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Intelligence;
Kremlin Watchers Cope With Data Glut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
After 40 years of foraging for bits of data on the Soviet Union and its allies, American intelligence analysts are struggling to cope with a cascade of information, including Kremlin statistical reports, periodicals and word-of-mouth from foreign business travelers and military officers who can visit once-forbidden reaches.
The ability to tap new veins of data has already prompted major changes in the way experts in the Pentagon, the State Department and intelligence agencies operate, officials said in interviews this month.
''It used to be that you'd go through reams and reams of stuff and just come up with dross,'' said a senior Bush Administration official who is well-versed on the process. ''Now there's so much gold that they could work round the clock.''
 
Technology and Mindsets
The changes range from the increased use of computers and other advanced technology to simple efforts to break old mindsets about the Communist system. The sheer volume of publicly available data has led officials to use more ''open source'' data, and less secretly gathered information, in preparing analyses of events for policy makers. 
Officials contend that their insights into Soviet society and politics were sharp even before the new avalanche of information began in the mid-1980's. ''We did a pretty good job on groundwork studies that looked at the fundamental bankrupty of the bureaucracy and the economy,'' Richard J. Kerr, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, said in a recent interview. ''We've been writing about this in detail for 10 years, probably more.''
But the consensus of Government and private experts is that the C.I.A. and other agencies underestimated the Soviet Union's economic and social problems and failed to detect the potential for political upheaval in Eastern Europe.
Their hope is that the new data, combined with new ways to analyze it, will produce a more sophisticated view of East bloc changes and how American leaders may deal with them.
 
Like Redrawing a Map
A Defense Department official involved in the process likened the task to redrawing old and trusted maps that have guided American views about Soviet intentions.
''They had wonderful features and roads,'' he said. ''We could change the roads from two lanes to four-lane highways, but they all ran in the same direction and went through the same towns. What has happened now is that all the roads just went off our maps.''
He and other officials agreed to be interviewed only if they were not identified, and some required that their agencies not be named as well. They include some of the Government's top analysts of Soviet and Eastern European issues. The analytical work is concentrated at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
In a community of intelligence experts that dissects everything from nuclear strategy to sugar-beet harvests, the Sovietologists are the kings of the analytical hill. The pressure to handicap Kremlin events accurately, a former Government official said, is enormous, not just because of the implications that a serious error carries, but because of the prestige at stake.
In the tight community of intelligence experts, Soviet analysts have long been criticized as too clubby and too cautious, especially by political conservatives who have long held a dimmer view of the Soviet empire's future. Analysts and other officials bristle at suggestions that their work has been seriously deficient.
But even so, officials agree that analysts missed cues that would have pointed more urgently to the political turmoil seen in the East bloc today.
 
Estimates Were Overly Rosy
Well before 1980, they said, intelligence experts were issuing overly rosy estimates of growth in the Soviet economy. They also played down reports from Soviet emigres of growing social and political unrest.
An official said it became apparent to analysts in 1987, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, began pressing his plan of political restructuring, that ''all the props were getting knocked out from under the regime'' and that basic changes were inevitable. But even then, experts believed erroneously that the response would be evolutionary.
''Anyone who would have written about East Germany's disintegration a year ago would have been laughed out of the Government,'' another senior expert on the Kremlin said this month, echoing many others' comments about the Soviet Union and other East bloc nations. ''We were totally surprised.''
Officials also agree that the intelligence experts suffered another problem during much of the 1980s: inexperience. At the C.I.A., the largest analysis center, three-quarters of the analysts employed in 1985 were hired in the preceding five years, a senior Administration official said.
The new information flowing out of the Soviet Union today presents a far greater challenge. It is stunning in its breadth and complexity, experts say, but ragged in its quality and usefulness. Assembling it, and deciding what needs more study, is a monumental job in itself.
Examples abound: Moscow recently released the first figures since 1928 on suicide in Soviet Union, an important indicator of social stability. It also may be possible soon to subscribe to regional newspapers throughout the Soviet Union, a prospect eagerly awaited in part because it would provide local officials' versions of political meetings they attended on trips to Moscow.
Such reports are available infrequently and are often dated when they are received, an official said.
 
Information From Travelers
Military experts on arms-control missions inside the Soviet Union return with firsthand observations on Soviet defenses and technology, just as Soviet observers do in this country. So do business executives and tourists who now can visit areas and people that Government officials cannot easily see.
''What we've done is to look at alternative means of collection that weren't previously given the same importance,'' the Director of Central Intellligence, William H. Webster, said in an interview. ''We have mobilized significant places in American industry, professionals and others who have access that we don't have and which we could not likely get over a sustained period of time.''
On the other hand, reliable figures on the economy are rarer than ever despite new openness about Soviet spending, an expert said. Backroom insights into Soviet politics are still nonexistent; like their predecessors 20 years ago, disgraced Soviet officials still resign for ''health reasons.'' And understanding the jockeying within the ruling elite, analysts say, remains an art akin to reading tea leaves.
''Why doesn't someone sign an obit for Sakharov?'' one asked. ''Here's Pravda from Dec. 16. Ligachev didn't sign it. Why? Maybe he didn't like him. We don't know.'' Yegor K. Ligachev, a senior member of the ruling Politburo, is considered one of the more conservative members of the Kremlin leadership.
 
Changes in Soviet-Watching
Several Government officials said that Mr. Gorbachev's ascension marked the start of changes in the American intelligence community's approach to Soviet-watching. Within the C.I.A., for example, officials created a separate Soviet analysis office, an action later followed by other analytical agencies.
In a move that now looks prescient, the Soviet Union's Eastern European allies, which once were analyzed in the same C.I.A. office, were spun off to a division that watches Western European affairs.
Most important, experts have changed the mix of information they now use to evaluate changes in the Communist bloc. Mr. Webster said in an autumn interview that there was ''no question'' that the ''open side of the business has become more important'' than the secret side as the flow of public data increases.
The C.I.A. has set up new bureaucracies to examine issues like the Soviet labor movement that were unheard of even five years ago. It and other intelligence agencies have placed a new emphasis on economics, recognizing that military might depends in large part on domestic economic strength.
While the individual changes are often subtle, their collective impact weighs large on the analysis business, which has long been skewed to spotting war preparations and other military thrusts and parries.
A top Government analyst estimated this week, for example, that his agency's Sovietologists devote half their effort to nonmilitary issues now, compared with a third just a few years ago.
Some agencies are experimenting with optical scanners and computer programs that can read and translate into English some basic foreign texts, a senior official said, and the processing of radio and television broadcasts has been partly computerized as well.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Aid From the West;
New Bank to Help East Bloc Revive Its Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Senior officials from the leading industrial nations and Eastern Europe are to meet here on Monday to plan the establishment of an Eastern European development bank. The bank would lead to one of the largest regional assistance efforts since the Marshall Plan.
Representatives from 34 nations are expected to agree to put at least $10 billion into the bank, which has provisionally been named the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe.
European officials said the bank would be modeled after the World Bank and would provide loans, economic guidance and technical assistance to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Rumania and Bulgaria. 
 
Money for the Private Sector
The bank's principal aim will be to help finance the development of the tiny private sector in Eastern Europe nations as they move toward a market economy. In addition to making loans, the bank will provide loan guarantees as well as make equity investments in some enterprises.
French officials said an accord to set up the bank might not be signed until next month. The reason is that the Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry officials who will meet in Paris on Monday and Tuesday still have to agree on the exact capitalization of the bank as well as what its membership and structure will be.
European officials said the bank might not lend money for another 12 months because once the accord is signed, many governments and parliaments will have to approve their capital contributions to the bank.
Eastern European officials are eager for the bank to become operational; they say they lack the money to finance large-scale development of their private sectors.
 
Community Leads the Effort
The European Community has been the principal engine behind the new development bank, with the leaders of the 12 community nations voting to back a French proposal to form such a bank when they met in Strasbourg, France, last month.
A competition has already developed over where the bank will be based. Denmark has asked for the headquarters and so has Austria, even though it is not a member of the European Community. The French Government is pushing for Strasbourg to be the seat, while some West Germans are lobbying for Berlin.
Under the European Community's plan for the development bank, the Community nations would put up slightly more than 50 percent of its capital and would hold slightly more than half the seats on its board.
European and American officials said there was a provisional agreement for the United States, Japan and the four largest Community nations -France, West Germany, Britain and Italy - each to take an 8.5 percent stake in the bank.
 
Money From Moscow
European officials said the United States had agreed to the community's call to give the Soviet Union an 8.5 percent stake in the bank, but on the condition that Moscow would make its capital contribution in hard currency.
Nonetheless, Washington is said to have reservations about Soviet membership in the bank. ''The Americans have been the most hestitant nations about Eastern European and Soviet participation in general,'' a European official said.
Several countries were uncomfortable with asking the Eastern European nations to make capital contributions to a bank that is being set up to give them financial assistance. Others that support Eastern European membership say it is important for those nations to have a voice in shaping the bank's policies.
Under the Community's plan, the six Eastern European nations would be asked to take a 6.5 percent stake among them.
Other members of the bank will be Canada, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia, Malta and the Scandinavian nations.
 
Differences Over Size
Some Western officials have voiced discomfort that the Eastern European nations will be attending Monday's meeting even though the industrialized nations have yet to reach agreement on some delicate issues.
''There are differences over the size of the fund and over what types of projects the money should be channeled to,'' a Western official said.
The French originally called for capitalization of $18 bllion, while the British, reluctant to see Eastern Europe become even more indebted, proposed $6 billion. At a meeting last Tuesday in Brussels, the Community agreed that the capitalization should be $12 billion. The Americans and Japanese still have to approve that level.
Under the Community's plan, the bank would have intitial capital of $3.6 billion when it is started, with its capital base growing subsequently.
The British have also created some heat by asserting that the loans should go strictly to the private sector. But officials from France and some others European nations say the loans should also be available to governments to improve basic infrastructure, like roads and telecommunications.
 
Below-Market Interest Rates
Another debate will be over whether the bank should be able to lend money at concessional rates. The British have argued against this, saying loans at below-market interest rates should be made to only the poorest nations, namely those in Africa.
Before the formal meeting begins on Monday, there will be a preliminary meeting on Sunday night to discuss some details regading the bank.
Some officials said the new bank could, like the International Monetary Fund, attach conditions to its loans; for instance, that the countries make certain economic changes.
International relations experts said the new bank was one of the first major East-West projects in which Western Europe has taken the initiative. At last July's economic summit meeting in Paris, the seven leading industrial nations decided that the European Community should coordinate food and other aid efforts to Eastern Europe.
 
American Budget Deficit
At the meeting, European and American officials said the European Community had been chosen to lead that effort out of recognition of Western Europe's greater familiarity and proximity to Eastern Europe. Another reason for the choice was that Western European governments have greater resources for such aid than the United States does because of the huge American budget deficit.
The Paris meeting will be the first of several landmark meetings between Eastern and Western nations over the next few weeks. This week in Vienna senior military officials from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact are to meet in Vienna to discuss their military strategies to help prevent misunderstandings.
The United States will be represented at the Paris meeting by David E. Mulford, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and Robert P. McCormack, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs.
The chairman of the meeting will be Jacques Attali, a senior adviser to President Francois Mitterrand of France.

HEADLINE: THE U.S. AND PANAMA;
Peruvian Still Outraged By Invasion of Panama

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Jan. 13

 BODY:
High above the presidential palace here, the flag of Panama flutters next to that of Peru.
''It will stay up there until the Yankee troops get out of Panama,'' Peru's President, Alan Garcia, said defiantly in an interview on Friday.
Of the leaders of Latin America's major countries, Mr. Garcia is the only President to go beyond the flurry of protest notes that expressed regret or condemnation after the December invasion. He is bluntly and publicly offering the kinds of criticisms made frequently but privately by Government officials in Bogota, Brasilia and Buenos Aires. 
 
Says Invasion Is Illegal
''By what authority does the United States kidnap citizens and judge them?'' Mr. Garcia asked, referring to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and his associates. ''The invasion was an illegal search of an entire nation. And what you get from an illegal search is worthless in court.''
In a two-hour, passionately argued interview, the President, who leaves office in six months, said he believed that his Latin American colleagues would eventually join him in outspoken opposition to the invasion of Panama by the United States.
He predicted that Latin American public opinion would react negatively in coming months to the ''circus'' of a trial in Florida of General Noriega -''a barbarian brought before a court of imperial Rome.''
Mr. Garcia added: ''As much as Noriega was a dictator, he will be seen more as a Latin American than as a dictator. People are going to have compassion for him.''
Before the invasion, Mr. Garcia, a democratically elected civilian, sharply criticized General Noriega, and he indicated no change of heart on Friday. He described the deposed dictator, who long worked closely with the United States through the C.I.A., as ''the Frankenstein of the State Department and of the Pentagon.''
 
Calls Government Illegitimate
But he argued that Panama's new Government, led by President Guillermo Endara, was also illegitimate.
''The fact that Endara took the oath of office on a North American military base takes away all of his legitimacy,'' Mr. Garcia said, echoing a criticism heard elsewhere in Latin America.
''Once the carnival of the invasion is over, the protests will start, and American troops are not going to solve the internal economic crisis,'' he said.
Mr. Garcia said that to put Panama's democracy on a solid footing, Mr. Endara should set a date for new elections and President Bush should ask the Organization of American States to replace American troops with an inter-American peacekeeping force.
Mr. Garcia recalled his Ambassador from Washington last month and announced that he would boycott a presidential summit meeting in Colombia next month. Intended to promote a joint approach to cocaine trafficking, the meeting was to be attended by the Presidents of the United States, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.
''I will not attend the meeting as long as North American troops are illegally in Panama,'' Mr. Garcia repeated on Friday, adding that he would probably send a high-ranking substitute. ''While Latin America is invaded, it would be unworthy on my part to sit down with Mr. Bush.''
 
Fear of Interventionism
Mr. Garcia also expressed a worry that is reflected daily in newspaper headlines here and in Colombia: that the United States military victory revived dormant American interventionism. Two incidents last week - the dispatch of United States warships to waters off Colombia in the name of drug prevention and the surrounding of the Peruvian Embassy in Panama by American soldiers hunting Noriega associates - provoked nervousness in Colombia and Peru before the efforts were abandoned.
''The invasion of Panama has set relations between the United States and Latin America back 30 years,'' Mr. Garcia said, leaning angrily over his massive wooden desk in the palace.
''Now Mr. Bush feels backed by North American public opinion to intervene in Peru's Huallaga Valley war, in Bolivia's Santa Cruz de la Sierra,'' he said, referring to two areas that account for about 75 percent of the coca leaves grown worldwide for cocaine production.
On the drug issue, Mr. Garcia said he favored tracking drug-laden airplanes with radar and stopping them with a joint interdiction force, provided that agreement can be reached with his neighbors and with the United States.
''No one wants to be a drug-producing country,'' he said.
 
Disappointed at Reaction
He confessed disappointment with what he called Latin America's ''lukewarm'' reaction to the invasion of Panama. Indeed, several of his countrymen have backed the American intervention as a necessary evil.
Mario Vargas Llosa, the front-runner in Peru's current presidential election campaign, said recently, ''The Panamanians are celebrating in the streets the overthrow of the dictator Noriega.''
Mr. Garcia's own Ambassador to Panama, Mario Castro Arenas, resigned two weeks ago in protest over his nation's opposition to the intervention.
''The North American military actions in Panamanian territory did not invalidate the genuinely democratic election,'' Mr. Castro told a Panamanian newspaper last week, referring to the nullified election last May that Mr. Endara is widely believed to have won. ''The image of an invading army subjugating a people is not accurate in the case of Panama.''
Looking around the continent, Mr. Garcia said that Latin America's weak response to the American intervention was due to several factors: widespread condemnation of General Noriega, a traditionally ''submissive attitude before North America'' and a new fear that Latin America would be ''marginalized'' as new investment, foreign debt relief and trade preferences were channeled to Eastern Europe.
''The United States feels it can ignore and mistreat Latin America, because it is more interested in Eastern Europe,'' the President said, touching on a new worry in South America. ''Latin America is wounded, but her leaders won't say anything.''

HEADLINE: Praising 'New Mainstream,' Wilder Takes Virginia Oath

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Lawrence Douglas Wilder, a grandson of slaves, was sworn in today as Governor of Virginia in a 30-second ceremony that changed the political face of the United States.
Standing under a bright January sun, a cold breeze whipping colorful pennants of state and nation, Mr. Wilder repeated the oath of office in a clear but distinctly Southern drawl, then took his place in the line of elected Virginia governors that began with the Revolutionary patriot Patrick Henry and has included figures like Thomas Jefferson, Henry Lee, Harry F. Byrd and Mr. Wilder's immediate predecessor, Gerald L. Baliles.
But never before in Virginia, the centerpiece of the Confederacy, nor in any other state, had a black assumed a governorship by virtue of winning a popular vote.
''I am a son of Virginia,'' Mr. Wilder declared in his inaugural address, in which he paid repeated tribute to the ''new mainstream'' in this rapidly changing state. 
That mainstream, made up of blacks and the moderates who now crowd Virginia's burgeoning urban areas, gave him his narrow victory over former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman in November. That victory, in turn, made him not only Governor of the Old Dominion but also the nation's highest-ranking black elected official, a political figure to be reckoned with nationally, a symbol not just of a changing state but of a changing South and a changing nation.
 
The Faces of Change
That change was evident everywhere on Richmond's Capitol Hill today. Blacks and whites sat side by side in the bleachers reserved for dignitaries. They cheered side by side, fought off the chill wind side by side. Arrayed in front of Mr. Wilder was a sea of faces, mostly black nearest the podium, turned up toward him, proud, expectant, people who had come from distant corners of the state and the nation to be part of history, people who had come from as close as the next hill over, where Mr. Wilder was born almost 59 years ago in a segregated neighborhood racked by poverty.
The cheers began before Mr. Wilder could speak, even as an artillery unit was still firing off a 19-gun salute. Once he began, he was frequently interrupted by cheers. But when he spoke of freedom, there was silence.
''We mark today not a victory of party or the accomplishments of an individual but the triumph of an idea, an idea as old as America, as old as the God who looks out for us all,'' he said.
''It is the idea expresssed so eloquently from this great Commonwealth by those who gave shape to the greatest nation ever known, Jefferson, Madison, Mason and their able colleagues. The idea that all men and women are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
The cheering began again. It rolled across the Capitol grounds, reverberating off the walls of the Capitol building and finally washing over the statues of Stonewall Jackson and other Virginians who in earlier times held another interpretation of the idea touched upon by Mr. Wilder.
But that was before growth, much of it fueled by Federal spending and Federal projects, gave Virginia a population of more than six million people, many born elsewhere.
 
'Proof Positive' of Cooperation
''This is a great day for Virginia,'' Lina Smith, a 66-year-old black woman from Portsmouth, said as the inauguration began. ''We have had to overcome so much. It has been so hard for us. But now he has taken this great step, and I don't think things will ever be the same again.''
Garland Stith, a retired black merchant from Emporia, said Mr. Wilder's inauguration was ''proof positive of what people can accomplish when they work together.''
While the inauguration was infused with much heady pride and expectation, Mr. Wilder was careful to note that Virginia still faces hard times. He did not belabor the point, but early on he warned that tighter economic times are looming for the state after more than a decade of great prosperity.
''But progress will still be possible,'' he said. ''Opportunity can be expanded. Freedom can be increased. We are on hallowed ground today, and the steps we take from this place must be steps of honor. We shall not pause. We shall not rest upon laurels, for we have not fulfilled our destinies. While the flow may have slowed, Virginia's New Mainstream is far from drying up.''
 
A Moderate Approach
Even if Virginia still had a plentiful amount of money in its treasury to spend, Mr. Wilder is not the kind of politician who would be searching far and wide to spend it. He has repeatedly said that his mark as a Governor would be made through careful, thoughtful stewardship, not flamboyance or big spending, and that if there was any future for him in national politics, it would flow from that approach and philosophy.
A veteran of 16 years in the state Senate, Mr. Wilder began his political career as a brash and confrontational legislator, always ready to take on the Establishment. His initial major move when he became one of the first blacks to serve in the General Assembly since Reconstruction was to demand that the Assembly strip the words ''darkey'' and ''massa'' from the official state song, ''Carry Me Back to Old Virginia.''
He did not prevail on that, although the song has since been sung at few official events and was on no program today.
Within a few years Mr. Wilder became less confrontational and eventually was one of the Assembly's most effective legislators.
When he decided to run for governor, he ran in the middle of the road. And most of his appointments so far have been mainstream, people with experience in government and politics, including a goodly number of women and blacks.
Also sworn in today was a new Lieutenant Governor, Donald S. Beyer Jr., an automobile dealer from Northern Virginia. The incumbent Attorney General, Mary Sue Terry, was sworn in for a second term. Both are Democrats.
Mr. Baliles, the departing Governor and also a Democrat, was not eligible under Virginia law to run for a consecutive term. Mr. Wilder had been serving as his Lieutenant Governor, having won that job in 1985 in an election that was the first solid sign that a new kind of politics was emerging in Virginia.

Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
Congress will have to deal with several bills concerning coins in the next few months. One will change the look of the coins. Another will abolish the cent in favor of a new coin valued at one dollar. Both bills are mired in controversy. The bill to change the design on the reverse side of the coins is supported by the American Numismatic Association and by many collectors. The Bill of Rights has been suggested as the theme of the new design, but there's one problem. With only five coins and 10 original rights the choice will be hard. Should a design glorifying the First Amendment's guarantee of a free press push aside the design proclaiming the Second Amendment's right to bear arms? A vote on that question could tie up Congress and lobbyists for eternity. 
The other bill proposes abolishing the cent under the argument that, with inflation, it has become next to worthless. In the cent's place, the United States Mint would be mandated to make a one-dollar coin, presumably one different from the unpopular Susan B. Anthony dollar.
Eighty-one years ago, Congress voted to change the design on the one-cent coin and caused quite a stir. Under the urging of President Theodore Roosevelt, the Indian-head cent was abolished and replaced by the Lincoln-head cent. But the new coin, first minted in August 1909, was the first bearing the portrait of a President. When this new penny was announced in February 1909, the protests began.
Newspapers took sides on the question with one major New York newpaper proclaiming that the Indian-head cent was just fine as a coin and there was no reason to change it. Readers differed or agreed. Some felt that honoring the aboriginal inhabitants of America was fitting. Others said that the copper color of the cent complemented the copper color of the American Indian. One reader thought that the cent was too low a denomination for President Lincoln, while another thought that changing the cent was a dishonor to Sarah Longacre, the model for the Indian head. Her father, James B. Longacre, was the coin's designer.
Other readers felt that the Lincoln-head cent commemorating the centennial of Lincoln's birth was an appropriate change. Lincoln, dead only 45 years, was still a cherished or reviled figure.
The largest objection to the new cent was that no President had ever been depicted on a coin before and the tradition had persisted for more than a century.
The Government of post-colonial America was vehemently anti-monarch - the people had seen enough of royal policy. George Washington decried efforts to make him king of the colonies and resisted all tries to have his face adorn any currency. (That tradition, like his limit of two-terms in office, endured until President Franklin D. Roosevelt was inuagurated for a fourth term in 1945.) The penny's design change was made. On Aug. 2,1909 the Philadelphia Mint issued the first Lincoln-head cents. Then another controversy arose. The designer, Victor D. Brenner, had placed his initials on the penny too prominently.
Rumors spread that the Treasury would recall the coins. The cents began selling for a premium and in New York City boys lined up at banks to buy a dollar's worth. The cents were sold two Lincoln-head cents for a nickle. But the Treasury changed the dies to eliminate the initials and the cents continued to pour forth. Today, the Lincoln-head cent and all its design variations is the most numerous U.S. coin ever minted, more than a quarter-trillion.

Overcoming Obstacles to a Civil-Rights Chronicle

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In 1965, Henry Hampton, the executive producer of ''Eyes on the Prize,'' marched for civil rights in Selma, Ala. Today he works in a corner office piled high with books and papers, with a view of Shawmut Avenue, a thoroughfare in this city's South End that is, in his words, ''about the only integrated neighborhood in Boston.'' Over his desk is a somber portrait of William Butler Yeats; on one wall is a poster-sized drawing of a time line, with major civil-rights events from the 1950's to the 80's inked in by hand.
Mr. Hampton has just put the finishing touches on ''Eyes on the Prize II,'' the eight-hour second half of the critically acclaimed chronicle of the civil-rights movement that he conceived and produced for public television. The sequel, which, like the first, is narrated by Julian Bond, the civil-rights activist and longtime member of the Georgia Legislature, begins tomorrow night at 9 on the Public Broadcasting Service. It focuses on the more complicated years of the movement, 1965 to the mid-80's, and the story of its production underscores some of the lingering misunderstandings that caused problems for the movement itself at the time. Not the least of the hurdles Mr. Hampton had to overcome in completing the sequel, despite the praise heaped upon the original series, was financing - even from some of those who had contributed earlier. 
The initial half of the series, ''Eyes on the Prize,'' which focused on the years from 1955 to '65, was telecast in 1987. Walter Goodman, in his review in The New York Times, called it ''a moving documentary'' in which ''the nobility of America's civil-rights struggle comes through with the directness and strength of a spiritual.''
''Eyes on the Prize II,'' which begins with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and ends with the election of Harold Washington as Mayor of Chicago, examines a more complex period. The issues are less clear-cut and often more troubling, at least in the eyes of mainstream America, and events exploded amid dissent over how best to achieve real progress for black Americans.
The series discusses convulsive issues like the desegregation of the Boston schools in the mid-70's and the prison riots in Attica, N. Y., in 1971. It offers a look at the Black Panther Party, first as a political force in rural Alabama (where the panther was chosen to help illiterate voters distinguish the party's candidates from local Democrats and Republicans, who used roosters and elephants as party symbols) and then as a militant organization that became a source of fear in major cities. The series also examines attempts at local power-sharing, as in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school decentralization effort in Brooklyn, and the need for economic power as enunciated by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the final year of his life.
Mr. Hampton always envisioned the series as surveying the years through 1983 but chose to make two less massive projects by dividing the period at 1965. The first half, called ''Eyes One'' around the offices of Blackside Inc., the film production company Mr. Hampton founded in 1968, ''covered a period for which historians have had a chance to apply all the filters, and there is very little doubt about what was going on,'' Mr. Hampton said. From 1954 to '65, he added, the goal of nonviolent protests by blacks and whites was to outlaw the segregated society that prevailed in the South. Whites could readily understand what was wrong with the system.
''Eyes on the Prize II,'' on the other hand, deals with matters that are less straightforward. ''In 'Eyes Two,' we're where the East Germans are today,'' said Mr. Hampton, a sturdy, sunny 50-year-old in Brooks Brothers attire. Once the right to vote was in hand, black people had to be encouraged to vote. And there had to be black candidates, and black victories, and an electorate able to understand that not all things were possible even when a person it had chosen was in power. ''The issue wasn't separatism versus integration,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''The issue was that to participate in this country you have to have a base.''
The episodes in the sequel focus on the struggle of blacks to build a power base from which to shape the future. One segment examines the tensions felt by voters, black and white, who were confronted for the first time with the option of choosing a black mayor for a major city during the 1967 campaign of Carl B. Stokes Jr. in Cleveland.
''Don't vote for me because I am a Negro,'' Mr. Stokes is shown urging the congregation at a black church. ''But for God's sake, don't vote against me because I'm a Negro.''
The wider array of people and philosophies in the sequel took longer to research than those in ''Eyes I.'' Finding people who were willing to discuss the events after 1965 was often difficult.
''It was harder than some of the earlier films in the South,'' Mr. Hampton said, ''perhaps because they've resolved it in their heads down there, and it's further in the past.'' Among individuals who were approached for interviews but refused, he said, was former President Richard Nixon.
Despite the warm reception given the first series, Mr. Hampton, who spent eight years amassing enough money to produce it, found himself once again having to pry financial support out of corporate and private sources for the sequel. In part because of lingering controversy and skittishness about some of the issues addressed in ''Eyes on the Prize II,'' many of the potential investors he approached turned him down.
''We got $1 million from the Ford Foundation and $650,000 from the public stations, so I expected the rest to roll in,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''Wrong.''
Complicating the job, his production costs were twice as high this time. The first series cost $3 million to produce, but ''Eyes on the Prize II'' required $6.2 million.
''It's eight hours instead of six,'' Mr. Hampton explained. ''And our costs were artificially depressed the first time around, because I had people working for a lot less'' than standard industry wages.
He built a network of support by returning to some of the corporations that had helped him with ''Eyes on the Prize I.'' Through friends, he found others. Major underwriters for both halves of the series include the Lotus Development Corporation, a leading software manufacturer based in Cambridge, and the Ford Foundation. New underwriters include the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the William Penn Foundation and the Melville Corporation, the Westchester-based owner of several national retail chains.
He was rejected by more than 100 companies. ''No one ever says, 'Malcolm X? No way!' '' Mr. Hampton said. ''The reality is, you never know why. There were some companies that said they'd like to sponsor us - but after the series was finished, so they could see it. It's a little like saying, 'I'd love to be pregnant. Can I see the baby first?' ''
Mr. Hampton said he did not target black-owned companies in particular for financial help. ''We really didn't go to them with a direct pitch,'' he said. ''We were looking for people who had the capacity to give at a certain level,'' namely about $350,000 each. ''That was a big contribution for a lot of companies who don't have big advertising budgets.''
The president and chief executive officer of Lotus, Jim Manzi, said his company helped to underwrite the series out of a policy of supporting programs that work to fight racism. It is of particular interest to him as well as other executives at Lotus, he said, ''given the history of Boston.''
Lotus provided $200,000 for the initial series and $300,000 for the sequel. ''The first one was so great that it was easy to fund the second,'' Mr. Manzi said. As for the content of ''Eyes on the Prize II,'' he added, ''We didn't think twice about it, but we understood that other people would. It's a much more controversial period to the extent that people remember it a whole lot more vividly and lived through it.''
In the end, only about 2 percent of the material gathered for ''Eyes on the Prize II'' became part of the finished product. Much of the rest has been compiled in ''Voices of Freedom,'' an oral history written by Mr. Hampton and Steve Fayer, the series's senior writer. The book is being published by Bantam to coincide with the telecast of ''Eyes on the Prize II.''
Mr. Hampton's own experience in the South inspired him to create a television series charting the civil-rights movement. ''It was great television,'' he says now. ''You have great characters and a big story. When I first got involved, there were cameras all over the place filming it. And it's still with us, while other movements have come and gone.''
After Selma, Mr. Hampton, a St. Louis native and a graduate of Washington University, returned to work in Boston as a spokesman for the Unitarian Universalist Church, a leading voice in the civil-rights movement. By 1968 he had formed Blackside, which now has a staff of 40 and has produced more than 40 documentaries and films. His next project is a series, also for public television, on the Depression.
''Eyes on the Prize II'' is a chronicle, Mr. Hampton observed, of a struggle that continues in America, and the series may serve as a bridge between movements and concerns that existed in the 1960's and 70's and those of the present.
The stalling of the civil-rights movement in the 1980's was ''one of the great crimes of our century,'' Mr. Hampton said. By the late 1970's, he added, people had come to believe that certain policies were needed to redress the effects of segregation, but the Reagan era changed that. ''The signal from the leadership was, let's go back,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''And so, this enormous opportunity gets deferred.'' Many of the issues, such as poverty and homelessness that preoccupy America today, Mr. Hampton said, were problems that the movement tried to eradicate but failed.
''The difference between then and now is the intensity you see in the films, compared with the vacant eyes you see now,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''I hope what happens is you get a sense of the breadth of the movement and the persistence of people to change the system. This may seem like a moment when people are retreating, but there's another wave coming. You have to both help create it and be ready to ride it when it comes.''

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
LEARNING TO TAKE CALIFORNIA SERIOUSLY

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
It is not true that there was no California architecture before Esther McCoy. But there was almost no writing about it, and that made all the difference, since before Esther McCoy began her career as an architectural historian almost no one took California seriously as a place where great buildings could be made. Esther McCoy discovered a California that was not just freeways and oranges but the place where the American dream fused more naturally, and more intensely, with the 20th-century's language of modernism than it did anywhere else. And she wrote about this combination, and about the architects who made it happen, with such dogged determination that her work gave birth to an entire realm of architectural history.
Esther McCoy died in the final days of 1989, at 85, in Santa Monica, where she had lived since the 1930's. There wasn't as much California when she arrived as there is now, but she perceived an extraordinary architectural legacy, some of which was still a-building in the 30's and virtually all of which was ignored back East: the stark, white buildings of Irving Gill, far warmer than they looked to be; the rich, gentle eclecticism of Bernard Maybeck, at once noble and mystical; the sumptuous villas of the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, which merged Japanese influences with the California bungalow; and the sleek, taut modernism of R. M. Schindler, Richard Neutra, Gregory Ain and so many others. 
These men were not unknown beyond the borders of California, but they surely had not received their due before Ms. McCoy wrote ''Five California Architects'' in 1960, the book that turned several of them into major figures of the 20th century. The book includes chapters on Gill, Maybeck, Schindler and the Greene brothers (the essay on the Greenes was contributed by Randall Makinson). It quickly went out of print, but it had the status of a rare volume among architectural historians until 1975, when it was brought back in a new edition (by Praeger).
Because California is so much the focus of our attention today, it is hard to imagine how radical the whole idea of taking California seriously was to an architectural historian in the 1950's. Yes, Charles and Ray Eames lived there, and Richard Neutra was well known, and Los Angeles had an unusual number of houses by Frank Lloyd Wright, but still, if you asked an Easterner to name an important man-made place in California in those days he would probably have answered ''Disneyland.'' Not even Californians took California all that seriously.
Esther McCoy did; she took everything seriously. She was not stern or prim in manner - she loved to laugh, to tell stories, and to communicate in her writing her love of what she saw - but she knew great architecture when she saw it, and she knew California was full of important things that no one back East was bothering about. When she wrote ''Five California Architects,'' it was with a sense of mission. And the mission succeeded beyond anyone's dreams. Not only did her writing serve as the first introduction to California architecture for an entire generation of scholars and critics, it also did much to create the climate that permitted California's remarkable architecture of the 1970's and 1980's to flower.
Esther McCoy was not a great stylist; her prose, like her personality, was blunt, not baroque. She saw things in a matter-of-fact way and she wrote about them in a matter-of-fact way. But sometimes her laserlike ability to cut to the essence of things could yield splendid phrase-making, as when she wrote that Irving Gill's Dodge House in Los Angeles ''was to bring concrete to the architectural importance of stone.'' Of unsympathetic alterations to Gill's Scripps House in La Jolla, she wrote with both irony and bluntness that the changes ''could not have been an easy task, for it requires a pneumatic drill to destroy a Gill building - and a lack of understanding of his work.'' Esther McCoy had none of the scholar's tendency to detach architecture from the rest of life; when she wrote about an architect she pulled together art history, sociology, economics and biography, and did so in a way that never made you feel that she was shifting gears. In her essay on Bernard Maybeck in ''Five California Architects,'' she manages to teach us something about the terrible financial stresses of architectural practice, no better at the turn of the century than now, and about the majesty of a kind, almost innocent, character who produced works of magical beauty and power.
That Esther McCoy would put Maybeck and Schindler together in the same book tells us something, too, for these architects could not have been more different: the one a romantic eclectic who designed mainly by intuition, the other a strong-willed modernist with roots in Viennese modernism and in the career of Frank Lloyd Wright. What they had in common, of course, was California, and by putting them together in a single volume Ms. McCoy was saying that she was more interested in what they both had to say about the nature of California as a place than in their separate ideologies.
Esther McCoy herself was sympathetic to the modern movement. It is where her beginnings were, from the days in the 1920's when, fresh from the University of Michigan, she did freelance editing in New York and traveled in the city's avant-garde literary circles and did research for Theodore Dreiser, to a period when she lived in Paris. When the Depression brought her back to the United States, she went first to Key West, where she wrote short stories and a novel, and then, in 1932, for what she expected would be only a single winter, to Los Angeles.
She never left. In 1940, she married Berkeley Tobey, who died in 1962, and during the war she worked as a draftsman at Douglas Aircraft. It was after that, she told Joseph Giovannini in an interview published in The Times five years ago, that she decided to go into architecture. But women were not encouraged in the profession then, and instead of studying for a degree, she took a job as a draftsman in the office of R. M. Schindler, where she worked from 1944 to 1947. After that she decided to put the two parts of her career, literature and architecture, together and begin writing about the buildings and the architects of California.
And thus began a stream of articles and books that continued until just before her death. Among its highlights, besides ''Five California Architects,'' were ''Richard Neutra,'' the first book-length study of that architect's work; ''Vienna to Los Angeles: Two Journeys,'' a look at the tense and competitive relationship between Neutra and Schindler; and ''The Second Generation,'' a study of later California modernists. Her career closed with writing that was more personal: a memoir, published in the quarterly Grand Street, and a catalogue essay for ''Blueprints for Modern Living: History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses,'' an exhibition that opened last November at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
The exhibit traces the ambitious program of prototype modern houses in Los Angeles sponsored by the magazine Arts & Architecture between 1945 and 1966, which Esther McCoy was so much a part of that even this piece is as much a memoir as it is a work of architectural history. ''A magazine as flat as a tortilla and as sleek as a Bugatti with little advertising and no financial backing became the greatest force in the dissemination of information, architectural and cultural, about California,'' she wrote about how the Case Study program came to be, and while her similes could only have referred to the magazine, the rest of the sentence could really be about Esther McCoy herself.

COMPANIES
 
Debt Ahead for UAL
 
The UAL Corporation had better learn to love debt. Either management and the employees will load the company with debt to buy it, or the board will undertake a buyback - mortgaging the company to pay some impatient stockholders a premium. The noisiest of these stockholders, Coniston Partners, threatens to unseat most of the board unless UAL coughs up a satisfactory payoff. Investors and arbitragers took a beating last October, when the collapse of a $300-a-share buyout plan sent the stock from the high 200's to the mid-160's. Stephen M. Wolf, the UAL chief executive, has warned that the buyback would drain the company of funds to buy more jets and maintain market share. Some analysts doubt the company would be much healthier if Mr. Wolf and the employees won control. 
 
Doubts on Farley's Filing
 
The woes of leverage, continued: William Farley's plans for creating the nation's largest textile company are looking as dim as his ambitions to become President. He took control of West Point-Pepperell Inc. last year, outbidding management with a $3 billion offer. For a part of his financing, he used some of the junkiest junk bonds Drexel Burnham Lambert could devise. Nine months later, he is still depending on his bankers to extend a billion-dollar bridge loan and keep his hopes for completing the purchase alive. Wall Street has such deep doubts about Mr. Farley's prospects that West Point-Pepperell shares are trading at more than $20 below his offering price. But then Mr. Farley's last Presidential campaign got no further than Iowa.
 
Pension Funds Pressure on G.M.
 
It was a rough week for the General Motors Corporation. Two of the nation's largest pension funds appeared fed up with the company's performance. The heads of the California and New York public employees pension funds asked G.M. directors for a broader role in choosing and setting goals for the next chairman and chief executive. The current boss, Roger B. Smith, is due to retire this August. Since the G.M. board has usually allowed chief executives to choose their own successors, analysts saw the pension funds' request as a slap at Mr. Smith. The funds own millions of G.M. shares, so unlike small investors, they can't easily bail out. The company issued a curt statement rejecting the funds' appeal. But a couple days later came broad cuts in expenses, with incentives for white-collar employees to retire early. Meanwhile, ticket sales for the movie Roger & Me were so strong that Warner Brothers expanded its distribution. The film contrasts Mr. Smith's reassuring pronouncements with scenes of laid-off auto workers being evicted from their homes in Flint, Mich.
 
Top Price for Tape Machine
 
Look for digital audio tape recorders to finally arrive in United Statesstores by mid-year - at more than twice the minimum price in Japan. Two Japanese manufacturers, the Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, plan to sell the machines. They were kept off the American market for three years because record companies feared their potential for copying compact disks and digital tapes. The record companies dropped their opposition after manufacturers agreed to restrict the machines' ability to copy the tapes, but not the disks. Matsushita, know for its Panasonic and Technics brands, announced a price of $1,200 to $1,300. In Tokyo, retailers in the glaring, neon-lit Akihabara electronics district already sell the digital recorders for about $500.
 
Campeau Buying Time
 
Robert Campeau has been forced from American retailing. The question is, how much more time will his departure buy from the Campeau Corporation's creditors and suppliers? The creditors agreed last week for Campeau, on the brink of bankruptcy, to pay for December merchandise. The payments insuring that shipments to Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and the rest of the company's 240 stores will continue for the time being. The retailing interests will be run by a new chief executive and a new board, with the majority of its members American. Mr. Campeau, a flamboyant Canadian real estate investor, took on $7 billion in debt in buying the stores. Some of that debt is now worth just a dime on the dollar.
 
Sotheby's Margins to Move
 
 Somehow, Sotheby's famous Van Gogh just can't stay sold. With the purchaser, Alan Bond, deep in financial trouble, ''Irises'' may be for looking for a buyer again. The art world toasted the auction price of $53.9 million in November 1987 as a record. But it turned out that Sotheby's had financed half the price, with the painting itself as collateral. Though Sotheby's says Mr. Bond is current on his loan, it has been extended twice. Now Sotheby's might be in the awkward position of having to treat the masterpiece like some used car that has ended up back on the lot. The company has issued a new rule: No more purchases on margin. Sotheby's has evidently decided that ''We tote the note'' is no motto for a distinguished auction gallery founded in 1744.
 
 
 
ECONOMY
 
Stalling on the Prime
 
The worse the banks do, the slower they become to lower the prime rate. The banks did finally lower it a half point last week, to 10 percent. Analysts had been predicting the move for weeks, as the economy weakened and the Federal Reserve eased credit. But bank earnings have been squeezed by problem loans to real estate developers and Third World nations. Troubles loom in some of their highly leveraged corporate deals; Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said their consumer loans worry him as well. And for years, banks have had to pay higher rates on deposits. As a result, said Thomas H. Hanley, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, ''The banks are more reluctant to drop the prime directly in line with decreases in other short-term rates.''
 
Bond Defaults Head Higher
 
Corporate bond defaults are likely to mount in 1990. Ominously, the value of the defaults could approach the value of new junk bond issues. Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond Investors Association, predicts that about $15 billion in corporate bonds (mostly high-yield ''junk bonds'') will default this year, while only about $25 billion in new junk bonds will be issued. In 1989, $11.7 billion in corporate bonds defaulted - up 136 percent from 1988 - while $51 billion in junk bonds were issued, down 15 percent from 1988. The association, a nonprofit research group, keeps track of Wall Street's turkeys in the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter. ''All of these deals assumed capable management,'' Mr. Lehmann said. ''But some of these people are better at raising money than managing companies.''
 
An Inflationary Horizon
 
Economists predict renewed inflation in the wake of higher producer prices. And they say the Federal Reserve will be reluctant to ease credit further. The Producer Price Index rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in December, or 4.8 percent for all of 1989 - the highest annual increase in eight years. Analysts said the producer price news contributed to a 71.46-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the steepest since a 190.58-point drop last October 13. Economists, who had predicted a five-tenths of 1 percent increase, couldn't blame cold December weather for the surprise. Even without figuring in food and energy costs, producer prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent. As Lacy Hunt, chief economist at Carroll McEntee & McGinley Inc. said, ''Inflation is going to be very significant this year.''
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Ailing Argentina
 
Argentinian stocks are losing value as rapidly as the currency. Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange plunged an average of 53 percent on Monday, the first day the market was open this year. December inflation reached 40 percent, for a 1989 total of 4,923 percent. All President Menem's austerity plans, budget cuts and free-market medicine appear to be too little to rescue one of the world's sickest economies. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has required banks to increase their reserves against Argentinian loans to at least 35 percent from 15 percent. Argentina has paid the banks no interest since 1988.
 
Tokyo's Quota Trick
 
Count meaningless but symbolic concessions as one of Japan's newest exports. The Japanese Government is expected to extend its ''voluntary'' quotas on automobile exports. But the Japanese automakers say the move will have no practical affect. Rising production at their American plants - more than 1.1million cars last year - has made them less dependent on exports. The export quota stands at 2.3 million cars, but Japanese automakers exported only 1.8 million to the United States through November last year. The United Automobile Workers want to count Japanese cars made in America under the quota. The crisp response from Japan's trade minister, Hikaru Matsunaga: ''Very unlikely.''
 
Moscow the Scrooge
 
The Soviet Union wants to end its charity for Eastern Europe. The Soviet-led trade bloc, Comecon, has supplied valuable Soviet oil and gas to Eastern Europe in return for shoddy manufactured goods of dubious worth. Next year, the Soviet Union wants Comecon to begin trading at real market prices in hard, convertible currencies (not rubles or zlotys). East Europeans generally live better than their Soviet neighbors, but the new trade standards would leave these former satellites with a $10 billion annual trade deficit. If the Soviet Union insists on Comecon trade at market prices in a year, said Jan Vanous, research director of the PlanEcon consulting firm, ''All hell will break loose.''

HEADLINE: WORLD MARKETS;
The Triple Demerits in Tokyo

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Rising interest rates, a declining yen and higher oil prices are undermining the usually buoyant Tokyo stock market, hurting the stocks of large companies and sending shivers through other markets around the world.
Analysts argue that the plunge of 1,399.10 points, or 3.6 percent, this year in the Nikkei 225-stock index is a correction in an overvalued market that had reached a record high, and does not have the smell of a bear market. As evidence they point to two broader stock indexes, both including smaller companies, have done better. One has declined only six-tenths of 1 percent and the other is up 3.9 percent this year. 
But if it is not a preface to a disaster, the Tokyo decline is a reminder that markets everywhere could be highly volatile this year, especially because they seem to be feeding off each other's ups and downs. Tokyo's plunge of 653.36 points on Friday helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average down 71.46 points and depressed markets in West Germany, Britain and elsewhere.
In addition, the hopes arising from the investment opportunites in the opening of Eastern Europe and the record highs hit in many markets this year may not stand up that well against unhappy developments in domestic economies and the surely bumpy road to real progress in the new Eastern bloc.
Whatever happens, some analysts expect the Tokyo market to be uncertain, if not weaker, as investors wait to see how the ruling Liberal Democratic Party fares in the Feb. 18 Parliamentary election. The jitters could also continue until the Bank of Japan makes it clear whether interest rates have hit their peak. This means more swoons even if there is nothing close to a crash, and these gyrations, as happened Friday, could pull other world markets with them.
''I am not saying a panic is setting in,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities American Inc. in New York. ''But an anxiety has been created.'' He said inflation worries are emerging with reports of jumps in prices for business services, including trucking and rent. This news and the rise in Japanese interest rates (the 10-year government bond reached 6.465 percent Friday, the highest since just before the October 1987 Wall Street crash) first hit the futures prices, then bonds and now the stock market.
Mr. Kohashi said the election is worrying the market and a setback for the Liberal Democrats would do more damage. But he plays down the influence of developments in the Soviet Union last week, arguing that they had more of an effect on the yen.
He also said the rise in small-company stocks is not as positive as it might look. Large investment funds suffered losses from their holdings in major companies and are switching to smaller companies to try to recoup. The size of their purchases can easily inflate the share price of smaller companies.
''It may take two or three months for investors to regain confidence in the market,'' Mr. Kohashi concluded.
The decline in the yen and the rise in oil prices, which both add to inflation, are the other main reasons for the collapse. ''These are the triple demerits,'' said John Ford of Rowe Price Fleming Inc. in London, adding in the jump in interst rates.
Mr. Ford sees some advantage in the decline. Because the market is so overvalued, he said, ''we are not distressed seeing it have a correction.'' But no correction is pleasant, he acknowledged. ''Its not particularly nice when markets are collapsing around you.''

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Beware The Lesser FSX Role

BYLINE: By MEL LEVINE; Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and co-chairman of Rebuild America, a nonprofit group based in Washington.

 BODY:
The unfortunate truth about the FSX agreement to jointly develop a new Japanese fighter plane is that it was a compromise that ended up pleasing almost no one. The agreement was a contravention of free trade principles, a waste of resources and an inefficient method of meeting our defense needs. It may be that no permutation of the FSX agreement to transfer American technology abroad would have adequately addressed these central objections.
The FSX deal also vexed the Japanese defense industry, which wanted the full share of the Japanese Government's FSX contracts for itself. And it has irritated many in Congress and elsewhere who see in this deal the United States helping to expedite the development of yet another Japanese industry that will inevitably compete against our own companies. 
But while we argue about the wisdom of transferring some of our most advanced aviation technology to Japan, a much larger problem is emerging - our own growing reliance upon foreign technology. Accompanying this problem is the realization that the United States needs to find a way of insuring that technology developed in other countries also flows straight to America.
For most of this century, the United States, confident of its technological superiority and ability to maintain a comfortable lead over its competitors, felt little compunction about licensing products to foreign manufacturers. The F-16 technology that forms the basis of the FSX project is only the latest in a long history of American transfers of aerospace technology to Japan.
For future co-production agreements to avoid the acrimony surrounding the FSX, there must be some assurance that the technology flow will occasionally reverse itself and that the United States can benefit from research from abroad.
Carefully designed joint ventures can be a positive force and can result in precisely the kind of two-way technology flow the United States now requires. But the FSX is not that kind of two-way deal. A number of proposed international joint ventures may also pose an immediate risk to critical American industries.
Unless we begin to see some serious examples of the transfer of Japanese technology to the United States, we should reconsider the wisdom of future participation in such joint ventures.
The very fact that we must now insist on a two-way technology flow -and have grown so fearful about exporting our most advanced technology - reflects our weakening industrial position as a whole. American industry increasingly finds itself backed into an ''if you can't beat 'em, join 'em'' mentality. This pattern is reflected in such proposals as the suggested sale of Perkin-Elmer's stepper division - which manufactures the machines that make computer chips - to Japan's Nikon, the Boeing-Mitsubishi joint development plan for the 767X civilian transport plane, and the agreement for American semiconductor companies to manufacture chips for the Japanese high-definition televison and systems industry.
These deals symbolize the growing tendency of American companies to take a secondary position in international ventures. Over the long run, taking this secondary role will have profound negative implications for our industrial leadership, trade balance and standard of living. We increasingly find ourselves in a position in which there is often no alternative for an American company but to sell itself to the highest bidder (often foreign) or to remake itself with foreign cash.
We cannot permit the unlimited sale of vital high-technology assets to foreign interests. To deal with this problem in the urgent fashion it demands, we need to reform the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States - a Cabinet-level group that advises the President on foreign acquisitions - and give it more authority to block such sales when they threaten the survival of American industries critical to our economic future and our national security. But these are only near-term approaches. We have thus far spared ourselves the direct pain of a dwindling high-technology base by running up enormous balance of payments deficits to import the products we no longer make. The longer this continues, the more difficult it will be to rebuild our industrial infrastructure.
Ultimately, we need to find solutions to two key problems facing American industry: lack of access to patient capital, and a strategic economic vision. We need to reform capital gains to encourage long-term investment, extend the research and development tax credit, lower interest rates and increase savings. We also need to develop our most vital resource - our labor force - through vastly improved education and training.
It is clear that the old rules of comparative advantage no longer apply. Information and technological know-how cross national borders with relative ease, and the foreign targeting of key American industries distorts traditional market principles. In a global economy whose capacities and laws we barely understand, we can no longer act as if we have found the one formula for success. We must experiment boldly to find new ways of cooperation between industry and government.
The United States has maintained a comfortable industrial leadership position for so long, that it is not easy for us to adapt to the new realities of international competition. Only when we can put our own house in order will we be able to deal with our trading partners from a position of strength. Ultimately, this is the only way of averting future FSX-type controversies.

HEADLINE: TAKING THE FIELD;
A Battle for the Voters, and the 90's, Begins

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ELECTION 1990 is hardly uppermost in the minds of American voters. Non-presidential elections are often seen as mere housekeeping for democracy, and the stunning changes in Eastern Europe have overshadowed domestic politics.
But the parties are already obsessed with the November elections, which will have a fundamental effect on the politics of the 1990's. As of now, the 34 Senate contests are expected to yield no big partisan shift, and almost all of the 435 House seats are likely to be won, as usual, by incumbents. But the election of 36 governors and 6,257 state legislators will affect the contours of Congress for the rest of the decade. 
The new and re-elected state legislators and governors will help determine the composition of the House of Representatives of the 1990's, through the map-making exercise known as redistricting, which follows the Federal Census every 10 years.
This year will also see the emergence of a new dialogue, one absent many cold war era fears and anxieties; President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, after all, is getting approval ratings in American polls that most Washington politicians might envy. (Conservatives in the post-cold war era, page 24.)
Most off-year elections send some sort of message. In 1982 it was a thundering rebuke for Congressional Republicans who came up for re-election in the midst of recession. In 1990, the voters have much to comment upon; the world has changed significantly since most of them last went to the polls. The Pentagon is cutting its own budget, the Supreme Court has made abortion a more local issue, and a whole new crop of lawmakers is in the ethics spotlight.
''We are caught between the political dynamic of Reaganism and the emerging dynamic of the 90's, and it hasn't taken shape in a way that America really understands yet,'' said Michael McCurry, director of communications for the Democratic National Committee.
Democrats hope the voters are yearning for a more active government, one concerned with problems from crumbling highways to troubled schools. Republicans hope to keep control of the national political agenda, as they had for much of the 1980's, and campaign once again as the party of peace, prosperity and lower taxes.
Lee Atwater, the Republican National Chairman, offers a taste of campaign rhetoric to come. ''The fact of the matter is the President of the United States has not raised taxes,'' he said. ''And the fact is that Democrats talk about it all the time.'' Republicans hope 1990 is the first stage of a two-year assault on the Democratic fortress in Congress. They look back wistfully to the early Reagan years, when they controlled the Senate and had considerably more clout in the House than they do today.
The Senate, where the Democrats currently hold a 55-to-45 edge, seems by far the easier nut for Republicans to crack. Party leaders hope to pick up enough seats in 1990 to put them in striking distance of regaining control in 1992, when many freshman Democrats who were elected by narrow margins will be up for re-election.
Republicans have high hopes for races in Iowa, Rhode Island, Illinois and Michigan in which Republican House members are expected to challenge Democratic Senators. Senator John Breaux, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he would be content with a successful holding action. ''If we keep what we have, we'll be in good shape for '92,'' he said.
Republican ambitions for the House are tempered by history. Ed Rollins, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, noted that no sitting President's party has gained seats in the House in a midterm election since the Democrats did it in 1934 under Roosevelt. Moreover, the re-election rate in the House is about 98 percent, and Democrats currently outnumber Republicans 258 to 175. Still, Republican Party leaders say they hope to lay some groundwork this year for ending the Democrats' 36 years of dominance in the House.
''Obviously, the big opportunity will come in 1992,'' Mr. Rollins said. ''You've probably got 70 or 80 open seats that year with members retiring and the creation of new seats.'' The battles for those seats will be fought largely on terms set in the Congressional redistricting, which has customarily been used to further partisan goals. Democrats hold sway in 29 of the 37 states where both houses of the legislature are controlled by one party.
Demographic changes will make this new round of redistricting all the more contested. Population growth in the West and the South, particularly in California, Florida and Texas, will result in additional Sun Belt Congressional seats. The Northeast and Midwest, long considered part of the Democratic base, will lose about 18 seats, party officials estimate.
Gubernatorial races in California, Florida and Texas are nearly always hotly contested, and the stakes for redistricting will make them all the more so this year. The Georgia race will also be closely watched: former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta is hoping to become the second black to be elected a governor. In Massachusetts, the woes of retiring Gov. Michael S. Dukakis have created new opportunities for Republicans.
 
No Presidential Coattails
President Bush currently is soaring in the public opinion polls, but Republicans say they learned from Ronald Reagan that the coattails of a popular President are not long. An Administration official said that the party hopes to use Mr. Bush for ''operational'' support -raising money and boosting volunteers' morale.
Few experts care to predict what issues will be important in November. ''The politics of this country has changed dramatically,'' said Ron Brown, the Democratic National Chairman. Not many had expected that support for legalized abortion, for example, would be a political plus in 1989. This year, who knows?
Some experts say the campaigns will reflect an increasing voter skepticism toward government. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker, said, ''I think 1990 is going to be a year when a lot of incumbents are going to try to separate themselves from the institution, saying they're different from everything that's going on.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
China Seeks Respectability, But Painlessly

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
DENG XIAOPING is gambling again. The 85-year-old Chinese leader, who has proved an astute political oddsmaker, is betting that by ending martial law Beijing will reap economic and diplomatic benefits without risking further unrest.
Avoiding new turmoil is crucial, and the hope here is that foreigners will take the lifting of martial law, announced last week, more seriously than will the Chinese. It seems that the action is an effort to expunge some trappings of repression without ending the repression itself. 
China's leaders had hoped for a more enthusiastic response abroad. True, the Bush Administration agreed - on the very day of the announcement, although it said there was no connection - to allow World Bank loans for relief after earthquakes and other calamities. President Bush had earlier sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on two missions to Beijing, and the Administration suggested that the lifting of martial law was a dividend. But Japan has said that it wants to see further liberalization before resuming negotiations on a $5 billion loan package. In Washington, Congress may well vote for new sanctions against China after convening later this month.
China's leaders had hoped for a more enthusiastic response abroad. Martial law and the bloody victory over the democracy movement last June carried with it tremendous costs. The Bush Administration's overtures notwithstanding, the Government has become a virtual pariah in the world. The sharp drop in tourism and foreign investment has hurt the economy and risks sparking further unrest. And the military presence during martial law deepened the hostility of many Chinese toward the Government.
Army troops remain in the capital, and the police have been ordered to intervene at the first sign of trouble. Unauthorized demonstrations are still illegal. On Tiananmen Square, even speaking loudly is an offense.
Until last May, the Communist Party might have gained some popular support with political liberalization, many Chinese intellectuals and foreign scholars say. While in Eastern Europe, Communist parties were generally reviled as Soviet-installed instruments of oppression and stagnation, the Chinese party still had a modest reservoir of good will based on its successes in the 1950's in reorganizing society and reviving the economy, as well as on the more recent economic boom of the early 1980's.
 
The Path Not Taken
Some young party officials here believe that when the leadership came to the crossroads last May and June, it could have chosen greater pluralism over violent repression. They say that if China had held elections, partly free, partly rigged, as in Taiwan and many developing countries, the Communist Party could have relied upon rural support to win.
But even these party members say that the Communists have so outraged the country over the last nine months that liberalization will be far more complex and dangerous than ever before. A famous pop singer, Hou Dejian, who has some protection because of his fame and Taiwanese origins, put it this way: ''In Eastern Europe, the regimes sacrificed one or two persons and protected the whole party. China was the opposite. China sacrificed the whole party and government to protect one or two persons.''
Economic pressures are crucial in this respect. A year ago, many Chinese were upset about inflation. Now inflation has been tamed, but unemployment and slow growth have emerged to make people more upset than ever.
Industrial output grew by only 6.8 percent in 1989, the Government announced last week, down from 17.7 percent growth the previous year. More alarming, most of the growth came early in the year; in the last quarter, industrial output grew only seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Because of a tight monetary policy, rising debts and a shortage of energy and raw materials, countless factories have been closed across the country - up to 8 percent of factories in some cities, the Government spokesman acknowledged. The Chinese people as a whole may not have seen their real standard of living drop, but they certainly have fallen far behind their expectations of continued improvement.
By late last year, the Government seemed to realize the political risk of further austerity, and monetary policy was sharply relaxed, though this may mean a resurgence of inflation later in 1990. The authorities also disclosed that all workers at state-owned enterprises will get a wage increase by the Chinese New Year holiday later this month.
It is not clear that the lifting of martial law will bring many of the expected economic benefits. Foreign business executives interviewed last week said that the move by itself made relatively little difference, and that economic prospects and the investment climate remain inauspicious. Tourism will improve, but is expected to remain subdued.
Most Chinese seem to believe that the party will try to consolidate its position through economic relaxation - a move intended to improve its popularity on pocketbook issues - while maintaining political controls that remain as strict as ever. But Chinese officials and foreign diplomats interviewed also maintain that hostility to the leadership is so great, particularly in cities and even within the party itself, that the hard-liners will be taking considerable risks if they try to rely on anything but the barrel of a gun.
Significantly, while the end of martial law brought no immediate economic benefits, it did ignite some minor political incidents. In several cases reported Thursday and Friday, people were hauled away from Tiananmen Square after shouting slogans or trying to present wreaths to honor the dead.
 
'When the Overthrow Will Come'
''Everybody is talking about when the overthrow will come,'' said a Government official. His own prediction is that it will take 10 years, but he acknowledged that his guess is unusually conservative. When asked, most people say two to five years will be enough. They do not so much forecast the end of socialism in China as simply a shift to a more moderate set of economic and political policies, probably under new Communist leaders. They see the changes coming either because of new street demonstrations or from a military coup or a power struggle within the Communist Party.
As the Government tries to heal the wounds of June and win a measure of support, it is stressing ''political study'' sessions intended to show that, as a huge billboard proclaims in the center of Beijing: ''Only socialism can save China. Only socialism can make China develop.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Finally, Amtrak Looks Like a Way To Run a Business

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
FOR most of its 19 years, Amtrak has been regarded as a kind of lost cause. Its trains were derided as unreliable, its service and food as primitive and its budget as a drain on the Federal treasury. But the national railroad appears, at last, to be moving in the right direction.
Revenues and service have shown a slow but substantial improvement. Passenger complaints are down. And the reliance on Federal money has steadily declined. Fares and other revenues now account for 72 cents of every dollar spent by Amtrak, up from only 40 cents in 1980. 
Last week, after Amtrak reported record income of $1.3 billion for 1989, W. Graham Claytor Jr., the system's president, even predicted that Amtrak might be able to cover all of its operating costs, something that no national railroad system in the world does now, by the year 2000.
Even critics of the railroad say they have been impressed. ''Three years ago, I would have said they never would have made it,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, the conservative public policy institute that has opposed the Federal subsidies. ''I say, hats off to Mr. Claytor and other folks at Amtrak. They have really turned that railroad around.''
Amtrak, or the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, was created by Congress to take over the nation's failing passenger lines. Slowly, the managers of this patched-together network improved service, overhauled the reservation and ticketing system, advertised aggressively and undertook tough cost controls.
Indeed, Amtrak's major obstacle in recent years has been its inability to meet demand. While ridership in 1988 reached an all-time high of 21.5 million, gains have come slowly because the system is at or near capacity. Because the overworked fleet does not have enough cars and equipment, breakdowns are frequent.
While the Transportation Department tries to shape a new national transportation policy, Amtrak's success has given added credibility to those who say that trains must be part of any plan. Advocacy groups like the National Association of Railroad Passengers say the Federal Government needs to make a long-term commitment to passenger railroads and enable Amtrak to introduce new technology.
Over all, inter-city trains still account for only a small fraction, probably less than 5 percent, of the Amer ican transportation market.
But in some areas, trains play a much larger role. In the Northeast corridor, where Amtrak carries more than 11 million passengers annually - accounting for more than half of Amtrak's total ridership -trains are competitive, even essential. On many legs of the Washington-to-Boston corridor, flying is not even an alternative.
Mr. Claytor and others predict that Amtrak can become more competitive in other congested corridors, including some in California and the Midwest. With growing airport congestion, high-speed rail travel is seen as a sensible alternative on medium-distance routes, like those between Detroit and Chicago or Miami and Orlando. And while long-distance trains will never compete seriously with airplanes, they are potentially profitable. With improvements in service and equipment, some of Amtrak's most impressive gains in recent years have come on its overnight trains, especially popular with vacationers. First-class space on such trains is sold out months in advance of peak travel seasons.
At issue in the debate over transportation policy is the need for taxpayer dollars. If Mr. Claytor is going to see Amtrak break even by the year 2000, he says, he will need to hold down costs, including increasing demands from Amtrak workers, and count on Federal subsidies to cover anticipated operating losses. Last year, the Federal subsidy was $584 million.
More important, he said, he was counting on Congress to make investments in the equipment and technology needed to increase the speed and frequency of some trains and expand routes. At a minimum, he says, Amtrak needs $100 million a year in new investments, about half of which must come from Congress. He hopes to borrow the balance on the private market.
Last year, Congress granted Amtrak $80 million for capital spending, beyond its operating subsidy. In addition, the railroad privately financed about 100 new cars for routes in the Middle West.
Over the next decade, Mr. Claytor said he hopes to introduce new technology that will substantially improve service. One innovation will be ''tilt trains,'' which maintain speed and comfort on curves by leaning into them. By putting tilt trains, which are now operating in Canada and Spain, on the route between New York and Boston, for example, Amtrak hopes to reduce a trip that is now four hours and 20 minutes to less than three hours.
In addition, before the year 2000, Mr. Claytor also hopes that a train powered by magnetic levitation will be operating as a demonstration project on a short route. The technology, which is being tested in West Germany and Japan, enables a train to ride suspended on a magnetic cushion, about a half inch above an elevated magnetic track. It is then propelled at high speed by a traveling magnetic field created by current in the rail. Mr. Claytor's plans stop short of the high-speed technology of Japan's bullet trains or France's Train a Grande Vitesse, which approach 200 miles an hour. So far, the private sector is not convinced there is any return in such expensive technology, which costs more than $20 million a mile. And the Federal Government clearly cannot pay.
 
Less to Come
Those limits were pointedly stated last week by Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who said that less rather than more Federal money would be available for transportation in coming years. Instead, he said, state and local governments are going to have to pay more.
Amtrak has already received support from state governments, including Michigan and Alabama, which are subsidizing operations and rebuilding roadbeds used by Amtrak.
Mr. Moore of the Heritage Foundation says the necessary limit on Federal subsidies also suggests another alternative - turning over at least some Amtrak routes to private enterprise, as conservative theorists have urged for years.
If Mr. Claytor and his colleagues at Amtrak have managed to do as well as they have, said Mr. Moore, ''imagine what Donald Trump could do with passenger service on the Northeast corridor.''
But for time being, Mr. Claytor is going to keep looking to his friends in Congress for continued support. That's where he can make use of his most effective argument: train routes that cross hundreds of Congressional districts.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Nation Tries to Decide How to Recall Martin Luther King

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE nation will honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. tomorrow, the holiday that marks his birth 61 years ago. But increasingly, the holiday is becoming a time when his admirers ponder not just the meaning of his life, but also the more delicate question of how best to carry on his work 22 years after his death.
This year, the celebration carries the burdens, passions and ambiguities of a work in progress. After a bitter battle over his memory and growing despair in the black communities whose aspirations he symbolized, Dr. King's legacy remains incomplete. 
The holiday symbolizes the civil rights era in the South and the man who more than anyone else is identified with its achievements. But many of his admirers see a legacy that is more complicated, including a focus on economic issues that was well ahead of its time.
Dr. King was honored in a week of ceremonies at the center that carries his name here and at the White House, where President Bush said, ''We have not finished the work of making Martin Luther King's dream a reality for each child in America: that one day they would live in a nation where they would be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.''
 
Popular Misconceptions
But to some, the King now remembered is a sanitized version of the King who changed history. The Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, senior pastor of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem and formerly the chief administrator of Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said all but lost in the popular notion of the man is his concern about economic inequality.
''When we left Birmingham, he said we would never make any major breakthroughs against racism until there was a fairer distribution of the wealth,'' Mr. Walker said. ''I contend anyone who is comfortable with the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. has missed his meaning and his message.'' Julian Bond, the civil rights figure who is now a visiting professor of African-American studies at Harvard, said: ''In some ways, we've smoothed Dr. King down. We don't remember King the critic of capitalism. We don't remember King the critic of imperialism. All we remember is the racial peacemaker, the black-and-white-together man.''
Some of the passions surrounding the man surround his holiday. White supremacist groups mark it with marches reviling him. In Arizona, conservatives led a petition drive that forced suspension of the King holiday, pending a popular vote in November.
But if the most visible controversies are caused by white opponents, the most painful may be among black supporters.
The civil rights leadership found itself in an ugly feud last summer when the Rev. Ralph Abernathy's autobiography repeated reports that Dr. King had extramarital affairs. Part of the furor reflected feelings of betrayal and disagreements with his account of the night before Dr. King's death. But some feel it also reflected the degree to which Dr. King's memory has become inviolate. Mr. Abernathy's charge that many of Dr. King's followers have become more attuned to preserving his name than perpetuating his work struck a note heard among blacks, often privately and seldom in public.
''I think we've become King-dependent,'' Mr. Bond said. ''We've invested so much hope in him or in a second coming of Martin Luther King that it becomes paralyzing.''
Adding to the complexity is the question of whether the tactics used against Bull Connor in Birmingham in the 1960's can be as successful today.
''We're not arguing the customer side of the lunch counter,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. ''We're arguing the cash register side: not who can check into the hotel, but who has the means and who owns it. That's a far more complicated issue than where you sit on the bus.''
Still, this year the King holiday also brings renewed grounds for hope.
 
Example for the World
''Czechoslovakia and Rumania, Poland and Tiananmen Square - all of that is Dr. King's philosophy of nonviolent mass protest,'' said Mr. Walker. ''I fear the involuntary racism of America will not allow it to make the connection with the nonviolent mass protest of Dr. King because he was black.''
For others, the day is a time to reflect on the changes he brought to the nation and to rededicate themselves to his work.
''If not for Dr. King, I don't know what would have happened to the American South,'' said Representative John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat who was an ally of Dr. King. ''We could have become like Northern Ireland, like Lebanon - not to the same degree, perhaps, but we would have been a much more divided region and a more divided nation.''
That does not make Dr. King sacrosanct, he said, but it makes him an extraordinary actor in American history, all the more so because he acted from no elected seat and with no power other than moral suasion.
''He was a man, a human being, flesh and blood,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''but he preached a message of hope and optimism that says to all of us that an individual can rise up and inspire an entire generation, an entire nation.''

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
If They've Won, Can Conservatives Still Be Important?

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE transformations sweeping Eastern Europe have reverberated through the institutes and offices, the meeting rooms and magazines that, for the past decade or so, have made up the most influential body of American political thought: conservatism. The echoes, in fact, are the sound of a victory chorus, even if the conservatives' detractors do not believe they should be the only ones to celebrate.
Naturally enough, conservatives believe that the extraordinary collapse of Communism in Europe has vindicated their most important beliefs about foreign policy. Or, as Burton Y. Pines, the vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy group in Washington, put it, ''We've won, and we won more extensively, more dramatically and more quickly than anybody could have imagined.'' 
In the conservatives' view, it was they and not apologetic liberals who bore the true message about the evils of Communism, a message that the people of the Soviet bloc are now for the first time free to proclaim themselves. For years these theorists argued that Communism was both threatening and bankrupt. If it is suddenly less threatening, they say, that is because of American wariness and military strength.
But what now? Has the agenda proclaimed by the coalition of forces that made up American conservatism lost its purpose now that its chief foreign policy enemy has been vanquished? Will the movement survive? And, if it does, what will be its issues in the future?
Perhaps the ultimate question is whether there is really something fundamental that sets American conservatism apart from other political philosophies. Put another way: is the movement, particularly in the powerful form it took in recent years, something permanent, or is it merely a phenomenon of an age when almost everybody sensed a common danger from the Soviet Union?
Some commentators have already seen what the essayist Charles Krauthammer has called ''the conservative crackup.'' The idea here is that the Soviet threat was the cement that held the movement together. Without it, the theory goes, it will disintegrate into a large number of factions.
 
Looking Within
The conservatives themselves agree that the time has come for introspection and re-evaluation. A few even concede that in some areas of American life, there may be no need for a specifically conservative agenda. In foreign policy, for example, some leaders on the right predict a return to the consensus they believe existed before the Vietnam War. Yet, with the many strains of conservatism no longer united by anti-Communism, it is difficult to see exactly what a unifying domestic agenda might be.
Some conservatives fervently believe that the movement has always been centered on national concerns, and if the foreign policy gap between East and West has narrowed, they will simply return to the domestic issues: government bureaucracy, the welfare state, the erosion of moral and educational standards.
But others are not sure that is possible. With the great icon, Ronald Reagan, no longer in office, and the Communist threat reduced, they see factionalism as not only possible but likely.
At the same time, the old liberal-conservative quarrel remains. If the conservatives have declared victory on the ideological battleground, others would like to deprive them of it. Some commentators, like Strobe Talbott of Time magazine, have argued that the collapse of the Soviet bloc is not at all the fruit of conservative policies but of Communism's inherent weaknesses.
Some contend that it was the cold-warriorism of the conservatives, their hawkish hostility to the Soviet Union, that gave rise to East-West tensions in the first place. And even those who blame the Soviets, rather than the Americans, for the cold war, refuse to give the conservatives credit for its end. Foreign policy, they say, has always been a good deal more bipartisan than the right admits.
The immediate response of some conservatives has been to taunt the liberals for being bad losers. ''Who, after all, has been most loudly proclaiming the superiority of capitalism?'' they ask. ''Who led the moral charge against the evident odiousness of Communism?''
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the Reagan representative to the United Nations and perhaps that Administration's most influential foreign policy theorist, gives Mr. Reagan credit in two important areas.
''One was the confident reaffirmation of the case for free institutions,'' she said in an interview. ''And two, I think that the restoration of American military strength, occurring as it did with the stagnation of the Soviet economy, really dramatized and illustrated for Gorbachev the problems in that country of technology and the economic base.''
While celebrating Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and his decision not to intervene in his neighbors' affairs, conservatives have been more cautious than liberals in assessing his prospects for success. Needless Concessions? Columnists like William Safire of The New York Times and William F. Buckley, publisher of the National Review, have warned about two things: making needless concessions to the Soviets in the hope of helping Gorbachev succeed in reforming the Communist system, and letting down the American military guard too hastily.
''The complacent community is inhaling every fresh dandelion within the Soviet empire as a reason to diminish our defense forces,'' Mr. Buckley wrote. ''But although it can be said that by all the evidence, Communism has failed, it can't yet be said that the aggressive potential of the Soviet Union has evaporated.''
And so the debate continues, but some conservatives say the issues are far more matters of nuance and degree than of fundamental difference. Some, like the columnist Patrick Buchanan, who have generally favored increased military spending, are already saying that the time has arrived to pare down military spending. It is a common misconception, conservatives like to argue, that they want a big Pentagon, no matter what. Saving money on the military would be a desirable ''peace dividend,'' they say, if the Soviet military threat has been genuinely reduced.
''The right in America is a mixture of very different strands,'' said Michael Joyce, president of the Bradley Foundation, a conservative group in Wisconsin. ''One thing that has been common to all of these factions -the Chicago School, the neo-conservatives, the National Review religious conservatives, the old South types - was a common revulsion of totalitarian regimes. So that to the extent that this great massive totalitarian system is in self-destruction, you could say that will accentuate the differences.''
Mr. Pines of the Heritage Foundation, by contrast, denies that anti-Communism was ever the real conservative cement.
''What created the conservative juggernaut were by and large domestic issues - abortion, falling standards, inflation, a stagnating economy and the growth of the bureaucracy,'' he said. ''There are going to be different parts of the movement thinking different things and having different priorities. But by and large if some of our energies are freed up to focus on the domestic arena, we're going to hold our coalition together.''

Silicon Valley Is Changing Programs

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif.

 BODY:
SILICON VALLEY, where it once seemed growth had no limits, is in the midst of a midlife crisis. Faced with fierce Japanese competition and a market for personal computers that is growing more slowly than the industry's early visionaries predicted, high technology has lost some of its luster. If boom times are to return, the valley's engineers and entrepreneurs will have to find ways to make the personal computer cheaper, more powerful and portable enough to live up to its name.
Remember the predictions of the early 1980's? By now computers were supposed to be as ubiquitous as telephone answering machines and microwave ovens - the gadget that no one could do without. But except for those who needed a machine for word processing or spreadsheet calculations, the personal computer turned out to be an expensive toy. It was easier to keep track of household finances with a checkbook and to file recipes on three-by-five cards. 
Many companies tried to expand sales by catering to businesses and developing more powerful and expensive machines called work stations. But even that market became saturated more quickly than the optimists expected.
Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. both had disappointing years in 1989. Although neither company is losing money, it is clear that the 20 percent annual growth rates they once experienced are a thing of the past.
The slowdown in Silicon Valley mirrors a similar malaise for the nation's largest computer makers. Late last year, the chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, John Akers, gloomily predicted that growth in the industry as a whole would hover around 7 percent in the future.
One view from Wall Street suggests that the days of open-ended growth for American high technology are over for good. A Morgan Stanley economist, Stephen S. Roach, said that capital spending on information technology accounted for 40 percent of the growth of total spending on business equipment between the mid-1970's and the mid-1980's. But now that percentage is flat, even declining slightly last year. It seems that companies generally have all the computer equipment they need. At the same time foreign competition has greatly reduced domestic market share.
If the computer industry is to revitalize itself, it will have to come up with ways to appeal to people who have had no reason to buy a personal computer or who need enormous incentives to justify upgrading the systems they already have. There are reasons for optimism. The driving force of technology here, the ability to double every few years the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a sliver of silicon, has shown no sign of pausing. The Intel Corporation introduced a microprocessor with more than a million transistors last year, a watershed indicating that desktop computers can soon match the complexity of the most powerful mainframes. The same is true for magnetic storage devices, also pioneered in Silicon Valley. I.B.M. researchers in San Jose said recently that they had succeeded in squeezing a billion bits of information onto a square inch of storage space.
At each of these technological plateaus new products and even new industries are made possible. While Japanese competitors continue to make inroads into the personal computer market, new Silicon Valley companies like Agilis Inc., the Poquet Computer Corporation, Momenta Inc. and the Go Corporation are all trying to redefine the personal computer. Go, for example, will soon introduce a portable notepad computer without a keyboard. Information will be written instead on an electronic pad. The idea behind such a machine is to open computing to a broader class of users, including those who don't type.
Agilis has an even more radical idea. Its mobile computer introduced last year is in constant communication with its home base via a radio link. Poquet and Atari are offering pocket-size computers that can run spreadsheet programs and other software that once required a desktop machine.
If these companies and others succeed they will likely transform computing in the next decade. The computer will no longer be chained to a desk. It will be something people have with them constantly, more like a watch or an appointment calendar.
As personal computers become more personal, few of them will actually be manufactured in Silicon Valley. State-of-the-art factories like those Steve Jobs created to build his Macintosh and Next computers are the exception today. Instead the valley is serving as a combined development laboratory, design center and corporate administration site. In a global economy manufacturing is relocated close to the markets it serves.
The advance of technology has meant the demise of the garage inventor, the heart of Silicon Valley's mythology. Computer design today is done seated at a powerful computer work station. But that hasn't ended the role of the individual designer. Powerful tools and custom computer chips permitted Sun Microsystems to build its new Sparcstation 1 work station with far fewer designers and more quickly than was possible with earlier models.
The challenge today for Silicon Valley is to see if it can reinvent itself once again.

HEADLINE: Cold Warriors, From A to Z

 BODY:
Ever since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, neoconservatives and other hard-liners have strained to find new rationales for old cold war animosities. It hasn't been easy. Mr. Gorbachev doesn't fit the mold of Soviet leaders with his political and economic reforms, his unilateral force reductions, his freeing of Eastern Europe, his willingness to reveal the lies of his predecessors and now his statement that a multiparty system in his own country would not be a ''tragedy.''
Even so, the hard-liners have persisted in their suspicions, looking for intellectual support wherever they could find it. Some of them now embrace the argument advanced by a writer known only as ''Z,'' in Daedalus, journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and recently excerpted on the Op-Ed page. But in so doing, they commit two sins of omission. 
One is that, like Z, they oversimplify the likely paths to the future. The other is that they pay scant attention to Z's own policy recommendations.
The neocons and hard-liners have long felt that no Soviet leader could be trusted, and that Americans should not be duped into unilateral disarmament. When Mr. Gorbachev first spoke of reforms, they charged that he was all talk and no action. When he began to act, they insisted that more action was needed. When he delivered far more than anyone would have predicted, they found comfort within the Bush Administration and its early do-nothing policy self-described as ''status quo plus.''
Lawrence Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, talked about the turmoil Gorbachev policies were creating in Europe and seemed to pine over the loss of cold war stability and certainties. Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser, argued in effect that Mr. Gorbachev wasn't worth helping because his reforms would fail and he'd be thrown out of office.
Secretary of State Baker scotched much of this talk by saying it was in America's interest to help Mr. Gorbachev succeed. And President Bush, after the Malta summit meeting, pledged to press ahead with arms control and Soviet-American trade to help Mr. Gorbachev ''keep going forward.''
That left the hard-liners groping for a new intellectual underpinning, a new line of attack. Some of them, at least, found it in the article by Z. Z argues that if Mr. Gorbachev's goal is to strengthen the Communist system through reform, he cannot succeed. The ''system cannot be restructured or reformed . . . On this score, Mr. Gorbachev is beyond our help'' . . . Helping him would only ''prolong the agony.''
If, rather, Mr. Gorbachev seeks gradually to transform his party dictatorship and command economy into a democracy and market economy, Z says he can't be believed. He ''clearly does not intend'' to liquidate Communist Party rule, asserts Z, and thus should not be helped to maintain it.
Thus, through this simple rhetorical device, Z defines away policy choice. Why isn't Mr. Gorbachev to be believed? Because, Z says, Soviet Communists would never relinquish power. But as he now illustrates anew in Lithuania, Mr. Gorbachev has already taken initiative after unimaginable initiative, weakening the party's power.
And even if he doesn't desire Western-style democracy and capitalism, perhaps he is searching. Perhaps he isn't even sure exactly what kind of system he wants and is mainly groping for what will work.
In any event, his actions matter far more than his supposed goals. And his actions offer the soundest test for Western support - whether he continues to allow, even encourage, political and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. These are the very steps the West has demanded for 40 years. Hard-liners, neocons and Z skirt this issue. And they also duck the critical fact that the likely alternatives to Mr. Gorbachev would be far worse for Western interests.
Then, Z, unlike most hard-liners and neocons, seems to see that his analysis leads only to a policy dead end and alters course. Z writes that whatever the intentions of Mr. Gorbachev or his successors, the Communist regime is ''dwindling away,'' and here ''Western help could play a constructive role.''
Z then goes on to urge what Western liberals and moderates have been urging all along - arms control and cooperative arrangements to develop market structures and joint economic ventures in the Soviet Union. Thus, in the end, even Z seems to understand that there is no serious alternative to helping Mikhail Gorbachev. The neocons and hard-liners still miss the point.

HEADLINE: Who's Left, Who's Right in Post-Wall Europe?;
The Failed Experiment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a visitor from Britain, I am growing tired of the complacent tone that marks most reporting and comment on the remarkable events in Eastern Europe. Those who see those events as the final triumph of the American ideals of capitalism, democracy and freedom should pause to take a look, first, at what is really happening in those countries and, second, at whether ''democracy and freedom'' are really alive and kicking at home.
As for the triumph of capitalism, the widespread assumption that the people of Eastern Europe have embraced capitalism is fallacious. They have thrown off a repressive and totalitarian regime, which set a low premium on human dignity. No doubt this rejection will also include a rejection of the centrally planned economy. But as any European or Scandinavian social democrat or democratic socialist will tell you, an economic system that recognizes the importance of the market in appropriate spheres is a far cry from the free market utopia that is generally the American understanding of capitalism. It seems far more likely that Eastern Europe will follow the Western European or Scandinavian model than the American. 
As for whether the United States is today the best exemplar of democracy and freedom, you are right to observe (''Human Rights: Now the Hard Part,'' editorial, Dec. 30) that the recent struggle ''owes much to America's history and ideals.'' So indeed did the postwar international human rights movement, inspired by your Constitution's protections of fundamental rights and freedoms. But at the end of a dark decade for liberty and progressiveness at home, those values and ideals appear, regrettably, to have passed into American history.
Recent decisions of the Supreme Court retrenching on the hard-won gains of the civil rights movemment, threatening to remove a woman's reproductive autonomy, failing to guarantee respect for the private conduct of homosexual adults, would today inspire no United Nations Declaration or European Convention, other than as examples of the sorts of failures to guarantee fundamental freedoms to guard against.
A society in which the ''liberal'' label has become the pejorative ''L-word''; in which membership in the American Civil Liberties Union is used as a smear in a Presidential campaign, and in which lies and corruption in the highest places are widely tolerated, is a society sufficiently dislocated from its former commitment to make complacency about liberty unjustified and hypocritical.
Those in Eastern Europe and elsewhere who have courageously risked their lives to gain a say in how their countries should be run would surely not wish to choose as their model democratic society one in which less than half the electorate bothers to vote, while millions are consigned to the hopelessness of poverty, homelessness, drugs and crime. The idealistic mood in those countries would be appalled at the high level of toleration of outrageous suffering in this ''free and democratic'' nation. Where, they would ask, did it go wrong; how can democracy ever lead to that?
So, before rushing to celebrate the victory and vindication of the ''American experiment,'' Americans should take a closer look at their own society. Perhaps the best lesson they can offer the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe is to insure that the people there remain ever vigilant against the tragic ways in which such noble ideals and values can be corrupted.

Chronology Of Betrayal

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
This is the chronology of the American betrayal of the struggle for freedom in China. It is worth studying. There is still a chance to recover some of America's honor.
PUB-DATE: June 4, 1989:
June 20: President Bush orders some mild sanctions against China. He says any high-level contacts with the murderers of Beijing are suspended until they acknowledge the validity of the demonstrators' aspirations.
Early July: Exact date still secret. Mr. Bush sends a high-level mission to China but keeps that fact hidden.
July-November: More executions. New waves of arrests, closing in tighter on student leaders who had escaped; purging of officials who had shown any sympathy with them.
Nov. 30: Mr. Bush vetoes an act of Congress, passed without opposition in the House and Senate, to guarantee that Chinese students now in this country would not be forced to return to China as long as they were in danger.
Dec. 9: A top-level mission is sent publicly to Beijing. Warm exchanges of toasts with the men who ordered the murders. Administration refuses to say whether other secret missions were sent to China.
Dec. 10-24: Mr. Bush says some sanctions will be lifted. Brushes aside protests from Republican and Democratic members of Congress.
Administration makes it plain that it expects gestures from Chinese Communists before Congress reconvenes to try to override the President's veto.
Jan. 2-8, 1990: American organizations like the International League for Human Rights provide information detailing arrests and executions, which have continued since the June murders.
Chinese students say at least 10,000 demonstrators are still in jail, beg Mr. Bush to demand their release.
Chinese Communists denounce Eastern European revolutions, show even stronger determination not to loosen their own control.
Jan. 10: Chinese Communists, as predicted, announce lifting of martial law in Beijing - not in any other place where it was imposed publicly or secretly.
Many soldiers transferred to police force, which now numbers more than l.5 million in addition to army about twice that size. Laws allowing arrests without explanation, secret trials, executions, indefinite detention without trial, forced labor, press control, brutal student ''re-education'' camps - all still on the books and recently made even harsher.
Denunciation of ''lifting'' of martial law as meaningless cosmetic trick comes from all over the world. In Washington, the President orders steps to permit World Bank loans to Chinese Communists.
Jan. 11: Mr. Bush hails the Chinese Communists for taking a ''very sound step.'' Washington reports possible repeals of other sanctions. That is the chronology so far. In the last days of the 1980's the Bush Administration deserted the struggle for freedom in China. Whatever the reasons - outdated, stale geopolitics and Mr. Bush's misplaced confidence that he really ''knows'' China best -the Administration picked the wrong China, the China of the oppressors over the China of the oppressed.
In the first days of the 1990's it did something almost as bad - it made a fool of itself. It said that a contemptuous piece of cynical playacting by the murderers of Beijing was a step toward freedom.
Now here is a date for the future:
On Jan. 24, the day after it reconvenes, Congress will try to override Mr. Bush's veto of the bill to protect Chinese students in the United States.
This was always important, to help the students. Now it has taken on profound political significance.
An override would signal to the entire world that at least the legislative branch of the United States Government remains on the side of the freedom fighters of China. It would be an act of hope and loyalty for the Chinese and the freedom movements still struggling in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Override of a veto requires a two-thirds majority. The White House is working hard to persuade Republicans who voted for the bill to vote against an override.
Between today and the date of that vote, every American can get in touch with his or her representative and senator and urge them to vote against the veto and for the people of China.
This will give us all a chance to take part in the chronology of Chinese-American history and wipe away part of the stain.

West German Youth Hostels
Q. My husband and I are planning a trip to West Germany in March and intend to stay in youth hostels. Has the recent influx of East Germans made it difficult to secure accommodations? - V. O., Springfield, Mass.
A. Many of the 537 hostels and guesthouses serving young people in West Germany are housing visitors and settlers from East Germany and other Eastern European countries, according to the country's hostel association. There is no list of which hostels take resettlers, the association said, as the decision to do so was made locally. However, most hostels and low-cost guesthouses that have been taking in Eastern Europeans have also set aside space for tourists. So it is a good idea to reserve early as space will be more limited than usual. The country code for telephoning West Germany is 49. 
The owner of a low-cost guesthouse in Hamburg (Jugendgastehaus, 100 Rennbornstrasse, 2000 Hamburg 74; 40-6511671) said he was reserving a quarter of his rooms for resettlers and leaving the rest for tourists.
In Nuremberg the guesthouse (Jugendgasthaus, 2 Auf der Burg, 8500 Nuremberg 1; 911-221024) is not saving rooms especially for tourists but will accept early reservations. In West Berlin, the youth hostel (48 Hermsdorfer Damm, 1000 Berlin 28; 30-4041610) and two guesthouses, Gasthaus Berlin (3 Luckstrasse, 1000 West Berlin; 30-8032034) and Gasthaus Wannsee (1 Badeweg, 1000 West Berlin 38; 30-8032034), are not taking in resettlers. However, the head of the youth hostel recommends making reservations as early as possible, as he expects a flood of visitors.
Information about West German youth hostels can be obtained from Deutsches Jugendherhbergwer, 8 Bismarckstrasse, 4930 Detmold 1; 5321-74010.
 
Art Deco Hotels in Miami
Q. I am interested in spending a week in the Art Deco district of Miami Beach this winter. Please provide information on renovated beachfront hotels in the area. - J. W., New York, N.Y.
A. The chief concentration of Art Deco hotels (among some 800 other buildings in the style) is in South Beach, on the southern tip of the island on which Miami is situated. There are several renovated Deco hotels along Ocean Drive, a milelong two-lane street along the beach. The hotel rates given here are for the least expensive rooms, which often do not have an ocean view. The mailing address of all the hotels is Miami, Fla. 33139.
The Avalon (700 Ocean Drive; 305-538-0133) has 61 rooms, starting at $75. The Majestic, a Deco hotel across the street, will finish renovation in mid-February and open under the same managment.
The Leslie (1244 Ocean Drive) and the Cardozo (1300 Ocean Drive) can be reached at 800-338-9076 or 305-534-2135). Both are managed by the Art Deco Hotels Group, as is the Cavalier (1320 Ocean Drive; 800-338-9076 or 305-531-6424). All have no more than 50 rooms. The Leslie's rooms start at $80, including breakfast, and the Cardozo's $95, no breakfast. Rooms at the Cavalier start at $95, with breakfast.
The Carlyle (1250 Ocean Drive), an outstanding Deco structure, is now an office building but has a restaurant, the Carlyle Grill (305-534-2135).
The Clevelander (1020 Ocean Drive; 305-531-3485) has 65 rooms starting at $50, plus an outdoor and indoor bar and a pool.
The Edison (960 Ocean Drive; 800-237-3522 or 305-531-0461) has 62 rooms starting at $75, a pool and two restaurants. A community center across the street blocks the view from the first and second floors.
Park Central (640 Ocean Drive; 305-538-1611) has 80 rooms starting at $75 and a restaurant.
The Waldorf Towers (860 Ocean Drive; 305-531-7684) has 45 rooms from $90 and a restaurant.
For an informed look at the local architecture, the Miami Design Preservation League (661 Washington Avenue; 305-672-2014) offers a 90-minute walking tour every Saturday at 10:30 A.M.; a $5 contribution is asked.
 
London Bucket Shops
Q. I used a bucket shop called the Late Traveler in the West End of London in 1979, specializing in last-minute flights out of England. I cannot find it. Do you know of similar shops? - R. B. F., Freehold, N.J.
A. London has several agencies, called bucket shops, that buy unused spaces on planes and travel packages and sell them to the public at a discount. The Late Traveler still exists, with its main branch in Croydon, at 78A High Street; telephone 686 0460. Its London office is called Dial A Flight, Hobbs Court, 2 Jacob Street, London SE1; 334 0995. The country code for England is 44 and the city code for London is 1. Other agencies specializing in plane tickets:
Trailfinders, 42-48 Earls Court Road, London W8; telephone 937 5400 (trans-Atlantic and European flights); 938 3366 (other flights); 938 3444 (first and business class).
S.T.A. Travel, 74 and 86 Old Brompton Road, London SW7, and 117 Euston Road, London NW1; 937 9971 (North American flights); 937 9921 (European); 937 9962 (other).
Orion Travel, Fifth Floor, Morley House, 320 Regent Street, London W1; 580 3751. Travel Bazaar, 221 Westbourne Park Road, London W11; 221 6095. The Air Travel Advisory Bureau (Morley House, 320 Regent Street, London W1; 636 5000) is a service that says it finds the cheapest flights available from bucket shops.
For more agencies that offer cheap flights, visitors to London can refer to the classified pages of the weekly magazine Time Out.
 
New Zealand Jewish Tour
Q. I hear there is a tour to New Zealand that covers Jewish history. Do you know anything about it? - M. S., New York, N.Y.
A. The American Jewish Congress organizes a 21-day tour called New Zealand: Jewish Discovery. The tour takes in much of the standard sites on the North and South Islands. However, the leader, Odeda Rosenthal, author of ''Not Strictly Kosher: Pioneer Jews in England,'' discusses the history of the Jewish population, which in New Zealand dates to 1840. Participants have Sabbath dinner at homes of Jewish Aucklanders and, for those who wish, attend synagogue there, and, in Wellington, they meet Shmuel Ovnat, Israel's Ambassador to New Zealand. The tour costs $3,690 a person in double occupancy, and includes economy-class air fare from New York, lodging and 31 meals, including full breakfast daily. Information: American Jewish Congress, Travel Department, 15 East 84th Street, New York, N.Y. 10028; 800-221-4694 or 212-879-4588.

HEADLINE: SHOPPER'S WORLD;
An Array of Spices in Istanbul

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE; MARVINE HOWE, a reporter for the metropolitan desk of The Times, was a correspondent in Turkey.

 BODY:
IF you walk along the right bank of the Golden Horn through the maze of street vendors, porters and all kinds of vehicles, then turn south just opposite the Galata Bridge, you enter a world of pungent Oriental spices, medicinal herbs and essences, some very familiar, others quite unfathomable.
The grand 17th-century domed building on Eminonu Square is Istanbul's Spice Bazaar, called Misir Carsisi, which can mean either Egyptian market or corn market. The busy square has been a marketplace since the days of Venetian and Genoese traders, and at one time, corn was sold there. And during the Ottoman Empire, Egypt served as the main entrepot for goods from the East, which were then dispatched to Istanbul, seat of the imperial court. The bazaar was built in 1657 by the mother of Sultan Mehmet IV, Valide Sultan Turhan Hatice, founder of the handsome Yeni Cami, or New Mosque, nearby. Rents from the shops in the bazaar went toward financing the mosque.
Leaving the harsh glare and hubbub of the square and going into the Spice Bazaar is something like entering a vast cathedral. As you walk in the cool air of the central aisle you are enveloped in a soft, filtered light and a heady blend of fragrances. On either side are vaulted niches; you almost expect to see statues of saints instead of the brightly lighted shops. 
The Spice Bazaar is like some giant specialty store, where you can find all kinds of Turkish products that make wonderful gifts. Many visitors find the long L-shaped building easier to get around and far less exhausting than the legendary Covered Bazaar with its 4,000 shops.
Along the narrow corridors of the Spice Bazaar are mounds of dried apricots, pistachios, hazelnuts and almonds, selling for a fraction of their cost in the United States. Huge trays contain mild white cheeses, spicy sausages and honey-sweet lokum, the candy paste known as Turkish delight. Nonfood items include everything from basketware to gold jewelry.
Above all, this is the best place in town to find spices and herbs singly and in exotic combinations. In front of small numbered shops stand great bags of anise, cumin, saffron, cinnamon bark. Shelves are lined with bottles of hibiscus flower, sumac and rose-pepper as well as more familiar seasonings like ginger, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. Tucked away in dusty drawers or in ancient bottles are all kinds of mysterious plants for different ailments. In most of the tiny establishments, every inch of floor and wall space is used, and some products like branches of dried herbs and garlands of sponges dangle from the ceiling.
What seems to be the best seller these days is something called the Aphrodisiac of Sultans. This concoction has 41 spices and herbs including honey, nutmeg, cream of tartar, clove, cinnamon and saffron. People believe that besides its aphrodisiac qualities, it fortifies the blood, alleviates pain and protects against snake and insect bites. Some people eat it spread on bread like jam but taking it straight is advised for the best effect. A 12-ounce bottle costs between $2.10 and $3.15, at 1,908 Turkish liras to the dollar. (Inflation is running very high in Turkey, and prices are changing constantly.) Actually, the aphrodisiac is a popular version of a medicinal paste called Manisa Mesir Macunu, which can be found in some of the shops. This paste comes from Manisa, near Izmir, and dates to the early part of the 16th century. At that time, Suleyman the Magnificent, who later became sultan, was governor of Manisa. His mother, Hafsa Sultan, fell gravely ill, and the head of the Manisa Hospital put together a special paste of 41 herbs and spices that cured her. The sultan's mother proclaimed the miraculous paste should be distributed free to all who wanted it. From that time on, the paste, in small chunks like soft candy, has been distributed free from the Sultan's Mosque during the Mesir festival on the third or last Sunday in March.
Unlike in most Oriental markets, prices in the Spice Market are displayed on almost all goods. This practice seems to discourage bargaining - although it undoubtedly goes on. Shopkeepers sometimes offer free samples of spices to entice prospective clients.
At No. 7 Ayfer Kaur, spices and herbs are generally sold loose by weight. For example, 100 grams (about three and a half ounces) of paprika is priced at about 60 cents; 100 grams of curry, $1; 50 grams of oregano, 60 cents; 50 grams of vanilla sticks, $2.10; 100 grams of ginger powder, $2.10. A bottle of 300 grams of mixed herbs and spices for salad dressing costs $1.50; a spice mix to be used with fish is $2.10 for 100 grams. A gift package of eight small bottles of different condiments including mint, saffron, sumac, cumin black pepper, sweet pepper, rosemary and paprika sells for about $4.
No. 41 Erdal Bahrat, opened in 1927, is the oldest shop in the Spice Bazaar, according to its manager, who is generally known as Ali Bey. He says Turks buy mostly black and red pepper, mint, thyme, cumin and allspice, which are used in stuffed vegetable dishes. Also popular are orange-flower water and rose water, used in puddings. And much in demand are different herbs for tea; garden sage, supposed to be good for the digestion and nerves; linden flowers good for colds, and camomile flowers as a laxative.
Foreigners are partial to saffron, says Ali Bey, who warns that there are all kinds of saffron for all kinds of prices. Spanish saffron, which he does not carry, is weaker and cheaper than its Eastern counterparts. Indian saffron powder costs $1.10 for 100 grams, but the most highly prized saffron is the flower from Iran, 5 grams for $3.75.
In the back of the shop recently, amid large jars of medicinal plants and bottles of rose oil, paraffin and natural dyes, a group of Libyans were buying what looked like chunks of wood. Ali Bey explained that it was incense and they were taking it back to be burned in mosques.
Nearby is No. 51 Ucuzcular Spices and Food Company, which Dilaver Kadioglu says has been in his family for four generations. He sells spices, natural dyes, musks and oils as well as many medicinal plants and mysterious mixtures. One popular mix is called Bronchit, said to cure bronchitis and other respiratory ailments. It is made of nine spices and flowers including clove, cinnamon flower, jasmine flower and orange flower. There are also several concoctions, whose composition is a secret. One combination of natural fats and herb extracts is supposed to cure rheumatism.
About half of the market is devoted to spices and herbs. The other shops seem to deal on a small scale in almost everything found in the Covered Bazaar except carpets. Several shops display shoes and slippers made of good Turkish leather but generally lacking in flair. Other shops offer attractive soft leather handbags priced less than you would pay for plastic in the United States.
Some merchants specialize in household linens - towels and tablecloths of good Turkish cotton, wool blankets and embroidered mats and towels. Some carry children's clothing.
In one area, the bazaar has been invaded by high tech. Shelves are piled high with electronic calculators and stereo equipment. But better bargains can be had in discount stores in Manhattan.
For a quick snack, the busy shopper can always try one of the stand-up kebab bars in the market. But if there's time, Pandeli, upstairs in the Spice Bazaar, is a good spot for lunch. The upper rooms used to serve as the office of the cadi, or Islamic judge, until an earthquake left the place in ruins about 100 years ago, according to Christis Tsobanoglu, who is the manager of Pandeli.
''Istanbul is between Europe and Asia and has a temperate climate, so the cuisine is lighter and not so spicy as nearby cooking,'' Mr. Tsobanoglu says.
At Pandeli, as in most Turkish restaurants, a diner could probably be satisfied with just the meze, or hors d'oeuvres, and in fact many Turks stop at that point. You can start with chilled vine leaves stuffed with rice and onion, sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with fresh dill, mint and parsley, cinnamon and allspice, at $2.35. A must is the borek, crisp flaky pastry filled with white cheese and seasoned with chopped parsley, dill and nutmeg, for $1.60. As an entree, try sis kebap, grilled cubes of lamb or beef marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, thyme, pepper and grated onion, for $3.70. The entree specialty of the house is fresh swordfish marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, paprika and onion juice and grilled with bay leaves, green peppers and tomatoes, for $6.80 a serving.
Probably the best place to get to know the delights of Turkish cuisine and its panoply of spices and herbs is the Konyali Saray, inside Topkapi Palace. In the fourth court of the palace, behind the mosque, is the Konyali restaurant, looking out over the Bosphorus. At the entrance, there is a lineup of grand bottles containing spices and herbs used by the sultans and still gracing the fare in Topkapi.
NURETTIN DOGANBEY, who also manages the smaller - and even better - Konayli restaurant near the Sirkeci railway station, says that his cooks still use more than 50 different spices and herbs but points out that the Ottoman cooks used four times as many. ''McDonald's and television are changing Turkish tastes,'' he says.
Mr. Doganbey recounts how the Turkic nomads came from Central Asia, early in the 11th century, bringing with them spices and herbs accumulated from their travels in China, India and the Caucasus. In Anatolia, they found a wide variety of local spices and herbs and abundant fresh meat, fish and vegetables.
Under the Ottoman sultans, the use of fresh herbs and spices was developed into an art form, which spread to the villages. It is said that the common cook could tell by the taste of mint leaves on which side of the mountain they were grown, and would sometimes mix the sunny-side mint with the shady to get the right flavor.
Neset Eren, the author of ''The Delights of Turkish Cooking.'' (Redhouse Press), which is widely available in Turkey, says that Turkish cuisine is characterized by ''fresh herbs and discreet spices that don't overwhelm you.'' In the introduction to her book, she writes that her family home, on a hill overlooing the Bosporus, was headquarters of the Bektashi order of dervishes. She recalls the huge kitchen fireplace and the walls lined with shelves of countless jars of jams, herbs and spices and how at the age of 5, she used to go with the cooks to pick thyme, oregano, and dandelions on the hills around Istanbul.
She also tells the story of the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, who visited Sultan Abdulaziz and fell in love with Topkapi Palace's specialty, eggplant puree. The sultan agreed to allow his chef to show the Empress's cook how to prepare the delicacy. But the Turkish chef refused to give his French colleague the recipe, saying, ''An imperial chef cooks with his feelings, his eyes, his nose.'' Today the delicate eggplant dish, hunkar begendi, meaning royalty liked it, has become a national favorite and is found on most menus.

HEADLINE: KASPAROV BEATS DEEP THOUGHT

BYLINE: By Brad Leithauser: Brad Leithauser is the author of the novel ''Hence,'' coming out in paperback in March from Penguin. He is on the editorial board of Book-of-the-Month Club.

 BODY:
IN A CROWDED AUDITORIUM, THE CHAMPION hunches over a chessboard. He is surrounded by cameramen. Taking refuge in himself, he pillows his jaw in his hands. He is thinking hard in order to make himself think harder. His opponent, also a champion, is some 300 miles away, pondering the next move, engaged in calculations on a scale too colossal for anyone in the audience to grasp.
The first champion, Gary Kasparov, is considered by many aficionados the greatest genius the game has seen. He became world champion by defeating his Soviet countryman Anatoly Karpov in the fall of 1985. Twenty-two at the time, Kasparov was the youngest person ever to gain the title.
The second champion, Deep Thought, is a good deal younger: roughly two years old. Deep Thought is a computer. It usually plays its games by telephone hookup. In the spring of 1989, it defeated all comers at the Sixth World Computer Chess Championship, held in Edmonton, Alberta. Deep Thought is, far and away, the fastest chess machine yet devised. 
The two-game match between the champions, which took place in New York City on Oct. 22, 1989, was designed to illuminate just where, at the highest levels, human chess and computer chess intersect. The mere existence of the match is, in a sense, a victory for the computer. Before the advent of Deep Thought, no machine had been developed that might challenge a human world champion. In the rapidly evolving relationship between people and their machines, this match is an acknowledgment of a new, and inherently short-lived, state - one of essential parity on the board.
On the day when computers begin to dominate the greatest human players - an inevitability - they will do so forever. If, taking an overview of the game, we regard the set of all human chess players as a single, collective organism, we see that this is a ''life form'' driven toward self-betterment: it ventures into new territory, tests and retests its hypotheses, pools its knowledge. But its rate of improvement simply cannot keep up with computers, whose progress is measured exponentially. In 1986, the fastest computer was looking at roughly 150,000 different chess positions per second. Deep Thought examines about 1,500,000. Machines that evaluate 10 million, even a hundred million positions per second may not be far off. Some computer scientists are now predicting that within another three to five years, machines will have ranged so far beyond our capabilities that a confrontation between human and computer world champions would be boringly one-sided.
ON THE DAY BEFORE THE MATCH, I GO OUT for coffee with a group of chess devotees that includes Murray Campbell and Feng-hsiung Hsu, two of the chief architects of Deep Thought. Although physically a study in contrasts - Campbell is lanky and neat, Hsu compact and disheveled - the two scientists have a lot in common. Campbell, who grew up in Alberta, Canada, is 32; Hsu, born in Taiwan, is 30. Both earned doctorates in computer science at Carnegie-Mellon in Pittsburgh, where Deep Thought is located, and both have recently become researchers at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, 40 miles outside New York City. They are working exclusively at the moment on chess computers.
They also share, on the eve of the match, a no-lose situation. Because Deep Thought is a decided underdog they needn't worry whether it will win or draw either game; two defeats, provided it plays solidly, would suit them just fine. Whatever happens, they are already looking ahead to a new machine, which they hope to develop within two or three years, and which Campbell predicts will represent a ''significant leap forward.'' Their primary worry is that some bug in the program will spring up, in poltergeist fashion, to make them appear ridiculous.
But the question remains - is even one draw feasible? Campbell sets the odds at 1 in 10. Because Deep Thought never gets discouraged, it can play marvelously tenacious chess when in trouble, often sneaking into an improbable draw - what Campbell calls its ''weasel phenomenon.'' Unlike the other members of the Deep Thought team, Campbell used to play competitive chess, which gives him a privileged insight into Deep Thought's ''behavior'' (Continued on Page 54) and enables him, through the machine, to attack far stronger opponents than he could on his own.
The business of predicting chess outcomes is greatly facilitated by an international rating scheme called the FIDE system, based upon performance in sanctioned tournaments. Deep Thought's rating would be approximately 2450-2500, which places it among the top 30 players in the country. Kasparov's rating, recently elevated to about 2800, is the highest in the history of ratings - he has exceeded even Bobby Fischer in his prime. Uncertainties arise, however, when a machine rather than a person is being evaluated. Deep Thought has achieved some signal victories, including one over the Danish veteran Bent Larsen, once a contender for world champion. But how much were these the product of intrinsic prowess, and how much of human jitteriness before a radically unfamiliar opponent? Of course Kasparov is not immune to nerves, either. There is nothing to say he won't find himself rattled by a machine adversary and play far below strength - in which case, Deep Thought could finesse the odds and seize a victory. ''I'll tell you one thing,'' says a member of our party: ''If Deep Thought wins the first game, there won't be a second game. Gary will refuse to play.''
The two-game match takes place at the New York Academy of Art, an unexpectedly appropriate site for a chess contest. Much of the artwork on display in the academy's auditorium depicts fragments of the human body: Here are drawings and sculptures of a hand, a torso, a head. The effect is a view of humanity as an assemblage of component parts - just the perspective fostered by the match. For we can see this encounter as a contest of mind versus mind, the two antagonists unburdened of bodily limitations. Chess has a physical side, naturally. At the championship level, mental demands are so exorbitant that only the fit of body are likely to stand up under them. Kasparov is an avid sportsman who enjoys tennis, soccer and long-distance swimming. Yet the game's physical dimension is something chess players are always working to overcome. (Continued on Page 58) It is a commonplace of chess literature that the advance toward mastery involves a process of neutralizing one's surroundings. The better the player, the less aware he'll be of his environment - a freedom rendered dramatically manifest whenever experts play multiple or blindfold games. Even a middling chess player may catch inklings of a state of mind in which the corporeal is transcended.
Ironically, this exalted state resembles the ''mind-set'' from which a computer commences play. It ''listens'' only to its own mathematical language of evaluation. It has no idea that the game involves actual pieces. In fact, it has no idea that it is playing a game. In many ways, Deep Thought looks like chess apotheosized: a show of skill enacted on a plane purified of such distractions as lighting and noise, mood and personality, victory and defeat.
Deep Thought may be a long shot, but going into the first game it has three sizable advantages. Under the terms of the match, photographers and camera crews will be allowed free reign during the first eight minutes, which obviously cannot disturb Deep Thought but may rattle Kasparov; the machine has been assigned White in Game One and Black in Game Two, and so will have the first move to begin with; and each side will be allowed only 90 minutes in all. Since this is a fraction of the time allotted in an ordinary tournament game, Kasparov might find such an irregularity unsettling.
The game begins; Kasparov hunches under the popping lights. He is a darkly good-looking man, the only child of a Jewish father, who died when the boy was 7, and an Armenian mother. His is a face that was made for brooding. Within moments he is very deep in thought.
In sharp contrast Hsu, who sits across from Kasparov, maintains a relaxed demeanor behind his computer keyboard. At this point, his job is largely secretarial: a matter of recording moves and serving as a liaison between Kasparov and Deep Thought. Concentration for Kasparov is not to be equated with immobility, and as time wears on he ranges through an impressive variety of gestures. He shrugs his shoulders, pops his knuckles, drums his fingers, scratches his forehead, chews his nails, clenches his jaw; and yet, for all this activity, the game unfolds quietly. What becomes evident after 18 or so moves to the best players - and there are a number of grandmasters present - can be seen by almost everyone a dozen moves later: Kasparov has wrested control of the game. Deep Thought - in the person of Hsu - resigns on the 53d move.
Before resting up for the second game, Kasparov briefly addresses the crowd upstairs. He is clearly in high spirits. His talk is exultant to the point of grandiosity. ''I can't visualize living with the knowledge that a computer is stronger than the human mind,'' he says; to challenge the machine is to ''protect the human race.''
ONE MIGHT SIMPLY ATTRIBUTE such remarks to the monomania of champions in almost any field; but this would fail to explain the sympathetic hearing they receive. Perhaps the deepest impression left by the first game is of the audience's partisan fervor. Deep Thought is disliked. Upstairs, where talking is permitted, its play is treated to scorn and condescension from the start. And as Kasparov begins to crush the machine, the crowd's contempt turns into catcalls, laughter, hoots of incredulous contempt. There is something both appealingly loyal and disturbingly delusive about this response. The simple truth is that Deep Thought could squelch all but a tiny handful of the chess fanatics assembled here. So why is the audience so worked up? In part, it's a matter of simple identification with a hero; people would feel many of the same tensions if Kasparov's opponent were a human being. But the match engages the spectator on another level as well, roping in even those few who (like some of the photographers) scarcely know how the pieces move. For everyone understands winning and losing.
Not that chess is like other games. Whoever wins at pinball or Asteroids or Nintendo has gained a qualified victory, one undermined by the certainty that it arises only through the machine's ''mercy.'' No one doubts that a pinball machine or video game could be constructed against which the human hand and eye would flounder. Chess is different. At present, it may provide the only activity in the world in which an all-out struggle between man and machine is a fair fight. In chess, the best human beings and the best machines possess capabilities both similar enough to allow meaningful competition and diverse enough to insure that the outcome is not a foregone conclusion. Their battle recalls Roman gladiatorial days, when a lively asymmetry was achieved by equipping one combatant with net and trident and the other with sword and shield.
The question the chessboard continually poses, for both man and machine, is a straightforward one: What is my strongest move? Yet if they pursue the same end, they go about it in radically divergent ways. Given the brain's relative slowness, a man can scrutinize no more than an infinitesimal fraction of the moves available at any juncture. In the typical case, his decision is bifurcated: He will first determine, by a somewhat mysterious process called intuition, a small number of plausible candidates for the optimal move - perhaps as few as two - and then study these possibilities at great depth, narrowing his choice from the few to the one. A machine like Deep Thought, conversely, will look at every possible move - however unlikely or even transparently inane many of these may be. This process of exhaustive investigation is called a ''brute force'' search, as opposed to an intuition-simulating ''selective'' search.
Partly because intuition has eluded machines, and partly because it represents an area of the psyche especially difficult to describe or categorize, many chess players have seen in it a final, impregnable defense against the incursions of the machine. Kasparov said as much a few years ago: ''If a computer can beat the world champion, the computer can read the best books in the world, can write the best plays, and can know everything about history and literature and people. That's impossible.'' About 10 years ago, when even the best computers were fodder to a grandmaster, a study was carried out in which many top international players estimated the proficiency that computers might eventually achieve. Despite variations in expertise, a consistent pattern emerged: respondents tended to envision computers reaching a level of play about 50 points below (Continued on Page 65) their own. Such results no doubt reflect a characteristic need among highly competitive people to assert their superiority. But they probably also reflect a heartfelt conviction that chess, when carried out at the highest and most rigorous levels, is so shaped by inexplicable promptings - by creative or mystical or artistic impulses - that a mere machine could never master it.
In fact, computer ratings have continued to go up. Each time computers have crossed a new threshold, various chess experts have speculated that some sort of natural ceiling had been reached and that without human intuition they could not climb much higher. But computers have steadily shown that mere acceleration may be a satisfactory substitute. The human realm - a realm supposedly inaccessible to machines - turns out to be more vulnerable than we thought. In years to come, the descendants of machines like Deep Thought will doubtless compel us to examine the nature and importance of human intuition. The rise of the chess computer conclusively demonstrates that at least for those tasks in which a narrowly defined objective is formulable (as in chess, where every goal is subordinate to checkmating your opponent), and in which all possible lines of behavior can be charted (every contingency in chess can be set out in a simple, if astronomically vast, diagram), intuition may be a useful but expendable tool. To be able to scan all possibilities on a chess board, you don't need to be smart in the usual sense. You can be dumb, in fact, provided you're fast - blindingly, electronically fast. Deep Thought makes us ask, What next? Which areas in our lives, in our ''history and literature and people,'' might prove accessible to the brute force of a monster number-cruncher?
 PLAYING WHITE IN THE second and final game, Kasparov lashes out fiercely. He plays a Queen's Gambit, in which White offers its queen's bishop pawn in exchange for a firm position on the board's center; and when Deep Thought accepts the pawn, Kasparov advances his king's pawn two spaces - an aggressive line. By the 10th move, with the game still theoretically in its preliminary stages, Kasparov has managed to do something to Deep Thought that no one has ever done: made it look silly. His forces are powerfully posted; Deep Thought has just gotten started. The game is essentially over before it has begun.
Kasparov handles a microphone with much the same assurance he brings to his chess moves; in his brief victory speech, he notes that the computer still has ''a lot to learn,'' including ''how to resign.'' His closing lines are graceful and ingratiating: ''When playing versus a human being there's energy going between us. Today I was puzzled because I felt no opponent, no energy - kind of like a black hole, into which my energy could disappear. But I discovered a new source of energy, from the audience to me, and I thank you very much for this enormous energy supply.''
In the next day or two, most newspaper accounts of the match will present an upbeat report on Deep Thought's performance - acknowledging Kasparov's easy triumph but predicting that in a few years' time the outcome may be different. On the night of the match, though, feelings are a good deal less sanguine - at least among those closest to the machines. Summing up the match, Campbell explains to a circle of journalists: ''This was a very clear demonstration of one of the weaknesses of the program. We'd seen glimpses of it before, but this was an exceptionally clear and well-conceived exhibit of Deep Thought's lack of long-range planning. It's a huge problem.''
After the match I talk with Monty Newborn, a professor of computer science at McGill University, and Hans Berliner of Carnegie-Mellon. One reads so frequently that computer science is still a discipline in its infancy that it comes as something of an illumination to talk with men who measure their research not in terms of months and years but of decades. Newborn is 51 and has been active in the field for 20 years. Berliner is 60. In addition to chess programming, he designed a backgammon-playing computer - which defeated the human world champion in 1979. These days, he is a designer of Hitech, after Deep Thought the world's strongest chess computer. Berliner probably has no peer in the world when it comes to a dual grasp of chess theory and of the technicalities of computer-chess programming - and tonight he comes away disheartened. He has long been an optimist about chess computers. When I met him, in 1986, he foresaw equality in five years.
Things look different tonight. ''I really expected to see Deep Thought get at least one draw,'' he admits, and adds that he certainly hadn't expected to see Kasparov win so effortlessly. Kasparov simply saw farther, ''much, much farther,'' than the machine. And while Berliner says he would still bet that a serious machine challenger will appear in three or four years, he recognizes that the existing hardware is limited, and he allows the possibility that man will ''still be master at the end of the century.''
I MEET KASPAROV AND his business manager, an Englishman named Andrew (Continued on Page 74) Page, for breakfast on the morning after the match. (Kasparov's business interests are large and, in the days of glasnost, growing. In addition to his substantial fees - the $10,000 he received for battling Deep Thought is said to be typical - he has endorsed a chess computer and Schweppes tonic water.) A first encounter with the world champion comes as something of a surprise. In view of the stereotype of the chess genius as an insular eccentric, he seems unexpectedly normal. One might even say disappointingly normal, since the notion dies hard that chess achievement of his magnitude is purchased only at the cost of a diminished aptitude for daily life. That a world chess champion could present himself as witty and engaging and intellectually broad - as Kasparov does - seems patently unfair.
''I am a man of many interests,'' he acknowledges. Last summer he gave an interview to Playboy in which he tossed out blistering condemnations of Soviet economic policy, social policy, the unreliability of the media and pre-glasnost mores (''Intellectual life was frozen, and sexual life, too''). Clearly proud of his openness, Kasparov relishes the chance to speak out broadly, and confesses that a future in politics ''may be inevitable.'' All the more curious, then, is his unwillingness to entertain hypothetical questions about his chess career. When I ask what he might have become if chess had never been invented, he counters with, ''But it was.'' What would have happened if he'd lost a sixth game to Karpov in their first encounter? ''But I didn't.'' And if the computer had defeated him yesterday? ''Oh, it couldn't.''
It seems peculiar that a man who makes his living by exploring unfollowed contingencies - roads not taken - should resist such hypotheticals, but Kasparov has strong feelings about Fate. ''I was fated to be world champion,'' he explains, with an odd but characteristic mixture of forcefulness and merriment. ''You ask would I eventually have become champion anyway, if I'd lost a sixth game to Karpov? But you see, I was fated not to lose a sixth game.'' The thought amuses him enormously.
Did the pressure ever get to him? Any trouble sleeping before a match? ''Andrew should answer that one,'' he replies, and calls across the table, ''Do I have trouble sleeping before a match?'' ''Oh, he has a problem sleeping all right,'' Andrew reports. ''Put him on a sofa for five minutes, or in a taxi, or in an armchair, and he falls asleep. It's a terrible problem.'' Both men laugh. They have every reason for feeling ebullient this morning. Yesterday's match has brought Kasparov more attention than any event since the last world championship. He's on the front page of every newspaper they've seen so far. He scans the articles with good-humored interest. One quotation, from Murray Campbell, particularly delights him: ''Deep Thought didn't get a chance to show what it can do.'' Kasparov reads this aloud. ''But that's exactly the point!'' he exclaims. ''I didn't let it. The highest art of the chess player lies in not allowing your opponent to show you what he can do.''
AT THE MOMENT , Kasparov reigns over the board as no one has for decades. Karpov, his predecessor as world champion, shared his crown with a ghost - that of the notoriously temperamental Bobby Fischer, from whom Karpov received it by default. None of the postwar champions who predated Fischer was ever more than first among equals. Looking back, one has to go a long way to find a suitable counterpart to Kasparov; looking forward, one may find none at all. At 26, he could plausibly hold his title for 10 or 15 more years - by which point even conservative computer scientists expect to see machines surpass the best human players. He reigns without peer, human or mechanical - a privilege that none of his successors may ever know.
The arrival of an unbeatable machine will hardly be a death knell to human players. The game will go on as before; there will still be human tournaments, flush with all the anguish and exultation of old. But psychology at the uppermost echelons will be irreversibly altered. Not even the world champion will be allowed a sense of untrammeled superiority. Kasparov is perhaps the last of a kind.
The new machines will represent triumphs of human doggedness and ingenuity, and we owe it to ourselves to acclaim their makers. But we also owe it to ourselves to grasp that within the transitional terrain we have now entered, where machines rapidly close in upon the human world champion, something inspiring is passing away. If we have reached the last world champion to whose name no asterisk is attached - the one who was champion of all and everything - it is heartening that this should prove to be Gary Kasparov. For he is a man who has not only climbed Everest but stood on its summit as though he belonged there.

THE JEWS OF VIENNA IN THE AGE OF FRANZ JOSEPH
By Robert S. Wistrich.
Illustrated. 696 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $79.
Americans and Western Europeans have been fascinated with the art and culture of Vienna for a decade, and there have been many books written about the old Hapsburg capital. But Robert Wistrich's exemplary scholarly analysis of the Viennese Jewish community in the 19th century is the first well-written, reliable study of its kind. It is devoid of the cloying sentimentality and tendentiousness that characterize most writings on Vienna and the Jews, and it provides a vital corrective to our understanding of the Viennese fin de siecle. Although the book closes with a sensitive discussion of how their Jewish identity influenced certain of the Viennese who were seminal in the development of 20th-century culture (Karl Kraus, Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig and Joseph Roth), most of it is devoted to aspects of Viennese Jewish life that have been overlooked. 
At the outset, Mr. Wistrich, who teaches history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, documents the stunning growth of Vienna's Jewish population. Between 1860 and 1910, primarily through migration from Bohemia, Moravia and Galicia, the number of Jews grew from 6,000 to over 175,000 - from just over 1 percent of the city's population to 9 percent. During this time the three leading Viennese rabbis - Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Adolf Jellinek and Moritz Gudemann - created and sustained a particular and quite Viennese synthesis of Jewish orthodoxy, secular Western learning and Austro-German patriotism. This accommodation set the tone for the posture of pride and patriotism assumed by most Viennese Jews towards the Hapsburg monarchy and Vienna. Socialism and Zionism caught the imaginations of some younger people at the turn of the century, but most Viennese Jews remained true Hapsburg loyalists, supporters of the crown and of the ideal of a multinational constitutional monarchy.
Within the Jewish community, the tremendous immigration from other parts of the empire and the rapid increase in the number of Jews who acquired wealth produced strains. The established community leadership would not democratize Jewish organizations to accommodate the new, mostly poor, immigrants. And the new rich did not sustain the historic tie between Jews and progressive politics. Thus, when strident popular anti-Semitism arose in the city's cultural and political life in the 1880's and 90's, the Jewish leadership had no influence or power in the new mass politics; it clung to its conservative, outdated brand of liberalism.
Mr. Wistrich gives elegant portraits of the crucial Jewish figures of the new Viennese politics at the turn of the century, including, of course, Theodor Herzl. Nathan Birnbaum was the gifted but eclectic and erratic Jewish politician who coined the term ''Zionism'' but later broke with Herzl, abandoning political Zionism to champion - as did Martin Buber and Joseph Roth - the Yiddish culture of the shtetl. Joseph Bloch was a maverick politician, journalist and Orthodox eastern European rabbi who challenged the official Jewish leadership and organized an aggressive strategy of self-help among middle-class Jews against the rising tide of Viennese anti-Semitism in the 80's. Bloch used the courts successfully to defeat slanderous misrepresentations of the Talmud by such Catholic leaders as the Rev. August Rohling and to fight recurrent accusations of Jewish ritual murder in parts of the empire.
Throughout ''The Jews of Vienna in the Age of Franz Joseph'' Mr. Wistrich places the history of this one group in the context of the history of Jews in all the German-speaking countries, and of contemporary economic and political changes in central Europe. In the last third of the century, Jews rose rapidly in commerce and culture. Those who played a leading role in Vienna had lived there relatively briefly; most of the key Jewish figures in the city in 1900 had not been born there. The profound acculturation and assimilation of Jews, and the striking assumption of leadership by Jews in the professions, the arts, journalism and science, despite powerful restrictive barriers, are tributes to the Jews and to the dynamism of the opportunity they encountered.
At the beginning of the 19th century, anti-Semitism was common among Viennese aristocrats, but a gradual process of Jewish emancipation was already under way. And throughout the century the multinational Hapsburg empire, more than any other continental European power, offered a paternalistic, if not benign, context in which both separatist Jewish culture and assimilation could flourish. However, by 1900 the triumph of radical social and political anti-Semitism (despite the overt resistance of the Emperor Franz Joseph), particularly among the middle classes in Vienna, reflected new economic and social pressures exacerbated by industrialization and the strident conflict of nationalities within the empire. Anti-Semitism emerged as a virulent racist prejudice, justified by a political ideology directed at eradicating the ills of capitalism, liberalism and modernity. The successful identification, in Viennese politics, of the Jews with these presumed sources of all social, moral and political evil provided an explosive political formula that would serve later as a model for the Nazis.
Mr. Wistrich's focus on the internal history of the highly diversified Jewish community enables him to reconstruct the attitudes of Jewish university students and to chronicle the evolution of various Jewish nationalist movements in Vienna before and after Zionism, particularly the first Jewish national fraternity, the Kadimah. He analyzes effectively the genesis of Herzl's Zionism from within the Viennese context. Although his sympathies for Zionism are clear, he is respectful of Jewish critics of Zionism. What is refreshing in his narrative is the absence of retrospective critical moralizing about assimilation and the remarkable participation of Jews in German culture. Assimilated Jewish aristocrats and intellectuals, even Jews who converted to Christianity, are presented with as much evenhandedness as those Viennese Jewish nationalists and traditionalist theologians whose mistrust of assimilation and acculturation as reliable defenses against prejudice seems to have been vindicated by the Holocaust.
''The Jews of Vienna in the Age of Franz Joseph'' is not merely a descriptive history of Viennese Jewry. It vindicates the centrality of Jewishness and anti-Semitism as dynamic and changing forces in the evolution of 19th-century Austro-German politics and culture. Czechs, Poles, Slovenes, Hungarians and Germans in the Hapsburg realm shared a scapegoat, the Jews, for their economic, political and cultural frustrations. Viennese Jews, in turn, whatever their psychological or social strategy toward the Jewish question, could never forget or avoid the issue.
Our current attraction to Vienna at the turn of the century - to its legendary mix of intellectual and esthetic radicalism, antiliberal pessimism and decadent behavior - may reflect only our fear that we too live in a culture in decline. Mr. Wistrich's book stimulates some different reflections.
As America and its large cities confront a growing ethnic diversity in which color remains the dominant basis for racial discrimination, we need to understand how Europe in the 19th century failed to deal successfully with its central racial prejudice, that against the Jews. The influence of anti-Semitism on social structure, political ideology and the history of ideas before 1914 was so central that anti-Semitism still retains a remarkable hold on the populations of central and Eastern Europe - even where there are no Jews left. The recent revolutionary political events there, including the explosion of nationalist sentiment - combined as they are with the call for freedom and democracy - should not obscure nationalism's nasty side.
This book reminds one that a century ago there were people in Vienna who idealized diaspora Jewry as the harbinger of a civilized world free of nationalistic strife, violence and racial prejudice. And it provides a framework in which to evaluate the dramatic shift in the international appraisal of Judaism and Zionism not only during the past century, but since the establishment of Israel in 1948. When Herzl proposed a Jewish state in 1896, some of the Viennese Jews worried that embracing Zionism would cost the Jews their diaspora heritage of spirituality, reason, humanism and cosmopolitanism that resulted from their having no homeland. The existence now of Jews as ordinary citizens of a modern Jewish nation, and the the rise of Israeli nationalism, throw a new light on that ideal; one might conceive nostalgia for it. The book can also alert us to a modern anti-Zionism that is no more than a thinly veiled variation of fin de siecle anti-Semitism.
And it speaks to people who are concerned with the issues of Jewish assimilation and identity in the United States. The large and successful Viennese Jewish community struggled with conflicting notions of Jewish identity - as a citizen with merely a different religion, a secular member of a separate nation and race, or an assimilated citizen with only a different ancestry. The modern quarrel among Jews about who is a Jew and whether assimilation is desirable or even possible can be compared usefully with the varieties of Jewish responses Mr. Wistrich chronicles for Vienna. It is clear that neither Herzl nor Karl Kraus (an extreme assimilationist and convert) nor the anti-Zionist religious Orthodox Jews of Vienna were right, in the light of history. The acculturated Viennese Jew who had contempt for the shtetl Jew from Galicia had no more claim to be on the side of historical progress than did the Orthodox Viennese Jew who regarded the leading Jewish figures of Viennese science, culture and art - such as Kraus, Arnold Schoenberg or Gustav Mahler - as self-deluded apostates.
Mr. Wistrich's poignant narrative reminds us that the struggle for civic equality, social acceptance and economic security by the Jews of 19th-century Vienna resulted, among other things, in a steady stream of diverse and unforgettable contributions to art, science and culture. The symbiosis of Jews and Austro-German culture in Vienna produced convincing exemplars of genuine cosmopolitanism and refined secular culture committed to the power of knowledge, the sanctity of art and language and the possibilities of universal tolerance and political equality. Two crucial personalities who came out of the Jewish population of Vienna - Freud and Ludwig Wittgenstein - were motivated, in part, by contradictions within the dominant liberal Viennese Jewish credo. They inspired much of our own century's engagement with the issues of meaning, language and truth. Even if the hopes implicit in the political and social struggle of the Jews of Vienna before 1914 were dashed finally by the violence of Nazism, Mr. Wistrich's book is a moving reminder of what high hopes they were.
 
'THE ISRAELITES ARE GOOD PATRIOTS'
 To the civil patriotism which had become the bedrock of post-emancipation Judaism throughout Europe, Austrian Jews added the dimension of unshakeable dynastic loyalty and devotion, which grew into a veritable cult. . . . This imperial patriotism was nourished from the pulpit, in the Jewish press, at public gatherings, and on commemorative occasions. The imperial-royal loyalty of the Jews stood moreover in sharp contrast to the centrifugal forces of Slavic nationalism and feudal particularism. Most significant of all, the civil religion of dynastic patriotism became a central feature in the defence strategy of the Jewish establishment, threatened as it was after 1880 by the new force of organized political anti-Semitism. . . . In 1882, when the Austrian anti-Semitic movement was celebrating its first Jew-baiting orgy, the Emperor had indeed declared to his Ministers: ''I will tolerate no Judenhetze [Jew-baiting] in my Empire.'' . . . Franz Joseph I increasingly appeared to Austrian Jews as their guardian angel, custodian, and patron saint. . . . By the 1880s it must be said that the darkening situation of Austrian Jews had begun to encourage a more positive view of the Habsburgs as uniquely benevolent custodians and patrons of Jewry, under whose blessed sceptre they had always enjoyed protection against medieval blood-libels, clerical fanaticism, and mob rule. Franz Joseph I now became, in Jewish eyes, an inheritor of this gracious, merciful, and benign Habsburg tradition, a monarch who outshone not only his illustrious predecessors but also all contemporary princely rulers of Europe in his respect for religious tolerance and justice.

DANIEL DEFOE
His Life.
By Paula R. Backscheider.
Illustrated. 671 pp. Baltimore:
The Johns Hopkins University Press. $29.95.
Today biographers often know too much about their subjects, at least for their own comfort. The major figures of history have left abundant records of their being - in journals, letters or confessional statements in their art. So we admire one biographer for her tactful abridgment of this, another for his discreet avoidance of that, and a third for squeezing the whole of Henry James into four volumes. 
It is not like that with Daniel Defoe. He lived such a shifty subterranean life that many of the basic facts have still to be established. His letters are mostly confined to one period of his life and they never mention his best-known books, like ''Robinson Crusoe'' and ''Moll Flanders''; they are almost innocent of reference to his art. He left no journals and no profession of faith. His intimate being has to be reconstructed like a Dead Sea scroll. He wrote maybe 400 books and pamphlets, maybe 600 - but the retort ''who's counting?'' freezes on our lips, because the bibliographers are counting. The greatest debate in current Defoe scholarship concerns this very question of the scale and makeup of the canon. He is a great writer whose very oeuvre shifts before our gaze.
It was brave of Paula R. Backscheider, a professor of English at the University of Rochester, to take on the herculean task of a full new life. Brave but timely, for we have not had a serious chronological account of Defoe's career since the one by James Sutherland, originally published in 1937, though there have been popular versions and a large grab-bag of biographical materials, thematically organized, which John Robert Moore put out in 1956. Ms. Backscheider supplants both, as well as her three-decker Victorian predecessors, in the wealth of detail she has assembled and in her comprehensive grasp of the religious, political and economic setting. The density of her documentation is at first sight forbidding, but it is all there for a purpose. For the first time everything we know, or can reasonably surmise, about Defoe is presented in a single orderly sequence.
Of course there are still large gaps, and the story refuses to be altogether orderly, since Defoe lived such a jumbled life, with a literary output marked by syncopations and sudden backtracks. Bred for the ministry, he promptly turned himself into what the author calls a ''secular capitalist.'' He suddenly emerges as a member of the Duke of Monmouth's army at Sedgemoor (the last major battle fought on English soil, in 1685). It was of course the losing side, and Defoe barely escaped with a royal pardon - a fact that typically lay hidden until 20 years ago. He went into trade and engaged in a variety of more or less shady enterprises, from the wholesale hosiery business to farming civet cats (for perfume) to brick manufacture. Few professional writers have strayed very much beyond the printing trade or advertising or the learned professions. An occasional artist like Wallace Stevens or Charles Ives may have worked in an insurance office, but this is conventional beside Defoe's crazy venture into marine insurance during a time of naval warfare. The outcome was a succession of lawsuits, mostly revealing Defoe's sharp practices and mania for imprudent borrowing; ultimately bankruptcy followed, with a spell in the debtor's jail.
In all these matters Ms. Backscheider's treatment is exemplary. She has been able to add only a few details on the endless battles in the courts of Chancery and the Exchequer, but they are often telling. She tells us what hose-factors actually did, and how the brick-making business was affected by seasonal factors - hence the company's downfall at a time when Defoe was in prison (''Defoe's workers continued to lack supervision in the critical months between March and September when bricks were molded, dried, and heated and slaked in clamps and when pantiles were made from kneaded, sieved, and precipitated clay''). She has a remarkable hold on financial realities, and this comes in useful later when the complex machinations of the South Sea bubble entrap Defoe, like so many others. She fills out our understanding of Defoe as a land speculator - late in life he bought large estates near Colchester, with dreams of raising cattle and growing corn, but also (with his usual dispersed energy) of selling honey, oysters and anchovies.
Over all Ms. Backscheider has a clear sense of her subject. She sees him as one constantly beset by reversals: ''The most traumatic, influential experience of Defoe's life was not the pillory'' (where he arrived after his ironic book ''The Shortest Way With the Dissenters'') ''but his bankruptcy.'' But she also sees him as a courageous Protestant hero, and she does something to revive the unfashionable view that he was a prime intellectual architect of Britain's surge to colonial and economic power. His ''boringly mundane'' financial failure left its mark on all his work, but so did his sense of religious persecution as a dissenter. In only one area does she nod: she confuses printers and publishers in uncharacteristically slapdash fashion, and in one paragraph jumbles up all the crucial relationships between members of the book trade.
Elsewhere she is sure-footed and well primed, whether on Defoe's relations with the equally devious and secretive Robert Harley, a Tory politician who employed Defoe as his agent and spy, or on the impact of Defoe's dissenting education. There is no full literary assessment of major works like ''Moll Flanders'' or the ''Tour Through Great Britain'' - but Ms. Backscheider is, candidly, a smarter biographer than a critic, and anyway we have readings of these things elsewhere, almost to saturation. What she does give us is a searching study of a complex man, one that is coherent and credible for our times. Practically anyone can forge a shapely narrative out of a regular life and a tidy body of work. It is Paula Backscheider's considerable achievement to have made an enticing story out of a jerky and often obscure career.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Downtown Brooklyn;
Creating a Critical Mass at Metrotech

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
BY a curious quirk of timing in the mid-70's, Citibank found itself building the imposing Citicorp Center project at Lexington Avenue and East 53d Street when new office construction generally in Manhattan was tomb silent.
Entering the 1990's, the market generally is far healthier than it was then. But with much newly built space still unspoken for and with financial and other service firms leery about plunging into expensive building programs, the forecast is for a winding down in new office-construction starts in Manhattan this year and next.
And that may leave downtown Brooklyn in the countercyclical position that in the end benefited Citicorp Center in the 70's. For that neighborhood, in the cliche of the business, is in the process of ''taking off'' in new office construction. The bulk of the space in the buildings was spoken for before construction began, so this is not a case of speculative miscalculation. And the largest project of all, the Chase Financial Center, with 1.5 million square feet in two buildings, will be fully occupied by Chase itself. 
But the total effect, contrasted with the relative quiescence in Manhattan, will be to make Brooklyn the center of office construction in New York City in the early 90's. With excavation for the Chase buildings still about a month away, it may still be a year before the full impact of this concentration of new construction is apparent. By then, additional projects may be committed.
It is too early to say whether the leasing market will respond by taking new space in Brooklyn - at prices that are perhaps a third lower than Manhattan's. What is clear is that for the first time New York City is developing new space to compete for back-office operations of banks and financial firms with comparable space in northern New Jersey.
As Merrill Lynch & Company demonstrated last June in its decision to move 2,600 jobs to a new building on the site of the former Colgate-Palmolive soap factory in Jersey City, the Brooklyn alternative will not capture every major back-office tenant for New York City. But it has made the city more competitive.
On financial grounds, according to Michael P. Esposito, chief financial officer of Chase, the bank was ''cost neutral'' between New Jersey and New York City by the time it finished the negotiations that led it to choose Brooklyn. He also said that 40 percent of Chase's clerical staff already lives in Brooklyn.
The Brooklyn construction is all part of Metrotech, conceived ultimately as a 4.7-million-square-foot commercial, academic and high-technology office complex on a 10-block, 16-acre site. The tract lies between Jay Street and Flatbush Avenues on the west and east, and Tech Place and Willoughby Street on the north and south.
The office development is linked with the renovation and expansion of Polytechnic University, which is a partner of the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. A major element in the university's building program, construction of a new library, is to begin in March. Lehrer McGovern Bovis Inc., is the Metrotech construction manager.
Forest City's 500,000-square-foot, 10-story, red-brick building for the Securities Industries Automation Corporation is about 60 percent complete. The tenant is leasing 350,000 square feet. Of the rest of the space, 80,000 square feet has been spoken for by a bank and a computer user, said Bruce Ratner, president of Forest City Ratner, although leases have not been concluded.
Foundation work has started next door on an 850,000-square-foot, 23-story headquarters building for the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. There, 400,000 square feet will be available for other tenants.
BROOKLYN enthusiasts have long contended that the borough's basic problem in attracting office tenants has been the lack of a ''critical mass'' of new construction. Now the mass is being created. But will it be enough?
Forest City believes that upgraded retail space is also required. Accordingly, it has contracted to buy the 10-year old Albee Square Mall, about three blocks from Metrotech on the Fulton Street Mall, to bring ''upscale retail'' operators into it, Mr. Ratner said. The mall has 155,000 square feet of space, of which all but 6,000 square feet is leased.
Lacking the critical mass, downtown Brooklyn has floundered. An example of that is the long postponed Renaissance Plaza, Alexander Muss & Company's name for the mixed-use hotel and office building it has tried for two years to start building on the site of a former municipal garage between Jay and Adams Streets.
Hilton Hotel is prepared to operate a 360-room hotel in the building, which William Tabler designed. But a major tenant for perhaps 250,000 square feet in the 600,000-square-foot office component is needed before construction can start. Two tenants came close to signing on - most recently the American Insurance Group - but then bowed out. ''I was like a bride left at the altar,'' said Joshua Muss, principal in Alexander Muss.
Now, with so much work proceeding on Metrotech, there is new interest, he said. ''I'm talking to 19 users who need 100,000 square feet or more,'' he said.
ALSO talking is Mr. Ratner, who was given a 50,000-square-foot city-owned site on Jay Street when Forest City yielded the Metrotech land that Chase bought, using favorable financing, for its operations center. On the Jay Street site, still occupied by city offices, Forest City is offering to build someone a one-million-square foot office building with 31 floors of 25,000 to 48,000 square feet. David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill is the senior design partner.
Beyond that Metrotech has approved sites for an additional 1.4 million square feet of space.
If all this succeeds, no small debt will be owed to the Chase decision to come to Brooklyn. To bring it about, the city provided incentives of two types, as-of-right, or those that are available to any employer who decides to move from Manhattan to one of the other boroughs, and discretionary, or negotiated specifically for this move. The city estimated the total value of the incentive package over 25 years at $230 million.
The incentives include an as-of-right, 13-year total exemption on real estate taxes, phasing in to full taxes over the subsequent 10 years; a $10.9 million as-of-right savings on energy costs over 12 years; an as-of-right corporate-tax credit of $500 for each relocating employee; an exemption from sales taxes on the purchase of some equipment, for which Chase qualified because it is using industrial revenue bond financing, and a $15 million capital-budget contribution for site improvements. There also is a savings on energy through the Power Authority of the State of New York, estimated at $25 million.
CHASE is buying the land through the city's Industrial Development Agency, which will mean annual payments of $750,000 and a $7.5 million balloon payment in the 25th year, when Chase will acquire title.
New York City estimated the value of the as-of-right savings in these incentives at $137 million over 25 years, and of the additional state and city incentives at $68 million in the same period. The savings on energy through the Power Authority of the State of New York were estimated at $25 million.
The true benefits of building a new downtown office hub in Brooklyn are calculated not merely in dollars or even jobs, but also, it might be said, spiritually. Growth in an older, economically stagnant urban center redeems the aspirations and efforts of its community for a better future. Nevertheless, the city estimates that the Chase move will generate about $3.8 billion in economic activity over the 25-year period.

HEADLINE: IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester;
South Norwalk Waterfront Plan Moving

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A MASTER PLAN to turn SoNo, the restored waterfront of the South Norwalk neighborhood, into one of Connecticut's prime tourist attractions is advancing with surprising brio in view of a recession-prone economy.
Last month final approvals were granted by Norwalk for the newest component - conversion of the vacant old City Hall on Main Street into what Robert Katz, its developer, describes as a ''mini-theme hotel.'' Now the hard part begins - arranging for $17 million in financing. The converted 16,500-square-foot City Hall will be called the Maritime Inn and be keyed to the atmosphere created by the $30 million Maritime Center a block away on Water Street overlooking the Norwalk River and harbor. It will house the lobby and registration desk, restaurant, bar, health club, kitchen and employee facilities. 
Its white-pillared entrance on Main Street will remain as a decorative artifact while a more impressive circular driveway and fountain will mark a new entrance around the corner on Marshall Street.
Behind the converted City Hall, an eight-story, 96-room hotel will rise. It will include a five-story atrium facing the water that will be soundproofed against the rattle of trains passing on the Danbury spur of Metro-North and three parking levels, one underground, that will accommodate 108 cars.
The doorman at the new entrance will be dressed as Long John Silver, with a live parrot on his shoulder.
''We want to accommodate tourists, families coming here for the weekend,'' said Mr. Katz, a Norwalk developer since 1950. ''We are not seeking business travelers, although they would be welcome.''
''We wholly support the project,'' said Rollo Gianannini, president of the 15-member City Council, ''because it will help draw people to Norwalk, help the Maritime Center and tie the area together with Washington Street.''
The Maritime Center, troubled by deficits in its first year, nonetheless attracted almost 400,000 people to its shark, fish and seal aquarium, marine and boating exhibits and educational exhibits. One block south is the Historic District on Washington Street, where eight years ago several abandoned 19th-century commercial buildings were remodeled into art galleries, boutiques, restaurants and condominiums. On weekends and holidays the area is clogged with visitors. Another element of the master plan is Maritime Square, a $70 million residential, office and restaurant complex on which construction by M. F. DiScala & Company, a local real estate concern, is to start early in 1990. It will back up to the new inn and front the Maritime Center at the end of Marshall Street.
The South Norwalk/Metro-North railroad station, three blocks from the inn, is scheduled for a $100 million expansion with a new station, housing, parking, theaters, restaurants and retail stores to be built by the Starrett Corporation of Manhattan.
''Once people park, they can walk everywhere,'' said Mr. Katz. He hopes to begin construction this spring and open 18 months later.
THE inn's 90 guest rooms, priced from $90 a night no matter how many people occupy what the developer calls suites (the range of prices has not been determined), will measure from 14 by 30 feet to 28 by 30 feet. Each will have two television sets and two bathrooms, one with a Jacuzzi, and sliding doors will separate its bedroom from the living room, which will have covertible sofas for children or guests as well as a refrigerator, sink and microwave oven.
In the larger rooms, there will be dining furniture and additional sleeping accommodations. Six penthouses will offer luxuries not yet worked out.
The architects are Valus and Carpenter Associates of Westport.
A second hotel, with 300 rooms, has been earmarked by the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, which controls the area, for a seven-acre parcel just north of the Maritime Center. It is for sale by the State Department of Transportation. ''This could be a good time to negotiate, with the market flat,'' said Mayor Frank J. Esposito. But the redevelopment agency estimates that a million square feet of new office space would be needed to support it.
The Fred F. French Realty Company of Manhattan has made a start in that direction by buying up 74,000 square feet of a block facing West Avenue at Reed Street, just west of the proposed hotel site. ''The city requires development of the entire block of 170,000 square feet,'' said Helmut Scholde, vice president. ''We are acquiring it gradually and intend to build about 340,000 square feet of offices.''
While the old City Hall is not the most prepossessing example of local architecture, Mr. Katz is abiding by the wishes of the Redevelopment Agency to preserve it. Built in 1912, it is one of 600 buildings, public art and oddments listed in the Norwalk Inventory of Historic Assets, a list that was drawn up by the local Historical Society in 1976 and that includes Stew Leonard's, the enormous supermarket-cum-funhouse on Route 1.
Next door to the inn is the Palace Theater, a vaudeville house built around 1916 and closed for decades. It is owned and operated by Palace Productions Center, a commercial television company whose president, Christopher Campbell, wanted to buy City Hall and expand into it. But Mr. Katz won out with a $1.2 million bid that the city accepted. He spent $1.7 million more on development costs. Now he is negotiating with Mr. Campbell to buy the theater and, he speculated, ''tie it in with the hotel, possibly as a conference center.''
Four existing hotels with 700 rooms in other parts Norwalk are not viewed as competition for Mr. Katz, but Thomas McConnell, manager of the hotel consulting division of Laventhal and Horwath, a Manhattan firm preparing a study of the district for Norwalk, said: ''Marketing an inn can be difficult. It's related to the ability to draw tourists.''
NORWALK officials have various opinions about what constitutes tourist attractions and recently gave Mort Walker, creator of the ''Beetle Bailey'' cartoon and founder of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Westchester, a mixed reception when he proposed moving his museum into a vacant building opposite the Maritime Center.
Mr. Katz views all this activity with enthusiasm but is concentrating on negotiating financing in a difficult time. ''The worst thing that could happen is the hotel doesn't get built,'' he said. ''I can't afford that.''

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Tin Pan Alley;
Rodgers & Hammerstein Is Moving to Broadway

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THE cacophony of Tin Pin Alley has long been stilled, but enough of the music industry remains on Broadway to have lured the Rodgers & Hammerstein organization from Madison Avenue after four decades on the East Side.
The organization, which owns and licenses some of America's best-known musicals - ''The King and I,'' ''Sound of Music,'' ''Carousel'' and ''Oklahoma!'' among others - is scheduled to move this month into the Paramount Plaza Building at 1633 Broadway, between 50th and 51st Streets, one block north of the Brill Building, which used to be the center of music publishing.
Many music-related businesses had dispersed before the recent redevelopment of the blocks north of Times Square and others were displaced by demolition. But the industry is ''still largely between Times Square and Lincoln Center, although some of it is downtown,'' said Ken Sunshine, the manager of public relations for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Another music industry executive said that most music publishers could be found between 47th and 58th Streets. And a number of musical-instrument dealers are clustered on West 48th Street. 
''We looked all over the place,'' said Theodore S. Chapin, executive director of Rodgers & Hammerstein, ''but we kept going back to that corridor where the entertainment industry really is. Our business is focused on the theater and music. To be surrounded by it seemed to make sense.''
''Broadway is a community, a network, a small village,'' said Bert Fink, the director of special projects and public relations for Rodgers & Hammerstein. ''You run into people at the Edison Hotel coffee shop. You meet people on the elevator. You constantly run into business associates and friends. By being east of Fifth Avenue, we were on the other side of the moon.''
''From their new location, they can look out and see all the Broadway theaters,'' said Arthur H. Lerner, senior vice president and director of leasing for Helmsley-Spear, which represented Rodgers & Hammerstein in its search for new offices. ''Emotionally, and for every other reason, it's where they belong.''
Founded by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d in 1943, the organization controls the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, the major musicals by Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, some Hammerstein musicals (''Showboat,'' for example) and such other shows as Irving Berlin's ''Annie Get Your Gun.'' It licenses 3,000 productions a year, 600 of which are ''Oklahoma!'' It also has a music-publishing division and employs about 20 people in its Manhattan office.
At its founding, Rodgers & Hammerstein was at 1270 Sixth Avenue, at 51st Street, but a few years later moved to Madison in the lower 40's. Since 1960 it has occupied 4,500 square feet in 598 Madison Avenue, at 57th Street, paying a rent per square foot that Mr. Chapin said was in the low $40's. It has signed a 10-year-lease for 8,500 square feet on the 38th floor of Paramount Plaza, with a rent in the $30's, he said. There are few other, if any, music-related tenants in that skyscraper.
RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN will sublet 2,500 square feet to the Really Useful Group P.L.C., of London, which owns the copyrights to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals ''Cats,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Starlight Express'' and ''Aspects of Love.'' John Whitney, the chief executive of the Really Useful Group, said that the choice of space had less to do with its Broadway address than with proximity to Rodgers & Hammerstein. ''I'm delighted we'll be joining them in an office that gives us the opportunity to have a dialogue without going through fax machines,'' he said.
That kind of closeness was the hallmark of the music business when it was much more centralized; when the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway, on the corner of 49th Street, was the 11-story embodiment of the songwriters' quarter called Tin Pan Alley.
Today, the 1650 Broadway building, at 51st Street, may the closest thing remaining to a vertical Tin Pan Alley or a Runyonesque hangout, a 12-story hive of small show-business offices. Among the tenants are Beaver Music, Creative Music Concepts, Dandy Dittys, Princess Music, Tiny Coots Music, Wazzie Music and We Three Music.
''It is probably the building in the area as far as Broadway-related corporations,'' said Steve Colavito, vice president of William Colavito, managing agent for 1650 Broadway. He said 90 percent of the tenants are involved in entertainment - music publishers and arrangers, talent agents and producers.
Unlike modern skyscrapers, 1650 Broadway has spaces as small as 350 square feet, for a two- to three-person office. Rents range from $25 to $28 a square foot, Mr. Colavito said. All told, there are some 100 tenants, from four to 10 on each floor.
''So many tenants in that building work closely with one another,'' Mr. Colavito said. ''They don't have to get on a train and go downtown. They just ring for the elevator and go two floors down.'' ''Despite all the advanced technology,'' said Mr. Sunshine, of ASCAP, ''it's still a people business, a human being writing music that needs to get published or recorded. The only way to do that is to meet somebody who can make it happen.''
Last summer, the Polygram record company moved its New York offices into 120,000 square feet at Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets, five blocks from its old offices at 810 Seventh Avenue.
There, it is paying rent in the $30's, according to Peter E. Takiff, the executive vice president for administration. Polygram, owned by Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, has about 400 employees in mid-Manhattan.
''MY personal opinion is that we probably don't have to be in midtown,'' Mr. Takiff said, ''but there are advantages to being near other music businesses and law offices. I don't think our business would suffer if we weren't here. It's a matter of convenience.''
There is probably no better example of how the area has changed than the Brill Building itself. ''My guess,'' Mr. Takiff said, ''is that if you asked most record company employees under the age of 35 where the Brill Building is, they wouldn't know.''
''At one time, the Brill Building was nothing but music publishers,'' said Freddy Bienstock, president, chairman and chief executive officer of the Hudson Bay Music group of companies, the last major publisher left in the building. ''Songwriters would come to the 11th floor and make their way all the way down, peddling their songs, playing the piano.''
''When we took over the building in 1979, there were very few music publishers left,'' said David Gordon, vice president of Realty Group Ltd., managers of the Brill Building. ''A lot of the offices were used for undesirable businesses,'' he said, including the pornographic trade.
Mr. Bienstock said ''personal and sentimental'' reasons figured into his decision to stay in the Brill Building. ''My first and second employer had these premises,'' he said. ''I bought both of their businesses and remained in premises I'm familiar with.''
Economics also played a role. Thanks to a long lease, Mr. Bienstock pays $15 to $16 a square foot for about 6,000 square feet in the penthouse.
Hudson Bay, which also includes E. B. Marks and George M. Cohan Publishing, has shows like ''Cabaret,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Godspell'' and ''Company,'' as well as popular, jazz, classical and rock-and-roll titles.
Half of the Brill Building is occupied by the Sound One Corporation, a post-production sound studio for movies, specializing in sound effects, mixing, dubbing and even ''automatic dialogue replacement'' - the substitution of unoffensive words for profanity in movies that are to be broadcast on television.
On the ground floor is Colony Records, which has been there 21 years, specializing in out-of-print records and a 250,000-title sheet-music collection. (There is still a steady demand for ''Love Is Here to Stay,'' ''Cheek to Cheek'' and ''Blue Moon.'') ''As you look around and see everything coming down, this place stays here,'' said Norman Levy, the sheet-music buyer for Colony. ''People come in and say, 'We're glad you're here because no one else is around anymore.' This is the last remnant.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Delinquencies Increasing

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE slump in the New York region's real estate market, now in its third year, is increasing the financial strain on homeowners, would-be sellers and lenders alike as delinquent mortgage loans and foreclosures spread across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
More than 4 percent of the mortgage loans to individuals and families in New York City and its suburbs are now past due by at least two months, according to several studies. At those rates of delinquency, analysts say the region does not face anything close to the deep economic woes of Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and other states around the Southwest, where more than 20 percent of the mortgage loans are delinquent and over 20,000 foreclosed homes are being sold off by the Federal Government.
But while few in the New York region are predicting problems of similar magnitude, experts say the rising number of problem loans offers little cause for comfort. The rate of mortgage delinquencies in the region has more than doubled since 1985, and now slightly surpasses the national average of 4 percent, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision, a Federal agency that supervises mortgage lenders. 
Home foreclosures, reported by the lending institutions, have also risen sharply. A check of legal documents filed by lenders with county clerks across the New York region as a first step in the process that sometimes leads to foreclosures indicates future problems.
Most disturbing, some experts say, is that problems in and around New York City have risen most dramatically over the last year.
''It would be an exaggeration to say the bottom is falling out of the market, but the rate of deterioriation in the New York region is not good news,'' said Eugene Sherman, chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of New York.
The mortgage delinquencies provide an object lesson in what can happen after years of rapidly appreciating home values, when both borrowers and lenders come to assume that prices will continue to rise and that homeownership can be approached as a short-term investment.
Some of those now in arrears in their mortgage payments are people who bought homes, particularly condominiums, purely for investment purposes. Many became landlords, hoping that demand for rentals would be robust and rents would rise enough to cover their mortgage payments, upkeep, taxes and other costs. Instead, rents have risen little, if at all, and they are losing money on their investments.
Others ran into trouble because they stretched their budgets too far, often expecting that they would be able to sell at a profit after two or three years of rising prices. Some compounded their risks with hefty second mortgage or home equity loans, taking on too much debt to be supported if the underlying value of their property began to shrink, as it has in many cases.
LENDERS brought on some of the problems themselves and are paying the price for practices that real estate executives now say were too risky even in the heady real estate market of the mid-80's. Huge losses from nonperforming mortgage loans have already been reported by several banks and thrift institutions in the region, and analysts expect more fallout to come.
''People are hunkering down,'' said Michael J. Wexler, chief operating officer of the Related Companies, a real estate and financial services concern and former managing director of Chemical Bank. ''For the next few years, the days of excess in real estate lending are over.''
Many of the so-called ''no-documentation'' loans that were made to home buyers unwilling to provide proof of their employment or incomes are now showing up as delinquencies, and the lending practice is all but eliminated. Lenders who once quickly approved adjustible-rate mortgages to people whose income would cover the first, artificially low, phase of payments, but who might find themselves in a financial squeeze as the payments rose, are applying more stringent standards.
And in one of the most widespread shifts, banks and thrifts across the region are requiring that homeowners show evidence that they have sold their existing properties before they are granted mortgages for different homes. The change has come after hundreds of people found themselves paying off two mortgages because they were unable to find acceptable bids for the home they were trying to sell.
Many believe the troubled loans will become more commonplace. With some sellers unable to get as much for their homes as they would have a year ago, and thousands of householders paying adjustable-rate mortgages that have risen at hefty 6- or 12-month intervals, some lenders are making it more difficult to sell real estate by making it harder for would-be buyers to qualify for loans.
Indeed, lending executives say that in the region's sluggish market for houses, condominiums and cooperative apartments, which began a broad-based downturn after the October 1987 stock market collapse, may now be entering a period of new constraints as commercial banks and thrift institutions, jolted by a rash of soured loans, become more cautious in all forms of real estate lending.
''THE logic is inescapable that when you remove marginal buyers from the market it has a negative impact on sales,'' said Douglas Johnson, chief lending officer for the Dime Savings Bank of New York, one of the largest mortgage lenders in New York City and its suburbs.
Dime, like many other lenders, has tightened its requirements for lenders in recent months. Its changes have taken on a special urgency because it reported in December that it would have a fourth-quarter loss of $92 million, largely because of delinquencies and foreclosures in single-family home mortgages.
Other lenders, particularly those that had had been aggressively marketing mortgage loans in the suburbs, have reported similar problems. Midlantic Corporation, a major lender in New Jersey, said late in December that it had expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter but would add $75 million to a reserve against loan losses.
Citytrust Bancorp, a large real estate lender in Connecticut, which had earlier in the year added $40 million to its loan loss reserves, said its nonperforming real estate loans had risen by 45 percent in 12 months. Citytrust said that it expected a fourth-quarter loss, but it declined to predict how much it would be.
And in the starkest example of the problems faced by the region's real estate lenders, the City Federal Savings Bank, New Jersey's largest savings institution, was taken over in early December by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that is overseeing the Government's rescue of ailing thrifts across the nation.
Not all the problems at the thrifts and commercial banks have resulted from loans to individuals or families buying houses, condominiums or cooperative apartments. Some, like Midlantic, had financed office buildings, shopping malls and condominium projects, some of which ran into financial difficulties even before being put on the market for buyers or tenants.
And the lenders' problems extend beyond the New York City area. City Federal said some of its delinquent loans were to developers as far afield as Florida and Texas.
But analysts say the problems are as much a result of the sharp downturn in the New York region's market for homes as they are an outgrowth of lending to commercial developers or in distant real estate markets. And they say the problems have not ended.
''We haven't seen the half of it,'' said Lacey Shockley, a banking and thrift industry analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. Bank and thrift industry executives ''tend to say three or four times that the problem is under control before it really is.''
The New York region's ''underlying economy has not yet stabilized, and we are going to see more problems,'' she added, saying that condominiums, particularly in suburban communities that have had intensive residential development, are likely to be the biggest problems for lenders.
One area that has been particularly hard hit by a surplus of condominiums is Fairfield County, where demand and prices hit a peak even before the stock market crash of 1987 and have been in a slump ever since. Hundreds of condominiums are on the market.
Robert D. Bundock, an appraiser in Stamford, said a typical two-bedroom condominium in a high-rise Stamford building has lost 19 percent of its value in four years. Although he declined to specify the building, he cited examples of typical selling prices of apartments with the same appraised value as $144,000 in 1986, $142,500 in 1987, $128,000 in 1988 and $117,000 last year.
Although he said demand and prices now appeared close to stabilizing, Mr. Bundock and other experts said such a steep decline in values seems certain to forebode continuing problems as those who lose their jobs or confront other economic hardship are unable to keep up their mortgage payments and find themselves unable to sell for close to what they paid for their homes.
TO be sure, the rising rate of delinquency and foreclosures is welcomed in some quarters. State officials in Connecticut announced this month that they had budgeted $50 million to buy the homes across the state at the lowest cut-rate prices they could negotiate and make them available in a special program for low- and middle-income first-time buyers.
Bargain hunters are also beginning to look to some of the banks and thrift institutions that have foreclosed properties to sell. At Dime, for example, officials are circulating a monthly list of homes that were in foreclosure and open for bids.
''We are not giving anything away, but we may price things moderately below the market,'' said Kenneth Borecki, vice president and director of owned real estate. He said the list currently includes 150 homes, including many New York City co-ops.
Hopeful buyers may also be encouraged by recent declines in interest rates, which have brought the average rate of a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage to slightly below 10 percent in the New York area, down more than a full point since the beginning of 1989. And most economists expect the rate to continue falling, albeit slightly, over the next six months.
But despite the incentives to buyers, the delinquent loans and foreclosures -and the resulting hardship on homeowners and lenders - are problems for the region that show no immediate signs of going away.
Federal agencies, which until now have been concentrating most of their resources on helping failing thrifts and preparing to sell off vast amounts of real estate in Texas, Arizona, Florida and elsewhere in the Sun Belt, are gearing up in the New York region.
''Our activity increased in the New York area last year, and from every indication, we have to expect it to be heavy in 1990,'' said Robert Cittadino, deputy regional director in the New York office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Liquidation.
In one measure of the problem, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York said 4.1 percent of the mortgage loans outstanding at the thrifts it supervises in New York State were at least 60 days past due at the end of the third quarter. That compared with a deliquency rate of 2.7 percent a year earlier.
In New Jersey, the analysis showed an even higher rate of mortgages over 60 days in arrears - 4.7 percent in the third quarter of 1989, up from 3 percent a year earlier.
Nationally, a study by the Office of Thrift Supervision found that the deliquency rates on home loans were 4 percent at the end of the third quarter, down from 4.8 percent a year earlier.
Mortgage loans that are past-due rarely lead to foreclosures because the borrowers, threatened with the loss of their entire investment, usually find buyers or other sources of financing before their properties are seized. Even when it occurs, foreclosure is usually a protracted legal process that takes months or years to complete.
NONETHELESS, foreclosures are on the rise. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade organization that analyzes thrifts, commercial banks and independent mortgage brokers, said foreclosures represented 0.83 percent of the residential real estate lending in New York State at the end of September, up from 0.49 percent a year earlier.
Foreclosures were a bigger problem in New Jersey, accounting for 0.89 percent of the real estate loans at the end of September, up from 0.67 percent a year earlier, the trade group said.
And in Connecticut, it was reported that foreclosures accounted for 0.32 percent of the lending at the end of September, up from 0.16 percent the year earlier.
One other indication of the expanding problem of loan delinquencies in the New York region comes from the county clerks, who record a legal document, filed by banks, thrifts or other mortgage lenders, when the mortgages are delinquent. The document, a lis pendens - Latin for ''notice of a pending suit'' - is typically filed when a loan is 90 days past due, and is used by lawyers as the first step in the lengthly process leading to foreclosure.
A spot check of county records shows that the number of such documents filed had risen sharply, particularly in the suburbs. On Long Island, Nassau County reported 2,478 filed in 1989, up from 1,576 in 1988, and Suffolk County said 3,530 were filed by Dec. 21, 1989, up from 2,451 in all of 1988.
In New Jersey, Hudson County said it had 823 lis pendens documents filed in 1989, up from 720 in 1988, and Morris County reported 643 of the filings in 1989, compared to 454 the year earlier.
Westchester County reported 965 of the filings thru Dec. 22, 1989, up from 805 for all of 1988. The increase was smaller in Manhattan, where there were 1,247 filings in 1989, compared to 1,140 in 1988.

HEADLINE: In Affluent Towns, The Working Poor Are Filling Shelters

BYLINE: By BARBARA LOECHER

 BODY:
WESTPORT, with its country clubs, marinas and million-dollar mansions, is not a town where you would expect to find a soup kitchen or a shelter for the homeless. Still, a few dozen people find their way every day to the Interfaith Housing Association's soup kitchen for a hot meal, and another 15 fill the nonprofit agency's shelter each night.
Many of these people are unemployed or retired. But a growing number are among the working poor. They hold clerical, custodial, restaurant or sales jobs in the community but do not earn enough to cover basic expenses.
Because they are employed, most do not qualify for Federal and state assistance. In communities like Westport, Greenwich and Fairfield in Fairfield County and Sharon and Salisbury in Litchfield County where the cost of living is high and rising faster than wages, the problems of the working poor stand out in high relief. 
Carol A. Femia, Commissioner of Social Services in Greenwich, a town better known as home to Wall Street executives and celebrities than to the poor, said: ''The number of people here who are eligible for welfare benefits is probably the same as it was a decade ago. It's a boom economy; there are jobs. The number of working poor, though, is much larger.''
There are no shelters or soup kitchens in Greenwich, but the town has a contract with a Stamford shelter to use a shelter and kitchen there. Greenwich also maintains a small cottage where homeless families can stay temporarily. Neighbor to Neighbor, a private nonprofit group, distributes food and clothing to those in need.
''We've seen a considerable increase in the number of households we are referring to Neighbor to Neighbor,'' Miss Femia said. ''It's our sense that the working poor are really suffering. Our housing costs are exorbitant; the cost of living here is high. These people might have jobs paying $10 an hour. Unless they have a second income, it's very tricky to pay rents here, which are in the $800- to $1,000-a-month range for one or two bedrooms.''
Along with the state's unemployment rate, the number of Connecticut residents receiving welfare benefits dropped to the lowest point of the decade in 1989. According to the State Department of Income Maintenance, 35,300 state residents were getting Aid to Families With Dependent Children last year, compared with a high of 45,800 in 1980. But in 1989 the number of Connecticut residents sleeping in shelters for the homeless reached a high of 18,400, according to the State Department of Human Resources. The department estimates that more than 20 percent of those people were employed.
''We've noticed we're getting more people who are working,'' said Pam Hyman, executive director of the Operation Hope shelter, soup kitchen and food bank in Fairfield. ''About half the men at our shelter work.''
An average of 30 people eat at the kitchen daily, and the 18-bed men's shelter is always full, she said.
 
Working but Homeless
One of those living at the shelter is 23-year-old Warren Richardson. Mr. Richardson, who was raised by his grandfather in Bridgeport, said he was forced to leave the house after his grandfather died. He said he lived in a friend's garage, did a stint in the Army and tried the Job Corps before he found the shelter seven months ago.
Since then he has been working full time at a McDonald's restaurant in Fairfield and studying graphic arts at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport. With his earnings of $200 a week, he cannot afford an apartment in Fairfield, where most rents start at $800 a month. He said that he could find an apartment for $500 a month in Bridgeport but that if he lived there, he would have to pay to take the bus to work in Fairfield.
Evelyn Harris, a professor at the University of Connecticut at Stamford who last month organized a symposium on poverty in southern Connecticut, explained the seeming incongruity between decreasing unemployment and rising homelessness in the state by pointing out that most of the jobs created in Connecticut in the last decade were service jobs that pay less than $20,000 a year. At the same time, housing costs rose dramatically.
 
Programs in Wilton
In Wilton, where the average family of three earns more than $75,000 and apartments renting for $800 a month are scarce, the social services director, Suzanne Van Vechten, has only three clients who are eligible for welfare. Most of the people who stop at her office these days are the working poor.
''The people I think are most in need in Wilton and towns like Wilton are the ones doing unskilled jobs that don't pay a tremendous amount,'' Miss Van Vechten said. ''They're spending a very high percentage of their income on housing. We have various programs, including an energy-assistance program that's open to individuals earning $12,000 and below a year. What I'm finding, though, is that people with incomes just above the guidelines aren't eligible for help.''
In response, church and civic groups in Wilton have set up funds to assist those who are employed but still in need. The town officially has its own version of the state's heating-assistance program and a fund to cover medical expenses for those who have no insurance. Occasionally, Miss Van Vechten will tap a third fund to pay a month's rent for a tenant who might otherwise end up homeless. Wilton has no shelter and has to refer the homeless to shelters in Norwalk and Westport. The town does have a food pantry in Miss Van Vechten's office.
 
Help in Sharon
In Sharon, the Older Women's League is planning to open a food bank. The town already has a fund for residents who need emergency financial help. And Sharon Hospital has a contingency fund that covers certain medical expenses for those who cannot pay.
''It's easy to drive through this town and see nothing but the fancy houses, but it's a problem in these towns - poverty that people don't want to talk about,'' said Ella L. Clark, the social services director in Sharon. ''There's no affordable housing as yet in Sharon. I have 25 people who need fuel assistance and three more just applied, including a single mother who lives in an apartment where nearly all her income goes to rent. There are other people here who need surplus food.'' Sharon, a rural town in the northwestern corner of the state, is, like nearby Salisbury, a well-known second-home spot for affluent New Yorkers.
''I've asked virtually everyone I can think of whether they'd use the food bank the league is planning,'' said Miss Clark, who is a league member herself. ''They've said, 'Yes, because it doesen't have a means test.''' Like Miss Van Vechten and Miss Femia, Miss Clark says she is seeing an increasing number of people who need help but are not eligible for many benefit programs because they are employed.
 
Limits of Welfare
Even those who are eligible for benefits like Aid to Families With Dependent Children or Social Security need additional help, Miss Clark said. A family of three in Sharon is eligible for about $550 in A.F.D.C. benefits each month. This is supposed to cover housing, food, fuel, clothing and transportation, but the least expensive apartments in town rent for about $500.
In general, the federally financed A.F.D.C. program provides benefits that total just two-thirds of the amount the Government estimates that families need to live at the poverty level. According to the Federal Government's definition, the poverty level for a family of three in Connecticut is $10,060 annually. A.F.D.C. benefits to a family of three in Sharon total $6,564 a year. Welfare benefits did not keep pace with inflation through the 1970's and were cut back significantly during the Reagan Administration. Welfare benefits are now pegged to the inflation rate, but the Government has limited increases to 6 percent annually.
While local governments and religious and civic groups are trying to fill the gap, there are limits to what they can do.
 
The Housing Problem
''I think housing is the main problem,'' the Salisbury social services director, Barbara Tobias, said. Salisbury Family Services, a private group, has long provided townspeople with financial assistance, and the privately endowed Bissell Fund helps low- and middle-income residents with medical expenses. There are 25 subsidized housing units for low- and mid-income people in Salisbury, some renting for as little as $200 a month. But there is a long waiting list.
People who would otherwise end up spending most of their income on market-rate housing have little choice but to live with another family or two in a house or apartment, Mrs. Tobias said.
''A lot end up moving back in with their parents,'' she said. ''We've had two people do that in the last month. There are parents with their daughter or son, and their children, in one household. Homes built for four people house seven to nine.''
The situation is much the same in southwestern Connecticut.
 
Doubling Up
''People double up, or triple up, or leave town'' for places where housing costs are at least slightly lower, said Miss Femia, the Greenwich Social Services Commissioner. ''That's one reason it's so hard for Greenwich employers to find employees.'' There are 800 subsidized housing units in Greenwich, but Miss Femia said that the town would have to double that number to meet the need over the next decade.
Connecticut businesses have complained for several years that they were having problems attracting and retaining entry-level workers. In areas like Fairfield County, they point out, there is little housing that someone earning a receptionist's salary can afford.
The State Department of Economic Development is concerned about the long-term consequences, including possible corporate relocation outside Connecticut. Commissioner Stephen B. Heintz said his department may recommend formation of state and corporate partnerships, which would be responsible for finding ways to lower home financing costs and for investigating variations on typical single-family home ownership, like co-housing.
To make things somewhat easier for low-income tenants, the state started offering welfare recipients an additional $50-a-month rent subsidy this year. The subsidy, however, is available only to those who spend more than 50 percent of their benefits on rent.
 
Rental Assistance
A rental-assistance program the state introduced several years ago is further reaching. Under the program - patterned after the Federal Section 8 rental-assistance plan - eligible tenants pay one-third of their income for rent. The state pays participating landlords the difference between that amount and the landlord's actual charge. To qualify for the program, a family of three in Fairfield, for example, could earn up to $20,800 a year.
The state offered more than 1,200 households rental assistance through the program last year and plans to offer it to another 360 shortly. But there are far more than 360 families on waiting lists for the program and its federally financed counterpart.
The state should make affordable housing a top priority, municipal social service workers agree. But it should also increase benefits and extend them to the working poor, they say. A family of three is eligible for $600 a year in state energy assistance, they point out, only if it earns less than $20,124 a year.
''The income limits are outrageously low,'' said the Rev. Peter Powell, director of the Westport shelter and soup kitchen.
 
Fallacy of Work
Before there is widespread support for more extensive social welfare programs, there may have to be fundamental changes in the way people think about poverty and employment, said Claudette Bieulieu, a spokeswoman for the Department of Income Maintenance. The notion that a job is everyone's ticket out of poverty, she said, has always been a basic assumption behind the country's social welfare policy.
''There certainly is evidence that merely having a job is no guarantee against poverty,'' Miss Bieulieu said. ''But our welfare programs don't provide a long continuum of support. You're either on welfare or you get a job and you're on your own.''

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Encouraging a Healthy Life Style Is Just Good Business

BYLINE: By Robert W. Figlerski; Robert W. Figlerski is executive director of the Hofstra Health Dome in Hempstead.

 BODY:
A COOLING economy in Long Island is not the only challenge facing Nassau and Suffolk County employers. The rising cost of health insurance has become a serious drain on revenues and makes it increasingly difficult for companies to grow and compete in a chilly economic climate.
In 1987, increases in the costs of providing health insurance to employees were an average of 7.9 percent over those same costs in 1986. In 1988, increases in health care costs soared at an average pace of 20 percent, and 1989's average increase will be about 25 percent. Looking at companies on an individual basis, increases of 35 to 40 percent are not uncommon. 
Controlling health care costs has become an uphill battle, particularly for small to mid-sized employers.
Increases in health insurance premiums are taking place throughout the insurance industry, making it difficult for a company to switch to an insurance carrier offering lower rates. Even if an employer found an insurance carrier offering lower rates, insurance companies won't guarantee a rate for more than a year.
Small to mid-size businesses are working at an even bigger disadvantage to secure lower rates since they usually pay 10 to 40 percent more than a large employer, and insurance companies are less interested in insuring small groups.
However, these increases should not come as too much of a surprise, since major health studies have concluded we are in poor shape, our children are in worse shape, and our life styles are to blame. The following are a few examples:
* Approximately 26 percent of the adult population is overweight. Overweight workers are 50 percent more likely to have medical claims that exceed $5,000 in a year, and 29 percent more likely to miss more than a week of work each year.
%
* Sedentary employees spend 30 percent more time in the hospital and call in sick more often than those who exercise.
* Most people who have high blood pressure don't know it. Fortunately, if they are made aware of it, most cases of high blood pressure can be controlled by changes in exercise habits and diet.
* The fat content of the average American diet is 100 percent above the recommended level, which is one reason the United States has one of the highest rates of heart disease of any industrialized country.
For many years, companies have assumed the habit of paying for medical costs after the fact and viewed screening and life-style programs as nice things to do for the employees, but not really relevant to the bottom line. Employers are now looking to life-style programs as a method of containing costs.
Because of rising health care costs, the business community is beginning to warm up to lifestyle programs. At a recent business meeting of the Long Island Forum for Technology, the chairman, Fenimore Fisher, commented, ''These types of programs are long overdue. The business community needs to recognize these health programs are an investment in their company, not a cost.''
Life style, or wellness, programs are based on the premise that employees who control their risk factors not only are more productive, but have less need to use costly medical services. This helps the employer maintain a better medical utilization profile, improves employee morale, decreases absenteeism, and boosts productivity.
One survey of company-supported exercise programs documented the effects on the bottom line and found:
* A drop of 50 percent in average absenteeism among program participants compared to the prior year.
* A 20 percent decrease in average disability days.
* A 48 percent reduction in the medical costs of employees who exercised compared to those that did not.
However, wellness is more than making a corporate fitness center available to employees. While staying active is a key to staying healthy, it's not the only important component of a lifestyle program.
Smoking, obesity, stress, diet and lack of awareness of potential health problems are driving medical utilization, and therefore premiums, through the roof. Until people begin taking better care of themselves, the rising costs of health care will not be controlled.
For example, an employer sponsored health screening program provides an opportunity for employees to detect problems like high cholesterol or blood pressure before they turn into more serious health problems, which bring with them tremendous costs in the forms of medical claims and lost productivity.
Dr. Stanley Shannies, president of the Long Island Heart Council, believes organized efforts of these kind are long overdue. ''The stage has been set for the health and business community to start working together to help Long Islanders reduce their health risks due to life-style habits,'' he said. ''Well-organized life-style programs can only have a positive impact on all those involved.''
In terms of the bottom line, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Indiana research found that every $1 invested in a life-style program returned $1.45 in medical claims savings. It has also been established that employees who participate in life-style programs are hospitalized less than other employees and their medical costs increase at a much slower rate.
In addition, when factors like absenteeism are assessed, significant decreases have been found which translates to more productivity. It is estimated that for every 1 percent decrease in absenteeism, a company's profits increase 1 percent.
The time has come for the business community to actively promote the health and well-being of their employees through education and life-style programs. It has become good business sense to help employees stay healthy as a way of controlling rapidly escalating health care costs and protecting the bottom line.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
L.I.R.R. Should Recognize Long Beach's Ties to New York

BYLINE: By Arnold Gumowitz is chairman of the Association for a Better Long Beach.

 BODY:
IF you are one of those individuals who derive pleasure in life from swimming against the tide, it's hard to think of a better place to do it than Long Beach.
Sprawled across the sands of the Atlantic shoreline like a sunbathing stretch of homes, shops and boardwalk, Long Beach is the only city in New York State which is situated entirely on a barrier beach island. With Reynolds Channel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, there is plenty of opportunity for residents to choose the tide best suited to their own stroke.
In Long Beach, people are swimming against the tide in less literal fashion as well. While Long Island, once considered a vast bedroom community for New York City, has been changing its employment focus, Long Beach still maintains economic ties with its urban cousin to the west. 
Like childhood friends going their separate ways, Long Island and New York City have been gradually growing apart. Between 1980 and 1988 the number of jobs on Long Island grew by 25 percent. More than 200,000 people still commute to work in New York City every day, but a vastly larger number of residents, 1.1 million, now earn their living at home on Long Island.
This unexpected change recently forced the Long Island Rail Road to amend its capital improvement program started in 1982. Under this program, the L.I.R.R. planned to meet what it anticipated would be an expanding demand for its commuter services. But the commuter demand leveled off as business and industry grew with the sudden expansion of Long Island's economy during the mid 1980's. With an expanding local economy, more people found work closer to home.
The same boom that boosted Long Island's economic future turned into a bust for the railroad's expansion program. It recently became apparent that there would not be enough new commuters to justify the capital improvement plans adopted 7 years ago. Most of the people going to work on Long Island no longer need the L.I.R.R. to get there. The Dashing Dans of years ago are now concerned about traffic congestion rather than train schedules.
But in Long Beach the tide is still flowing toward New York City, at least during the morning rush hours. Nearly 5,000 people commute from the Long Beach station to New York every day. Many more take their cars over the Loop Parkway and catch the train at other stations, where they can find more convenient service. That's a lot of people going to New York each day from a relatively small city.
So the railroad is still very important to the commuters of Long Beach, and, consequently, those commuters should be important to the rail road. That's why they feel justified in asking the L.I.R.R. to rearrange the existing service to make it more convenient for the people who are most interested in using it.
In this case, the improved service ought to take the form of an express train. The typical train of eight cars holds just under 1,000 people, so there is certainly enough demand generated from Long Beach to fill one express leaving for New York in the morning and returning at night. Because we are looking to rearrange service, rather than place additional demands on the system, it should be possible for the schedule to be made up so that such an express train would take the place of two local trains. This two-for-one swap would be a small price to pay for better service.
A new president is taking the throttle at the L.I.R.R. at a time when the railroad has to contend with increasing competition for riders. Specialized service would be a highly effective marketing tool for encouraging new riders to start with and current riders to stay with the L.I.R.R.
Long Beach is not the only part of Long Island that deserves such service. Many towns on Long Island could support express trains, and the L.I.R.R. should be actively looking to establish special service wherever demand and scheduling considerations make it feasible. As a station at the end of the line, Long Beach would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: To Mr. Floria: Words of Advice

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
EVERY New Jersey governor takes office as the head of a different state. New problems constantly demand different solutions and innovative approaches to deal with economic cycles, a changing population, shifting employment patterns and, lately, global changes that present new challenges and opportunities.
James J. Florio, the Democrat who will become New Jersey's 49th governor on Tuesday, will have to deal with an economic downturn after seven years of rapid growth. Although that will have a chilling effect on his ability to offer new programs that require increased spending, problems persist, change and grow, as well as demand attention.
In a series of interviews, several people outside government who deal with these changes were asked for their thoughts on the challenges that face New Jersey in the immediate future. 
New Jersey's cities require changes in the state's tax system and its reliance on local property taxes if they are ever going to be able to rejoin the economic mainstream, Mr. Roper said.
''We must make building in the inner cities less costly,'' he said. ''And if we do that, it will have an impact on a whole range of social-welfare needs.''
He said revitalized inner cities could provide the financial resources needed to improve urban education. Mr. Roper added, however, that money was not the total answer.
''After 10 years of increased state funding, we still are not providing inner-city youngsters with the skills to compete,'' he said. ''We need the intellectual creativity to define new solutions and new approaches to urban education.''
Along with the new programs must come dedicated and creative managers to make them work, Mr. Roper said, adding that job training and skills development are sorely needed by a work force caught in the shift from a manufacturing economy to one based on services and communications.
''The question we must answer,'' he said, ''is how do we make the most of job training programs to prepare people to move out of manufacturing and participate more effectively in the information and service sectors?''
Mr. Florio has recognized that need and given his Commerce and Labor Commissioners the task of coordinating and condensing the dozens of job-training programs.
Providing affordable housing for the poor and for those forced out of their homes by the excessively high cost of housing, Mr. Roper said, is another pressing need. ''In addition to the poor and moderately poor,'' he said, ''we must also provide for those young married couples buying their first home, the people moving out of their family home for the first time and those who have fallen on hard times and can no longer afford to pay their mortgage or rents.''
Mr. Roper said the state had made a good start in revitalizing some downtown areas in the cities, but said: ''We have not focused enough on reviving the neighborhoods abutting these downtown areas. The people living in these neighborhoods are out of the economic mainstream and worry most about crime and illness, and if we fail to begin to address this problem, it will be inexcusable.''
New Jersey colleges and universities will have to deal with declining high school graduation classes through most of the 90's, Dr. Donaldson said. He added that the schools had to devise programs to meet the needs of more minority students; nontraditional students, whose higher education was interrupted and are returning to the classrooms, and graduate students.
''We will be into the 21st century before we see a high school graduating class as large as the one that graduated in 1988,'' Dr. Donaldson said. That will require schools to do a better job of persuading those students who intend to go out of state that New Jersey colleges and universities ''are every bit as good, or better, than the schools they are thinking of attending.''
The high dropout rate among minority students in high school, he said, is a pattern that is being repeated in New Jersey colleges and universities and requires ''some new strategies to retain our black and Hispanic students.''
''It's not just good social public policy to help our minority students stay in school, but sheer economic necessity that says we must expand our management pool, and the urban minority population has got to help fill that need,'' he said.
The nontraditional and graduate students also have to be prepared and made aware of their importance as potential business managers and engineers who are sorely needed if the state's economy is to continue to develop, Dr. Donaldson said.
He said Fairleigh Dickinson, whose physical plant was largely built in the 1960's, and other institutions had pressing needs to work on their buildings. ''During periods of high inflation, not much maintenance was done, and now we're paying the price,'' he said. ''We must renovate existing facilities and build new ones.''
One possible source of the needed capital, he said, is the business community. In recent years, partnerships between corporations and the state's colleges and universities have grown, as business looks to the schools to provide highly trained workers.
''They've got to continue to invest in our universities, not only to help us do a better job of retaining and teaching students, but to build new facilities,'' Dr. Donaldson said. ''They will derive a direct benefit from a stronger economy.''
He said the schools also had to acquaint their students with international issues. ''We are more and more being caught up in a global economy,'' he said. ''And our students are relatively unsophisticated about the world.''
Mr. Stanton said he believed that the inflated value of real estate had harmed the New Jersey economy and made banks and savings institutions very cautious in considering new loans.
''The value of real estate pretty much got way ahead of itself,'' he said. ''People began to think that a 10 to 12 percent annual growth in the value of their property was a God-given right.''
The leveling of the trend has shaken confidence somewhat and left the real-estate market with a large inventory, Mr. Stanton said, adding, ''It looks like we're in for another difficult year.'' The loss of confidence and the banks' cautious attitude also forecast some earnings problems for banks, he said.
Another troubling prospect, he said, is Mr. Florio's plan to appoint an environmental prosecutor. ''We already have a situation where people sue over perceived environmental threats at the drop of a hat, and this is hurting our economic development,'' he said.
''The oil spill at the Exxon refinery in Linden is an example,'' Mr. Stanton added. ''The state already has impaneled a grand jury just because of the accident.
''I'm worried about the proposed prosecutor because a prosecutor's only job is to 'get' people. From an economic standpoint, creating such a post would be overkill.''
A member of the commission overseeing Liberty State Park, Mr. Stanton said half the agency's budget went to pay legal fees fighting suits to stop the development of the park. ''We won every case, but it's costly,'' he said. ''I recognize that the new governor promised to appoint an environmental prosecutor during his campaign, but it won't be good for our economic climate.''
Mr. Stanton said the economic slowdown was not affecting New Jersey as hard as its neighbors, New York and Pennsylvania. Unemployment is still low, but there is a perception that the state economy has some stresses and that to meet them Mr. Florio will have to consider raising taxes. ''He may have to bite that bullet, and the sooner the better,'' Mr. Stanton said. ''If there is a central theme to improving our protection of the environment,'' Mr. Moore said, ''it's better growth management. This could lead to solving a lot of other problems.''
By creating buffer zones around water resources and streams, the amount of pollution that runs into the waterways and eventually forms slicks of debris along the ocean beachfront could be reduced, he said, adding:
''Non-point source pollution is generated primarily by runoff into streams and waterways. And maximizing the natural environment by preventing development in buffer zones around our waterways will protect against the problem.
Mr. Moore suggested that ocean pollution could be reduced by mapping and repairing the storm-water system and equipping it with devices to trap debris before the water pours into the ocean and that parking lots and highways should also be equipped to prevent debris from entering the storm drains.
Reducing vehicular travel in the most densely populated state also would improve air quality, Mr. Moore said. ''Instead of allowing people to spread out all over the landscape, development should be encouraged where it reduces the number of miles people travel between their homes and where they work and shop,'' he said.
He also said the state should resist pressure on the Department of Environmental Protection to speed up or reduce its examinations of development that might harm the environment. ''For many types of licenses, there is already a 90-day time limit for D.E.P. action,'' he said. ''If people weren't always trying to beat the system, things would go smoothly. But they are always seeking variances from local zoning boards and exceptions to state regulations, and that takes time.''
The major problems facing New Jersey and the nation, Dr. Bergen said, are health care and its cost.
''It's rapidly becoming an overwhelming problem, and industries and business find they must compete in a global economy and they no longer sustain the increased health-care costs for their employees,'' he said. ''And the state is finding it difficult to provide care for the medically indigent and the unemployed. The price tag is just getting out of hand.
''We're hearing nationally that there are 38 million people who have no access to health care because they are poor, do piecework or work for small companies that are not required to provide health insurance.''
Dr. Bergen said he believed that the problems were rapidly approaching a breaking point and that it would probably require all the parts of the health care system, providers, patients and payers, to join in devising controls on costs and assurances of quality.
He said the public would have to be on guard to make sure that institutions and physicians did not sacrifice quality.
Dr. Bergen said he agreed with the incoming Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, and Mr. Florio that drug abuse is the major health problem in the state. ''And closely connected with that, of course, is the problem of AIDS,'' he added. ''Individual drug abusers make up our major AIDS population, and they are spreading the disease to other members of their community and outside the community.''
The treatment of AIDS, with its growing number of patients and new treatments that can prolong lives, also increases health costs, he said, adding:
''We must develop out-of-hospital techniques for some of these patients, ambulatory care or hospice care, and not lock up all of our beds with AIDS patients. We must continue to pursue a course of educating the public on how AIDS is transmitted. And we have to make sure it gets across in school, when talking about drug abuse and sex education.''

HEADLINE: Turnpike Seen as Metaphor for America

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
POSING for newspaper photos on a small hill overlooking the New Jersey Turnpike here, a Rutgers University professor turned to a colleague standing beside him.
''I always expect to see a gun sticking out a window,'' said Prof. Angus Kress Gillespie, gesturing toward the Turnpike Authority headquarters, which rise on a knoll above the toll plaza at Exit 9 and the authority's heliport.
''That's because you're afraid of authority,'' the colleague, Prof. Michael Aaron Rockland, said. The two professors of American studies have written ''Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' poking fun at the authority and holding that the quintessential New Jersey highway is so bad it's good. They also see the superhighway as a metaphor for America in many ways. ''The turnpike represents a number of American ideas and values,'' they wrote. ''Built as economically as possible, with virtually no attention to esthetics, the turnpike is the embodiment of American pragmatism and of the triumph of function over form. Offering its patrons virtually no amenities and with an exclusively bottom-line approach to management, the turnpike is an unabashed shrine to American materialism.'' 
While giving credit to the authority, which they compare to a paramilitary organization, for efficiency, the writers accuse the authority of making the collection of revenue its top priority and courtesy to the public last. They contend that the agency's ''virtual political and economic independence'' has created an arrogance that ''has trickled down to turnpike employes on every level, including, most notably, some of the state police who patrol the turnpike.''
The book includes a Kafkaesque tale that explains Dr. Gillespie's wariness. A motorist was arrested, and convicted, for taking pictures of an accident caused by a trooper. The writers contend that the turnpike regulations, posted in fine print at entrances where they are virtually impossible to read, can be interpreted to mean that no pictures can be taken on the turnpike, or even of the road.
The authority responds that the professors have misread the law, which is aimed at keeping people, for their own safety, from walking on the roadway and that, with the authority's permission, photos can be taken on the road by professional photographers for publication, even in books like ''Looking for America.'' The 219-page book, however, features drawings.
Nonetheless, Dr. Gillespie said, he still is a bit apprehensive when posing for newspaper pictures against a turnpike background, despite a growing number of requests since the book was published in November. The Rutgers University Press, in New Brunswick, has started a second printing, after an initial run of 5,000. The book's price is $18.95.
Newspapers in New Jersey, as well as The Philadelphia Inquirer and The News Leader in Richmond, where Dr. Gillespie went to high school, have published articles on the book, and ''The 11th Hour'' on WNET-TV featured it.
The book's success has prompted the writers, longtime friends, to continue their friendly banter. The calm Dr. Gillespie, 47 years old, presents a tie, sweater and blazer to the frenetic Dr. Rockland, 54, the chairman of the department, who favors jeans, turtleneck sweater and leather jacket.
In an interview near Exit 9 and in Dr. Rockland's office, they acknowledged that the ''redneck law-and-order type'' Professor Gillespie and the ''knee-jerk liberal'' Professor Rockland, as they call each other, had different views about the turnpike.
Dr. Gillespie tended to find what the turnpike did well; Dr. Rockland tended to be critical. They divided the writing of the chapters, mercilessly rewrote each other's efforts and continued to ''thrash'' things out over two years.
Dr. Gillespie, a specialist in folklore, said he thought up the idea for the book as a graduate student while reading about the Brooklyn Bridge as artifact with cultural implications.
''I can't say there's one moment when it hit me, like Paul on the road to Damascus,'' he said. ''It was just a big artifact that kind of invited explanation.''
Although he began research in 1979, he put off writing the book until Dr. Rockland joined him.
The title comes from a line from the 1968 Simon and Garfunkel song ''America,'' about a young traveler who is ''empty and aching'' and doesn't know why, ''Countin' the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike/And they've all come to look for America.''
As much as that song captures the alienation of America in the late 60's, other songs the authors cite touch other values, from the expansiveness and freedom of the 50's in Chuck Berry's ''You Can't Catch Me'' to the spiritual malaise of the 80's, as expressed in Bruce Springsteen's ''State Trooper.''
That ambiguity runs through the book deliberately, said Dr. Rockland, who was born in the Bronx.
''That's our premise, I think, that this thing is so powerful it attracts us and repels us,'' he said. ''Not alternately, but simultaneously.''
They write that for residents the turnpike is the ''most important common experience,'' the ''source of what it means to be a New Jerseyan,'' who can appreciate its efficiency but despise it as ''a source of New Jersey's negative image.''
For out-of-staters, it is one of the ''central experiences of the East Coast,'' evoking ''powerful images of dense traffic combined with an industrial landscape and chemically fouled air.''
Although rural and somewhat nondescript in the south, the turnpike takes its identity from the northern, industrialized 35-mile section, a stretch so overwhelming in its ''world class ugliness,'' the authors wrote, that it has become synonymous with the entire highway in the consciousness of most people. Especially overwhelming for the authors is the Newark Airport area, inspiring them to write:
''With Newark Airport on one side, Port Elizabeth on the other; with the flames of the refineries and huge tank farms of petroleum; with planes roaring in one after another, so close one is sure a Lockheed Tri-Star is going to land on the roof of one's automobile; with the giant cranes of the container shipping port seeming to stalk across the land on their long legs like Martian war machines in 'War of the Worlds' - one is impressed almost to speechlessness by the sheer, raw power of this technological landscape. Hideous, yes. But theater that rivals anything on Broadway ten miles to the northeast.''
A spokesman for the authority, Gordon Hector, said he had ordered 12 copies for officials of the authority. His reading of the book, Mr. Hector said, was that it was ''fair and even-handed.'' Aside from saying that the professors had misread the regulation on taking photos, he said he would not rebut the book, adding, ''We certainly are not going to shoot them.''

HEADLINE: JAPAN STILL WARY OF LOANS TO CHINA

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Despite the lifting of martial law in Beijing last week, Government officials say Japan is not prepared to resume talks on arranging $5.6 billion in loans suspended after the Chinese crackdown in Tiananmen Square in June.
Sounding a similar cautionary note, Japanese businessmen who welcomed the suspension of martial law, which took effect in Beijing on Wednesday, also said in interviews that they would be slow to resume a high level of investment activity in China because of concern about the country's political stability.
As the biggest donor of economic assistance to China, Japan has reacted cautiously to its neighbor in recent months, frequently reminding the United States and other countries that it was not in their interest to impose heavy sanctions on Beijing.
At a New Year's news conference, for instance, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reiterated Japan's position that sanctions would only reinforce a feeling of defensiveness in China, perhaps driving it into the Soviet Union's camp or making it dangerously mistrustful of other countries in Asia. 
 
Opposes Isolation of China
''To isolate China will not be good for world peace and stability,'' Mr. Kaifu said. Apparently mindful of public outrage over the crackdown last year, he said he hoped that China would ''carry out the consolidation of its environment in a way easily understandable to the West.''
Mr. Kaifu said that Japan intended to renew the aid it had frozen after Beijing imposed repressive measures last year, but that talks on the matter would probably not come until the spring.
Japanese officials said they still intended to send back a Chinese man who is charged with hijacking an Air China plane on Dec. 16 and forcing it to fly to Fukuoka, in southern Japan.
The hijacking suspect, identified as Zhang Zhenhai, asserts that he took part in the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. He has said he will appeal in Japanese courts for permission to seek political asylum in Japan.
 
Suspect Claims Political Status
Lawyers from the Fukuoka Bar Association's human rights committee have said Mr. Zhang argues that he is a political refugee. But the Japanese Government said it understood that he was charged with embezzlement in China and was free on bail when he committed the hijacking.
''Even if Zhang was involved in June's pro-democracy demonstration, resorting to inhuman methods like hijacking can never be pardoned,'' said Mayumi Moriyama, the Chief Cabinet Secretary.
Mr. Zhang was transferred to Tokyo this week from a hospital near the airport. He was injured when someone pushed him out of the plane and onto the tarmac at the airport in Fukuoka after the hijacking.
The centerpiece of Japanese aid to China was a $3.3 billion loan program that is near completion, although most of the projects were unfinished when they were frozen in June. Japan has resumed many of them since August.
 
Talks, but No Pledges So Far
Future aid for China, including a $5.6 billion program announced in 1988 by Noboru Takeshita when he was Prime Minister, remains suspended. That program is to run from 1990 to 1995.
In the last week, Japan has announced that it will step up discussions of general economic matters with China by sending a high-level aid official to Beijing after the visit here this month of the head of the Chinese State Planning Commission, Zou Jiahua.
Prime Minister Kaifu also has decided to send Koichiro Matsuura, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Cooperation Bureau, to Beijing next week. Mr. Matsuura has been traveling with Mr. Kaifu in Europe, where he announced an aid program for Poland and Hungary this week.
But a Foreign Ministry spokesman said those talks would not necessarily lead to the resumption of aid to China. He said only that officials wanted to learn about Chinese plans, including measures to liberalize its economy.
''A simple visit by the director general does not mean the start of extending yen loans,'' said Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry spokesman.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Amid the Jealousies, a Suspicion That the U.N. Works

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
''A dangerous place'' - that was how Daniel Patrick Moynihan described the United Nations when he served there as the United States representative in the mid-1970's, a time of ferocious East-West rivalry.
Thomas R. Pickering, who now holds the job, likes to call it a ''useful place,'' and this view was widely echoed as the 44th General Assembly concluded business last month.
Infused with what the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Vladimir F. Petrovsky, called ''the spirit of superpower detente and cooperation,'' this year's Assembly approved an unparalleled volume of international ''legislation'' with the potential to change the way the world works.
Among other things, it agreed to ban fishing with immense nets that sweep great areas of the ocean free of marine life; to draft a treaty to stabilize the world climate; to set up a world action program to fight drug trafficking, and to extend human rights guarantees to children. 
The Security Council has turned its attention toward seeking peace in Cambodia after coaxing Namibia toward independence, beginning a peacekeeping operation in Central America, and prodding Arab League mediators to cobble together another fragile peace accord in Lebanon.
Yet when the Academic Council on the United Nations System brought academics and diplomats together here on Jan. 5-7 to examine the future of the United Nations, the discussion centered more on the difficulties faced by the organization than on its potential.
 
A North-South Split
Despite the easing of East-West tensions, the effectiveness of the United Nations as a forum for global agreement remains impaired by a widening North-South split between industrialized and developing nations, and by growing doubts about Washington's interest in multilateral action.
Echoes of the North-South split were audible during the Assembly's difficult debates on the environment and drugs, when developing countries tried to barter their support for promises of economic aid.
And in Ottawa, Mexico's deputy representative, Olga Pellicer, argued that the issues that industrialized countries want the United Nations to emphasize - drugs, the environment, terrorism and refugees - are of greatest concern to rich countries.
Poorer nations struggling to bring their economic difficulties to center stage at the United Nations are blocked by the United States, which believes that development springs from domestic policies, not international action.
Ahmed Osman, a retired Egyptian diplomat, said that while the group of developing countries that consider themselves nonaligned might appear irrelevant at a time of eased tensions between the Washington and Moscow, the third world must keep its agenda before the world community to insure its survival.
John Trent, a professor of political science at Ottawa University, said that the third world is forced to raise its voice to avoid becoming ''marginalized'' as Western countries refocus their aid and attention on Eastern Europe and new technologies reduce the demand for poor countries' raw materials.
But Assistant Secretary General James O. C. Jonah expressed doubt that the conflict over agendas could be resolved easily. ''Why should the United States change its attitude when Eastern Europe is accepting the market economy as the motor of development?'' he asked.
 
Envying the 5 Powers
During the General Assembly session, the third world's assertiveness killed British proposals to give the Security Council a role in the fight against drug trafficking and to simplify discussions of economic and social issues.
The defeat of the drug proposal showed that the developing world is bent on blocking any expansion of the Security Council, and thus the power of the five countries with permanent seats and veto power - Britain, China, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
The defeat of the second item demonstrated the third world's impatience with demands for cost-cutting and for greater efficency, goals that Humphrey A. Asobie, a professor at the University of Nigeria, dismissed as ''a Western concept.''
It is not just the poor countries that are jealous of the permanent Security Council members. As Canada's deputy representative, Phillipe Kirsch, observed, detente allows the five to work together for peace, but also arouses fear they will form a directorate to run the United Nations. Indignation at U.S. At the General Assembly, as well as at the Ottawa conference, the liveliest debate came over United States attitudes toward the United Nations.
The Bush Administration's blunt threat to resort again to withholding funds even though it already owes the United Nations more than $500 million, killed an Arab effort to win recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization as a state by the last General Assembly.
But at the Ottawa meeting, Washington's threat was seen both as an attempt to extend the nation's Security Council veto into the General Assembly, and as a sign that the United States remains uncomfortable with the give and take of multilateral diplomacy.
Jane Becker, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau for International Organization Affairs, argued that the United Nations is in ''a transitional phase,'' becoming more relevant and gaining support from the United States Congress.
But if the P.L.O. seeks to join the World Health Organization again in April, or Vice President Dan Quayle pursues the repeal of a 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism, some believe that another bout of American withholding could be seen again this year.

HEADLINE: THE U.S. AND PANAMA;
New Government Starts To Put Panama on Track

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Slowly, sometimes painfully, the new civilian Government here has begun grappling with the problems of getting post-Noriega Panama up and running again.
There are already some success stories.
In the three and a half weeks since President Guillermo Endara was sworn in, hours after an American invasion force ended the six-year rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, basic municipal services have been restored, and many schools and banks are preparing to reopen.
On Monday, Mr. Endara is expected to meet his first full, on-time payroll, issuing salary checks to more than 100,000 Government employees. 
In the capital and many outlying areas, garbage collectors have resumed regular pickups, many of them driving trucks repaired with the help of American troops. Street lamps and traffic lights, scores of which were shot out in the fighting, have been fixed.
 
Sewers Still Need Work
Telephone service, water and electricity have been restored ''pretty much to pre-conflict levels,'' a American military adviser said, although the sewer system, parts of which were apparently sabotaged, still needs work.
Airports are struggling back toward normalcy. On Saturday, the runway of a local airstrip known as Paitilla - the scene of a fierce firefight Dec. 20 between Navy commandos and Panamanian troops - was finally cleared of debris, including General Noriega's damaged private jet, which was carried away by an American helicopter.
But despite the progress, President Endara, a 52-year-old lawyer who had never held public office before, presides over a largely untested group of leaders who have not had nearly enough time to begin to free themselves of dependence on the United States for armed protection, financial aid and technical advice.
On Saturday, the newly appointed American Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, said the remaining 20,000 American troops in Panama would be withdrawn either to their bases here or to the United States as soon as possible, ''hopefully in a matter of weeks.'' Seven thousand troops have returned to the United States so far.
But Panamanian officials say they cannot possibly attend to the country's most pressing needs without a continuing American military presence, certainly for many months to come.
 
'We Need Their Help'
''There's a very strong desire, not only in the Government but among Panamanians generally, to keep the troops here much longer than the U.S. wants,'' Louis Martinz, a senior Endara aide, said today. ''We need their help simply because we can't do everything at once.''
Many ordinary Panamanians also seem haunted by the fear that without the troops in the streets, diehard Noriega loyalists might someday try to strike back with terrorist tactics.
In the last week, 300 civil-affairs advisers from the American military -half of them reservists, all under the supervision of American Embassy and the civilian Agency for International Development - have begun answering requests from such ministries as Health, Education, Public Works and the new police agency known as the Public Forces for suggestions on how to solve specific problems and reorganize their bureaucracies.
Another area in which the Americans are expected to be generous with their advice is in the formation of a new, corruption-free criminal justice system.
With an avalanche of Panamanian charges expected against scores of former Noriega loyalists, the courts will be especially busy. The Supreme Court, which was packed with the general's appointees, has already begun work with a new cast of justices.
 
Criminal Inquiries Begin
Although no indictments have been issued yet, in the last week the Attorney General, Rogelio Cruz, announced that criminal investigations had begun into the activities of many former Noriega loyalists, both military men and civilians.
Over the weekend, the new Comptroller General, Ruben Dario Carles, disclosed that while going through documents left behind by his predecessor, he discovered evidence of what appeared to be a $36.5 million slush fund set aside for the personal needs of the eight civilian Presidents who served under either General Noriega or his predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera.
''All of these investigations are going to take a long time,'' Mr. Martinz said. ''We haven't had access to government documents in 21 years.''
Others doubt the process will be that time-consuming.
''Basically, we know who all the corrupt people are,'' said I. Roberto Eisenmann Jr., publisher and editor in chief of the daily La Prensa. ''This is a very small country; everybody knew who was in what business and how much they were making. Typically, a lot of overnight millionaires were connected to a major here or a colonel there.''
 
Rooting Out the Untrustworthy
Apart from the task of investigating past corruption, Mr. Endara must also balance the task of rooting out untrustworthy holdovers from the old regime without crippling the staffs of the various ministries in the process.
The Endara Government's biggest single problem is building a police force capable of maintaining public order, guarding the Panama Canal and keeping the country free of drug traffickers - while at the same time remaining fully answerable to the civilian authorities.
The new Government's continuing reliance on American troops is a direct consequence of the fact that when General Noriega's 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces collapsed in defeat, the country was left not only without an army, but without customs and immigration authorities; a municipal, port and transit police; a presidential guard; a coast guard, and even a forestry police.
So far, the newly formed Public Force, a 1,000-member police agency composed of former Noriega troops, is keeping order in the streets by patrolling jointly with American combat units. The only ones on their own are 150 traffic police officers posted at intersections.
Panamanians are vigorously debating the ultimate size and duties of the Public Force, whose long-term reliability worries many people.
Some officials have expressed concern that if Panama follows the recommendations of American officials to endow the force with specialized anti-narcotics-trafficking powers, it could someday become powerful enough to threaten the civilian Government.
But Mr. Endara's First Vice Preident, Ricardo Arias Calderon, whose office supervises the Public Force, said he was confident that the new Government would be able to keep the police on a short leash.
''They will always be fully under the financial control of the Comptroller General's office,'' he said.
As for hiring former Noriega soldiers, officials say there was no way around it if Panama was to move quickly to build its own force; there was no time to train new personnel.
At the same time, the Government is facing intense pressure from Panama's business leaders, who are fearful of labor problems ahead unless there is quick assistance from the United States to ''jump start'' commercial activity, mainly in financial services and retail industry, the traditional mainstays of the Panamanian ecomomy.
Many of the hundreds of merchants whose inventories were stripped by looters warn that officials must move quickly to persuade Washington to give Panama millions of dollars in relief money to help put commerce back on its feet.
''Six thousand unemployed workers is one thing in a dictatorship,'' said a shoe manufacturer whose 375 employees were thrown out of work by the looting that occurred during the fighting. ''It's a whole other story in a democracy.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Scoring Political Points On Social Security Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Despite Republican claims, Federal taxes over all were not cut in the Reagan-Bush years. But Democrats have failed to persuade voters of that, or to call attention to the way the mix of taxes has changed.
That is mostly what is behind Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut the Social Security payroll tax.
The New York Democrat has already succeeded in scoring political points by embarrassing President Bush, forcing the White House to express disapproval of a plan that would cut workers' taxes by more than $60 billion in the next two years. That, from a President who has made opposition to higher taxes the cornerstone of his political philosophy. 
And Senator Moynihan, who offered his plan just before New Year's Day and then left for Africa on a trip for the Foreign Relations Committee, has also managed to generate an unusual amount of debate on two points that he and some other Democrats have been harping on without much notice for years.
The first is that in the last decade lower income taxes were offset by higher Social Security taxes. The proportion of Federal taxes paid now is just under 20 percent of the gross national product, the same as at the beginning of the last decade.
Income taxes were sharply reduced. The top rate in the 1980's fell to 28 percent from 70 percent, providing a boon to the wealthy and some tax relief for the middle class and the working poor.
But at the same time, payroll taxes went way up. As of Jan. 1, workers and their employers are each paying 7.65 percent, 6.2 percent for retirement under Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The tax is paid on the first $51,300 earned. At the beginning of the decade, the payroll rate was 6.13 percent on the first $29,700 of income.
Nearly three-quarters of all Americans now pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. In the view of many Democrats, that is an abomination. Income taxes increase the more a taxpayer earns. Social Security taxes, on the other hand, are paid at the same rate by all workers, and those making $500,000 a year pay no more than those making $51,300. This year, the maximum payroll tax will total $3,924.45.
Senator Moynihan's other point is that the growing surplus of Social Security revenue, which will exceed $250 billion by the year 2000, is being used to mask the deficit in the Government's operating budget rather than to guarantee pension benefits for today's workers when they retire.
In the current fiscal year, the Government is taking in $65 billion more in Social Security taxes than it is paying out in benefits. If it were not for the Social Security surplus, the deficit, by the Bush Administration's accounting, would be more than half again what it says it is, about $165 billion instead of $100 billion. The main reason the overall deficit has fallen in recent years is not so much that spending has been cut, but that Social Security taxes have been increased.
Using Social Security revenue in effect for day-to-day government expenses, Mr. Moynihan says, is a perversion of the reason a schedule of rising payroll taxes was set in 1983. The Senator was a key member of a Presidential commission that established the new rates.
The theory behind the new rates, he says, was to allow money to be invested in productive ventures, thus promoting economic growth and producing the revenue needed for retirement benefits in the next century.
Mr. Moynihan says that since that is not being done, the only reasonable action is to cut the Social Security tax rate. He would reduce it this year to 6.06 percent (7.51 percent with Medicare), where it was in 1989, and reduce it further in 1991 to 5.1 percent (6.55 percent with Medicare). So far, only a few conservative Republicans and no Democrats have embraced the proposal. But tax cuts are so popular that lawmakers may feel compelled to vote for the plan if Mr. Moynihan presses his case.
Democratic leaders are hoping he will not do so. They are glorying in the political mileage the Senator is getting, but deep down they think the last thing the country needs is a tax cut of any kind.
''The Moynihan proposal reflects our frustration,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader. But like the other leaders in the House and the Senate, he said he was unwilling to make a commitment.

Flavors of Capitalism

BYLINE: By Nicholas Wade

 BODY:
Free trade is best, everyone agrees, but what should the United States do when its partners distort trade by closing their markets or targeting special industries for support? The answer is a subject of hot debate, as demonstrated anew in a study group commissioned by the Twentieth Century Fund, a New York research foundation. The group divided so sharply it issued two reports, one favoring traditional free trade, the other calling for revision of trade policy.
The focus of the debate is that the United States doesn't seem to be as good at making things as it once was. Japan's pre-eminence in cars, consumer electronics and some semiconductors is one visible symptom. The decline in America's export of high-technology goods is another. To most economists, the cause lies almost entirely in the overall weaknesses of the U.S. economy, like the high Federal deficit and low savings rate. 
''We have problems, but they are not made in Tokyo or Brussels: they are made here,'' said Herbert Stein, the economist who spoke for the free traders. ''We reject the notion that the United States should embark upon an industrial policy, meaning Government should select industries that need particular support.''
Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade negotiator with Japan, replied that when countries like Japan and Korea target particular industries for government support it is impossible to have open markets. The U.S. regularly complains that these practices are unfair, but the accusations cause only friction, not freer trade. Better to accept, says Mr. Prestowitz, that other countries regard the possession of certain industries as a national necessity, like the Europeans with Airbus, and to manage trade in such targeted sectors by agreement.
Free traders reject managed or ''results-oriented'' trade because the results are rarely as expected. U.S. sugar policy costs consumers more than $1 billion a year. The import quotas demanded by the U.S. auto industry only induced Honda, Toyota and Nissan to transfer production to the United States, and to switch to luxury cars instead of ''econoboxes.'' Better to agree on rules for open trading rather than try to fix the results.
But the hands-off approach, say the trade policy revisionists, is fatal when Japan targets an industry and drives out American companies. It matters a lot, they say, whether the U.S. is a maker of wood chips - or computer chips. Even after the U.S. has put its economic house in order, it will still face the fact that Japan practices a different flavor of capitalism, which gives its companies special advantages over their American competitors.
The free traders, in their Twentieth Century Fund report, concede that Japan's brilliant record of growth has been ''accompanied by a pervasive system of managed trade'' and that Japan has reduced its trade barriers only under intense foreign pressure. But Japan's targeting of high technology is unlikely to relegate the U.S. to second-class industrial status, the free traders say. The revisionists reply that the U.S. cannot let its economic future be ''dictated by the narrow and chauvinistic trade and industrial policies of other countries.''
What is society to do when even an expert group like this splits down the middle? Surely it should heed the advice of economists, almost all of whom back the free traders, by investing more, and having Government overspend less. But even economists might concede a little disquiet when whole industries, like consumer electronics or semiconductor equipment, seem headed for oblivion. Just in case their prescriptions prove insufficient, maybe the problems of particular industries are also a fit subject for government concern. NICHOLAS WADE

HEADLINE: Lift Manufacturing Ban on Phone Companies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''How to Rewire America'' (editorial, Jan. 1) raises the question of whether or not it is time to remove restrictions against the entry of telephone companies into cable television, as a means of making it economically feasible for them to hook up every home with fiber-optic cable. You might have added that local cable companies are deregulated and ought therefore not be protected from competition - provided that competitors are assured of free and fair access to such phone company networks.
We should also examine the other legal restraints on telephone companies to exploit modern telecommunications technology. The one that seems to me ripest for elimination is the ban, six years old Jan. 1, on manufacture of communications equipment by Bell operating companies. 
The prohibition made sense as long as the American Telephone & Telegraph Company was a single national telephone monopoly because that enabled it to monopolize equipment manufacture as well. But now manufacturing is highly competitive; and A.T.& T.'s local telephone business is in the hands of seven regional companies, no one of which offers a captive market sufficient to permit it to dominate the manufacturing business.
The danger remains that the local Bell companies would buy equipment from their manufacturing affiliates at inflated prices, hoping to pass costs on to captive customers. But the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory agencies can hold these transfer prices to cost plus a reasonable return. The regulators would also have open-market competitive prices against which to test interaffiliate transfers.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing prohibition confronts the telephone companies with the threat of a contempt citation if ever they cross the boundary from research and development, in which they are very heavily engaged, to manufacturing. To a scientist or engineer that distinction is arbitrary: the essence of innovation is the play of information and ideas between basic research and marketing.
For example, one of the companies, Nynex, entered a partnership in 1986 with Citicorp and RCA for development of an inexpensive terminal to give telephone users electronic access to information services like directory listings, bill paying, banking and shopping by phone, but Nynex had to drop out because it could not cooperate consistently with the manufacturing prohibition. While big business users have all those capabilities available to them through their own computers and switches, the telephone company has the greatest incentive to make them available to all its subscribers.
The prohibition on manufacturing no longer serves its antitrust purpose; now, I think, it does more harm than good.

HEADLINE: New Parks Commissioner Has Opportunity to Do a Lot of Good

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Cheers for Elizabeth F. Gotbaum, New York City's new Parks Commissioner, the first woman to hold this office (news article, Dec. 28). She could become the most important official in Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration, but it will require courage to review the imperatives that came from City Hall during the last decade, to question the directives that will come from City Hall in the years ahead and to place the public needs of the 1990's before special interests. The commissioner's stature would be measured by her willingness to ask hard questions. 
The last decade in the city's parks was marked by an obsession with massive, multimillion-dollar construction projects. By comparison, only a pittance was spent on maintaining the grounds. This, coupled with the past administration's view of recreation as theatrical entertainment, further threatened our parks.
In Prospect Park, an outdoor theater rushed to completion at spectacular cost, has vilified the landscape with the ugliest structure ever built. Now, a needless $22 million redesign of the nearby Grand Army Plaza is in the works, and the administrator talks dangerously of building another Wollman Rink, this time on a hilltop.
In Central Park, the department has been striving to enlarge theater offerings, first on a pier on Belvedere Lake, defeated by public outcry, and now with a high-tech, airport-style stage on the Mall, temporarily shelved by protest from every community planning board. The Parks Department persists and is prepared to spend millions for Broadway theatrical entertainment in the park.
The new commissioner is fortunate to have former commissioner Gordon Davis as adviser; she can find no better guide than his great 1980 park policy statement, which closed Central Park to Christo's fantasy of gates. But Mr. Davis is also respons-ible for advancing the policy he termed ''load shedding,'' a disavowal of responsibility and ceding of management to concessionaires, heavily subsidized, invited to take over sections of the park.
In Central Park, the Administrator proclaims the need for a restaurant at the Harlem Meer, unprecedented in the park's history, a banquet-catering hall, whose enlarged size is dictated by the need of the concessionaires for profits. Restaurants will no more eliminate drugs, the excuse here, than they will revive dwindling attendance at the Metropolitan Museum's Lehman Wing, over which another restaurant is to be built. Central Park has never been so threatened.
The new commissioner's urgent task is to appoint, as first deputy, a professionally trained horticulturist and to work with him or her to make our parks labor intensive. This would stand in contrast to the high point of the past parks administration, dedicating a new five-borough motor pool on Randalls Island.
Mrs. Gotbaum has a rare opportunity. The Parks Department is one city agency that can hire large numbers of the unemployed and the unskilled for maintenance and modest capital projects. They are always with us, otherwise without prospect of meaningful work.

Baltics + Z - F.S.R.

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To their credit, the unreconstructed roundheels of The New York Times editorial pages gave extended space recently to an anonymous hard-line analysis, signed ''Z,'' that has caused a fearsome fluttering in the dovecotes.
Z argues that Mr. Gorbachev's announced plan for reforming the Communist system while retaining central control is hopeless; consequently, whatever the West does to help him postpone the day of free markets and a multiparty system only prolongs the agony of the exit from Communism.
Keep the pressure on, is Z's import; economic desperation causes political movement. I would add that our State Department mantra of ''stability,'' its go-slow admonitions to radicals and Mr. Bush's unstinting offer of economic aid to Moscow -untied to systemic change - help only those roll-with-the-punch totalitarians who will cling to as much power as they can. 
My Times colleagues' response: Since Gorbachev's rise, ''hard-liners have strained to find new rationales for old cold war animosities.'' Ad whominem? At me and him. Psycho-hangups aside, we hard-liners are said to ''duck the critical fact that the likely alternatives to Mr. Gorbachev would be far worse for Western interests.''
Revivified accommodationists, so wrong for so long about our policy of stressing the Soviet system, find what they consider a contradiction. They discover in Z's analysis ''what Western liberals and moderates have been urging all along - arms control and cooperative arrangements to develop market structures and joint economic ventures . . .''
Wrong. To soft-liners, arms control means a hurry-up strategic missile treaty, which would save the Russians vast sums while retaining their superpower threat; to hard-liners, arms control means first getting Soviet troops and tanks out of Eastern Europe, so that an end to occupation is not linked to Mr. Gorbachev's shaky personal fortunes.
Here is another difference between softs and hards: freedom for the Baltic peoples.
I have a large Bernese Mountain dog who bounds in out of the snow to lie on her back, paws splayed in every direction, in hopes of getting her belly scratched. This is the current State Department position on Baltic independence.
For 50 years, the U.S. has refused to acknowledge the Hitler-Stalin deal that forced Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into becoming ''Soviet Socialist Republics.'' Nine U.S. Presidents have supported their independence-asserting legations in Washington.
With freedom now imminent, the Balts hear our State Department spokesman say their status is a Soviet ''internal matter.'' Why couldn't we cut the hand-wringing and say instead:
''The United States reasserts its longstanding recognition of Baltic independence. We applaud the peaceful but resolute way the Baltic peoples have recently demonstrated their desire for freedom.
''As these three countries gain their freedom in fact, we are prepared to join with the Soviet Union and European nations to create a Baltic Convertible Currency Zone. We will encourage a private economy capable of replacing the command system, speeding the day of a convertible ruble and the opening of Soviet markets.''
Such a targeted approach is a far cry from the tell-us-what-you-want, we-won't-rock-your-boat offer of trade by the eager Mr. Bush at Malta. One way requires genuine change; the other permits cosmetic change.
Here's the beauty part: Centrifugal agitation is now causing Mr. Gorbachev to rethink his insistence on one-party monopoly. He doesn't need tacit understanding from freedom-seekers; he needs a shove. Only then can he continue to play the man in the middle.
That's why some hard-liners here for the past year have been focusing on the Baltic states as the testing ground for real Soviet change. The freeing of six states of the empire has been breathtaking, but Baltic unrest reaches across what Moscow considers its border.
Mr. Gorbachev went to Lithuania to act against his words: in waggling a finger against inevitable separatism, he plunged ahead to ''I see no tragedy in a multiparty system.''
What brought about this high-wire flip-flop on the essence of one-party control - gentle accommodation by the Balts? Just the opposite.
Only unrelenting pressure from inside and out, accompanied by Red Army refusal to back political power with firepower, can change the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics into a less militarist F.S.R. - a Federation of Soviet Republics. While soft-liners are struck dumb with delight, hard-liners will keep pressing.

A Needed Revolution

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
On the anniversary of Martin Luther King's birthday, those who have grown complacent about the racial situation in America can find plenty of evidence - if they'll look - that his work is not finished, and nowhere less so than in education.
As only one example, a state survey shows that 58 percent of black high school seniors in Maryland, compared with 76 percent of whites, plan to pursue higher education. But 22 percent of black male seniors intend to join the military, as against only 9 percent of whites.
Americans do not have to be liberal do-gooders to worry about that, because it vitally concerns their economic future. In the 1990's, only 2 of 10 new entrants in the American work force will be white males. Therefore, as Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, put it:
''If we are to compete effectively in the world economy, we need minority and poor youngsters to produce, rather than become dependent on us or shoot at us.'' 
Nor is it the problem, as all too many white Americans - some in positions of authority - seem to think, that minority students either can't or don't want to learn.
Evidence of their capacities was the only good news in a recent study made public by the Secretary of Education, Lauro F. Cavazos. It showed that the reading and writing skills of all American students -white or black - were ''dreadfully inadequate,'' requiring ''a revolution in teaching and learning.''
Black and Hispanic pupils, however, showed strong improvement in reading skills; white students made no such gains. Even so, 17-year-old whites remained about 20 points above minority youths in the study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. That suggests how far the education system has to go to achieve satisfactory performance for all.
It's not true, either - despite the ritual belief of many skeptical Americans - that funds spent on compensatory education programs for minority students are a waste of taxpayers' money. Officials of the assessment board said that older students had benefited considerably from preschool education programs like Head Start. One reason black and Hispanic students displayed greater gains than whites, in fact, was that many of the former had more directly benefited from such compensatory programs.
Nevertheless, ''a glaring gap between minority and non-minority educational achievement'' remains, another national study reported, because too many minority students ''still attend schools that are both separate and unequal.''
Again, that is, or should be, everybody's concern; as Shirley McBray, the study director, pointed out:
''Nearly one-quarter of all Americans are minority and by 2020 [only 30 years from now], at least one-third of the nation will be non-white.''
That study, financed by the Carnegie Corporation, was conducted over two years, at a cost of $1.2 million, by a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The many recommendations it made contradict another popular myth - that compensatory programs only benefit minorities. That might be the case with one proposal, to revise curriculums to reflect the culture of minorities; but most of the report's proposals clearly would benefit pupils of all races - nutrition assistance to the poor, for example, reduced class sizes, an extended school year, summer residencies on college campuses to improve older pupils' math and science skills and school aid for all children from welfare families.
Putting all these programs fully into effect, it was estimated in the report, would cost about $27 billion a year. Such substantial investment need not be out of the question, despite the deficit and those who share President Bush's opposition to new taxes. John E. Jacob, the president of the Urban League, for example, has called for a $50 billion program to train minority workers, with the money to come from no-longer-needed military expenditures.
It won't be easy, even with the cold war a bad memory, to wrest that kind of money away from the Pentagon and from fossilized Cold Warriors in Congress and the Administration. But what price bombers and missiles if, as Mr. Jacob properly warned:
''America will become a second-rate power unless we undertake . . . to insure that our neglected minority population gets the education, housing, health care and job skills . . . to help America compete successfully in a global economy.''

Housing Project Poses Quandary: Is It Affordable?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
It was, Mayor Edward I. Koch declared at City Hall, ''probably the single most important announcement in the last five years made here in this room.''
Let's hope not. Nearly three years later, the significance of that showcase agreement by leading developers to build, at no profit, 1,000 apartments for middle-income families is affirmation of how difficult it is to get some things done in New York.
Even if the agreement survives a review by Mr. Koch's successor, Mayor David N. Dinkins, the number of apartments has been reduced, they will be affordable to fewer moderate-income families and they could require more than double the subsidy officials had anticipated. 
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan has just recommended that the project be re-evaluated because ''the costs involved and the degree of risk are inordinately high'' and the prices now appear to be beyond the grasp of many less affluent middle-income buyers.
In 1984, Mr. Koch asked developers how the city could stimulate production of affordable housing without government subsidies. In response, the real-estate industry agreed to build 3,000 apartments at no profit if the city would streamline cumbersome regulations.
The city made strides. But the developers finally concluded that the housing could not be built unless the city helped pay for it.
In 1987, Mr. Koch announced the agreement to build the first apartments on 10 acres at Tibbett Avenue and West 230th Street in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. The city would sell the land to a Real Estate Board of New York subsidiary for $1 an acre. The city would pay a $15,000 to $25,000 subsidy per apartment to make them affordable to families with gross incomes ranging from $25,000 to about $50,000. Tibbett Gardens was to have been a prototype for at least 2,000 additional apartments sponsored by the board. Instead, it may have become an embarrassment.
The latest proposal, scaled back by the Board of Estimate, is to sell 75 apartments at market prices to defray costs on 675 subsidized apartments. Those are expected to be sold for from $64,000 for a studio to $128,000 for a three-bedroom to buyers whose income can range as high as $60,840.
The relatively small condominium apartments would be built for about $120,000 each -roughly the cost of the most expensive city-sponsored apartment renovations. The original $25,000 city subsidy is expected to balloon to about $50,000 - in part, because of legal challenges, inflation and the expense of complying with handicapped-access and other requirements, but primarily because of borrowing costs. (In comparison, subsidies for a Harlem project by the New York City Partnership, a nonprofit consortium, which hired a private developer, averaged $25,000 per apartment.) Slow sales could increase interest costs. If the city fails to recoup its loans, Elinor B. Bachrach, a deputy state comptroller, warns the subsidy could average as much as $90,000 per apartment.
Mr. Dinkins is torn. He voted for Tibbett Gardens. He has labored to reassure the business community that he is neither profligate nor against development. To revamp the project might mean years of delay, which could prove fatal. It would fuel opposition by advocates for more affordable housing and by the site's northwest Bronx neighbors, some of whom fear congestion and prefer that the land be reserved for an educational complex rather than for middle-income residents, or worse.
''There are people on my side of the issue who don't want those black and brown faces anywhere nearby,'' says Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. ''That bothers me. But that's not going to affect my decision that this is a crummy site for housing and a poor way to use scarce housing dollars.''
Steven Spinola, the Real Estate Board president, is hopeful. He said the board has already invested $1 million in time and money out of self-interest: developers' stake in the city could be jeopardized if middle-income families cannot find some place to live. The city itself has spent about $3.5 million, he said.
Mr. Spinola said construction could begin immediately if the city's Housing Development Corporation and Citibank agree on financing. He predicted that all the apartments would be sold in four years. But he acknowledged that if the board tiptoes into a second project, this one in Queens, it would proceed differently.
Three years ago, Mr. Spinola figured that Tibbett Gardens would ''demonstrate what it is going to take to build affordable housing in the city.'' He was right. Now the city must weigh the need, the symbolism and the expense and decide whether this is one housing project it can still afford.

HEADLINE: Panel Stresses Productivity In Budget Fight

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City should increase the productivity of municipal workers by using more one-officer police cars, closing underused firehouses and introducing one-worker garbage trucks among other measures, a private budget-monitoring group urged in a report released yesterday.
In its report on the state of city services, the group, the Citizens Budget Commission, called on Mayor David N. Dinkins and other city officials to balance the city's budget not by relying entirely on tax increases and service cuts but by improving efficiency.
''We're in a period,'' said the group's president, Raymond D. Horton, a Columbia University professor, ''when the economy is going south and also at a period when the sheer dependence of so many New Yorkers on the city for not just food, clothing and shelter but a variety of things from preventing child abuse to treating AIDS is enormous.''
 
'A Huge Bureaucracy'
''So if the entire budget-balancing process rests on the citizenry in the form of taxes and service cuts, that's really sticking it to them,'' he added. ''There's a huge bureaucracy that has to contribute, too.'' 
The report comes as city officials have warned that the city must close a budget gap of $400 million in the rest of the fiscal year that ends June 30 and faces a projected gap of more than $1 billion in the next fiscal year. Mr. Dinkins has already ordered all city agencies to prepare cuts to help close the current gap.
The Mayor's press secretary, Albert Scardino, said last night that Mr. Dinkins's position is that ''there will likely be a significant need for new tax revenues'' in the next fiscal year. But until the state prepares its new budget, no specific plans for new taxes can be made by the city, Mr. Scardino said. ''There is no way to know what they might be and where they might come from.''
At the same time, the Mayor and his first deputy, Norman Steisel, have indicated that they are open to a thorough review of how the city goes about providing services in an effort to make it perform more effectively. As Sanitation Commissioner in the Koch administration, Mr. Steisel presided over a major productivity gain, the introduction of two-worker garbage trucks, replacing three-member crews.
Mr. Steisel said he was not sure that one-worker garbage trucks, which are used in some cities, could be easily used in New York. But he said he had not yet fully reviewed the report and would not dismiss any of its suggestions ''out of hand.''
 
'A Helpful Indicator'
''We need to do a thoughtful analysis and make a judgment about whether they are workable,'' he said of the suggestions. ''The fact that they're used in other cities is a helpful indicator, but all it is is an indicator. One has to look at the unique circumstances here and decide whether you can go forward in our city at this time.''
He said whatever was done would follow ''discussion and cooperation with our labor groups.''
Many of the report's suggestions, including one-officer police patrol cars, have been discussed for years and never put into effect because they were deemed impractical, inappropriate or politically difficult by prior administrations. The strong reaction of municipal workers' unions to the report's recommendations makes it clear that they would resist some of the proposed changes.
For example, Mr. Steisel and the new Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, have said use of one-officer patrol cars must be studied seriously.
But Phil Caruso, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main police union, issued a statement saying it has long opposed one-officer patrol cars for safety reasons, although the Police Department uses them now in highway units and for some guard-duty assignments.
''If the geniuses at the Citizens Budget Commission think such procedures would be safe, let them ride in police cars by themselves,'' Mr. Caruso said.
 
A Succinct Reaction
Edward Ostrowksi, president of the sanitation workers union, was even more succinct in his reaction to the suggestion of one-worker garbage trucks. ''I think it's time for a no-man Citizens Budget Commission,'' he said.
In addition to recommending that underused firehouses be closed, the report called on the city to shift more emergency and rescue duties from the police to firefighters and to press the State Legislature to repeal a 1938 law requiring that fire companies be staffed at the same levels day and night.
Louis Sforza, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, said the staffing suggestion would ''play Russian roulette with the lives of the people of New York City'' and ''borders on insanity.''
But Mr. Horton of the budget commssion, which is financed mostly by the city's business community, said difficult fiscal times called for new initiatives, in the same way that the two-worker garbage truck was introduced in the early 1980's, when the city was still recovering from its fiscal crisis of the mid-70's. He said that in the last two years, for the first time since use of the two-worker trucks began, the efficiency of garbage collection as measured by the city's own index had declined.
The index compares hours worked and tons collected against predetermined standards, and in the 1987-89 period it fell to 95.2 percent from 97.3 percent, indicating that the city may have achieved all the gains it can from the two-worker trucks and now needs to begin using one-worker trucks, Mr. Horton said.
 
Looking for Opportunities
Mr. Steisel said that ''as with many services, there may be advances in technologies that allow you to do even more productivity.'' He said one-worker trucks were now used in other cities ''in back alleys, with cart collection.''
''My sense is you may be able to find such opportunities in New York City, but I'm not sure they're as extensive as the report would suggest,'' he said.
Noting the city's severe jail overcowding problems, the report said the city should ''make much wider use of alternatives to incarceration,'' including more flexible bail requirements, work-release programs and drug and alcohol treatment programs for addicts. Mr. Dinkins called for expanded opportunities for drug treatment as a major theme in his campaign but has not yet made clear how much he thinks the city should do or how it would pay for the programs.
The report also called on the Police Department to transfer more officers from administrative jobs to direct law-enforcement positions, by adding civilians if necessary, and to assign more officers to foot patrol instead of patrol cars.

HEADLINE: Rage Over a Gas Pipeline Appears to Cool in Connecticut

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHERMAN, Conn., Jan. 10

 BODY:
When Hank Dutton moved to this rural, one-stoplight town two decades ago to start a 20-acre hobby farm, he never figured on sharing his prized back pasture with a 24-inch-wide natural-gas pipeline.
''I don't think the cows are going to like this,'' he said.
Such complaints, usually less understated, have been common for the last three years among the 2,600 residents of this northern Fairfield County town, the planned entry point in Connecticut for a $583 million, 369-mile underground pipeline from Iroquois, Ontario, to South Commack, L.I.
But as the pipeline plans progress in the complicated approval process, the fervor of opponents appears to be fading. ''People have been at this for so long that time has taken its toll,'' said Gary B. Davis, spokesman for the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, a consortium of Canadian and United States natural-gas utilities planning the pipeline. 
 
Remark About Arthur Miller
Opponents of the pipeline here and throughout southwestern Connecticut believe that much of the most vigorous anti-pipeline activity - angry town meetings, fund-raising rallies and ''Stop the Pipe'' T-shirt sales - has diminished because of a 1987 rerouting away from Litchfield County and the more affluent towns of Salisbury, Roxbury and Washington.
Many are still rankled by a remark that Mr. Davis made last year about how Iroquois was no longer bothered by telephone calls from the playwright Arthur Miller, who lives in Roxbury.
''There are a lot of people in those towns who have a lot of money and can make a lot of noise,'' said John Duncan, a computer programming manager whose colonial-style house in Sherman lies about 500 feet from the pipeline's route. Opponents also cite the wooing by Iroquois of local politicians and residents. The company has announced plans to buy $10 million worth of land in New York and Connecticut, which it will lease to municipalities and private groups for use as parks.
 
'Making an Effort'
But Iroquois officials say the company is merely being a good neighbor. They said the route was shifted from Roxbury for economic reasons, not because of Mr. Miller. They also note that they have held frequent meetings in each of the eight Connecticut towns now in the pipeline's path in an effort to allay fears about the effect on the environment.
Opponents fear a natural-gas pipeline could leak into the ground water or explode.
''I don't think anybody has gone 180 degrees,'' Mr. Davis said. ''But many of them would have to say that we're making an effort to address their concerns and provide information.''
The pipeline, a connection off the huge Trans-Canada pipeline, was announced in 1986. It crosses the United States-Canadian border at Waddington, N.Y., zigzags through upstate New York and enters Sherman from Dutchess County, N.Y.
From Sherman, which was added to the route in 1987, the pipeline will burrow to New Milford in Litchfield County, into Brookfield, Newtown, Monroe, Shelton and Stratford in Fairfield County and then into Milford in New Haven County before running under the Long Island Sound to the Long Island Lighting Company's Northport station in Huntington. Then it would be buried along a Lilco right of way to the South Commack substation.
 
Awaiting Approval
The pipeline has received state approval in New York, even though such approval was not necessary; the Federal Government has sole legal jurisdiction over interstate pipelines. Iroquois is negotiating rights of way with property owners in New York.
But in Connecticut and New York the project still must receive final approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers, which have held several public hearings over the last four years, including four in Danbury and Albany last week.
Iroquois officials are confident of approval but are concerned that Connecticut may challenge Federal jurisdiction over the pipeline and delay, if not stop, the project. It has been criticized by virtually every state politician, including Gov. William A. O'Neill, on environmental and economic grounds.
The pipeline would take a year to build; the company expects the project to be approved by the end of this year and completed by the end of 1991.
''We will be in operation as scheduled,'' Mr. Davis said.
 
'Big Bucks Talking Here'
The grass-roots opposition in Connecticut, though less strident than it once was, remains troublesome to Iroquois.
At a public hearing this week, about 100 people criticized Federal officials. ''This is a real joke!'' yelled Lola Shumlin, a Sherman resident. ''You don't care if you hurt these residents, because it's big bucks talking here.''
''There is still a lot of battle left in most of us,'' Mr. Dutton added.
But more common are moderate assessments like those of Sherman's First Selectman, Kenneth F. Grant. ''Nobody wants it in their backdoor yard,'' he said. ''But if we're going to have it, then we want to have it where we want and in a manner we want.''
Opponents contend that the project will ruin valuable farmland, wetlands and natural areas, as well as several golf courses and parks. They also believe that the economic need for the pipeline has not been established.
 
Need for Gas Is Questioned
''We're not opposed to gas,'' said Karen Ann Hayward, a consultant for the Housatonic Valley Association in Cornwall Bridge. ''We're opposed to how this project is totally disregarding the environment, particularly if there is no need for it - and the need has not been shown.''
Iroquois officials have argued that natural gas is needed because it is less polluting and more available than oil, on which the region is now heavily dependent. The pipeline would carry 125 million cubic feet of gas daily to New York City and Long Island and 144 million cubic feet a day to Connecticut customers.
In all, 576 million cubic feet of gas would be carried daily on the entire pipeline, enough to generate three times as much power as would have been created by the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, which was mothballed last year. Gas would also be provided to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and New Jersey.
Iroquois officials said a recent increase in oil prices and a shortage of natural gas in the Northeast in the last few months should be enough evidence of the region's need for additional supplies.
''The issue is violation - many of these people believe they are being violated by this proposal,'' Mr. Davis said. ''They do not believe that the benefits to the entire region outweigh their concern for their community.''

HEADLINE: Florio Plans An Assault On Poverty In the Cities

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Governor-elect James J. Florio envisions an aggressive administration that will experiment with new approaches to protecting the environment and begin an assault on urban poverty.
Mr. Florio says he plans to use Camden, one of the poorest cities in the nation, as his first test of a partnership between business and government to help children and the unemployed.
''If you can bring Camden back you can bring any place back,'' Mr. Florio said as he spooned a lunch of vegetable soup out of a paper cup in his transition office. ''The key to our national success in the past was the perception that we all had opportunity. We have got to create opportunity.'' 
 
Sharp Drop in Revenues
New Jersey is a particularly good laboratory for experimenting with new approaches to urban problems, aides to Mr. Florio said, because its cities are small, making up 10 percent of the population. Modest programs in small cities, they said, can produce more visible results than in a huge, troubled metropolis like New York or Detroit.
But standing in the way of Mr. Florio's initiatives is a budget crisis that will demand action soon after Mr. Florio takes office tomorrow. With revenues dropping sharply, Mr. Florio may have to cut $500 million in services or raise that amount in taxes this fiscal year, politicians here say.
Nonetheless, in interviews last week, Mr. Florio and top members of his staff sketched their vision for a Democratic administration dedicated to solving social problems, a kind of ''post-Reagan activism,'' they said, after eight years of Republican leadership under Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
Although most of Mr. Florio's plans are still taking shape, and many may not be introduced until well into the administration, aides to Mr. Florio said their goal is to experiment with new approaches to some of the nation's most intractable problems, including a crackdown on environmental polluters, expansion of recycling, controls on overdevelopment and improvement of a health-care system that leaves more than one million New Jerseyans uninsured.
Tomorrow, Mr. Florio plans to call for a special session of the Legislature on Jan. 22 to announce his plans to reduce automobile insurance rates.
But perhaps his top long-term priority, Mr. Florio said, will be an ambitious assault on urban poverty in which he plans to enlist the help of businesses to train workers, improve education and expand social services for people left behind by the economic boom of the 1980's.
''We in government don't have the money to do all we would like to do,'' said Steven P. Perskie, who will serve as Mr. Florio's chief of staff. ''But now you can go to business and say, here, on your bottom line, is the reason for helping with drug treatment, with day care, with job training. Not out of altruism, but because it makes good business sense.''
Given industry's desperate need for new workers in this mostly suburban state and the high unemployment in cities, Mr. Florio said he hoped to bring the poor into the work force by creating partnerships between government and industry, as well as new programs in the schools.
Mr. Florio said he would start this approach in Camden, where infant mortality is the highest in the nation and government attempts at revitalization have failed for 30 years. Mr. Florio represented Camden in his 15 years as a Congressman.
What makes this kind of government possible at a time of budget constraints, Mr. Florio argues, is that economic forces now require businesses to search for solutions to the state's most serious social problems and to look to government for help.
''The time is right,'' Mr. Florio said. ''There has never been a time that I can remember when there has been more parallelism between private-sector concerns and the concerns of the public. I see a partnership approach with government acting as a catalyst.''
 
A Year of Crisis
But talk of saving the cities seems starry-eyed to many New Jersey politicians, who see 1990 as a year of crisis for Mr. Florio. Unless he overcomes budget, tax and insurance problems, they say, he will have neither the money nor the political support to pursue lofty goals.
Although Mr. Florio said during the campaign that he did not foresee a need for new taxes, budget specialists in the Legislature say state revenues may be running $500 million short in a $12 billion budget for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30.
Mr. Florio and his aides have refused to talk about their budget plans, but hints from top Democrats suggest that the new Governor may propose an increase in the income tax. He is expected to disclose his fiscal plans in a budget message before March 15.
Making matters more complex for the new administration, a major State Supreme Court decision is expected in the next few months that may require the state to change the way it funds public schools, at a cost of hundreds of millions to the state. Also, legislators feel growing rage from voters over rising property taxes.
 
Reliance on Property Taxes
Together, the budget problems, the court decision and the property taxes may well turn 1990 into the year when Mr. Florio proposes major tax reform, an idea that has been discussed here for years.
Mr. Florio and other Democrats have long been critical of New Jersey's reliance on property taxes to raise revenue, a system they say discriminates against cities. But Republicans and others oppose increasing the income tax, saying such a shift would stifle economic growth.
In the interview last week, Mr. Florio, 52 years old, conveyed a striking contrast, both in style and philosophy, to his predecessor.
Mr. Kean was, above all, a popular Governor, who used his buoyant personality to convery a feeling of hope about the state. In an interview he was as likely to chat about children and offer whimsical anecdotes as to discuss legislation crossing his desk.
Mr. Florio, on the other hand, possesses a passion for public policy and far less patience for small talk.
To friends, colleagues and assistants, Mr. Florio, the author of the nation's Superfund law that provides Federal funds to clean toxic-waste sites, is known for his remarkable command of detail and a thirst for information about social problems and their possible solutions.
''My husband is the only man I know who can talk passionately about sludge,'' his wife, Lucinda, said last year during the campaign.
Mr. Kean's top priority was to encourage business growth. Mr. Florio says the greatest problems facing the state now are byproducts of the economic boom that business alone cannot cure: the urban poor, clogged highways, increasingly endangered natural resources, and industries like insurance and health care that he believes need tighter regulation.
Since 1982, more than 600,000 jobs have been created in New Jersey, reducing unemployment to nearly 4 percent statewide and less in some areas. But businesses in those areas badly need qualified workers, while many residents of the nearby cities, which were left out of the economic good times, remain out of work.
 
Improved Prenatal Care
The new administration's plan to attack poverty is likely to be presented to the public as initiatives for children. Florio aides said they hoped to involve businesses in programs to improve prenatal care, to provide day care for working mothers, and to create transportation to bring inner-city workers to suburban jobs.
Mr. Florio said he will also propose legislation to expand health-insurance policies to cover drug abuse, and to encourage businesses to add drug-treatment programs.
Concerning the environment, Mr. Florio said he envisioned incentives for industries to reduce production of harmful wastes, and to have state government and public authorities use recycled products. He also said he expected to appoint an ''environmental prosecutor'' to crack down on polluters in highly publicized cases.
''In the history of government in this country the states have been laboratories,'' Mr. Perskie, the chief of staff, said. ''We are going to be a laboratory for a new set of approaches. The ones that work will be exportable.''

'Jonquil,' the 3d Play in a Saga of Black History

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
With harshness as well as equanimity, Charles Fuller's ''Jonquil'' reveals the obstacles to full emancipation in the South immediately after the Civil War. Through a voting rights episode in a small South Carolina community, the author views the Reconstruction period as one of the uglier chapters in the nation's history. ''Jonquil,'' the third play in Mr. Fuller's projected five-play series about black Americans in the second half of the 19th century, opened Saturday at the Negro Ensemble Company.
In common with ''Sally'' and ''Prince,'' the two plays that preceded it, ''Jonquil'' is not yet a finished work. A tentativeness in some of the characterizations and in Douglas Turner Ward's production lessens Mr. Fuller's argument. But for the first time in this ambitious cycle, the author tellingly dramatizes a complex situation and has a narrative strong enough to carry the play to a tragic conclusion. 
Though ''Jonquil'' makes passing reference to the earlier plays, especially in regard to the absent character of Prince Logan, a charismatic black soldier in the Union Army, the play stands on its own as a portrait of a section of the South totally unable to face its defeat and to discontinue a dehumanizing way of life. The theatergoer need not have seen the first plays in order to follow this one.
At the center is the character named Calvin (Charles Weldon), who is embarking on what he envisions as a political career. Calvin is willfully trying to transform himself into a leader of men. His primary asset appears to be the absence of any others challenging him for that position. In the course of the play, he grows as a candidate for state office, and he also sees the error of his pragmatic ways. Cowardly when his wife, Sally, is attacked by members of the Ku Klux Klan, he is gradually swept into taking a stand.
His allies include a loose assembly of rebels and passivists, from Graham Brown as a man who believes that only by arming themelves can blacks begin to achieve their rights, to Samuel L. Jackson, who has his mind entirely on the concept of owning property. As in the earlier plays, the author sees economics as a root concern, with blacks demanding equal pay as they did when they served in the army. In the case of ''Jonquil,'' they also claim the right to vote, and that claim sends them into violent collision with whites.
Mr. Fuller's white characters include a judge (William Mooney) whose paternalism barely conceals his racism and an apparently well-meaning carpetbagger (Tracy Griswold) with his own ambiguous attitude toward questions of brotherhood. Although some of the minor characters, black and white, become simplistic, these two and others have shadings that make their reactions unpredictable.
The symbolic center is intended to be the title character. Jonquil (Cynthia Bond) is one aspect of the play that needs strengthening. She is blind, but she hears with a mystical intensity. It is she, for example, who can testify with the most certainty about the identity of the hooded assailants who humiliated her friend Sally. Jonquil remains in the background. Whenever she is given prominence, she becomes the embodiment of Mr. Fuller's premise, which is that progress can only come through unity.
The comprehensive title of this cycle is ''We,'' a word that the illiterate Jonquil uses in the objective case, as in ''Folks are always forgetting what they do to we.'' Led by Jonquil as concerned conscience, the ''we'' will presumably consolidate their protest in the next play in the series.
Even as ''Jonquil'' is the sturdiest of the plays to date, the production is schematic. Charles McClennahan's unfurnished setting is only a step from a workshop. Several of the actors, including Mr. Weldon, still seem to be adjusting themselves to the demands of the play. Iris Little (as Sally), Mr. Mooney, Mr. Brown and, particularly, Ms. Bond are more insightful about delineating characters.
Because of its intelligent perspective on American history, ''Jonquil'' reminds one of Mr. Fuller's early play ''The Brownsville Raid.'' It is a sign that, as it proceeds, ''We'' is advancing.

HEADLINE: Europe Taking a Lead in Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The benefits already flowing from the European Community's continuing effort to create a single market by 1992 and the changes in Eastern Europe are prompting economists to predict that Western Europe's economic growth will exceed that of the United States in the 1990's.
For much of the 1980's, the fast-growing American economy was the envy of Western Europeans, who seemed to think that the high unemployment and sluggish growth plaguing most of their nations were insurmountable problems.
No longer. Last year, the economy of all Western European nations outpaced that of the United States. It grew 3.5 percent, while the United States economy grew about 3 percent. 
Economists expect growth in Western Europe to continue to outpace that in the United States for at least two years and possibly much longer. While annual growth in the United States is widely expected to average 2.5 percent in the 1990's, many economists expect Western Europe to grow by 3 to 3.5 percent a year.
 
'A Locomotive Role'
''It's very important for the world economy and the United States that Europe in conjunction with Japan should exhibit stronger economic growth,'' said George A. Magnus, chief international economist at Warburg Securities in London. ''To a degree, Europe is fulfilling a locomotive role as the U.S. economy slows down.''
With the 12 nations of the European Community moving ahead with their program to create a barrier-free common market by 1992 and with Eastern Europe moving toward democracy and market-based economies, there is a palpable excitement in Europe - a feeling that the Age of Europe may be dawning.
''There's a lot of dynamism in Europe,'' said Norbert A. Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest bank. ''Nineteen ninety-two and the Eastern Europe reforms have created the perception around the globe that Europe is on the move, that there is a renaissance in Europe.''
For a couple of years there have been signs that optimism is replacing the pessimism that had long gripped Europe. But with unemployment in Europe remaining high and inflation inching upward, many economists still feared that the expansion would lose steam.
About the only major nation where that has happened is Britain, whose Government's use of high interest rates to combat an inflation rate of 7.7 percent has brought growth nearly to a standstill.
With West Germany and other major European countries maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy, most economists are now cautiously optimistic that inflation, which hit a plateau in the second half of last year, will remain under control. Annual inflation in the European Community could average 4 percent between 1990 and 1995, down from 5.4 percent last year, said Paul Cockle, chief European economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the economic consulting firm.
Reflecting the cheerful new outlook, economists have managed to find a virtue in Western Europe's high unemployment rate, which has been falling only slowly. The rate -now about 9 percent - means Western Europe does not face the kinds of limits on growth confronting the United States, where unemployment is 5.3 percent, they say.
In a turnaround from just a year ago, some economists say it is possible that unemployment could fall to 6 or 7 percent by the mid-1990's. But any sizable reduction will require sustained economic growth of 3 to 4 percent, they say.
 
Boom in Capital Spending
One big reason for the current optimism is the capital-spending boom that has been under way in the European Community for several years. ''By helping to make sure that demand does not outstrip supply, the buoyant investment is an important factor in a continued noninflationary expansion,'' said David A. Currie, an economist at the London Business School.
While the spending boom has been slowing, it shows no signs of petering out. ''We had expected a greater moderation than there has been,'' Mr. Cockle said.
This spending, economists say, is being fueled by a combination of excitement and fear that the 1992 program has created.
Some companies are spending heavily to exploit the opportunities for expansion that they think the single market will offer them. Others are doing so to defend themselves against the increased competition they expect.
Investment in machinery and equipment has been growing at 9 percent annually in West Germany, even more in France and more than 20 percent in Spain and Portugal, Dr. Walter of Deutsche Bank noted.
 
Money From Outside
Heavy investment from companies based outside the community is one big reason this growth is so strong. ''Enticed by both the opportunities and the fears that outsiders may be prevented from exploiting them, companies from outside the European Community - especially the Japanese, the Swedes, the Finns and the Australians - are continuing to pour money into the community,'' said Martin Waldenstrom, president of Booz Allen Acquisition Services, a unit of Booz Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm.
Mr. Waldenstrom, who recently completed a study for the European Community, said American direct investment in the community, which soared in the mid-1980's, has declined since its peak in 1987.
The European Commission, the community's executive branch, estimated earlier that the 1992 program could add as much as one percentage point to the community's medium-term economic growth.
The surprise is that the rise has come so soon. Given the heavy capital spending, some economists now say that 1992 has already added a total of two to three percentage points over the last three years to the European Community's economic growth and that the total extra growth from the 1992 program could exceed the commission's prediction.
 
'Clear Change' in Behavior
''There has been a clear change in European economic behavior,'' Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said of the new optimism.
While it may be too early to pronounce Communism dead in Eastern Europe, the widespread hope is that the leadership role that Western Europe would play in rebuilding Eastern Europe will take up where 1992 leaves off in keeping Western Europe's expansion rolling along.
West Germany, already the economic locomotive of Western Europe (its gross national product represents 25 percent of the European Community's), is expected to reap the greatest benefit from any rebuilding of Eastern Europe. Mr. Walter predicted that the portion of West Germany's exports going to Eastern European countries could soar to 15 percent of its total within 10 years, from 5 percent now.
While such forecasts may be too optimistic, the flood of immigrants from the East is already giving a boost to West Germany's economy. The influx of 1.3 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the last three years is adding one-quarter to three-quarters of a percentage point to West Germany's gross national product, economists figure.
 
Help for Labor Shortage
Most of the immigrants are younger people who are in their prime spending years and who can help alleviate the shortage of skilled workers in West German industry. In addition, it is already clear that the immigration will force the Government to increase social spending to house the new arrivals.
To keep West Germany's inflation, now about 3 percent, under control, the Bundesbank, the country's central bank, is expected to continue to pursue its tight monetary policy. But economists do not expect it to slow the economy much. They note that besides the stimulus from the immigration, a sizable tax cut went into effect on Jan. 1.
With many economists expecting this tight monetary policy and looser fiscal policy to continue well into the 1990's, the result could be a higher value for the West German mark and an increase in imports that would stimulate the economies of West Germany's trading partners.
''What the capitalist economies could never persuade the West Germans to do, the demise of Communism is achieving - a more expansive policy,'' said Mr. Lawrence of Brookings. Implications for the U.S. What does all this mean for the United States?
Exports to Western Europe will undoubtedly continue to rise. A surge in such exports - to an estimated $100 billion last year from $61.6 billion in 1986 - has largely eliminated America's trade deficit with Western Europe.
Most economists note that this amount of exports is still tiny compared with the size of the $5 trillion American economy, and will not spell the difference between growth and recession.
The growing attractiveness of Europe - both East and West - as a place to invest could pose some threats to the United States. For one thing, the United States may find it increasingly difficult to attract the foreign capital it needs to finance its big trade and budget deficits.
 
'Pressure on the Dollar'
As a result, ''it may end up putting a lot of downward pressure on the dollar,'' said Charles R. Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics. That, he said, could translate into higher inflation and a drop in the standard of living for Americans.
If disarmament continues, reducing the importance of United States military power, American influence in the world could continue to slip because of its weakening economic muscle. The back seat America seems to be taking in the West's response to the events in Eastern Europe reflects this decline, political analysts and economists say.

U.S. Foundations Seek an East Bloc Role

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
American foundations and research groups are playing an active role in shaping Eastern Europe's transition to free markets, even helping to draw up an economic action plan for the next Hungarian Government.
The involvement was quite evident here over the last few days as the Hudson Institute, a staunch advocate of free markets, held the first gathering of a self-designated ''blue-ribbon commission'' of prominent Hungarians and Westerners. The panel is preparing detailed economic proposals for the Hungarian Government that will come to power after the March 25 parliamentary election.
Publication of the plan, covering such things as private ownership, labor law, taxes, social welfare, inflation and foreign exchange rates, is scheduled for early April. 
The Hudson project highlights a change in the overseas role of private American groups. Rarely in the past were they so openly active in trying to shape other countries; rather, they stayed in the background, financing research and other support work.
 
Evolutionary Catalysts
Taking note of the change, Kevin F. F. Quigley, an executive of the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the foundations had been given ''a historic opportunity to be catalysts in the evolution of Eastern Europe toward the values that we favor.''
Pew, which dispenses $140 million a year in grants, mostly for health and education projects in the United States, is just getting involved in Eastern Europe. Mr. Quigley came here to consider Hudson's Hungarian commission as a candidate for Pew funds.
The Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the George Soros Foundation, among others, are already dispensing money to such beneficiaries as Polish farmers and people organizing political parties.
The Hudson commission's mixture of prominent Westerners and Hungarians is intended to make its plan hard to resist for the next Government. That, at least, is the strategy of the organizers, a group of Hungarian politicians, the Hudson Institute and Paul Marar, an intermediary who brought them together. Mr. Marar, a Hungarian-born economist who fled his homeland as a young man in 1956, is now a specialist on Hungary at Indiana University.
 
No Credibility Now
''This is a bipartisan effort for a Government that will take office without having given the details of economic transformation much thought,'' Mr. Marar said. ''Right now there is no credibility within Hungary. The old Government is discredited, and the new political parties have no track record yet.''
Indiana University is sharing the cost of the Hungarian project with Hudson and another research organization, the East-West Forum. They have spent $150,000 so far.
More than two dozen Hungarians flew to Indianapolis from Budapest for the five days of sessions that ended Friday at Hudson's headquarters, a refurbished hilltop mansion. They included not only politicians, but also economists, educators, political scientists, even former Communist Party members.
Such well-known Westerners as Pierre S. du Pont 4th, the former Governor of Delaware, and Sir Alan A. Walters, a former economic adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, urged a rapid transition to free markets, perhaps in less than five years. But the Hungarians mostly resisted, arguing that too hasty a transformation could bring high unemployment, inflation and hardship.
 
Social Welfare State
''We think more in terms of Western Europe's social welfare state model,'' said Elemer Hankiss, a political sociologist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was among more than 100 people trying to develop recommendations for the 19-member commission.
At one working group session, Bruce Chapman, a Hudson official who is a former director of the United States Census Bureau, argued against a Hungarian proposal for a labor law modeled after those in Scandinavian countries, with their numerous protections for workers.
Mr. Chapman said that until Hungary builds up enough wealth to afford such benefits, it would be more appropriate to model the labor law after those in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea and slowly work up to Scandinavia.
Some issues came up repeatedly during the five days, although none were resolved. One was whether to continue Hungary's present tax holidays for foreign investment, or perhaps extend tax breaks to Hungarian entrepreneurs.
 
Inflation Dangers
Another was how quickly to make Hungary's currency, the forint, convertible to Western currencies, a process likely to result in steep devaluations and inflation if done too quickly. The working group dealing with this issue recommended three years, a deadline considered too ambitious and painful by others.
And there was considerable sympathy for a proposal that would keep big state enterprises, particularly manufacturing operations, in state hands while they were converted into operations efficient and profitable enough to command good prices from private buyers, foreign and Hungarian.
The new Government, in effect, would be responsible for the layoffs, plant closings and other measures intended to achieve efficiency.
The thought of imposing such hardships is one reason Hungarian politicians are turning to free-market advocates in the United States and Western Europe for support. That the Hungarians could not go only to Americans illustrates the decline of this country's influence. The Hudson Institute found that it had to enlist numerous Western Europeans, on the theory that they will be the main source of much-needed financial aid and foreign investment. Thus their endorsement is required to get the Hungarian public to accept the commission's transition plan.
 
Next Time in Brussels
So while the first gathering was held in this heartland American city, the next one will be in Brussels late this month, with Europeans playing the major role.
''It is useful for us to have this broad spectrum,'' said Geza Jeszenszky, an historian at Karl Marx University in Budapest and a leader of the Democratic Forum Party. ''Foreign capital is not possible without foreigners telling us what they require to come here.''
If the Democratic Forum, whose constituency is mostly those operating small businesses, does as well in the March election as many polls say it will, then Mr. Jeszenszky might emerge as the foreign minister in the new Government.
But a majority of the Hungarians here this week are members of or sympathize with the Free Democratic Party, whose constituency is mostly the wealthiest Hungarians. A leader of this party is Marton Tardos, an economist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences who is a co-chairman of the Hudson commission, along with Sylvia Ostry, former head of the Economic Council of Canada.
''The future Government of Hungary can't cope with the hardships of transition to free markets,'' he said. ''We have to design a program to do this, and that is best done with the support of experts from the major free-market countries.''

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Are True Profits Falling or Rising?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
CORPORATE profits are in decline. Company after company is reporting sinking net income and the trend seems certain to continue, given the weak economy. But there are several ways to measure profitability and some show American business to be in not such bad shape.
Profitability is a tricky, subjective concept. Two economists, or two executives, can draw different conclusions from the same mass of numbers. Examine income alone and the total is clearly running below last year's level by more than 10 percent, a decline spotlighted by the companies themselves in quarterly earnings reports. 
But if income is considered the return on the money invested in factories, offices and equipment, the picture brightens. Although the 1989 return is not yet calculated, it was probably close to the level of the two previous years for manufacturing and service companies, says John Musgrave, a Commerce Department economist.
That resilient showing reflects the efficiencies that many companies have achieved in the 1980's, through factory closings, work force reductions, automation and overseas investments. ''We have definitely lowered our break-even point,'' said Richard W. Kopcke, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who studies profitability.
The Federal Reserve and Commerce, in assessing profitability, often include in income an item that business executives think of as an onerous cost: the interest payments on ballooning corporate debt. For Mr. Kopcke and most business executives, a loan to a company provides capital to buy a machine, just as selling stock does. The disagreement is how to classify the interest payments. Mr. Kopcke and some other economists contend the payments, like dividends, should be counted as payouts from profits.
Viewed this way, profits have not declined since last year, although they have not risen either. Before taxes and including interest payments, income for the nation's nonfinancial companies remained at about $375 billion through the third quarter. This steady flow of wealth helps to explain why the nation's economic expansion has lasted for more than seven years.
Nevertheless, labeling interest payments as profits obscures the conflict in the American system between shareholders, who own a company, and creditors, who are outsiders. It does not, for example, end the nightmare at the heavily indebted Campeau Corporation. Nor does it help the nation's stockholders who blame interest payments for the sharp decline in profits, endangering stock values.
With the economy weak and consumers holding back, companies have had difficulty raising prices. That means that rising costs can squeeze profits and this has happened, but mostly because of interest payments. Other costs have hardly budged as a percentage of revenue.
Out of every dollar of revenue in the third quarter last year, interest payments consumed 5.2 cents, compared with 4.6 cents in 1988 and 3.6 cents in 1983, at the start of the economic expansion, Commerce says. Labor costs, by comparison, took 66.6 cents from the sales dollar in the third quarter, only slightly above the 1983 proportion of 66.2 cents. Corporate income taxes, sales taxes and the depreciation of buildings and equipment all take about the same today from each dollar as they did in 1983. Profits, on the other hand, fell in the third quarter to 4.5 cents, from 5.2 cents in 1988 and 5.6 cents in 1983. (The high point was 6.9 cents in 1984.) Aside from whether interest payments are profits or costs, another issue is how to value a company's capital investment in buildings and equipment. Mr. Kopcke and Mr. Musgrave, among others, favor valuing assets at current replacement cost; that is, the cost today of replacing, say, a three-year-old truck. While that might be $50,000, most companies carry the truck on their books at its original cost, say $25,000. The result is that a trucking company with 10 such vehicles and $25,000 in annual net income would report a 10 percent return on investment, while Mr. Kopcke would call it 5 percent.
''If executives are forced to keep marking up the value of their capital, they are more likely to acknowledge a slipping rate of return and to seek efficiencies,'' he said.
Many executives say they do keep an informal tally of replacement costs, and that is evident. Using a broad definition of pretax income - one that includes interest payments as well as various adjustments to remove fluke profits - Mr. Kopcke finds that the rate of return on the replacement cost of capital has risen steadily in the 1980's, to 8.1 percent in 1988 and probably a similar figure last year.
This return is up from 4.5 percent or less in the early 1980's and is the highest rate since 1973, although still a far cry from the 11 to 14.5 percent returns of the 1960's. Studies by other economists have produced similar results.
''The good news is that the rate of return has held up close to 8 percent despite the weakening economy,'' Mr. Kopcke said. And the bad news is that after energetic cost-cutting and modernization during seven years of economic expansion, American business got its rate of return back only to the early 1970's level - and now might once again lose ground.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Investors Relish Bet Against Japan

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors may buy Japanese cars, but they don't like Japanese stocks.
That fact became obvious again on Friday, when the latest way for American investors to bet against Japan became available. It amounts to a put option, of an unusual variety, on the Nikkei 225, the most prominent of the Japanese stock indexes.
The security was the most active issue trading on the American Stock Exchange, with volume of 3.2 million warrants, as the securities are called. In the initial public offering, underwriters led by Goldman Sachs & Company sold at least six million warrants, and are likely to end up selling another 900,000. 
The timing could not have been better from a marketing standpoint, coming on the heels of a sharp fall on Friday in the Nikkei 225, which tumbled 1.7 percent, or 653.36 points, to 37,516.77. Higher interest rates played a role in the drop, which left the index down 3.6 percent so far in 1990.
But that decline will do the buyers of the new security no good at all. Under the rules of the security, if on Jan. 3, 1993, the Nikkei is below Friday's level of 37,516.77, the holder can cash in the warrants. The lower the index, the higher the amount the holder will receive.
The warrants are issued by the Kingdom of Denmark, in a move to raise money that seems virtually certain to confuse investors. Denmark promises to make the payments, and it is collecting the $4.05 a warrant, less underwriting discounts, that investors paid for them.
As stock prices slid in the United States on Friday, the bearishness on Japan seemed to grow. The first trade of the warrants was at $4.125, an instant profit for those who sold after buying at the offering. By the end of the day, the price rose to $5.
To calculate the value of the warrant at expiration, one takes the Nikkei average then, and divides it by 145.325, the value of the dollar in yen on Friday, and then by five. Then that figure is subtracted from $51.63. Thus the absolute most a warrant owner could collect would be $51.63, and that is if the Nikkei fell to zero. The value of the warrant is not affected by what happens to the dollar relative to the yen.
If someone who bought a warrant for $5 holds it until it matures on Jan. 3, 1993, he makes a profit if the Nikkei average then is trading below 33,883.65, or 9.7 percent below current levels. That is a fairly hefty premium, particularly considering that the Japanese market has not had a down year in more than a decade.
The Kingdon of Denmark is not, as it happens, necessarily bullish on Japan. Goldman, which designed the warrant, has come up with a way for Denmark to pass on the market risks to Goldman, which in turn has hedged itself in ways it will not describe. A Goldman official concedes, however, that the brokerage firm's own hedge is imperfect.
There are ways for American investors to bet on the Japanese market going up, like buying American Depository Receipts of shares in Japanese companies, many of which are traded in this country, or by purchasing shares in mutual funds that invest heavily or, in the case of the Japan Fund, exclusively in Japan.
But there is no way to place a leveraged bet in favor of the Japanese market similar to the way the new warrants make a bet against it possible. No doubt if brokers perceived a demand for such a product, it would be created. The fact that it hasn't been is a testament to a continued American bearishness on Japanese stocks.
There is nothing new about that sentiment, and the bearishness is not hard to understand. Japanese valuations were excessive, by American standards, throughout the 1980's, a fact that did not stop prices from rising. The dividend yield on the Japanese stocks in the Financial Times-Actuaries world index now averages 47-hundredths of 1 percent, meaning that if an investor spent $1,000 on Japanese stocks, he or she could expect to collect dividends of $4.70 each year.
By contrast, the dividend yield on American stocks in the Financial Times-Actuaries index is 3.4 percent, a return that is a bit below historical averages, although not nearly as low as in 1987, when the figure dropped below 3 percent, a period when, in retrospect, American stock prices were wildly overvalued. To get a 3 percent yield in Japan, without raising dividends, Japanese stock prices would have to fall 84 percent. Even if dividends in Japan tripled, it would take a 50 percent fall in stock prices to get a 3 percent yield. The American bearishness on Japan has been easy to understand, but it has seldom been profitable in many years.
Still, in 1989, for the first time since 1982, American stocks did perform better than Japanese ones, and for the first two weeks of this year, Japan ranked last of the 24 countries in the Financial Times-Actuaries indexes. Perhaps the bears will finally be right.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Hong Kong Extending Its Reach

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
After enjoying extremely rapid growth in this territory, many large Hong Kong companies are looking abroad to find new sources of profits. But instead of going north to China, as they used to, many are reaching far in other directions.
In December alone, New World Hotel (Holdings) Ltd. completed its $540 million purchase of Ramada Inns, the American hotel chain, and Jardine Matheson Holdings acquired a United States insurance concern, the Financial Guardian Group, for an amount that local reports have estimated at about $70 million.
In the past, large local companies expanded mainly in Hong Kong, feeding off an exuberant local economy. The move abroad is partly the result of a natural transition for family-run companies that have built their empires so large that there is no longer room for them in Hong Kong. 
But it also comes at a time when this British territory of 5.7 million people prepares to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. There are rising political uncertainties over China and fears of further and greater instabilities, especially after the upheavals that have taken place in Eastern Europe.
 
New Sources of Earnings
China's retrenchment program already is stunting growth on the mainland and the economy in Hong Kong has slowed as well. While Hong Kong's giant companies are by no means abandoning their home, they say that they must look overseas, as many other corporations in Asia are doing, for new sources of earnings.
''Asian companies are diversifying for a variety of reasons,'' said Stephen A. Orlins, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. ''Hong Kong companies are diversifying for very much the same reasons, plus the reason of 1997.''
The flow abroad may lead to a more mature and diversified economy for Hong Kong, less dependent on the Chinese market that now sustains it. Nearly one-third of Hong Kong's total trade was with China for the first 10 months of last year, and stock prices of Hong Kong companies fluctuate on news from China.
Hong Kong's expansion overseas has been growing for the last few years, but interest and activity in investing abroad has blossomed in the last year or two. At least a dozen more companies are considering a move abroad, OCBC Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. reports.
 
Closely Watched Ship Owner
Among them is Sir Y. K. Pao, the industrialist and shipowner who is one of the most closely watched and richest Hong Kong investors. He has made a variety of foreign acquisitions, including the purchase of Omni Hotels in the United States in 1988.
In another highly publicized deal, Semi-Tech Microelectronics (Far East) Ltd., bought the Singer Sewing Machine Company for $269 million in April 1989.
Like many corporate giants, New World Hotels, one of the largest hotel developers in the territory, is reaching out to both Asia and the United States and at the same time expanding in Hong Kong. This summer, it opened two deluxe hotels here, and they have already become popular meeting spots for well-to-do Hong Kong Chinese.
''We make money from Hong Kong,'' said Henry K. S. Cheng, managing director of New World. ''But if we want to expand, how can we do it?
''We must go out of Hong Kong, and our aim is to establish an international chain of hotels based in Hong Kong,'' he said in an interview, explaining why the company bought Ramada.
 
Political Risks a Factor
New World is mindful of the economic and political strains in China, where it has hotel interests. ''If I told you that absolutely no political factors entered into it, that would not be a fair statement,'' Mr. Cheng said. ''But we have to go overseas anyway. The political risk just makes us move quicker.''
The largest deals have been property- or hotel-related, but analysts say that is to be expected, because it is easier to evaluate the risk in buying real estate or a hotel chain if it is the company's specialty, and real estate has always been a popular purchase among Hong Kong corporations.
Michael E. J. Sadak, a managing director of mergers and acquisitions at Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd., said many Hong Kong companies have relatively little debt on their balance sheets. This gives them capacity to borrow, if need be, to finance overseas acquisitions.
''Many of them have been family-oriented, well known in Hong Kong, but relatively unknown in the international market,'' Mr. Sadak said. ''One challenge they face is to raise their international profile, so they are viewed in the proper light.''
 
Outflow of Personal Capital
As more and more Hong Kong people move overseas, there has been greater speculation that a good deal of capital is going with them. While the Government has no way of tracking capital flight, economists and financial officials agree that there is probably a significant outflow.
''You can't put a figure on it,'' said Joseph C. K. Yam, Deputy Secretary for Monetary Affairs in Hong Kong. ''But it would be unrealistic to say that residents haven't moved capital overseas.''
He and other economists, however, say there is no indication that corporate capital is part of the exodus. Even if there is a flight of capital from local companies, it is rarely from divestment, and it is essentially matched by an inflow of investment from foreigners, they say.
Among several reasons they cite for this is the lack of pressure on the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar, to which the local currency is pegged. The rate of exchange hovers steadily around 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the dollar.
''A lot of Hong Kong companies are investing overseas, partly to diversify, partly for political reasons,'' said K. C. Kwok, senior economist at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. ''But the capital flight is not particularly serious.''
 
Significant Local Investments
Moreover, a significant amount of capital continues to be invested in Hong Kong, and the differences of opinion over the risk and opportunity that the territory presents are highlighted by the recent decisions of two top businessmen, Sir Y. K. and Li Kashing.
Both bid last year on Hong Kong's first cable television license, and the Government asked both to increase their bids. Sir Y. K. envisioned combining the system with a larger telephone and telecommunications system that might be built within the next decade to help enhance Hong Kong as a communications base, and he raised his bid to $640 million.
Mr. Li, whose company, Hutchison Whampoa, already is part owner of a communications satellite that is to be launched on a Chinese rocket, indicated the investment was already expensive and bowed out.

HEADLINE: David Wells MacEachron, 66, Ex-Leader of the Japan Society

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
David W. MacEachron, who retired last year as president of the Japan Society after leading the nonprofit group for 15 years, died of colon cancer on Saturday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 66 years old.
Mr. MacEachron was successively executive director and president of the organization, which advances understanding between the United States and Japan. Despite his worsening illness, he remained an active adviser to the society's board at Japan House, at 333 East 47th Street. 
He was a staunch advocate of liberalized trade, of close American-Japanese economic cooperation, and of the nations' joint repudiation of any effort to achieve dual dominance of other economies. He stressed the latter belief in his recently completed autobiography, which, his son, Daniel, said, he wrote for his family and friends.
Mr. MacEachron (pronounced Mac-KEK-ron) increased the Japan Society's endowment by about $20 million and its role as the main conduit for American awareness of Japanese culture, economics and politics with film festivals, stage performances, art exhibits and conferences.
 
Served in the Navy
David Wells MacEachron was born in Grinnell, Iowa, to parents who had been Congregational missionaries in China. He grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and Des Moines, and earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Yale. He also earned a master's degree in public administration and a doctorate in economics from Harvard. In World War II, he served in the Navy's Pacific Fleet on a submarine assigned primarily to rescuing downed American pilots.
After the war, his assignments included stints in Paris for the Marshall Plan, in Washington for the Bureau of the Budget and in New York where, from 1962 to 1974, he was successively program director and vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations. In later years, he was increasingly concerned about ecological dangers and overpopulation.
Surviving are his wife, the former Frances DePuydt, the Mayor of Hastings-on-Hudson for nearly eight years; his son, Daniel N., of New Canaan, Conn.; two daughters, Susan Patrick of Manhattan, and Laura O'Callaghan of Baltimore; two brothers, Lendrum, of St. Paul, and John, of Glendale, Calif., and two granddaughters.
A memorial service will be held at the Japan Society on Thursday at 4:30 P.M.

HEADLINE: After Months of Unsubtle Hints, Cuomo to Seek a Hold on Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 15

 BODY:
After months of dropping all-but-delicate hints, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on Tuesday will formally recommend suspending the next phase of the state's income-tax cut, aides to the Governor said today.
That phase, the last of the four-year tax-cut plan, was to take effect in October.
The Governor's recommendation will be listed in the budget Mr. Coumo is to present to the Legislature on Tuesday. If adopted, the proposal would freeze the top tax rate at the current 7.875 percent, instead of allowing it to drop as planned by half a percentage point. $2 Billion Gap in Budget Freezing the rate would provide the state $400 million in the fiscal year that starts on April 1. For that year, the state is facing a budget gap estimated at almost $2 billion. In the next fiscal year, the freeze would provide the state far more money, an estimated $1.3 billion. 
Aides to the Governor said Mr. Cuomo would argue in his proposal that the state's financial situation was too grave to sustain an additional tax cut.
''You can't keep cutting taxes when all your revenues are going south,'' an administration official said. ''We need to have some stability. The only practical prudent way to do that, in our opinion, is by re-examining the tax cut.''
Just last week, the administration estimated that the state would end the current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, with a shortfall of almost $700 million. That is almost three times earlier estimates.
 
Fuse for Debate
Budget Director Dall W. Forsythe attributed the growing gap to lower-than-expected tax collections in several areas.
Since the spring, Mr. Cuomo has hinted dozens of times that he favored deferring the next phase of the tax cut. But he has always stopped just short of endorsing the idea, maintaining that he had not made up his mind. Even after the budget was complete and much of it was in print, the Governor insisted last week that he did not know what he would recommend.
The formal proposal on Tuesday is likely to touch off months of debate and demonstrations. Business groups have pledged to fight any proposal to tamper with the cut, and labor and social-service groups have vowed to fight for a deferral.
Last year, when the financial problems were also severe, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, favored a delay in the cut, a suggestion Mr. Cuomo rejected. Mr. Miller is expected to support Mr. Cuomo's call for suspending the cut this year.
The State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., has said he will oppose changes in the cut.
The battle, which appears to be forming along party lines, is expected to be particularly fervid because this year is an election year for the Governor and all 211 legislators.
The legal deadline for putting a budget in place is April 1, but in recent years that limit has frequently been ignored.
Under the plan approved by the Governor and the Legislature in 1987, the top tax rate has already dropped, from 9 percent to 7.5 percent. Because the last cut took effect toward the end of last year, the effective tax rate for 1989 was 7.875 percent.
 
To Freeze '89 Rate
In the last phase, the top rate is now scheduled to drop, to 7 percent, in the fall. That would yield an effective rate for the year of 7.375 percent and a top rate of 7 percent for 1991.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said today that they would propose legislation to freeze the top rate at 7.875 percent. ''What you would do is keep the 1989 tax rate,'' one aide said.
The next phase would save taxpayers from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, depending on their incomes. Some taxpayers would actually pay more if the cut was put into effect. That is because the number of brackets is supposed to drop, to two from five, a change that would place some lower-income taxpayers into a higher bracket.
 
Likelihood of Stopgaps
The budget that the Governor presents on Tuesday is expected to rely heavily on the revenues that a delay the tax cut would generate two years from now. That means that the budget for the next fiscal year is likely to include many stopgap measures that depend on one-time revenue sources like refinancings and reserve funds.
It also means that if the Legislature rejects Mr. Cuomo's call to freeze the tax rate, his budget proposal will have to be substantially rewritten. That is because many stopgap measures could not be justified in the next fiscal year, if the state treasury was not likely to be replenished in the year after that.
In recommending a freeze, the Governor is in part following the advice of his council of economic advisers, which suggested last month that the cut be deferred. But the Governor's advisers, who include some of the most prominent executives in the state, explicitly recommended that the cut be delayed for a limited period of just ''one or two years.''
Administration officials said the Governor was not recommending a limited deferral, because such a proposal would simply create new problems in a year or two.

HEADLINE: Riverside Journal;
New Reign For Queen Of Hotels In West?

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, Calif.

 BODY:
Riverside gave the world the navel orange, but not even the fruit has defined this locality like the Mission Inn, the gaudy, sprawling hotel created by Frank Augustus Miller, an entrepreneur.
With its ornate beamed rooms, great courtyards with curved gables, campaniles, mosaics and stained glass windows, the inn has been host to the prominent from near and far since the turn of the century.
The Nixons were married there and spent their wedding night there in June 1940, as did the Reagans nearly 12 years later. Theodore Roosevelt was one of the earliest guests, overnighting on May 7, 1903. 
Now, after years of decay, decline and bankruptcies, the grand old hotel, shuttered and fenced off since 1985, is coming back to life under its latest owner. The owner is a reluctant one, the Chemical Bank of New York.
The bank seized the property after the Carley Capital Group, a Wisconsin-based syndicator, collapsed in 1988 just before it was to conclude restoration on the Mission Inn and reopen it as an Omni hotel.
The bank decided to throw in extra money and finish the restoration.
The huge complex is abuzz with jackhammers and drills. The furnishings are arriving for a reopening in the fall, two years late. It is the ultimate fixer-upper, 320,000 square feet of rooms, corridors, catwalks, loggias, alcoves and pergolas, with 750 doors and 450 windows that had to be replaced or repaired.
Reopening cannot come too soon for Riverside, a city of about 200,000 people 60 miles east of Los Angeles. The big Spanish mission-style structure is the centerpiece of a 700-acre downtown project.
''It is the centerpiece of our whole downtown redevelopment, physically, architecturally, economically and culturally,'' said Margueretta S. Gulati, director of Riverside's development department. ''It is the thing Riverside is known for nationally. It is a magnet for other development in the area. It will bring people back downtown.''
The inn is the kind of thing only the early California entrepreneurs could bring off. Frank Miller traveled the world and brought back ideas for expanding the inn over three decades, building four wings, each more spectacular than the last. No two rooms are the same. The styles evoke medieval castles, Spanish missions, Moorish palaces, Gothic cathedrals.
The Court of the Birds has fountains and a pool. The Music Room is a dark cavern with great oak beams. Then there are the St. Francis of Assisi chapel, with an 18-foot-tall gold leaf altar, four Tiffany windows and three Tiffany mosaics; the International Rotunda, with its spiral staircase and grand arches, and an octagonal wedding suite under a tall dome on the roof with splendid views of the San Bernardino Mountains.
Old-timers recall the parties, weddings and New Year's parties. A long slow decline started after Miller's death in 1935. The coup de grace was the Carley collapse.
The Chemical Bank, holder of $27.3 million in mortgages, consulted with the city; the New York bankers decided that they would lose less by finishing the inn - and they pumped in $9 million more.
As an inducement to the Chemical, says Ralph J. Megna, the inn's project manager for the Riverside development department, the city forgave part of a loan for seismic reinforcement. The hotel is situated very near the San Andreas fault.
The city has put together a $4.7 million financing package and built a 524-car garage to be leased to the new owner of the Mission Inn at below-market rates for three years.
The inn, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977, will include a museum for Miller's Asian and European art.
The hope is that the inn will regain its status as a winter resort - a ''destination'' hotel, a place where people go to be there, not just to bed down for the night. The Chemical Bank is looking for a buyer. The bank is taking written bids with a minimum bid of $28 million.
But will vacationers will find downtown Riverside a congenial destination? Indeed, the city already has a less desirable regular guest: smog and auto fumes that drift in from Los Angeles and are trapped here between two mountain ranges. The thick, soupy haze can last for weeks.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Presses Northeast Strategy, But Riders and Rivals Seem Unfazed

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS

 BODY:
With Amtrak nearing profitability, its managers are looking to several areas to push the railroad into the black, and one of their best hopes is the market now dominated by the Washington-to-New York air shuttles.
But the express Metroliner service between New York's Pennsylvania Station and Union Station in Washington, which Amtrak officials recently increased with that goal in mind, is off to a slow start.
On a recent morning, Metroliner 203, scheduled to make the 225-mile trip in 2 hours 37 minutes, carried only 24 passengers in its five cars. A more typical load, Amtrak officials said, is 40 to 50 people. But even with those numbers, the new express service would remain a money loser, although one that Amtrak appears willing to endure. 
By calling its express trains ''the civilized shuttle,'' Amtrak is taking a sharp marketing jab at the popular but crowded shuttle flights operated by the Pan Am Corporation and the Trump Organization. And strategies like that seem to be paying off.
 
Encouraging Financial Report
Last week, the railroad announced that in 1989 it had covered 72 percent of its operating expenses with revenue, a feat that was all but inconceivable only five years ago. Reporting record revenues of $1.3 billion for 1989, the railroad's chairman, W. Graham Claytor Jr., predicted Amtrak might be able to completely covers its costs by the year 2000.
Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, now carries about a million passengers between New York and Washington, about a third of the number who travel by air between the cities. Its goal, said Ira Silverman, Amtrak's director of route marketing, is to increase ridership by another 500,000.
''To be realistic, unless we some day have the equivalent of the European bullet trains, there is always going to be a market for the two shuttles that exist,'' said Mr. Silverman, ''but we clearly think that we can continue to increase our market share.''
Officials of the shuttle companies are politely derisive of Amtrak's ambition.
''We are the biggest competitor that Amtrak has, and we don't pay any attention to them,'' said Bruce Noble, president of the Trump Shuttle. ''I am no more worried about Amtrak as a competitor than I am about cars, buses or boats.''
 
Suburban Passengers Cited
Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman for Pan Am, said, ''We question the number of passengers who would be in Manhattan that early in the morning to take the Amtrak express service and how many would wish to end their trip back in Manhattan at the end of the day.'' She added that most air shuttle passengers ''live in suburban areas and find that the airport is more convenient.''
Amtrak's best hope for winning converts is the Metroliner, the reserved-seat train that celebrated its 20th birthday last year. Although he would not disclose actual ridership numbers, Mr. Silverman said the Metroliner accounted for most of Amtrak's growth in the New York-Washington market.
To better sell the Metroliner to time-conscious business travelers, Amtrak started an express train in 1987 from Washington to New York that made the trip in 2 hours 40 minutes. Last October, Amtrak added three additional express trains.
Amtrak has also begun serving Philadelphia's suburbs with Metroliner service that starts in Downington, Pa., at 6:10 A.M. and arrives in Washington by 8:37 A.M. Another nonstop express train from Baltimore to New York was also started.
Mr. Silverman acknowledged that the new routes have had a slow start, with average loads of about 40 passengers. To be profitable, he said, the trains need double that number.
 
'I Hate Trains'
But even with the recent 20 percent jump in prices for shuttle flights, to $119 from $99, many travelers interviewed recently at La Guardia Airport said they were devoted air passengers. A one-way Metroliner ticket costs $74, with an upgrade to the club service that includes wider seats and a meal, available for $43 extra.
''I hate trains; they're outmoded,'' said Barbara Winer, a consultant who flies monthly between New York and Washington for political projects. ''It would take me more time to go to Penn Station, which is filthy and full of homeless people.''
Some shuttle passengers said they would prefer to travel by train but were persuaded to fly by the added amenities at the shuttle terminals, including free champagne and snacks, vacation discounts and facsimile machines.
The largest lure, however, appeared to be the benefits airlines provide to those who accumulate flight miles. ''I got caught up in competing for the frequent flier miles,'' said Andrea Black, a television producer who flies weekly.
Arthur Messinger, a food executive, said of Pan Am's benefits, ''It's all the goodies and free vacations that got me.''
While gaining converts to the Metroliner may be difficult, Amtrak officials say they expect the service to grow slowly and are prepared to wait.
 
'Civil, the Genteel Way'
It could be a long wait. Most people interviewed on a recent 7:30 A.M. express train said they were not first-time Metroliner travelers. Generally, they said they used the train because they lived it Manhattan and found it easier to get to Pennsylvania Station than La Guardia Airport in Queens.
Gordon Ohlsson, a publishing executive from Washington who owns an apartment in Manhattan, said, ''The train is much more convenient; no taxis, no airport hassles and I get a lot more room.''
Some passengers also said they found the train service more reliable. ''If all goes right, certainly the plane is faster,'' said Chris Amundsen, an economist. ''But that happens so rarely.''
But it was David Bork, a management consultant from Aspen, Colo., who offered Amtrak its best hope. Sounding as though he were reading from an advertising script, he said trains were ''civil, the genteel way to travel.''

HEADLINE: Senator's Troubles Test Minnesotans' Tolerance

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In a state that likes to think of its politics as especially clean and genteel, Minnesota Democrats see special opportunities in Senator David Durenberger's problems.
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party dominates the state and the Congressional delegation but has been unable to reclaim the two Senate seats it lost to the Republicans in the same year, 1978.
Mr. Durenberger, a liberal Republican elected that year to fill out the term of the late Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, has enjoyed one of the highest popularity ratings of any Minnesota officeholder. He won a third Senate term in 1988 by trouncing Mr. Humphrey's son, Hubert H. (Skip) Humphrey, the current Attorney General. The other Republican seat, held by Rudy Boschwitz, is up for election this year and Mr. Boschwitz is heavily favored to win. 
But over the past two months, Mr. Durenberger has found himself under increasing attack by the Minnesota press about issues that he thought had been laid to rest in the campaign: an unusual, lucrative book publishing arrangement and bills for questionable travel expenses.
While Minnesotans will forgive much in their politicians, there are limits. His constituents stood by Mr. Durenberger when his marital and family problems were front-page news five years ago, but now politicians of both parties say state voters are more troubled by allegations that paint him as part of a pattern of abuse of privilege and power in Washington.
 
'A Minnesota Ethos'
''In Minnesota there is less of a liklihood that people will say, 'O.K., that's just politics,' '' said Mayor Don Frazier of Minneapolis, himself a former Democratic member of Congress.
Jim Rogers, the host of a public affairs show on WCCO radio in Minneapolis, noted that of the listeners who telephoned when Senator Durenberger was the guest in late December, most ''were pretty tough on him, but in a particularly Minnesotan way.'' He said there is ''a Minnesota ethos - politics here are cleaner, more honest, less ego-ridden; we expect our people here to be very high caliber.''
David M. Jennings, a Republican political analyst and former Speaker of the Minnesota House, said this of the state's political character: ''Independent voters here are so fierce and so proud that if they've gone down the ballot and found they've voted for too many candidates in the same party, they'll vote for the other party just to balance it off.'' He added of Mr. Durenberger that ''part of his charm is that he doesn't toe the Republican line.''
Still, the Senator's political future has been the main topic each week on a widely viewed local public affairs television program. The Mankato Free Press, which endorsed him in 1988, called for his resignation; Mr. Durenberger himself raised eyebrows and hackles in both parties by appearing to blame his lawyers and former aides for ''sloppy legal work'' on the financial activities for which the Senate Ethics Committee is now investigating him. To many Minnesotans, the Senator's statements smacked of disloyalty.
Mr. Durenberger said that the quotations about ''sloppy legal work'' in a front-page article in The Minneapolis Star Tribune did not accurately reflect his repeated statements in the interview with the newspaper, and that he was fully responsible for what brought him before the committee.
The committee, which began its investigation in September 1988, is trying to determine if a book publishing arrangement Mr. Durenberger had in 1985 and 1986 was intended to evade Senate limits on speaking fees. The committee is also trying to find out if he violated Senate rules by arranging speaking engagements in Boston that would pay for trips he made there for personal reasons.
 
Real Estate Partnership
In addition, the committee is looking into newly emerging questions about a 1983-87 real estate partnership that enabled him to bill the Senate for lodging in a Minneapolis condominium of which he was part owner.
Bill Luther, the assistant majority leader in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor-controlled Minnesota State Senate, said the the condominium and the flap over comments about aides helped crystalize an issue that simply wasn't ''developed at the time of the 1988 election.''
''It's not dissimilar to Watergate and George McGovern's unsuccessful Presidential effort in 1972,'' he said. ''George McGovern didn't win that election, but that didn't make Watergate any less a travesty.''
Mr. Jennings, the political analyst, called the the news reporting of current developments overheated and unfair, but he said there was no question that Mr. Durenberger had a serious problem.
''What people believe is that the book deal stinks, that the condo deal is bad,'' he said. ''There is a perception that he has done something wrong. What he needs to do is be on the attack so that the headline says 'Durenberger Apologizes,' or 'Durenberger Denies,' or 'Durenberger Fights Back.' ''
 
Strategy Down the Tubes
The most immediate casualty is the campaign strategy that the Republicans had hoped to use in the 1990 elections to unseat the two-term Democratic Governor, Rudy Perpich, and regain control of the House.
Half a dozen Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party members have been accused of ethical misconduct, and Republicans had hoped they could exploit that issue, as well as raise questions about Mr. Perpich's political ties to a wealthy Minnesotan whose ailing savings and loan institution has been taken over by the Government.
Mr. Durenberger has apologized to his constituents for ''mistakes and lapses in judgment,'' saying that while he believed his activities were permissible under Senate rules, he was wrong to have undertaken them and that he now knows they seemed improper. He has promised a full accounting of the real estate partnership and any tax or economic benefits he derived from it.
He expects to appear before the Ethics Committee early in February and hopes the panel will make a decision on his case by the end of that month.
A lawyer himself, and an authority on the complex subject of health policy, Mr. Durenberger has had trouble convincing critics at home that he did not know the particulars of his own financial transactions and cannot make the information available because he doesn't have it.
 
More Than Apologies, He Says
''To the general public, it's not credible at all, but to those of us who know him it's very credible,'' said Tom Horner, a former Durenberger chief of staff who heads a public relations firm. ''He's the absent-minded professor who can discuss the galaxy but doesn't know where he parked the car.''
In his Minneapolis office at the end of the week, fuming over the ''drip, drip, drip,'' of negative publicity, Mr. Durenberger acknowledged that he was on the defensive and that repairing his reputation and credibility will need more than apologies. On Friday morning, he said, his priest called him aside to tell him, ''The thing that's dripping on you is vagueness.''
''It's killing me, the inability to respond to the condo thing,'' the Senator said. ''It's like a claw around my neck.'' He said he hoped to have all the information available shortly. ''Yes, I'm choking on vagueness,'' he said.
He dismissed any notion of resigning. ''There's not another person in the state who could have beat Skip Humphrey,'' he said, ''And I'll be darned if I'm going to let his cronies beat me now.''
What hurts, he said, is the knowledge that he has disappointed people in Minnesota, let them down. ''It means I've got to earn back that good feeling.'' How does one earn back a good feeling? ''I can't think as much about how to win it back now because I've first got to convince people that I'm really not a bad guy.''

HEADLINE: Study for War Changes With Europe

BYLINE: By BERNARD E. TRAINOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
As the faculty of the Naval War College at Newport, R.I., sat in a conference room puzzling over what changes are needed in their curriculum to respond to the dramatic events unfolding in Eastern Europe, 50 generals and admirals from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were playing an annual war game next door.
For the senior NATO officers, it was business as usual. In their eyes the enemy threat was undiminished as they sought last week to defeat a hypothetical Soviet attack on Norway.
One British officer watching the scene said, ''When military men don't know what to do, they do what they know.'' 
But for the senior officers who serve as instructors at the nation's top-level military schools, teaching what they know is no longer enough. For more than 40 years, like the participants in the war game, they have prepared to deal with Soviet aggression. Now they find that threat is growing more ambiguous by the day and say that war games portraying the Soviet Union as the aggressor are increasingly irrelevant.
 
'The Threat Is Uncertainty'
''The threat is no longer the Russians,'' said Capt. John H. Heidt of the Navy school. ''The threat is uncertainty.''
Robin Pirie, the head of the college's strategic studies group, agreed and said, ''Developing a course of instruction in the face of such dramatic changes is like trying to paint a moving train.''
The Army, Navy and Air Force each have war colleges and the Defense Department sponsors two more that specialize in economics and resource management as well as high-level strategy.
The colleges play a major role in developing strategic thinkers and prospective generals and admirals for the armed forces. More than a thousand of the services' brightest officers are selected each year to attend nine-month courses at the colleges.
Most students are experienced officers in the grade of commander in the Navy or lieutenant colonel in the other services who will go on to important command and staff assignments. The courses at all five colleges stress military theory and the principles of national security. Through seminars, war games and research, the students formulate strategies and set up military forces to carry them out.
 
Quick Change After Stability
Until the events of the past year, the students wrestled with problems largely concerning a threat from the Soviet Union like the one addressed in the NATO war game at Newport. The problems differed little from those faced by officers attending the schools a decade ago, but this academic year all that has been changing as the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and the Warsaw Pact was unraveling.
Vice Adm. John Baldwin, the head the National Defense University, which consists of the National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, said nobody in the military or the academic world foresaw the sudden upheaval in Eastern Europe. Its effect upon military thinking in the colleges is still unclear.
''While the principles underlying national security remain the same,'' he said, ''what that means in practice is by no means clear.''
The events in Europe and the military's role in the war against drugs have stimulated sharp discussions among the students, and the prospect of a reduced military budget has already raised questions about the services' roles and what they might be called on to do.
''The Russians are 'out' and the third world is 'in' '' said Lieut. Col. Paul Pugh, a marine who is a student at the Naval War College. ''In a changing world, each of us wants his own service to be out front with innovative thinking.''
 
'No School Solution'
Col. Roy Stafford, the academic dean of the National War College, said the students know that ''there is no school solution to the new challenges and that their views are just as valid as those of the faculty,''
Col. Don Lundy of the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., said, ''Everyone accepts the fact that the old way of thinking is on its way out, but what happens in Europe now?''
''With the rebirth of nationalism in the East, are we going back to 1912 and an endless round of territorial disputes?'' he asked. ''How much of a threat will that be to U.S. interests? What sort of military do we need for the coming decade? What is the ideal balance between active duty forces and reserves for both NATO and third world contingencies, including the drug war?''
The colonel said war colleges must integrate thinking about these issues into their curriculums for the current and coming year.
 
New Approaches Are Varied
With the exception of the Air War College in Montgomery, Ala., whose commander, Lieut. Gen. Charles G. Boyd, said the college's curriculum is driven by ''enduring concepts'' unrelated to current events, academic deans at the schools are considering a variety of changes for the next academic year, which begins this summer.
The National War College believes the best way to deal with uncertainty is to ask the budding strategists in the school to decide the kind of world the United States wants to see 10 years from now and to work back from that on the ways of making it a reality while at the same time providing a hedge against unpredictable events.
The Naval War College takes a different approach. Capt. Betsy Wylie, the academic dean, said the future is too uncertain to be definitive.
''It is like driving in a fog,'' she said.''Your high beams will only blind you. It is better to creep along on your lows so you can see where you are going.''
William Turcotte, the head of the school's strategy branch, said this means the college sees the current situation as an interim one: ''It is much too early to say how things will play out. In the meantime, the students should confine their thinking to what is happening, not what they think will happen. Maintaining a strong and balanced military force has gotten us to where we are, and we should not go off on flights of fancy before the dust settles.''
Another faculty member said, ''We know we will have smaller armed forces, but we want the students to think about what those forces will look like and do.''
The colleges admit they were unprepared for the rush of events in Europe, as well as being equally unprepared to address the role of the military in the war on drugs, a role that was not even considered by the colleges during the Reagan Administration.
As part as President Bush's anti-drug campaign, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently increased the role of the armed forces, but there are no drug enforcement experts on any of the faculties.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SAID TO LAG IN SCHOOL SPENDING

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The United States spends relatively less on elementary and secondary education than do 13 other industrial countries, according to a report made public today.
The report, compiled by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization, also criticized assertions by President Bush that the nation ''lavishes unsurpassed resources on schooling.''
The Education Department said it disagreed with the report's findings and that officials were preparing a detailed response. 
The paper, ''Shortchanging Education,'' said that only Australia and Ireland invest less on elementary and secondary education, relative to the size of their economies, than the United States does.
 
Other Countries' 'Average'
Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Canada, West Germany, France, the Netherlands, Britain and Italy all invest more, said the nonprofit institute, which receives its major financing from labor organizations.
''If the U.S. were to increase spending for primary and secondary school up to the 'average' level found in the other 15 countries, we would need to raise spending by over $20 billion annually,'' the report read.
M. Edith Rasell, who wrote the report, said the results were based on widely accepted data published by the Federal Government and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
 
Three-Way Tie for Second
The report acknowledged that the United States ''spends comparatively more than other countries on higher education.'' But Ms. Rasell said that ''when expenditues on all levels of education - pre-primary, primary, secondary and post-secondary - are calculated, the United States is in a three-way tie for second place among the countries studied.''
The Education Department has estimated that total education spending by state, local and Federal governments will total $353 billion this year. By that measure, Sweden spends a larger share of national income on education than the United States, and Canada and the Netherlands spend equivalent amounts.
But when spending on higher education is removed from comparative data, the report said that ''the relative position of U.S. spending falls from a three-way tie for second highest in spending to close to the bottom of the group of 16 industrial nations.''
The statistics show that the United States spent 4.1 percent of its national income on elementary and secondary education in 1985, while the average abroad was 4.6 percent. Sweden spent 7 percent, followed by Austria at 5.9 percent, Switzerland at 5.8 percent, Norway at 5.3 percent, Belgium at 4.9 percent and Denmark and Japan at 4.8 percent. Canada spent 4.7 percent, West Germany and France, 4.6 percent, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, 4.5 percent and Italy, 4.2 percent.
Counting higher education as well, spending as a percentage of national income was Sweden, 7.6 percent; The United States, Canada and the Netherlands, 6.8 percent; Japan, 6.5 percent; Norway, 6.3 percent; Belgium, 6.1 percent; Denmark and Ireland, 68 percent; France, 5.9 percent; Austria, 5.8 percent; Australia, 5.5 percent; Britain, 5.2 percent; Switzerland, 5.1 percent; Italy, 4.8 percent and West Germany, 4.6 percent.
The institute's report noted assertions by President Bush at last year's meeting of the nation's governors to discuss education that the country ''lavishes unsurpassed resources on schooling,'' and therefore, ''Our focus must no longer be on resources - it must be on results.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Memories: Too Short

 BODY:
An unusual cooperative venture with the apt name of U.S. Memories has failed to raise the necessary funds from American computer companies to go into the business of making memory chips. A major opportunity to guard against future pressure from Japanese competitors thus seems to have been frittered away.
The idea of U.S. Memories began four years ago when American computer companies found only 10 percent of their memory chips were coming from U.S. sources, the rest mostly from Japan. The danger of such dependence is that Japanese chip makers could acquire control of the market, and favor Japanese computer companies with the latest chips and lowest prices. 
I.B.M. offered to license to U.S. Memories its technology for making the next generation of memory chips, those carrying four megabits of information. U.S. Memories has sought to raise $500 million from other computer companies to put the new chip into production.
But the supposed beneficiaries are no longer so worried. Twelve months ago, one-megabit memory chips were in short supply. Now they are abundant. Times are tough and few computer makers wish to spend now to avert a possible future shortage. Companies like Apple Computer say they have secured their own supply with long-term contracts. They may have correctly judged their situation - or may be mortgaging their future to Japanese suppliers.
But without alternative sources of supply, memory chips will surely again grow scarce and expensive, unless other companies can produce the next generation of chips in copious amounts. Without U.S. Memories, Japanese companies will be free to cut production and raise prices again. ''It's a textbook strategy. These guys are masters of the game, and the U.S. industry is playing into their hands,'' says Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association.
Japanese computer companies are members of industrial conglomerates and enjoy Tokyo's support in indirect ways. U.S. Memories was an effort to match some of these advantages. Had it succeeded, it might have become a model for similar consortiums on other technologies, like flat screens.
The failed attempt leaves the U.S. semiconductor industry with no other visible strategy for stemming its decline. The decline affects other industries that depend on access to the latest chips, like computers and telecommunications. ''This isn't the demise of the industry, but the trend is very disturbing,'' says Sanford Kane, the former I.B.M. executive who heads U.S. Memories. ''As the industry moves along the trend it becomes a second-class industry, and the U.S. economy with it.''
The industry tried to help itself and failed. Washington paid no attention. Though an expression of concern might have helped U.S. Memories get off the ground, the Bush Administration summarily dismissed a recent blue-ribbon report warning that the semiconductor industry is in trouble.
Mr. Kane and I.B.M. have done their imaginative best. The failure of U.S. Memories is the failure of grasshoppers like Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer to remember that winter follows summer, and the failure of the Administration to notice that the foundation of some critical industries is slowly crumbling.

HEADLINE: Auditors Not to Blame For Thrifts Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, I strongly disagree with the view in ''The Lapses by Lincoln's Auditors'' (Business Day, Dec. 28) that auditing rules didn't keep pace with change in the savings and loan industry.
The major causes of the savings and loan crisis are well known: an interest rate squeeze, a downturn in oil, gas and agriculture, and a deregulatory climate that encouraged greater risk taking and sought to downplay savings and loan problems. 
The accounting profession consistently urged caution in the face of regulatory proposals that would weaken accounting discipline applicable to savings and loan institutions. As early as 1981, we warned against allowing them to defer losses from asset sales. Later, we objected to proposals to defer recognition of bad debt losses and other devices to create equity artificially for the thrifts.
Moreover, as I testified before the House Banking Committee last February, my organization provided guidance to savings and loan auditors through the 1980's. Since January 1983, we issued 33 pieces of audit guidance applicable to thrifts. We continue to provide guidance as Congress and the regulators seek to resolve the crisis.

HEADLINE: Americans Still Trade Real Estate for Beads

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Fifth Column,'' Peter Passell's Economic Scene column on foreign investment and our trade deficit (Business Day, Dec. 20), makes light of the major issue. The primary concern is not that we are spending instead of saving. The number of jobs in the ever-increasing service economy is no better a measure of economic vitality than to claim the baby isn't sick because it doesn't have a fever.
Rather, what we must focus on, and change, is that we are financing our purchase of depreciable foreign merchandise (cars, videocameras, sneakers, clothing, beverages, small appliances to name a few) with the sale of appreciable assets, such as United States real estate and corporations.
Long after our Sri Lankan socks and Swedish Volvos have gone to the landfill and scrap yard, foreign investors with savvy will still be collecting even more rent and ringing up continuing corporate profits.
Intelligent people don't lay the blame solely to Japan, either. Until we collectively realize that we're trading equity for consumables, there doesn't seem any hope for change on the horizon.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can Help Soviet Private Entrepreneurs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is understandable that William Safire finds the ''Z'' article in the winter issue of Daedalus important (column, Jan. 4), because it affirms his skeptical reading of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It is less clear why you gave the article such prominence, excerpting it on the same Op-Ed page. The article's main conclusion is a warmed-over version of the arguments used to justify the Bush Administration's early reluctance to support perestroika and glasnost: that the Soviet Union is, after all, still a Communist system, and any outside aid will simply help prolong that system's life. 
Z reaches this conclusion by positing unbridgeable gaps between Bolshevism and democracy and between command and market economies, and by putting forward a crude cold-war image of the Communist Party. He argues that reform (''soft Communism'') is impossible because Soviet institutions, and particularly the Communist Party, are incapable of introducing true reform.
The party in this view is incapable of reform because it will ineluctably seek to maintain its role in the system. How does Z explain the significant numbers of reform Communists, including the radical group of deputies in the Supreme Soviet, who seek to reduce the role of the party and create a multiparty system? It is not at all inconceivable that in the next few years this wing could come to dominate party decision-making bodies, as has happened in the Communist parties of the Baltic republics.
While it is true that the measures adopted so far are inadequate to achieve either democracy or marketization, it is too soon to say they will not be expanded in the absence of total collapse. Mr. Gorbachev is not basing his reforms, as Z states, on structures programmed for ''hard'' Communism. The new Congress of People's Deputies and Supreme Soviet are unlike any previous Soviet political institutions and have shown considerable assertiveness - particularly in rejecting appointees for government posts and in sending back for revision draft laws that it considered too conservative. Ultimately, this too undermines the role of the party in setting policy.
Z concludes that United States assistance to President Gorbachev would be counterproductive; it would only ''prolong the agony'' and delay the inevitable collapse of the system, though he makes an exception for aid for ''parallel structures in a private sector . . . to promote economic and, eventually, political pluralism.'' This point is well taken, though by confining the discussion to free economic zones, Z ignores another option: to open a major program to assist the thousands of new Soviet private enterprises called cooperatives.
While mostly confined to the service sector and small-scale production, a few large state enterprises have been privatized and turned into cooperatives. These enterprises face severe problems in technological modernization and access to supplies, mostly because economic reform has stalled in other areas. The United States Government could provide incentives for American companies to create joint ventures with cooperatives and help modernize them. The United States could also support management training programs for Soviet private entrepreneurs.
These and other steps would increase the vitality of what has already become the most dynamic sector of the Soviet economy and help push the Soviets along the path of reform.

HEADLINE: To Help New Democracies, Cut Aid to Israel, 4 Others

BYLINE: By Bob Dole; Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, is the Senate minority leader.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's always a little risky to predict history's verdict on contemporary events. But even from today's sometimes shortsighted perspective, it is safe to declare 1989 as one of the watershed years of the 20th century - the year in which Communism collapsed and the long dormancy of freedom suddenly and dramatically blossomed in places from Poland to Panama.
In fact, events have been moving so fast that, in some ways, we're all playing catch-up in our own analyses and policy prescriptions. A little caution makes great sense in such a volatile environment. 
But this much is already clear: We do have an enormous opportunity to consolidate and expand freedom's gains and, at the same time, to enhance America's security and economic potential.
If the new democracies and free market economies fail, the long-term cost to America and to the cause of freedom will be enormous. But if they succeed, it will mean that the United States could enjoy increased security, reduced defense budgets and armament levels and expanded markets for our exports and our ingenuity. Simply put, there is no better investment we can make in America in 1990 than finding ways to support the new democracies.
That's the good news. The bad news is that supporting freedom is not free. It will cost bucks - big bucks. And we must find those bucks within the constraints of our own crushing budget deficits and a foreign aid budget that is already stretched to the breaking point.
We may be able to increase marginally our overall foreign aid expenditures. But the reality is that we are not going to have much more foreign aid money in the next few years, at least until the so-called peace dividend kicks in (if it ever materializes).
The immediate answer must include reallocation of what we are spending on foreign aid now.
Let me make this point clear: I am certainly not suggesting abandoning or short-changing our long-time friends around the world. They remain very important to us, and their needs are just as real and pressing as those of the new democracies.
What I am suggesting is to re-examine some of the huge aid programs in a few countries - the so-called earmarked countries - that take most of our current aid budget. Right now, the big five - Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and Pakistan - receive more than two-thirds of our foreign aid.
Does it make sense, at this historic moment, to provide these countries practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing dramatically promising new aid initiatives in Eastern Europe or other important countries? What about, for example, those Latin American nations in the front lines in the war against drugs?
Consider this simple fact: A 5 percent cut in current aid programs for the big five would provide about $330 million - enough to respond to the needs of new democracies such as Poland, Hungary, Panama and countless needy countries that under current allocations will receive not one penny of American aid.
Perhaps an even larger across-the-board cut and reallocation would be warranted, as the democratic revolution gains momentum. That would represent a better balancing of our limited resources with our changing priorities.
No doubt, these proposed reallocations will raise a hue and cry. But can't we convince our friends who would ''lose'' a tiny amount of their aid how much it is in their interest, too, to help insure against the failure of new democracies and free-market economies?
Can't those pressure groups that have turned some of our foreign aid programs virtually into ''entitlement programs'' realize that making some minor adjustments in aid allocations can simultaneously serve the countries of their special interest, and serve America?
And can't my colleagues in Congress, who have forced the President to swallow a few huge earmarked aid programs, stand up to domestic political pressure and resist the temptation to politicize foreign aid? Can't they instead support an amended foreign aid strategy that more completely serves the national interest?
Even despite Congressionally mandated aid programs, the President has the authority to make the small reallocations of foreign aid that I believe are warranted. I encourage him to consider seriously making those reallocations now. I stand ready to work hard to insure that the Congress and the American public will back him up.
To me, it boils down to this: Are big gains for freedom worth a small cut in a few huge foreign aid programs? I say yes.

HEADLINE: A Storybook Development With an Uncertain Ending

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Jan. 15

 BODY:
When Federal regulators seized control of New Jersey's largest savings institution last month, one of the troubled properties that came with it was Port Liberte, a storybook development of sumptuous town houses rising above lazy canals on the cluttered waterfront here.
To bank officials, Port Liberte is just one of the risky real-estate ventures that lured lenders across the country into debt way over their heads, setting off the savings and loan crisis. But to developers and investors, Port Liberte is one of the most ambitious projects attempted in the metropolitan region, a bold but sobering symbol of what can happen when unharnessed ambition exceeds reality.
Conceived in the financially optimistic days of the mid-1980's, this immense project on the Hudson River 4,000 feet west of the Statue of Liberty is floundering amid the region's economic slowdown.
Cost overruns and delays caused by the complexity of its design combined with an inability to close sales in 1989 to create a cash crisis for Port Liberte; with less than a fifth of the proposed 1,690 houses and apartments built, its developer ran out of money and halted construction. Most of the stores that were planned have not opened. The promised restaurant has not served a meal. 
 
'Buying Into a Dream'
Port Liberte's developer, Paul W. Bucha, says he is confident he will find overseas investors to pay off the project's $158 million debt and see it through to completion. Failing that, regulators may choose to foreclose, selling what has been built to the highest bidder, who could then push on. Or they could invest the $20 million to $30 million needed to complete Port Liberte's first phase of 363 homes, now 15 months behind schedule, and then sell the bank's interest.
The project's future is no more uncertain than when Port Liberte was proposed in 1980.
''What it will take is due diligence, a certain amount of creativity and buying into a dream,'' said Mr. Bucha, the president of Port Liberte Partners, a international group of designers, architects and builders. ''And let's not kid anybody. It is a dream.'' The first glimpse of Port Liberte is a surprise. It is taller and more striking than anything within a mile, except for the Statue of Liberty rising gracefully above its rooflines.
This is the epitome of the new Hudson River waterfront, the showiest of the projects being built along the 18 miles of old railroads and piers from here north to the George Washington Bridge. A few hundred feet south, the old waterfront survives on a pier where cars are shredded into scrap.
What has been completed is substantial. The first section of winding canals is open, and a few sailboats are tied up at backyard docks. There are 37 town houses and 326 apartments in various stages of completion; 189 homes are occupied.
The architecture is a subtle blend of Mediterranean village and Dutch streetscape. Some town houses sold for more than $750,000. Dual-level apartments on the upper floors of the larger buildings offer sweeping views of the New York Harbor and the lights of Manhattan.
''It's one of the most fascinating and interesting projects ever done around New York,'' said Steven G. Rockmore, chairman of Gilbert Charles Beylen, a real-estate marketing company in New York. ''The unfortunate part of it is that it's in Jersey City.''
Not just Jersey City, but a corner far from everything except the river. There are other waterfront projects here, but they are nearer established neighborhoods and PATH trains to Manhattan.
Many real-estate professionals admire the pluck of Port Liberte's developers, though they say only foreigners unfamiliar with the psychological barriers separating New Jersey from New York would have undertaken so extravagant a venture here.
 
'A Vision in Mind'
''They had a vision in mind,'' Mr. Rockmore said, ''a vision that was so grandiose, so ambitious, that the reality of where they were doing it got lost.''
The developers expected to sell heavily to New Yorkers. But New Jerseyans, most of them professionals, bought 85 percent of the first 303 homes sold or under contract. New Yorkers bought just 10 percent, and foreigners the rest.
An unexpected obstacle was the Wall Street decline that began with the October 1987 crash and has resulted in 16,000 layoffs in the financial services industry. Wall Street was to have been a major source of buyers.
''It got a little out of sync with the market,'' said Richard Schlott, president of Schlott Realtors, one of New Jersey's largest real-estate companies.
 
Out of Step
The project was out of step in other ways. Daring to be different in concept and design, the developers were unable to find craftsmen skilled enough to translate the plan into reality.
Expensive canals, for example, had to be built before sales could begin in earnest; the project was based on them. At first the developers tried to build the canal bulkheads with concrete piles, but they glanced off sunken barges and other fill and set crooked. Later, steel piles were used, but the developers had lost time and money.
Forty-seven floor plans, four different types of roofs and intricate interior woodwork further complicated the job, pushing costs up and completion dates back until the project was more than a year behind schedule and millions over budget.
Still, the concept gained acceptance. Patricia and Otto Lowe were among the first buyers, putting a down payment on their waterfront town house before anything was built. They sold their six-bedroom house in Short Hills and moved to Jersey City in May 1987. Mr. Lowe, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Company in lower Manhattan, now takes Port Liberte's ferry to and from work, 15 minutes each way.
 
A New Way of Life
For the Lowes it is a new way of life, a kind of suburb-by-the-sea. Mrs. Lowe is taking sailing lessons and the family has bought a 13-foot rubber Zodiac, the kind of motorized raft used by the explorer Jacques Cousteau.
''At first Otto said, 'If I miss the ferry you might be able to whip me across the river,' '' Mrs. Lowe said. ''I said, 'You're crazy.' '' So far, she has not had to try.
Though they continue to shop in Short Hills, about half an hour away, and return there to play tennis, the Lowes say they have not been disappointed with life at Port Liberte. ''In the summer we sit outside every single night,'' Mrs. Lowe said. ''We don't watch TV. We watch the lights come on in the city.''
For Robert Shifman, a retired manufacturer, Port Liberte represents the best of all worlds. An avid sailor who lived for years up and down the East Coast aboard his 39-foot cutter, ''Mon Liberte,'' he bought a $209,000 one-bedroom condominium and a $60,000 boat slip just below his third-floor window.
 
In Dark Moments, Pit Liberte
''The best part of Port Liberte is the character of the development, which I describe as a joining of London, Amsterdam and Venice,'' Mr. Shifman said. ''The worst part of it, unfortunately, is the delay in construction.''
Residents say they are tired of the dirt and noise and they are disappointed that the ferry does not run on weekends. In darker moments, a few refer to the project as Pit Liberte.
But the disappointment is nothing compared with the frustration and anger that residents said they felt in December when Port Liberte's primary lender, City Federal Savings Bank, was taken over by the Federal Government and news reports tied the bank's problems to Port Liberte.
''On the day we heard about it, naturally we felt discouraged,'' said Harvard G. Gordon, who with his wife, Dorothy, moved from Short Hills to Port Liberte in 1987. The Gordons have not panicked by trying to sell right away, but some people have. Twenty-two homes are up for resale.
 
'We'd Probably Take a Loss'
''The major problem we're worried about is our investment,'' said Mr. Gordon, who owns a factory in Brooklyn. ''If we were forced to sell right now, we'd probably take a loss.''
Last fall, CityFed Financial Corporation of Somerset, N.J., the parent company of City Federal, reported a net loss of $223.7 million for the third quarter of 1989. Bank officials attributed it to bad real-estate loans, lower bond portfolio values and operational losses. Less than a month later, Federal regulators seized the bank. It was the second largest savings institution taken over by the Government.
Of City Federal's loss, less than a quarter, or $52.7 million, concerned Port Liberte. Apartments were under contract, but buyers had the right to back out if their homes were not completed within nine months, and many did. Because the sales were not completed, the developer did not have the money to pay off the loan.
To finance Port Liberte, City Federal had formed a consortium of 15 financial institutions, including two others that also ended up taken over by the Government. City Federal and two other institutions also formed a partnership that holds a 50 percent equity interest in the project.
 
Heroic Sense of Optimism
City Federal played the lead role in administering a revolving line of credit - much like a home equity loan - in which money advanced for construction was repaid and loaned again. It totaled nearly $160 million.
Last March the loan expired and had to be renegotiated. In the meantime, the bank refused to give out any more money. Unable to pay its contractors, the developer shut down construction. Contracts of sale could not be closed, and some 113 sales remain in limbo.
Last summer the bank ordered a fair market appraisal on Port Liberte that pegged its value at $88 million, far below the $158 million the developers owed. The bank declared the $52.7 million loss on the basis of the preliminary results of the appraisal.
Mr. Bucha, the developer, is a Medal of Honor winner with a heroic sense of optimism that some of his rivals say borders on recklessness. In spite of all the bad news, he believes the permits he has to build 1,690 homes and the record of more than 400 sales before some buyers backed out will attract a new lender.
 
'I'm Fairly Confident'
He said he is negotiating with Sung Mo Chung, the head of Elite Company, a South Korean construction concern which owns office buildings in Seoul, to complete the first phase and take over the rest of Port Liberte.
Perhaps because prices are so high and so many buyers are well-established, Port Liberte residents seem to be taking the problems in stride.
''I'm fairly confident the project will be completed,'' said Mr. Shifman, a homeowners' association leader. ''So far there's been absolutely no panic. If you doubt that, try to pick up a bargain here now. I don't think you can.''

HEADLINE: Florio's Bright and Loyal Inner Circle

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The top advisers James J. Florio will bring with him when he is sworn in as governor of New Jersey on Tuesday are known for having many of the same traits as their boss: intelligence, loyalty, liberal instincts and reputations as tough political operatives.
All from New Jersey, many with degrees from Ivy League schools, the people known as the Florio team helped execute a nearly mistake-free campaign last fall, one that Democrats lauded and Republicans called one of the dirtiest in state history.
In the 10 weeks since Mr. Florio was elected by a landslide, they have rarely appeared in public as they engineered the takeover of the only statewide elective office, with its hundreds of appointees and its overwhelming control of a $12 billion government.
Mr. Florio, who describes his first love as making policy, and practicing politics as a price that must be paid, is expected to centralize the top decision-making in the governor's office, to give his top advisers unusual political influence and power. 
 
Devotion and Discretion
His inner circle includes a former Superior Court judge, a lawyer who worked in the campaigns of Mr. Florio and Senator Bill Bradley, a former social worker, a former journalist, and a university professor who studied the failures of Federal social programs in the 1960's and 70's.
What the Florio insiders share are years of experience with Mr. Florio in which they proved their devotion, discretion and intelligence, politicians here say. His aides say that after proving their loyalty to him, they are given a good deal of freedom to express their ideas and can count on his loyalty in return. Nonetheless, they say Mr. Florio insists on maintaining tight control of all major policy decisions.
''Generally, they are politically savvy, politically capable people who have proven themselves in various political wars,'' said Alan Rosenthal, the director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ''I think they are more adept at politics than they are at policy.''
The group includes Steven P. Perskie, a 45-year-old former judge who will serve as Mr. Florio's chief of staff; Douglas Berman, 37, who has been named state treasurer; Brenda J. Bacon, 39, who will serve as head of the Office of Management and Planning, and Jon Shure, 38, a former reporter for The Record of Hackensack, who has been named director of communications.
 
Professor As Policy Director
In addition, Carl Van Horn, 39, a professor of political science and associate director of Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute, is expected to be a major contributor to Florio's policy initiatives as director of policy. Gregory Lawler, a member of Mr. Florio's Washington staff, is expected to play an important role in shaping legislative initiatives like Mr. Florio's plans for bringing down the high price of automobile insurance in the state.
Some leading members of the new administration say there was some jockeying between Mr. Perskie and Mr. Berman for the lead role under Mr. Florio. Although Mr. Perskie took what was probably the most powerful position among Mr. Florio's aides, Mr. Berman's appointment as treasurer gives him direct involvement in all budget and tax issues, central concerns to an administration facing a growing budget deficit and the possibility of changing the state tax structure.
Mr. Perskie, a graduate of Yale and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, served with Mr. Florio in the State Assembly in the 1970's and gained a reputation for a sharp intellect and keen political instinct as Senate majority leader and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Among his duties, officials say, will be working with the Legislature.
Mr. Berman, a graduate of Yale and Columbia University Law School, had worked in two of Senator Bradley's Senate campaigns before taking over the Florio election effort last year.
 
Health Care and Federal Failures
Ms. Bacon, a graduate of the Hampton Institute and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, began her career as a social worker and served as president of a health care consulting firm and as a Camden County Freeholder. She has a particular interest in health-care issues and in changing the way the state delivers social services. Aides say Mr. Florio often calls on Ms. Bacon to help him thrash out policy decisions.
Mr. Van Horn, who attended the University of Pittsburgh and received his Ph.D. from Ohio State University, has written extensively on the failures of Federal programs for the long-term unemployed in the 1960's and 70's, devised in Washington and implemented by the states.

HEADLINE: Housing Police Ask Merger With New York Force

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
The head of the union that represents New York City housing police officers called yesterday for a merger of that force with the city's Police Department.
''It's better for the City of New York,'' said Jack Jordan, president of the Housing Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ''It's better for our members. It's better for the tenants and it will save money. So we say, let's do it.'' 
Though both housing and city officers take the same entrance examinations and attend the Police Academy, are appointed from the same list and are paid the same, some housing officers have complained that city officers have greater opportunities for different types of assignments and are viewed as having greater prestige.
At the same time, some city officers have expressed concern that, under a merger, they might get housing-patrol or other assignments they do not want.
 
Transit Union Agrees
Mayor David N. Dinkins said afterward that merging the separate city, transit and housing police forces would be ''one of the first things'' the city's new Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, would study after he takes office on Monday. He said Mr. Brown would then ''make recommendations to me about whether a merger makes sense.''
A little later, Ron Reale, the president of the Transit Police Benevolent Association, said he agreed with Mr. Jordan. ''Only through the merger of the three uniformed police services will we be able to accomplish the mission of providing better service to the people of New York,'' Mr. Reale said in a statement.
Joe Mancini, a spokesman for the city's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union would have no immediate comment on the proposal.
The question of a police merger, long a controversial subject, has been raised again recently, with advocates contending that it could result in more effective, efficient and economical operations. Some critics, however, assert that a unification of departments could lead to the subordination of those needs now met by the transit and housing police forces and a dimunition of some services.
Val Coleman, a spokesman for the city's Housing Authority, said yesterday that Louis Raiford Jr., the chief of the housing police, was concerned that a merger might ''siphon off'' certain police services now provided to tenants, like foot patrols on project grounds and patrols inside buildings.
 
'Lateral Transfers' Also Favored
The city's police force has nearly 26,000 members, the transit force, 3,600, and the housing force, 2,100.
Speaking at a news conference outsisde City Hall, Mr. Jordan said that a survey of his members showed that ''the sentiment for a merger is overwhelming.'' If there is no merger, he said, then his members favored a system of ''lateral transfers'' that would make it possible for officers from one department to voluntarily transfer to another.
Mr. Jordan said it was unfair to force a person who wants to join one department to go to another. He said that while some housing officers would, if they could, transfer to the city department, some city officers might prefer to be assigned to work in housing projects. He asserted there had been no shortage of candidates for housing police jobs when there was a separate selection process.
The city's Housing Authority now receives millions of dollars in Federal funds that are used for housing security purposes, and housing officials, in the past, have expressed concern that a merger might result in a loss of at least some of that money. But Mr. Jordan said that the problem could be worked out without any loss of money.

HEADLINE: Men at 65: New Findings On Well-Being

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
THE secret of emotional health among older men is not a successful career, a happy marriage or a stable childhood, new findings suggest. It lies instead in an ability to handle life's blows without passivity, blame or bitterness.
The findings, which contradict widely held theories about the importance of early life for emotional well-being in adulthood, are among recent conclusions of a study of 173 men who have been scrutinized at five-year intervals since they graduated from Harvard in the early 1940's.
The project, known as the Grant study after the W. T. Grant Foundation, which initially supported it, is one of a handful that have intensively assessed people at regular intervals through their adult years. Such studies are particularly valuable for the understanding of psychological development because they allow researchers to see what factors matter, for better or worse, later in life. 
The researchers defined emotional health at 65 as the ''clear ability to play and to work and to love,'' and a feeling of satisfaction with life.
These were among their findings:
* Pragmatism and dependability are particularly important.
* Many factors in early life, even devastating problems in childhood, had virtually no effect on well-being at 65.
* Being close to one's siblings at college age was strongly linked to emotional health at 65.
* Severe depression earlier in life caused problems that persisted.
* Traits that were important at college age, like the ability to make friends easily, were unimportant later in life.
The latest data were collected by George E. Vaillant, a psychiatrist at Dartmouth Medical School. He and his wife, Caroline O. Vaillant, a social worker, reported the findings in an article in the January issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. In 1977 Dr. Vaillant published a book, ''Adaptation to Life'' (Little, Brown), based on findings of how the men fared at the age of 47.
The men hardly represent a cross-section of Americans. All were Harvard undergraduates, white, and in good mental and physical health when selected. The researchers say that by avoiding complicating factors like sex, economic status and race, they were able to focus on more subtle forces that propel one person forward while another lags.
One of the most surprising results, Dr. Vaillant said, was that having been close to one's brothers and sisters at college age strongly predicted emotional well-being in adulthood - far more strongly, for example, than having had a good marriage or successful career. Those who were only children or who said they were distant from their siblings at college age fared poorly at 65 compared with those who had at least one close brother or sister.
Before age 50, the most powerful predictors of adult mental health were an emotionally close home life as a child and parents who encouraged trust and initiative. But by 65 those factors faded in significance, and closeness to siblings in childhood ''became as powerful a predictor of later-life adjustment'' as three other factors taken together: family closeness, good relations with parents and the absence of emotional problems in childhood. Dr. Vaillant said researchers could only guess at the reasons. ''It's intriguing, a sleeper variable that didn't show up as important until the men reached 65,'' said Dr. Vaillant. ''I would guess that those who were close early in life had the seeds of a good relationship late in life.''
At the age of 47, the quality of relationships with siblings was not an important factor; having a good marriage and enjoyable job were more strongly related with life satisfaction and emotional health. But in the decade before retirement age, neither mattered as much as did having been close to a sibling earlier in life.
 
'Lots of Surprises'
By and large, those most satisfied at 47 were still happy at 65. But ''there were lots of surprises,'' said Dr. Vaillant. Poor health or alcoholism in that 18-year span set some men back; those with ''strong stoicism'' at 47 were doing well at 65.
The researchers found little evidence that several factors long assumed to be important in lifelong psychological development had much effect on well-being at 65. They included being poor or orphaned in childhood, having parents who divorced (or who were happily married) and having emotional problems in childhood or college.
For instance, of the 204 men in the original group, 13 felt troubled enough during college to have seen a psychiatrist. But by the age of 65 these men fared no worse than the rest of the group.
''In the long run, people are extraordinarily adaptable,'' Dr. Vaillant said. ''Given enough time, people recover and change; a half-century perspective shows that time heals.''
One of the most devastating experiences over the course of life was a severe depression, Dr. Vaillant found. Of the 204 men, 21 had such a depression at some point between the ages of 21 and 50. In the latest study, 15 of the 21 were chronically ill or had died.
''I expected that the men in the study would be better-adapted and protected than most,'' Dr. Vaillant said. ''If they got depressed, it would pass with little lasting effect. But depression led to a greater global disruption of life than any other single factor.''
 
Buffers Against Depression
Having close family relations may have been a buffer against depression, since the researchers found that having had a ''bleak childhood'' predicted depression later in life. But not all of those who had a difficult childhood became depressed. And for those who escaped depression, bad times in childhood seemed to have little long-term effect.
Only 7 percent of those who did well at 65 had not been close to a brother or sister, Dr. Vaillant said. Of the 21 men who became seriously depressed at some point in their lives, 12 were only children or said they were estranged from their siblings by college age.
Whether they were only children or were distant from brothers and sisters, he said, ''the effects of the isolation seem to be the same in later life.'' Psychoanalytic theories of depression hold that emotional warmth early in life, whether with parents or siblings, can be a buffer against depression later.
One of the most potent predictors of well-being at 65 was the ability to handle emotional crisis maturely. Immature reactions included becoming bitter or prejudiced, collecting injustices, feigning cheerfulness and chronically complaining without allowing anyone to help.
The best way to handle emotional crisis, the study found, is to control the first impulse and give a more measured response. ''It's having the capacity to hold a conflict or impulse in consciousness without acting on it,'' Dr. Vaillant said. ''You can acknowledge the clouds, but also see the silver lining.''
Two lifelong traits, pragmatism and dependability, also emerged as particularly important to emotional health at 65 - more so than being clever in analytic work or having a creative flair.
Those who in college had been seen as being good at practical organization in their course work, rather than as having a theoretical, speculative or scholarly bent, were among the healthiest in mind at retirement age, the study found. So were those who as college sophomores were rated by a psychiatrist as ''steady, stable, dependable, thorough, sincere and trustworthy.''
On the other hand, traits that seemed important for psychological adjustment in college mattered less and less over the years. Among these were spontaneity and the ability to make friends easily.
By 65, being pragmatic and well-organized was the trait that most strongly predicted well-being. ''It's another way of measuring perseverance,'' Dr. Vaillant said. ''At this age, perseverance is more important than whether you can run the bases fast.''

HEADLINE: Human Genes Turn Plants Into Factories For Medicines

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS are inserting human genes into plants and turning the plants into miniature factories that can produce large quantities of useful human proteins.
They have grown tobacco plants that produce antibodies; potatoes that make serum albumin, a human blood protein widely used in surgery; and rape plants that make enkephalin, a painkiller produced in the human brain. And a California biotechnology company is planning to market a sun screen containing human melanin, a natural skin pigment, that will be grown in tobacco.
The researchers hope to use plants to make a wide range of human hormones, growth factors, enzymes and immune system cells, said Dr. Andrew Hiatt, a molecular biologist at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, Calif., who grew the antibody-making plants.
While many scientists applaud such experiments, critics say there are risks that need to be addressed. Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends and a frequent critic of biotechnology, said that ''turning living creatures into chemical factories'' has obvious benefits, but that ''the environmental and ethical implications have not been explored.'' 
''If the plants are raised outdoors and the new genes get into the wild gene pool,'' he said, ''it could have a potentially destabilizing effect on the ecological system. They are performing processes not performed in nature.'' Advocates of such experiments say these criticisms are probably exaggerated but agree that they need to be explored.
The usual way of manufacturing proteins is to insert human genes into bacteria, yeast or animal cells. These techniques are a big improvement over previous methods, which required painstaking extraction of proteins from vast amounts of animal tissue. But genetically altered plants can produce much more of these useful proteins at far less cost, scientists say.
''We can put just about any molecule that has therapeutic value into plants,'' Dr. Hiatt said.
Yeast and bacteria need to be carefully tended, said Don Cooksey, a plant pathologist at the University of California at Riverside. Animal cells in suspension and mouse-human hybrid cells are tricky and expensive to maintain.
But plants generally take care of themselves, Dr. Cooksey said. They convert sunlight, water and soil nutrients into food. Some plants, like tobacco, potatoes and petunias, can be grown from single plant cells; seeds are not required. Genes can be transferred into plant cells with relative ease. There is even a ''gene gun'' that shoots DNA into leaves.
For some human molecules, plants offer a biochemical advantage over simpler organisms, said Robert Erwin, president of the Biosource Genetics Corporation of Vacaville, Calif. Plant cells, which are every bit as complicated as human cells, tend to assemble human proteins in their proper configurations; bacteria and yeast do not.
But the most important advantage, the scientists said, is that plants can be grown by the acre and can thus produce vast quantities of a useful protein. Some proteins, like human growth hormone, may never be needed in large amounts. But if large amounts would be useful, Dr. Hiatt said, ''plants are the way to go.''
For example, he said, other Scripps scientists are testing an antibody intended to combat lung cancer. Over the course of treatment, each patient requires about a gram of antibody. If the therapy is successful, Dr. Hiatt said, 100,000 people a year would need the antibody, making plants an economical route of production.
 
Tobacco's Advantage
Scientists have developed two strategies for inserting human genes into plants, one permanent and one temporary. Dr. Hiatt took the permanent route. His experiment, reported in November, began by manipulating an immune cell that produces a particular antibody. Previous efforts to insert a complete immune cell into tobacco plants had failed; Dr. Hiatt found that he had to extract from the cells the the two genes needed to make an antibody, a light chain gene and heavy chain gene.
The genes were inserted into a soil bacterium that passed them into tobacco leaf fragments. Next Dr. Hiatt exploited tobacco's ability to grow entire new plants from single cells. He chose tobacco cells that had taken up human genes and grew two kinds of plants: those with heavy chain genes and those with light.
Then he crossed the adult plants sexually. As the plants combined their genes, some received both a heavy and a light chain gene. Thus endowed with a complete set of genetic instructions, they began assembling complete human antibodies in abundance.
But there was an immediate problem, Dr. Hiatt said. The antibodies were released into the plant cell's fluid interior, where enzymes chewed them up as fast as they were made.
To avoid this fate, Dr. Hiatt attached protein from a mouse to the human antibody genes. This attachment protects the antibody from the hostile enzymes and guides it to a cell membrane where the assembly of the antibody is completed and is then secreted. If the plants are grown in liquid, they will secrete the protein into it; from there the protein can be extracted.
A Dutch company, Mogen, used a similar technique to produce serum albumin in potatoes. And a Belgian company, Plant Genetic Systems, introduced the brain protein enkephalin into rape plants.
The second strategy, pursued by Biosource Genetics, temporarily introduces human genes into adult plants. The company has developed a technique in which a new gene is carried into plant cells by an RNA molecule that multiplies and spreads itself and the foreign gene to neighboring cells. Within days, the entire plant is producing human protein.
The RNA degrades with time, said Mr. Erwin, the Biosource president, and the foreign gene is never passed on to subsequent generations. The plants are harvested and ground up, and the desired protein is extracted.
 
Genetic Sun Screens
The company's first commercial product is human melanin, which is produced in a variety of plant cells. Several pounds of pure melanin have been sold to a joint venture of William H. Rorer Inc. and Advanced Polymer Systems that plans to market a sun screen.
Conventional sun screens contain a chemical compound that both absorbs and scatters the ultraviolet light that causes sunburn, said Dr. Miles Chedekel, a research scientist at Biosource Genetics. Human melanin is better at scattering ultraviolet rays, he said, and offers more protection. The melanin is incorporated into microscopic sponges that are applied as a cream. Rorer and Advanced Polymer Systems are working on sun screens that will deflect all the ultraviolet light.
Mr. Erwin said his company was also using tobacco plants to produce interleukin-2, an anti-cancer agent derived from the human immune system. He recently met with Gov. James G. Martin of North Carolina to discuss conducting outdoor tests in that state's tobacco fields.
These technologies, the scientists said, can also be used to produce hard-to-synthesize drugs inside plants. For example, eincristine, a cancer drug, is now extracted at high expense from the periwinkle plant. Dr. Hiatt said the gene for eincristine could be inserted into tobacco cells, which are easy to manipulate, to produce the cancer drug more cheaply.
Finally, the technology is being used to give plants new genes that will protect them from plant diseases. It should be possible, researchers say, to give plants antibodies derived from animals that will neutralize many bacteria, viruses and funguses.
 
Permanent Gene Transfer
 
The two genes that produce a desired human antibody are isolated. One is called the light chain, the other the heavy chain. Each is inserted into rings of DNA called plasmids. The plasmids are placed in bacteria.
 
The bacteria are added to tobacco leaf fragments and transfer the plasmid to plant cells. Some cells integrate the heavy or the light chain into their own DNA.
 
Plants are cloned from the leaf fragments. Some carry either light or heavy genes.
 
The plants that carry either light or heavy genes are grown to maturity and crossed. Some of their offspring receive both genes and combine them so they can produce the functioning antibody.

HEADLINE: Chase Profit Off in Period; Loss for Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, parent of the Chase Manhattan Bank, reported yesterday that fourth-quarter profits fell 36.4 percent and that it had a loss for the year.
Chase said earnings in the last quarter of 1989 fell to $175 million, or $1.47 a share, from $275 million, or $2.93 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
The nation's second-largest bank holding company after Citicorp reported a loss of $665 million for the year in contrast to net income of $1.06 billion, or $11.55 a share, a year earlier.
 
Problems With Latin Loans
Chase attributed the weak showing in both periods to difficulties with its Latin American loans. 
Separately, the First Chicago Corporation, the largest banking company in the Midwest, said earnings were down 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 30 percent for the year, also reflecting in part moves to reduce exposure to third world debt.
Last week, J. P. Morgan & Company also reported sharply lower profits for the last quarter of 1989 and a loss for the year. Its $1.27 billion yearly loss included a $2 billion provision for losses on loans to developing nations in the third quarter.
Yesterday, Chase stock rose 37.5 cents, to $32.125, in very heavy trading, of nearly 1.7 million shares. Chase declined to speculate on the market's move,, but Cheryl Swaim, a banking analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said that ''people were expecting disappointing earnings, and that they were pretty much in line with those expectations.''
Chase said profits fell in the final quarter of 1989 because Brazil had made practically no interest payments in the period. Brazil suspended payments in February, 1987, the bank said, but then brought itself up to date in the final quarter of 1988 with a $365 million payment, thus distorting figures for the two fourth quarters.
The bank attributed the 1989 loss largely to nearly $1.3 billion in special third-quarter charges, including new loan-loss reserves of $1.15 billion to cover possible losses on loans to the developing countries, mainly Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela.
 
No Addition to Loan Reserves
Chase reported increases in fourth-quarter income from consumer banking, investment banking and from trading.
The provision for possible loan losses was $130 million in the fourth quarter compared with $300 million in the period a year earlier. In the 1988 period, Chase said it had added $200 million to reserves for possible loan losses in the developing world. No provision for developing countries was made in the fourth quarter of 1989.
For the full year, the loan-loss provision totaled $1.7 billion, including $1.3 billion for developing countries and $47 million for problem real estate in Arizona.
Chase said it also wrote off $463 million in loans in the fourth quarter, including $336 million in loans to the developing nations. Argentinian borrowers accounted for $165 million of that amount, or about half. It said it had written off $181 million in loans in the comparable period the year before.
Loans written off for the year, Chase said, amounted to $1.2 billion, including $91 million for real estate in Arizona, $706 million to developing countries and another $152 million to Argentine borrowers.
In addition to the $1.15 billion in reserves added in the third quarter, Chase said it wrote off $126 million last year for bad real estate at the Chase Bank of Arizona and $38 million to leave the securities business, mostly in London.
Interest income fell in the fourth quarter to $761 million, from $1.13 billion the year before, it said, and also for the year, dropping to $3.15 billion, from $3.4 billion.
Chase said it had collected $100 million in interest payments from loans to Brazil last year, mainly in the first half, but another $97 million in interest payments was not received, including $14 million due in the fourth quarter of 1989.
Argentina, Chase said, continued to be in arrears on its interest payments, reducing fourth-quarter interest income by $17 million and by $74 million for the year.

HEADLINE: Where Savings Crisis Hits Hard

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
This overbuilt city, only a few years ago an illustration of solid growth in the West, has now become a clear example of the difficulty the Government faces in selling the vast real estate holdings it has acquired in the savings and loan crisis.
Colorado Springs boomed during much of the last decade, helped by Pentagon spending and the arrival of big electronics companies. But after a three-year economic slowdown that left developers unable to sell or rent many homes, office buildings and shopping centers, three of the four local savings and loan institutions failed and were seized by the Government last year. Out-of-state savings institutions that had lent heavily here were also battered by foreclosures, and some fell into insolvency.
 
A Distressed Market
The result was to dump into the Government's lap a huge inventory of repossessed property. If the Government is to resolve the savings and loan situation quickly and without further inflating the bailout's costs, currently estimated at $160 billion, it will have to succeed in selling the property in Colorado Springs and in similarly distressed cities, mostly in the West and Southwest, with a minimum of delay and at market prices. 
Colorado, along with Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas, has been formally designated in the bailout legislation for savings institutions as a distressed real estate market, and Colorado Springs has the largest concentration of foreclosed properties in the state.
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency set up last summer to sell the assets of most failed savings institutions, concede their task is daunting at best. Among the biggest problems here and elsewhere are the sheer quantity of the properties to be sold, an inability to find enough tenants to make buildings attractive to buyers, the difficulty for potential buyers to find financing in places where surviving financial institutions have become more conservative, and competition from other Federal agencies also trying to dispose of troubled properties.
Complicating the situation, real estate executives here say, are ethics rules that prevent certain developers whose losses have already cost the Government money from helping to manage or sell the properties.
The quantity of property to be sold in this city alone is staggering. Resolution Trust has listed 156 single-family homes for sale in this city of 280,000 people hard by the eastern slope of the Rockies, 70 miles south of Denver.
The agency has put up for sale 162 condominiums, 10 apartment buildings with four units or less, 15 larger apartment buildings and 31 residential lots. There are 17 office buildings for sale, 8 strip malls and other retail locations, a warehouse, a movie theater and assorted other properties, not to mention thousands of acres of undeveloped land. Altogether, the agency owns at least 40 percent of the land of Colorado Springs.
 
Value Sharply Reduced
The list grows almost daily, and the trust corporation has not yet made a thorough appraisal of all the properties in its hands. Local real estate executives and economists say the property was once worth as much as $1 billion, although its market value today is probably no more than half that, meaning the bailout could cost taxpayers up to $500 million just in this one city.
The quantity of property is just one of the Government's problems. From a standing start, the trust agency will have to learn the intricacies of the real estate businesses, become intimately acquainted with market conditions in this community and others. It will also have to set up a system for hiring and policing the private brokers and property managers who will handle much of the day-to-day sales work and upkeep.
The agency will have to balance pressure to act quickly with pressure not to dump property on the market at fire-sale prices. It will have to cope with a host of practical problems, like a nationwide shortage of appraisers, needed to assess the fair market value of the holdings and help set prices. And it will have to accomplish all this without creating a cumbersome bureaucracy that will drive prospective buyers away.
 
'One Day at a Time'
''We're going to have to go from being a Rube Goldberg-type operation to being a well-oiled machine,'' said Anthony Scalzi, the regional director for Resolution Trust in Denver. ''The only way to approach this job is like a recovering alcoholic -one day at a time.''
The decline in real estate prices here seems to be leveling off. Brokers say prices are sufficiently low to attract a fair number of buyers, especially for completed homes in nice neighborhoods, and the Government has made modest progress in selling the most attractive of its residential properties.
Brent P. Spaulding, a broker with Premier Inc. working on behalf of the Government, has sold 32 of 56 town houses in the Brandy Glass development since last fall. But the prices he can get, around $60,000 for two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot units, are $30,000 less than the developer was asking three years ago, and Mr. Spaulding said the Government was losing up to $20,000 on each unit he sold.
''I 100 percent believe we've already seen property values in this market hit bottom,'' Mr. Spaulding said. ''But with the savings and loan crisis, it just means we're going to stay at those prices for longer.''
 
Still a Tough Sell
Even at the depressed prices, both residential and commercial real estate remains a tough sell here. Brokers like Mr. Spaulding are competing not only with other properties controlled by Resolution Trust but also with homes repossessed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Veterans Administration and other Federal agencies. Those agencies have foreclosed on thousands of properties in the area on which they held mortgages or mortgage guarantees.
Moreover, Mr. Spaulding said, investors interested in purchasing properties have been unable to get financing because the pool of available credit has shrunk since the failure of the city's three major savings and loan institutions. They are now being operated by the Government.
In addition, many properties, both residential and commercial, will prove difficult or impossible to sell at anything approaching market price, brokers said. Some properties are not fully built, or have deteriorated.
 
Beautiful View, No Tenants
One of the biggest problems facing the trust agency is leasing out enough space in office and apartment buildings to permit a buyer to generate sufficient cash flow to make a purchase attractive. The agency recently took over Union Pointe, a new 40,000-square-foot office building in Colorado Springs with a stunning view of the Rockies, but not a single tenant.
''If it's vacant, we can't sell it,'' Mr. Scalzi of Resolution Trust said.
Brokers said much of the undeveloped land would also be nearly impossible to sell. The biggest chunk in the Government's possession is the 25,000-acre Banning-Lewis Ranch, which runs along the eastern edge of the city. The land, purchased several years ago by a speculator named Frank Aries with $230 million borrowed from the Western Savings and Loan Association of Phoenix, was repossessed by Western last year, just after the institution was seized by Federal regulators.
Mr. Scalzi said the Government, under terms of the bailout bill, must use the private sector as much as possible in managing and selling its properties. But real estate executives, most of whom are eager to get that business, say the agency will be restricted in whom it can employ because of ethics guidelines that ban contract awards to any company that has been involved in a major foreclosure or has caused a significant loss to the Government. In Colorado Springs, that encompasses virtually every major developer. The Government says it is simply trying to avoid doing business with the same people who caused the problems.
 
A 'Neighborhood Business'
''The R.T.C. needs local companies because real estate is a local, neighborhood business,'' said Stephen M. Schuck, who as one of the area's largest developers has had his share of failed projects in recent years. ''There's no reason we should be disqualified, but it appears that we will be.''
Some developers also worry that the trust agency, under pressure to sell properties quickly and facing a lack of knowledgeable appraisers, will cut prices further, driving down the entire market. They say that even if the agency can find enough appraisers, it will be difficult to judge the true value of a property in a hypersensitive market where sales are relatively infrequent.
By law, the Government cannot sell any of the property in Colorado for less than 95 percent of its fair market value because the state is formally designated in the bailout bill as having a distressed real estate market. But even Government officials acknowledge that fair market value is a moving target and can be determined only by a good appraiser and knowledgeable local brokers.
Just a few years ago it would have been inconceivable to almost anyone in Colorado Springs that the city would become a symbol of a huge real estate debacle. After growing steadily for several decades, the local economy in the early 1980's seemed on the verge of a boom. The city was successful in persuading major electronics companies like the Hewlett-Packard Company and Texas Instruments Inc. to put big operations here.
Home to the Air Force Academy and Fort Carson, a large Army base, the city had long relied heavily on military spending. Colorado Springs became the home of a major testing center for the ''Star Wars'' anti-missile program and was designated as the site of a new military space command. Suddenly, the city was one of the fastest-growing in the nation and one of the most attractive markets for developers.
Housing developments, office buildings, retail space and other projects were built with abandon, anticipating consistently strong growth.
 
Lenders Had Sharp Growth
The three biggest local savings institutions, freed to plunge into real estate by deregulation in the early 1980's, financed most of the building, often lending 100 percent of the cost of a project in return for a share of the profits. The institutions all grew rapidly; the largest, the American Federal Savings and Loan of Colorado Springs, more than doubled in asset size between 1983 and 1988, to $830 million, and eventually had 60 percent of its loan portfolio in construction loans.
But then the city was struck by layoffs in the electronics business, cuts in military spending plans and the fallout from the depressed oil prices that struck at Denver and cities in the Southwest. Suddenly there was no demand for new office space, buyers for houses became scarce, defaults started mounting and the financial health of the savings institutions deteriorated rapidly.
Federal regulators seized American Federal and the two other institutions, Otero Savings and the First Federal Savings and Loan of Colorado Springs, last winter. The Government formally put American Federal and Otero Savings up for sale this month.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Health Insurers' Changing Role

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
HEALTH-INSURANCE executives say their business has changed radically in the last two years in the nation's struggle with double-digit growth in medical spending. Many insurers say their traditional work of assuming risks has been eclipsed by services to help their customers' health dollars go further.
''We are not an insurance company, we are a managed-care company,'' said John P. Cole, executive vice president of the Lincoln National Corporation, a medium-sized insurer based in Fort Wayne, Ind. Its business now, he said, is negotiating on behalf of employer groups to get discounts from doctors and hospitals and to eliminate unnecessary medical procedures. 
Demand from employers for ''managed care'' services has surged. They range from insurer-operated health maintenance organizations and discount networks of doctors and hospitals to requiring advance approval by an insurer for a hospital admission. And in some particularly expensive cases, like organ transplants or cancer, the insurer may assign a nurse or social worker to review the cost-effectiveness of care.
People in the industry say the number of Americans still covered by traditional fee-for-service insurance - which pays medical charges, no questions asked - declined again sharply in 1989.
For example, only 22 percent of the 11 million people covered for health benefits through the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, based in Hartford, are still eligible for traditional care, compared with 64 percent in 1988, said Charles T. Bell, senior vice president for employee benefits with Aetna. ''Our basic strategy is to suggest to our customers that we convert to these managed-care plans,'' Mr. Bell said.
The insurance companies say their charges for traditional fee-for-service policies caught up with inflation in health costs in 1989, after losses in the previous two years or so. But some insurers are still losing money in managed care. The start-up expenses of organizing networks of doctors and hospitals, checking on credentials and monitoring performance are higher than in traditional fee-for-service health insurance, said Anthony J. Gajda, a principal in New York with Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting firm.
Aetna, for example, said it lost money on its managed-care business in 1989. But Francis L. Onofrio, an Aetna spokesman, said the managed-care line is expected to break even this year and be profitable in 1991.
Ronald E. Hunt, a vice president with the Nationwide Life Insurance Company, said the company, based in Columbus, Ohio, now requires ''pre-certification before hospital confinement on virtually 100 percent of our business.'' Nationwide, which had $350 million in group life and health premiums in 1989, is setting up discount networks in Midwestern and Southern cities.
Indeed, 93 percent of the 1,915 employers recently surveyed by A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consulting firm, said they offer employees the chance to join an H.M.O. or another type of discount network. The employees typically pay out less than for traditional coverage, to induce them to join. Meanwhile, the doctors in the networks have financial incentives to avoid unnecessary medical procedures. John Erb, a managing consultant with Foster Higgins in New York, said a growing number of businesses with fewer than 500 employees had begun to offer managed-care systems, which larger companies have long used.
The number of employees choosing managed-care deals is growing rapidly. The latest survey of 1,665 employers by the Health Industry Association of America, an insurer trade group, found that only 28 percent of employees still had traditional coverage in 1988, compared with 41 percent in 1987.
''The commercial insurers are convinced that managed care is the future of their business,'' said John J. Gable, a research manager with the association of 200 health insurers, which cover 90 million people.
The same trend was reported by the nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations, which have 74 million subscribers. Gary Meade, a managed-care executive with national Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Chicago, said the movement toward H.M.O.'s and discount networks was accelerating. Managed-care systems now cover half the Blue Cross enrollees, compared with only 25 percent two years ago.
About $150 billion of the $600 billion that Americans spend on health care is handled by insurance companies, according to Government statistics. Only about half the companies' business is now ''real,'' or traditional, insurance, said Louise M. Firth, a vice president in Cambridge, Mass., with Arthur D. Little Inc., the management consultants. ''The other half is benefits under administration, including claims processing for self-insured employers,'' she said.
Many large insurance brokers, meanwhile, have developed benefit-consulting services to replace dwindling revenue from commissions as traditional insurance sales have declined.

HEADLINE: Mexico and Banks Said To Close Financing Gap

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Mexico and its bankers have agreed on how to cover the $300 million shortfall in their landmark deal under which most of the banks involved will reduce the value of the country's existing debt by 35 percent, according to bank and Mexican officials.
At the same time, the Bank Advisory Committee, led by Citibank of New York, is hoping to get Canadian banks to sign off this week on a $1.2 billion bridge loan that is the other last detail of the deal to be worked out. One reluctant British bank, Lloyds Bank, agreed to the bridge loan providing interim financing last week. The brige loan, by providing financing to the Mexicans earlier in the year, allows some of the guarantees involved in the proposal to be offered earlier. 
Both actions reflect the difficulty of tying up all the loose ends in this deal, which will be the first completed under the Bush Administration's debt strategy known as the Brady plan, named for Treasury Secretatry Nicholas F. Brady. If the deal is finally completed early next month in Mexico, as now planned, the conclusion will come 11 months after Mr. Brady first disclosed the new debt strategy and 10 months after Mexico and its bankers began negotiations.
 
Initial Outline in July
The initial outline of the deal was announced in July and involved the reduction of debt. The Mexicans are inviting the advisory committee members and the chairmen of the banks involved to Mexico for the signing ceremony, officials said.
The $300 million gap in the financing is a shortfall in the money necessary to provide the guarantees or what bankers call enhancements for the debt plan covering $48 billion of medium- and long-term Mexican debt.
The details of the method of covering the $300 million financing gap have become an issue because of a dispute in the United States Treasury and suggestions from Treasury officials and others that American taxpayers might be tapped to cover the gap. Officials from Mexico and the banks involved in the negotiations and the Treasury said, however, that this was not the case.
Under the overall debt plan, the bankers could chose debt reduction, either by lowering the principal on existing loans or accepting lower interest payments at a fixed 6.25 percent. Both reductions equal about a 35 percent reduction in the value of the existing loans. A third option allowed banks to choose to make new loans equal to 25 percent of their current exposure.
 
Mexican Guarantees
The Mexicans are to provide guarantees for both the principal and interest to be paid. They will buy zero-coupon Treasury bonds to guarantee the principal of the new bonds that are swapped for the old loans and will set up a revolving fund to cover the interest payments for up to 18 months. If all the interest payments are made by Mexico, the fund is rolled over for another 18 months.
The Mexican Government has $7 billion for these guarantees, which turned out to be $300 million short because more banks than expected chose to do principal reduction and fewer banks than expected chose to make new loans. The $7 billion includes money from Mexico, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Japanese Government.
Under the proposal the banks and Mexico have worked out to cover this gap, the Mexican Government will come up with as much as $100 million from its reserves. In addition, the money put in the fund to cover the interest payments will be cut by up to $200 million. The interest earned while the money is in the fund will make up the $200 million gap.
The question of a subsidy from the taxpayers arose when the Treasury separately decided what interest rate and price to offer on the zero-coupon bonds used to back the principal payments on the bonds that are traded for the old loans. Some Treasury officials suggested that a below-market price for these represented a subsidy from taxpayers to cover the $300 million financing gap. A zero-coupon bond is sold at a large discount to its face value because it pays no interest until its maturity. The higher the yield, the less that has to be paid for the face value of the bond. 7.925% Interest Rate The interest rate is 8.05 percent and there is a Treasury fee of 0.125 percent, which lowers the rate to 7.925 percent. This is about one-quarter of a percentage point above what the yield is on 30-year zero-coupon bonds in the market. Some in Treasury had argued that the Mexicans should get this lower rate, which would mean they would have to pay more for their zero-coupon bonds, thereby aggravating the lingering financing problems with the debt package.
Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates in New York, said there is an ''institutional distortion'' in the zero-coupon bond market at 30 years that created the lower yield. In addition, he said, this market is very small, amounting to a total face value of $45 million and a value today of around $5 million.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Broadly Lower; Dow Off 19.84

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks fell broadly yesterday in slow trading as many investors observed the Martin Luther King Day holiday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.84 points, to 2,669.37, as declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances, 1,091 to 395. On Friday, the Dow tumbled 71.46 points, its biggest drop since the indicator plummeted 190.58 points on Oct. 13.
Turnover on the Big Board shrank to 140.6 million shares, from 183.9 million on Friday because of the Federal and bank holiday. Government securities markets were closed and corporate bond trading was light. 
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.93 points, to 337, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.61 points, to 186.71.
Traders said that some of the market's decline might have been attributed to the fact that Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities, suggested his firm's clients increase the cash portion of their portfolios to 30 percent, from 15 percent, and that stocks be decreased to 35 percent, from 50 percent.
''There is concern that interest rates are not coming down and that the differential in interest rates between the United States and the rest of the world is narrowing, making it more difficult to attract more capital from overseas,'' Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview. ''There is also worry about inflation, and the earnings outlook is poor. In short, it looks like rough going for the first half of this year.''
 
J.P. Morgan Down
Among individual issues, J.P. Morgan dropped 2 1/8, to 38 1/8. Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said he had lowered his earnings estimate to $4.10 a share, from $4.35 a share, and his rating on the bank to below average near-term, from neutral.
Rorer soared 13 3/4, to 63, and was the biggest point gainer. Its 27.9 percentage change was the largest on the Big Board as more than 2.6 million shares were traded. Rorer said it was negotiating a deal in which an unidentified drug company would acquire about 68 percent of its outstanding common shares. Rorer has valued the transaction at $73 a share, or $2.3 billion.
Desoto fell 1 7/8, to 41. The company, which has offered its United States consumer paint business for sale, said other domestic paint manufacturers were the most likely buyers.
Symbol Technologies showed the largest percentage decline, falling 5, to 10 1/2. The company told an analysts meeting that it expected 1989 earnings to come in at about 5 cents a share. Most analysts had expected earnings in the mid-20-cent range.
Sea Containers plummeted 7 1/4, or 11.1 percent, to 59 1/2, and was one of the biggest net losers on the Big Board. Temple Holdings Ltd., jointly owned by Stena A.B. of Sweden and Tiphook P.L.C. of Britain, said Stena had offered to buy Sea Containers' Sealink British Ferries unit for $430 million and 838,098 Sea Containers shares. Analysts said that investors, speculating that Sea Containers would might agree to the Temple offer and give up its plan to buy back shares, took profits while they could.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
'Junk Bond' Prices Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The long-awaited bankruptcy filing by two of the Campeau Corporation's primary subsidiaries had little effect on prices in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market yesterday.
Market participants said that bids on most outstanding debt issues of the Allied Stores Corporation and Federated Department Stores Inc., the Campeau units that sought bankruptcy protection in Cincinnati, fell early in the day, then recovered and by late in the session were little changed.
Trading was limited in the high-yield markets and in other fixed-income markets because of holidays in the United States and Japan. What little trading there was, however, suggested that investors were concerned about higher interest rates. 
 
'Hard to Find Trading'
The Treasury securities markets here were closed for the holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., although futures contracts on Treasury securities were traded on the commodities exchanges.
''It is very hard to find trading in anything right now,'' said Kingman Penniman, an analyst who follows the high-yield market for McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei.
''The market took the Campeau news the way it should have, since it has already been built into prices,'' he said. ''The impact of this filing took place in September and October.''
In Europe, the only cash market for Treasury securities that was open yesterday, investors furthered the slide in Goverment notes and bonds by selling securities.
At the close of trading in Europe, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds were offered at a price of 99 7/32, down by 9/32, to yield 8.19 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 99 18/32, down by 5/32, to yield 8.08 percent.
 
Selling in Chicago
Selling pressure was also evident in trading in the futures market in Chicago, despite a further slide in stock prices.
''The bond market should have benefited from a flight to quality out of the stock market, but that was not the case at all,'' said Richard L. Sandor, an executive vice president in charge of the fixed-income department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
At the close of trading yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade, the March Treasury bond contract closed at a price of 96 19/32, down by 13/32 on the day. The March contract for 10-year notes fell by 15/32, to 98 15/ 32.
''The 10-year future was hit harder than the long bond,'' Mr. Sandor noted. ''That is a recognition that interest rates in Japan and around the world are headed higher.''
Ten-year Treasury note issues may be more vulnerable to shifts in foreign interest rates because most governments outside the United States do not issue securities with maturities longer than 10 years.

HEADLINE: CUOMO PROPOSES AUSTERITY BUDGET WITH MORE TAXES

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Saying that ''there is a huge gap between what we want to spend and what we can afford to spend,'' Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presented an austere budget today that would increase state spending by the lowest rate in more than a decade and would force cuts in dozens of state programs.
The Governor recommended that the last phase of New York's tax cut plan be suspended, a move that would provide the state with $400 million in the coming fiscal year. He also proposed that the state raise more than $800 million in increased fees and taxes, bringing his total tax proposal to more than $1 billion.
Among the tax increases he recommended are a new 6 percent tax on out-of-state telephone calls and an increase of 5 cents a pack in the state's cigarette tax, now at 33 cents a pack.
 
Praise and Criticism
As soon as the Governor's $31 billion budget plan was released, state lawmakers mobilized along partisan lines. 
The Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, offered reserved praise for the Cuomo proposal, saying that ''parameters of the budget are something I can support.''
In contrast, the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., attacked the proposal.
''The Governor has proposed a budget that increases the rate at which state spending is growing and looks to raise revenues to the tune of $1.5 billion,'' he said. ''I do not agree with the Governor's proposed deferral of the next phase of the income tax cut, nor am I receptive to the additional new taxes and fees he has proposed.''
In his budget proposal, the Governor barely managed to live up to a pledge he made last week to keep the spending increase below the inflation rate. The Governor projected that the inflation rate for the state, a figure that is rarely used and difficult to calculate, would be 4.5 percent for the fiscal year that starts April 1. His budget would raise spending by 4.49 percent, down from the 5 percent increase estimated for the current budget year.
But Mr. Cuomo's estimated 4.49 percent increase applies only to the state's general fund, which is made up of most state tax revenues. For the state's total budget, which includes billions of dollars in Federal aid as well as capital funds and specially earmarked taxes, the rate of increase would be 9.3 percent. Under Mr. Cuomo's proposal total state spending would rise to $51 billion.
The Governor's budget contains a significant spending increase for drug treatment and enforcement, $188 billion, and includes start-up funds for two drug treatment ''campuses'' to house 1,000 addicts each. It also contains $13 million to begin a new health-insurance program for children.
But outside of the drug and children's insurance programs, both of which were featured prominently in the Governor's State of the State address two weeks ago, few state programs would receive significant increases, and many would suffer cuts.
Aid to private colleges in the state, for example, would be cut by almost $11 million. The state's I H New York tourist promotion program would be cut by $2 million, and aid to local governments to run sewage treatment plants would decline by $24 million.
 
Programs for the Poor
Programs for the poor would be cut, too, under the Governor's proposal. Mr. Cuomo recommended limiting some welfare recipients deemed employable to six months of benefits, for a saving of $9 million. And he asked the Legislature to impose limits on the number of visits that Medicaid recipients can make to a doctor - to save the state $24 million. The Governor tried to impose such limits administratively last year, but they have been tied up in the courts.
In his budget presentation this morning, Mr. Cuomo dealt only with the broad outlines of his budget, glossing over the specific taxes or spending cuts he was proposing.
Even in his broad sketch, Mr. Cuomo painted a grim picture of the state's situation, saying New York was entering a period of declining tax revenues while social problems, like AIDS and drug use, were growing. And he warned that state tax collections, which have been lagging, could be even lower than predicted in the budget, necessitating further cuts.
''If we meet this challenge, as I fully expect we will, we will be stronger than we ever were,'' he said. ''But if we fail to meet the challenge, then, frankly, challenge can become crisis.''
 
Bracing for Tough Fight
Mr. Cuomo appeared to be bracing for a long and bruising fight with the Legislature, which traditionally adds several hundred million dollars to the Governor's budget to increase education aid and finance local projects.
In the budget season, it is common for legislators to accuse the Governor of stinginess and profligacy. But this year Mr. Cuomo pledged to expose what he said was lawmakers' hypocrisy. ''Every year I get $5 billion in requests from legislators,'' Mr. Cuomo said. This year, he said, he will make public whatever requests he gets.
''I'm not going to play that game,'' he said.
One of the few areas to receive a substantial increase in the Governor's budget is prisons. Predicting that the number of inmates in the state would grow by more than 8,000 over the next year, Mr. Cuomo proposed constructing 5,300 new beds in annexes attached to existing prisons. The cost of the prison expansion would be $282 million.
For New York City, which is suffering from tremendous budget problems of its own, Mr. Cuomo's proposed budget offered little comfort. Some of the Governor's recommendations, like the limits on Medicaid, would provide savings for the city, which picks up part of the cost of the program. But other proposals, like reductions in aid to local cultural organizations, are likely to cost the city money.
 
'Difficult Times'
In a carefully worded statement, Mayor David N. Dinkins avoided complaints but said the Governor's budget clearly reflected ''difficult times.''
In his education aid proposal, the Governor offered a $240 million increase, to roughly $8.7 billion. While educators in New York City and throughout the state called the proposal, which is traditionally raised by the Legislature, too low, Mr. Dinkins said he was pleased Mr. Cuomo was trying to direct more education aid to the city. Under the Governor's proposal, almost half the increase in aid would go to the city's schools.
Mr. Cuomo today proposed only a vague plan to deal with the state's financial difficulties for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31. The state's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, has estimated that the state will end the year with a $700 million budget gap. To make up half that gap, Mr. Cuomo recommended using reserve funds and other existing resources. The rest he proposed to borrow by issuing short-term notes that the state would have to pay back within the year.
The Cuomo administration had projected a budget gap for the coming fiscal year of about $2 billion, and today the Governor put the figure even higher. He said he had closed the gap with almost $1 billion in new or increased taxes, $1 billion in nonrecurring or ''one shot'' revenues and several hundred million dollars in spending cuts.
 
Taxes on Businesses
Several of the new taxes Mr. Cuomo recommended would fall on businesses. One of those is a 2 percent tax on ''S corporations'' that have tried to save money by paying personal income taxes rather than corporate taxes. This tax would raise an estimated $175 million this year.
The tax on out-of-state telephone calls would also be borne heavily by corporations, and today business leaders began what promises to be a long campaign against the tax.
''We are deeply disturbed about an excise tax on telecommunications,'' said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ''Such a tax would seriously undermine New York City's position as a headquarters city and financial service center.''
As expected, the Governor's budget relies heavily on nonrecurring revenues. Those include revenues from state authority reserves that would be transferred to the state treasury and money that would be saved by refinancing some of the state's debt. Mr. Cuomo also proposed changing the way the state's contribution to its workers' pension fund is calculated to save $122 million this year.
Mr. Cuomo said using the one-shot revenues could be justified only if the Legislature goes along with his effort to suspend the last phase of the tax cut. Suspending the tax cut would, the Governor argued, provide enough recurring revenues later to make up for the ''one shots.''
Under the tax cut scheduled to go into effect in October, the state's highest income tax rate would drop to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, for an effective rate for the year of 7.375 percent. Mr. Cuomo proposed today that the income tax rate be frozen at the effective rate for 1989, which was 7.875 percent.

HEADLINE: Talks on Bank to Aid the East Bloc End in Dispute

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 16

 BODY:
An East-West meeting on establishing a development bank to help Eastern Europe's troubled economies ended today with some dispute over whether the bank's lending should be limited to only the private sector.
Officials said most of the 27 Western nations and 7 Eastern European nations represented at the two-day meeting agreed that the bank should have about $12 billion in capital and should channel most of its funds to Eastern Europe's private sector to assist that region in moving from Communism to market economies.
Nevertheless, Jacques Attali, the French official who chaired the meeting, said that many issues still remained to be resolved, even though he expressed the hope that the bank would be operating by the end of the year. Some officials said that goal was optimistic. 
Once established, the bank could administer the largest program of aid to Eastern Europe - surpassing the $5 billion committed to the region so far according to estimates -and become one of the largest regional assistance programs since the Marshall Plan. Private-Sector Loans Only? One of the most divisive issues to emerge at the meeting was whether the bank's loans should go only to the private sector or whether they should also be allowed to go to state-owned companies or to government infrastructure projects.
Participants in the meetings said the United States and Britian argued strenuously in favor of limiting the loans to the private sector. Some participants said they feared that if the money were made available to governments to improve roads and other infrastructure, almost all of the bank's money could end up being used that way.
But several Eastern European officials objected to limiting the loans to the private sector. ''It is not easy to go very quickly from an economy of state-owned enterprises to develop a private sector,'' said Joseph Tosovsky, chairman of Czechoslovakia's Central Bank. ''If the bank offers money only to private-sector companies, then we might be left out of it.''
''Other countries would like to promote entrepreneurship as well,'' he said. ''But they realize there are difficulties in promoting it.''
 
Moscow's Eligibility Debated
Mr. Attali, expressing the French position, suggested that money might go to state-owned companies in sectors where there was competition.
Finance ministry and foreign ministry officials at the meeting said the bank, expected to called the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe, would channel money to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Rumania and Bulgaria. But there was considerable debate about whether the Soviet Union should be able to receive money from the bank.
Some participants said the United States had expressed reservations in informal meetings about Soviet membership and whether the Soviet Union should be able to receive loans from the bank. The European Community has offered a plan under which France, West Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union would each have an 8.5 percent stake in the bank, with the remaining shares distributed among other countries.
''There is a broad consensus that the Soviet Union should be allowed to join'' to help shape the bank's policies, said a Western European finance ministry official. But the official said there was far less consensus on whether the Soviet Union should be allowed to receive loans. Many participants have suggested allowing loans only to countries that have free elections and a multiparty system. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has opposed ending the Communist Party's dominant role in Soviet society.
 
Criteria for Borrowing
Mr. Attali, a senior aide to President Francois Mitterrand, said the participants hoped to sign the articles setting up the bank in Paris in March. He said that among the issues to be worked out were the total capitalization of the bank, what shares each of the 34 member countries would hold and where the bank would be based.
''There are no major difficulties in all this,'' Mr. Attali said. ''Everything has to be done to help these countries make the transition to a competitive economy and to develop their private sector.''
Mr. Attali said the representatives from the 34 nations had set up three working groups to resolve many of the issues under debate. Those groups are to meet in Paris on Jan. 30, and then hold a large drafting meeting in Paris March 10 and 11. Mr. Attali said he hoped the founding articles could be signed later in March.
He said the working groups would discuss the criteria for borrowing, such as whether undertaking economic revisions would be a condition. The groups are also to seek to resolve whether money would be loaned at market rates or below-market rates and where the bank should be situated.
Mr. Attali said that several nations had suggested capitalizing the bank at $18 billion, while others called for $6 billion. He said the majority supported capitalization of $12 billion, with the 34 nations paying in $3.6 billion for a reserve fund.
David E. Mulford, the United States Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, declined to discuss the meeting after it ended.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
State Dept. Endorses Dole's Call For More Flexibility in Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The State Department today endorsed a call by Senator Bob Dole to give the Administration greater flexibility in allocating foreign aid. But it stopped short of saying, as the Senate Republican leader did, that some money now designated for Israel, Egypt and other large aid recipients should be redirected to Eastern Europe and Panama.
''This is aimed at the system, not at any country,'' said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. ''We want to be able to conduct foreign policy with flexibility in order to be able to respond to new developments in the world.'' 
In an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times today, Mr. Dole wrote bluntly about the need to re-examine the strained foreign aid budget, in which Congress has earmarked more than two-thirds of $15 billion for five countries - Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan and the Philippines. Mr. Dole said this leaves little money for Eastern Europe and Panama or for Latin American countries fighting the war against drugs.
 
Discussed It With Baker
Miss Tutwiler said Mr. Dole had discussed his views with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and that department officials would be meeting soon to discuss the matter with the Congressional leadership.
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the spokesman, said the Administration had long been concerned about limits imposed on Presidential flexibility through Congressional earmarking of money for specific programs. But Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration had not encouraged Mr. Dole to make his proposal and had ''some problems'' with Mr. Dole's suggestions.
Mr. Fitzwater sought in particular to avoid any suggestion that the Administration was considering cuts in aid to Israel or Egypt. ''I wouldn't want to comment on any specific country and their need,'' he said.
Assistance to Israel and Egypt makes up more than a third of the foreign aid budget and is a pillar of United States policy on the Middle East. The amounts - Israel gets $3 billion in military and economic aid and Egypt $2.1 billion - have been linked and virtually unchanged over the last five years.
 
Political Alarm Bells
Although Mr. Dole did not single out Israel and Egypt for cuts greater than the cuts for the three other countries, his comments touched off political alarm bells on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers in both parties regard Israel's foreign aid allotment as virtually sacrosanct. In comments to reporters today, Mr. Dole said his suggestion envisioned cuts in all Congressionally earmarked country programs, not just those of the ''big five'' countries.
Mr. Dole said that he met with President Bush at the White House today on another matter and that the President had told him he had read the Op-Ed article and ''appreciated it.''
Caught between limited resources and philanthropic instincts, Congress is preparing a re-examination of foreign aid programs, but most lawmakers are unwilling to deal with a choice as stark as the one Mr. Dole has presented.
''I think Mr. Dole deserves credit for putting his finger on the lack of resources, but his approach is only one way to get to the problem,'' said Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
 
Other Approaches Suggested
Mr. Hamilton said other approaches would include shifts from the Pentagon budget or reductions in foreign military assistance for countries that have not yet spent their allocations. Another possibility, he said, was redesigning the current approach to debt relief.
Mr. Hamilton noted that Israel receives about $1.2 billion a year in economic aid, most of which is immediately used to repay the United States for past loans. ''I don't put that forward as a position to advocate, but to suggest that there are other ways,'' he said, adding that he expects Congress to support additonal money for both Eastern Europe and Panama this year.
While Mr. Hamilton said he would continue to support current levels of aid for Israel and other countries that receive large assistance, he and other lawmakers agreed that the major aid recipients would come under close scrutiny by Congress this year to justify their funding levels. Representative Vin Weber, a conservative Republican from Minnesota and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said that if anything, the Israeli Government might be able to make a case for additional aid to cope with the huge influx of new Soviet and Eastern European immigrants.
Representative David Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said a reshuffling of foreign aid as Mr. Dole has suggested would at best provide a one-year solution to the problem.
 
Figures Not Discussed
''It's a major undertaking that is going to need the sustained support of the American people,'' Mr. Obey said, ''and anybody who thinks you are going to get that support by telling the American people you are going to take it out of domestic spending is an absolute political idiot.''
At this point few lawmakers are willing to attach figures to the amount of aid required for Eastern Europe or Panama, let alone predict how much Congress can ultimately approve.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the chief lobby for Israel on Capitol Hill, said in a statement today that while it shared Mr. Dole's concern about providing assistance to emerging democracies this should be done by increasing foreign aid over all.
''We believe it should not be at the expense of other vital U.S. policy objectives,'' the lobbying group said. ''We should not hurt our existing, vulnerable democratic allies in the process of helping potential democracies. Instead we should look toward strengthing the tools of diplomacy by increasing the foreign assistance account.''
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee have scheduled a series of hearings shortly after Congress returns on Jan. 23 to examine the changing military and foreign aid needs in view of the reduced Soviet threat in Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Noriega's Party Wants a Role Again

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's Government may be history, but his civilian political party - at least part of it, anyway - is still around. In fact, four members of the party faithful emerged from seclusion today and announced that they had decided to become the loyal opposition.
The officials of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, who included Mario Rognoni, a former Noriega Commerce Minister, also used the occasion to put a great deal of discreet distance between themselves and General Noriega, who is in a Miami jail awaiting trial on drug-trafficking charges.
''Whatever the accusations against the general, that is a problem that has to be solved in the courts in the United States,'' said Mr. Rognoni, who was briefly detained by American troops in the first week of the invasion that toppled the Noriega Government last month. ''Yet that is his problem and that is a different situation.'' 
But, Mr. Rognoni added, ''we feel comfortable that he will come out innocent because most of the accusations against him are political.''
 
U.S. Troops Accused
''The challenge that we have now is to start our role in the new democracy without any armed forces ruling or advising us on political decisions,'' Mr. Rognoni said, standing in desolate, sweltering party offices that he and his colleagues said had been ransacked by American troops.
Mr. Rognoni, who appeared with the party's secretary general, Darisnel Espina, the second secretary, Pedro Pereira, and Ruben Dario Murgas, former head of the Government-run radio, also praised Panama's ''new democracy,'' declared himself and his colleagues to be utterly opposed to all forms of political persecution, conceded that the ruling party had made numerous mistakes that had alienated ''the masses,'' and dismissed the new Endara Government as a corrupt appendage of the Pentagon whose highest officials might yet find themselves formally charged with corruption.
''We have been looking at write-ups in the American press linking some officers of this Government to wrongdoing in different cases, including the laundering of money,'' Mr. Rognoni said. He was alluding to unconfirmed reports last week that a former law partner of President Guillermo Endara handled drug profits for clients and that a brother of Second Vice President Guillermo Ford was associated with a Miami accountant who laundered millions of dollars for the Medellin drug cartel.
 
'Not the Party of Crooks'
''We believe that when the Government of Panama goes in a true fashion after everybody who has done something wrong, they will have to jail more of their own people and more people from the independent ranks than people from the P.R.D.,'' Mr. Rognoni said, using the Spanish initials of the party, which was founded by General Noriega's predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera.
''That's because,'' he said, ''the P.R.D. in the majority of the cases were honest, come from middle and lower classes - and we were not involved in the wrongdong.
''In the end, the Panamanian people and the world will know the truth -that the P.R.D. is not the party of crooks or a party of violent people or anti-American people.''
The four officals asserted that the Endara Government bore main responsibility for the American invasion, which Mr. Espino said had resulted in unparalleled death and destruction as well as the looting of the party's offices.
 
U.S. Held Responsible
''The gringos came here and stole our computers, our files, everything, and removed all of it illegally from Panama,'' Mr. Espino said.
Mr. Rognoni added, ''We hold the U.S. responsible not only for the damage done by the invasion, but the damage done through the last two years with economic sanctions, with harassment, with pressure in the international finance centers.''
''We will accept the authority of the new Government the minute the United States armed forces leave Panama,'' Mr. Rognoni said. ''Right now, we believe that the Government is being run by the Southern Command and by the Pentagon.''

HEADLINE: Colonel Held in Salvador Ordered Killings of Jesuits, Cristiani Says

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 16

 BODY:
President Alfredo Cristiani said today that a colonel arrested in the killing of six Jesuit priests had ordered the slayings and that two lieutenants had named him in their confessions.
The President said that United States-trained investigators had not found any evidence that more senior officers were involved in the killing or an attempted cover-up. He said he did not expect any more arrests in the case.
''I think most of it is covered,'' he said in an interview at the Presidential House, where he has been living since guerrillas attacked his private home at the start of an offensive in November. 
Asked if there was any evidence of a conspiracy that included others besides the colonel and seven other officers and soldiers arrested in the case, Mr. Cristiani said, ''Up until now there is no reason to believe anything had gone beyond what it is.''
 
An Appeal to the Rebels
In the 40-minute interview, President Cristiani noted the desperate economic crisis facing the country and repeated an appeal to the guerrillas to resume negotiations, which they broke off before launching the November offensive.
For the first time the President stated that the leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Fronts held the key to his ambitious economic restructuring program. A major goal of the guerrillas' November offensive was to force the rightist Government to concede that its success and El Salvador's future were tied to in large measure to them.
Asked whether the economy was clearly in deep trouble, he said, ''That's an understatement.''
''Obviously the F.M.L.N. violence is a factor in the economic recovery of the country,'' he said.
The interview, one of several he gave to American newspapers and television networks, seemed intended to improve El Salvador's image in anticipation of a debate in the United States Congress on aid to the country.
 
Ninth Suspect Sought
The President appeared more relaxed and confident than at any other time since the slaying of the Jesuits along with their housekeeper and her daughter on Nov. 16.
The interviews all expanded on Mr. Cristiani's announcement on Saturday of the arrest of the colonel, Guillermo Alfredo Benavides, three more junior officers and four soldiers for the Jesuit killings. The eight were turned over to judicial authorities today in preparation for their likely indictment before a civilian court. President Cristiani said a ninth suspect, a soldier, deserted last month and is being sought.
Colonel Benavides, the commander of El Salvador's military school, is the highest-ranking officer arrested for human rights abuses in the country's decade-long civil war, in which many abuses have been attributed to the armed forces and death squads linked to the military and the governing party.
Until today, President Cristiani had not described the role the colonel is accused of in the slaying of the Jesuits, who were prominent advocates of a negotiated solution to the civil war.
 
Motive Called Unclear
Referring to Colonel Benavides, President Cristiani said ''two lieutentants testified that they did receive the order from him,'' adding that a third lieutenant said he had been ordered by the colonel to accompany them.
President Cristiani said the motive for the killings remained unclear. He said he thought the killings stemmed from a feeling shared by many in the army that the Jesuits were helping the rebels.
''These guys could have felt that they were part of the offensive,'' he said in suggesting the killers' motive.
Mr. Cristiani's view contrasted with that of diplomats and human rights monitors, who contend that the priests were killed by right-wing extremists eager to destabilize the eight-month-old Cristiani administration. Some of those also dispute Mr. Cristiani's assertion of where the orders originated, contending that they had to come from someone higher than any of those arrested. They note that Colonel Benavides has not been previously linked to human rights abuses and that he was not known to be prominent among the army's extremists.
''Benavides is the scapegoat,'' said a Latin American diplomat. ''He's the one whose taking responsibility. But there was a top man who knew about it and ordered it.''
 
A 'Historic' Precedent
In the interview, President Cristiani seemed to leave open the possibility that others could have been involved or aware of the killings but suggested that the interrogation of Colonel Benavides had provided no leads. ''Maybe he did talk to other people, but he's denying everything,'' the President said.
But President Cristiani said this should not overshadow what some here are calling the historic precedent set by the arrest of Colonel Benavides. The President said he thought it would begin to show the military, long a state within a state, that its traditional immunity from prosecution has begun to end.
''Obviously you cannot change things from one day to the other,'' he said. ''So it's a matter of pushing on the one hand, but also accepting that this is a process and that new possibilities will arise in the future.''
President Cristiani said he had received support for the decision to prosecute the Colonel Benavides from the high command, most of whom are classmates of the colonel. In the past, the officers have steadfastly defended each other from all accusations.
''We think the high-ranking officers understand why this has to be done,'' he said. ''They understand that the law is above any person and that nobody will be above the law.''
Mr. Cristiani acknowledged some concern about the reaction of junior officers, especially in the Atlacatl Battalion, the crack unit to which most of the arrested soldiers belong. ''I'm sure there's a lot of anxiety there,'' he said. ''Anything like this will create some expectations, some anxiety.''
But he said he had no sense that there was enough dissatifaction to provoke a coup.

HEADLINE: Robert Campeau's Special Genius

 BODY:
Any corporate executive can figure out how to file for bankruptcy when the bottom drops out of the business. It took the special genius of Robert Campeau, chairman of the Campeau Corporation, to figure out how to bankrupt more than 250 profitable department stores. The dramatic jolt to Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Jordan Marsh and the other proud stores reflects his overreaching grasp and oversized ego. 
But the importance of this spectacle to the public is easily exaggerated. A few customers might be inconvenienced. Some suppliers will be hurt, probably only temporarily. Otherwise, the big losers are investors, grown-ups, who loaned money to Mr. Campeau with full recognition of the risks. The rest of the public has little at stake.
The Campeau Corporation racked up more than $7 billion of debt buying up hundreds of department stores. It overpaid. The stores' profits cannot cover the interest payments on the mammoth debt. Mr. Campeau's creditors demanded relief. Bankruptcy does not mean closing the stores. They are, by contrast with other retailers that have recently folded, well run and profitable. They will remain open, but under court supervision until the creditors sort out the losses. In all likelihood, stores like Bloomingdale's will be sold. The new owners might lay off workers and alter policies. But if cutbacks occur, it is because they make sense and would have happened anyway. The valuable parts of the fallen empire will survive, with or without Mr. Campeau.
The grotesque Campeau failure has crystallized criticism of leveraged buyouts - the purchase of entire companies with borrowed money. Such sweeping indictments are premature. Research shows that L.B.O.'s in the early 1980's probably increased productivity, helping the economy. Managers operating under enormous debt worked hard to cut costs. Preliminary evidence from the late 80's is less encouraging. Recent L.B.O.'s benefited the target companies' shareholders, who received high takeover prices. But most of these gains seem to have come at the expense of bondholders, creditors and employees.
Whatever the final verdict on L.B.O.'s, the Campeau fiasco does highlight an important flaw in the corporate tax code. It is cheaper for businesses to borrow money than to raise it by issuing stock. This advantage encourages plungers like Mr. Campeau to buy healthy companies with borrowed money even if the reorganization doesn't add a dime to the nation's output of goods and services. As a plunger winds up paying less tax, the rest of the nation pays more.
The Bush Administration is well aware of this tax bias and is working on corrections. There are possible solutions, but they will cause tax revenues to fall and, thereby, the Federal deficit to rise. Unless it is willing to propose offsetting tax hikes, the Treasury will be unable to solve the problem.
L.B.O.'s are risky. That means some will succeed; many will fail. The Campeau failure, no matter how spectacular, does not prove that the bad outweighs the good. There will be some innocent victims, but the overwhelming losses will be borne by people who knew what they were getting into. If the nation can stop subsidizing such speculation with tax breaks, there will be little reason for the typical shopper, or voter, to feel any real concern.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole Milks a Miniature Cow

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole has never been shy about sounding a clanging alarm in the middle of policy debate. He did so again on the Op-Ed page yesterday. Mr. Dole urged that foreign aid funds be shifted from favored clients like Israel and Egypt to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, and to other countries where freedom has ''suddenly and dramatically blossomed.''
Mr. Dole's idea, which found cautious approval in the State Department and raised hackles among friends of Israel, is sure to provoke controversy. He is quite right to say that duty and self-interest oblige America to help people struggling to eradicate tyranny, whether in Poland or Panama. He's also right that there's nothing sacrosanct about the present foreign aid list. 
It's the next part of Mr. Dole's argument that fails: He suggests that the money can only be found in the foreign aid budget. Foreign aid accounts for less than $15 billion of total Federal spending of $1 trillion plus. Mr. Dole is right to want to nourish new democracies, but why does he limit himself to such a tiny cow?
The Senator's response is that there is no ''new'' money. The budget is already hemmed in by massive deficits. Further, he says, Eastern Europe can't wait for a ''peace dividend'' that may never materialize. He thus asks President Bush to make modest reallocations in foreign aid already appropriated and asks Congress to take a careful, across-the-board look at requests for next year - especially for the big five: Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and Pakistan.
Mr. Dole doesn't differentiate among the needs of the five countries, but that will surely be necessary. Egypt's requirements, for example, may have diminished now that Cairo is no longer isolated in the Arab world. President Cory Aquino of the Philippines might make a case for even more aid to fight the guerrillas and sustain her economy.
The question of Israel is the trickiest, diplomatically and politically. Israel receives $3 billion, more than a fifth of all foreign aid. Would reduced aid speed the Middle East peace talks? Mr. Dole and others in Congress are fed up with Prime Minister Shamir's glacial pace. But reducing aid could cause Mr. Shamir to dig in his heels and rally Israelis behind him.
These tactical considerations aside, the fundamental flaw with Mr. Dole's plan is that it aims too low. The reduced Soviet threat and slowdown in nuclear modernization provide compelling opportunities for prompt savings. A few military exercises canceled, a few procurements deferred - pretty soon, as Everett Dirksen once said, you're talking about real money. Enough, surely, to make a difference in the places where Mr. Dole rightly wants to make a difference.

HEADLINE: The Reagan Boom - Greatest Ever

BYLINE: By Martin Anderson; Martin Anderson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University, was an adviser to Ronald Reagan.

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Almost everyone knows that the greatest depression the U.S. ever had was in the 1930's. It was known as the Great Depression, and its infamy merits a separate section in economics textbooks. But what was its counterpart? When did our greatest economic expansion occur?
We just had it. And it is still expanding, setting new records with each passing month. 
We don't know whether historians will call it the Great Expansion of the 1980's or Reagan's Great Expansion, but we do know from official economic statistics that the seven year period from 1982 to 1989 was the greatest, consistent burst of economic activity ever seen in the U.S. In fact, it was the greatest economic expansion the world has ever seen - in any country, at any time.
The two key measures that mark a depression or expansion are jobs and production. Let's look at the records that were set. Creation of jobs. From November 1982, when President Ronald Reagan's new economic program was beginning to take effect, to November 1989, 18.7 million new jobs were created. It was a world record: Never before had so many jobs been created during a comparable time period. The new jobs covered the entire spectrum of work, and more than half of them paid more than $20,000 a year. As total employment grew to 119.5 million, the rate of unemployment fell to slightly over 5 percent, the lowest level in 15 years. Creation of wealth.
The amount of wealth produced during this seven year period was stupendous - some $30 trillion worth of goods and services. Again, it was a world record. Never before had so much wealth been produced during a comparable period. According to a recent study, net asset values - including stocks, bonds and real estate - went up by more than $5 trillion between 1982 and 1989, an increase of roughly 50 percent.
There are other important measures. Steady economic growth. As we begin the decade of the 1990's, we are in our 86th straight month of economic growth - a new record for peacetime, five months longer than the wartime growth of World War II and only 23 months short of the wartime record set during the Vietnam War in the 1960's. Most experts now predict that it will last right through 1990, and perhaps beyond.
Income tax rates, interest rates and inflation.
Under President Reagan, top personal income tax rates were lowered dramatically, from 70 percent to 28 percent. This policy change was the prime force behind the record breaking economic expansion. Interest rates and inflation also fell sharply and, so far, have stayed comfortably low - a further indication of the power and pervasiveness of Mr. Reagan's economic policies. The stock market. Perhaps the key indicator of an economy's booms and busts is the stock market, the bottom line economic report card. And here the record has been striking. During the period from 1970 to 1982, the stock market barely moved. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks inched up about 35 percent during that entire period. But starting in late 1982, just as Reaganomics began to work, the stock market took off like a giant skyrocket. Since then, the Standard & Poor's index has soared, reaching a record high of 360, almost triple what it was in 1982.
There were other consequences of the expansion. Annual Federal spending on public housing and welfare, and on Social Security, Medicare and health all increased by billions of dollars. The poverty rate has fallen steadily since 1983.
When you add up the record of the Reagan years, and the first year of President Bush - during which he has faithfully continued Mr. Reagan's economic policies - the conclusion is clear, inescapable and stunning. We have just witnessed America's Great Expansion.
The Reagan economic expansion was not perfect and we will never have one that is. The Federal budget deficits were too high and still are, too many Federal regulations lay unreformed and the trade deficit is worrisome.
In fact, the Reagan expansion may not have been the best economic expansion in history, for every economic expansion must be judged by many criteria. But if we look at the sheer size and immensity of it, at its scope and power, then it cannot be denied that it was the greatest.
The full impact of the powerful economic recovery that President Reagan launched during the 1980s is still unfolding.
Mr. Reagan's expansion provided the financial resources to allow the U.S. to build up the combat capability of its defense forces and to begin blazing the new trail for a protective missile system. This, in turn, convinced the Soviet rulers they could never defeat the U.S., and today the Soviet Union and the U.S. are busily engaged in nuclear disarmament as peace breaks out in country after country throughout the world.
Equally important, it proved beyond doubt to all (except perhaps for a handful of left-wing faculty members in our best universities) that capitalism is superior to Socialism and Communism. Our economy is the guiding beacon for all those countries that are ripping apart the ruthless collectivist regimes that ruined the lives of their people for so long.
One thing the Marxists got right: Economics is a powerful determining factor of history. But Marxists never dreamed it would be the economics of Ronald Reagan and all those capitalists that would prevail in the end.

HEADLINE: New York Region and the Budget: School-Aid Proposal Is Big Change

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Like most aspects of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget, the line items that most affect New York City and its suburbs are what Assembly Speaker Mel Miller called ho-hum - neither greatly enhanced nor greatly diminished from last year's appropriations.
Under Mr. Cuomo's budget, the state's discretionary revenue sharing with local governments would stay static at just under $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Although New York City would receive $535 million of that amount, as it did in the current fiscal year, the money would provide Mayor David N. Dinkins with little relief for the city's budget deficit.
Local governments in Westchester and on Long Island can expect scant increases in a number of programs important to those areas. For instance, the Governor proposed no increase in local highway assistance, a $24 million cut in aid for sewage operation and maintenance and a $5.4 million cut in grants to arts and cultural organizations. 
The city would seem to benefit, however, from a proposed change in the state's school aid formula and from increased funds for Medicaid, foster care, AIDS and welfare programs.
The new school financing formula, proposed last year by a state task force known as the Salerno Commission, would compensate schools for the higher cost of education in the city, would direct aid to schools with high populations of at-risk students and would begin to base state money partly on student enrollment. Currently, student attendance is the primary criterion in spending for schools, and the New York City system has suffered because of its truancy problem. The new formula is subject to legislative approval.
 
Battle Along Geographic Lines
While the school aid formula would benefit the city's schools, it would cost school systems in suburban areas like Long Island and Westchester County, where attendance usually is high and enrollment is declining in some communities.
That difference sets the scene for a political battle along geographic lines, Members of both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate, as well as educators in both city and suburban school systems, predicted that the new formula would face problems unless money can be found to wipe out the losses that would be realized by suburban schools.
''I think the Governor is trying to inject the Salerno formula into state aid in a way that favors New York City, and I think we have to take a look at that,'' said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I.
Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said that to make the new formula successful, ''What you really need is a year of a lot of money because you can't rob Peter to pay Paul.'' He added, ''It doesn't work in a political system.''
 
Lack of New Money
Nobody in Albany would mistake fiscal 1991 as a year of a lot of money. The increase in education aid proposed by Mr. Cuomo is $240 million in a total education budget of $8.7 billion, or 2.8 percent. Under the new formula, New York City would receive $116 million, or 48 percent, of the increase.
City officials, who have long complained that New York City schools do not get their fair share of the state's education dollar, tempered their enthusiasm for the formula by expressing disappointment at the lack of new money in the budget.
''Given that an increase of only $240 million is too low to meet anyone's needs,'' said the city's Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, ''what is significant is his recommendation that close to 50 percent go to New York City, a major improvement over last year, when the Governor proposed that the city school system receive only about a third of the state aid-to-education increase.''
 
Dinkins Sees Causes for Concern
Although Mr. Dinkins said it appeared that the increase in the city's share of the state budget would be less than the rate of inflation, he said the impact on the city was not so bad as it could have been. But Mr. Dinkins, who is expected to testify before a joint meeting of the Assembly and Senate budget committees on Feb. 6., said he would lobby for more aid.
Mr. Dinkins said at a news conference at City Hall that he and his advisers need more time to study the Governor's budget but that he spotted several causes for concern during his first review of the document.
He questioned whether the Governor's proposed efforts at Medicaid cost control, which the state estimates will save the city $115 million, would simply increase the burden on public hospitals operated by the city. And he questioned Mr. Cuomo's proposal that the city assume the more than $20 million cost of financing associate degree programs at John Jay College and New York City Technical College, both units of the City University of New York.
Other proposals in Mr. Cuomo's budget pose what Mr. Miller called ''a two-edged sword'' for the city. By increasing state appropriations for a variety of Medicaid reimbursements, foster care and welfare initiatives, Mr. Cuomo would fatten programs with large constituencies in New York City. But he also would increase the short-term burden on the city budget, which must match state and Federal contributions to those programs by mandatory formulas.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
About Education

BYLINE: By Fred M. Hechinger

 BODY:
Education research too often ignores the people it claims to serve -the children and teachers. So says J. Myron Atkin, a professor of education and teacher of science at Stanford University, where he was dean of the Graduate School of Education from 1979 to 1986.
When teachers are denied major roles in research, he writes in Phi Delta Kappan magazine, they ''are taught, once again, that worthwhile innovation comes from outside the schools.'' Professor Atkin complains that scholarship about education often does not realize that ''certain knowledge is available only to people who work within a system and try to change it.'' 
''Not much progress in education is likely to take place unless teachers become agents in the improvement of their own practice,'' he contends in the November issue of the magazine. What is frequently lacking, he finds, is a setting in which teachers can regularly exchange ideas.
''Teachers are at best peripheral to the conduct of educational research,'' he says, and as a result, many teachers and principals are convinced that ''educational research is irrelevant, wrong-headed, or both.''
Of course, he adds, research is essential. Teachers need new knowledge to cope with tough problems. He cites examples: teachers want to know how students can learn better, how children can teach other children, how educational progress can best be judged, and how various subjects relate to one another.
But, Professor Atkin says, because many researchers have never taught elementary and high school students, they tend to view schools as places to test their theories. He calls for a better balance between theory and practice.
Elaborating on his ideas in a telephone interview, he said that unless teachers are given a more active role in educational research, the ''message to them is that they are merely supposed to implement what other people have devised.''
On the bright side, he said, he sees a trend toward case studies written by teachers, which could become ''springboards for further research.''
Professor Atkin's background qualifies him as an informed critic. Born in New York, he graduated from City College with a major in chemistry and did graduate work in science education at New York University. He taught elementary and high school science in Great Neck, L.I., and was a teacher and administrator at the University of Illinois for 24 years before moving to Stanford.
Together with Donald Kennedy, the university's president, he began the study of Stanford and the schools, now called the Stanford/schools collaborative, which brought university faculty and researchers together with teachers and administrators in six surrounding school districts. He recently published a book, ''Improving Science Education through Local Alliances,'' based on a study of ties between schools and industries, universities, science museums, government libraries and the armed forces. The study is financed by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
Professor Atkin says that assigning a passive role to teachers while others determine what should be researched is particularly damaging when school reforms are supposed to give teachers greater power and responsibility over what and how they teach.
Currently, he says, research findings, and therefore proposals for change, come primarily from people outside the schools - university-based experts in sociology, psychology, anthropology and economics.
Why? Largely, Professor Atkin believes, because schools of education think this boosts scholarly image.
He does not exclude his own university from such criticism. ''That's how Stanford's school of education made its fame,'' he said. As an example of a trend that began in the 1960's, he recalls that Stanford, like many other major universities, ''dropped its programs in science and mathematics education (for teachers) altogether so that the institution could hire political scientists, economists, and sociologists.''
Many of them, he said, are first-rate scholars, but ''they don't see the day-to-day problems of the teachers.''
In recent years, Professor Atkin found some encouraging attempts to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners. ''Because some professors wanted their ideas to have greater impact, they began to work more closely with teachers and to spend longer periods of time in schools,'' he found. They realize that ''the teacher seems to be helping to market the professor's ideas.''
Professor Atkin expects some fundamental changes. The unions and subject-oriented professional groups like the National Council of Teachers of English and similar groups in mathematics and science are using their power to give teachers a place on the research front. This, he says, is crucial because unless teachers play a greater role in identifying the obstacles to progress, school reform will not gain momentum.

HEADLINE: For Every Five Young Women, Six Young Men

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
SOCIAL myth: There are not enough young men for all the young women looking for boyfriends or husbands.
Social reality: Single men in their 20's outnumber single women of the same age by more than a 6-to-5 ratio. For an entire generation born after the baby boom's peak in 1957, it is the men, not the women, who face a shortage of spouses.
From Greenwich Village nightclubs to Malibu beaches, women in their early and mid-20's repeat a common refrain: too few men and too many rivals for their affections. But on softball fields and in bars from New York to California, young men sound a different tune: not enough women and too much competition from older, more affluent men. The numbers say the young men may have a point. The Census Bureau estimates there are about 2.3 million more unmarried men in their 20's than women the same age in the United States. Altogether there are about 19.9 million men and 20.4 million women, although some sociologists believe that the Census Bureau misses many single young men because they move frequently. 
The end of the baby boom has shifted the odds even further in favor of young women, because bridegrooms are typically older than their brides. Since the number of births in the United States fell by an average of 1.7 percent a year from 1957 to 1975 - from 4.3 million to 3.1 million - the men born in any given year outnumber women born in most of the following years, so that younger women are in even shorter supply.
The result is frustration for many young men. ''Sometimes I'm lonely,'' said a 27-year-old associate at a major New York law firm who has been searching for a girlfriend for the last two and a half years and who, like other young men interviewed, asked not to be identified.
''We are competing against these 30- and 40-year-olds,'' complained a 25-year-old Washington lawyer, adding that a 31-year-old man had recently taken an unwanted interest in his girlfriend.
Some young women are unconvinced by such hard-luck stories. ''It depends on what you're looking for, but I think there's a shortage of men,'' said Risa Zaitschek, a 24-year-old graphics designer in Manhattan, who nonetheless has a boyfriend.
The strong tendency toward relationships between an older man and a younger woman presents young single men and older single women with a common problem. Demographers have written volumes on the shortage of boyfriends and husbands for single women over the age of 30. The less studied mirror image of this problem is the plight of the man in his early or mid-20's.
Although instances of men who marry older women have increased, a survey in 1985 by the National Center for Health Statistics found the bridegroom was older in two-thirds of all marriages. The average age difference was 5.3 years. ''Men in their 20's simply may not have many women available who are younger,'' said William Beer, the deputy chairman of the sociology department at Brooklyn College. ''Older men are poaching.''
A 1988 survey by the Census Bureau estimated that among Americans 20 to 29 years old, there were 122 single men for every 100 single women. The ratio reflects both a trend among men to postpone marriage until their early 30's and the many women in their 20's who marry men over the age of 29.
Among men and women in their 20's who have never married, the ratio increases to 130 to 100, because more young women than men are divorced or widowed.
Up-to-date information on the ratios in specific cities will not be available until after the 1990 census.
Graduating college seniors go from being the oldest readily available men for most college women to being the youngest and usually least affluent members of the working world. ''It's definitely something I think about,'' said Andrew A. Coburn, a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul. ''It's really a scary prospect as far as, I guess, in today's world, the material aspect: today I have nothing.''
On the other hand, some women are weary of dating men their own age by the time they leave college.
''The older men that I have met have done so much after college, have done so much that I haven't done,'' said Martha Catherine Dagenhart, a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who expressed an interest in meeting a ''sophisticated 26- or 27-year-old'' after graduation.
Bonnie L. Zweiback, a 23-year-old marketing assistant at a software development company in Roslyn, L.I., has been dating a 30-year-old man for a year and said she prefers older men: ''I just think they seem a little more mature, and they seem to know more about where they are going. Most of the guys my own age I've dated don't have a clue.''
Some women in their 20's may date and marry much older men because they cannot find suitable men their own age, said Mark R. Rank, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Under the ''social exchange'' theory now popular among some psychologists and sociologists, he said, relationships tend to form between men and women of roughly equal overall combinations of beauty, charisma, influence, intelligence, wealth and other resources.
''Someone who is extremely attractive in their 20's may be exchanging those good looks with someone in their 40's who has power, money,'' Dr. Rank said.
Some young men are too picky to find a companion or wife even if the ratio of the sexes were more favorable, said Dr. Samuel Pauker, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center who counsels young men and women.
''I'm not willing to settle right now'' for the wrong woman, said the 27-year-old New York lawyer who has been looking for a girlfriend for two and a half years. ''I think it's important not to lower your standards.''
Shortages of eligible women have been rare in American history and elsewhere. With the fairly brief exception of wars, the number of babies born each year in the United States tended to increase from Colonial times until 1957.
Sociologists disagree on the implications of the shifting ratio of men to women. Because most surveys on marital status and attitudes about marriage pose questions to women, reliable data on men are not available for serious studies, said Neil G. Bennett, a professor of sociology at Yale University.
In countries where immigration, war or even female infanticide have resulted in more men than women, the outcome for women has tended to be ''higher marriage rates, higher fertility rates, lower rates of labor-force participation, lower levels of education and lower rates of divorce,'' said Scott J. South, an associate professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Albany. But he added that international trends may not be a good guide for any specific country, the United States included, because of cultural differences.
Several issues in addition to the baby boom can influence the availability of single women in the United States, although their cumulative effect is difficult to gauge. Young women are thought by sociologists to be more likely to have affairs with older, married men than young men are to have affairs with older, married women. Slightly more unmarried men than unmarried women legally immigrate to the United States; the difference was 20,000 men last year. And underestimates of young men by the Census Bureau may mean that the true ratio is even higher.
On the other hand, some research has suggested that homosexuality is more common among men than women, but estimates vary and no consensus exists. And the Department of Defense estimates it has 200,000 more unmarried men than unmarried women stationed overseas.
Yet the situation of single older women who wish to marry remains more serious than the plight of young men, who grow out of their disadvantageous position in romance as they mature and as their fortunes improve. ''It's not a problem - it goes away,'' said a 25-year-old economist in Philadelphia. ''You get your flashy car.''

 BODY:
RESTAURATEURS across the country have seen the future and it is cheap. Or at least less expensive. While the best restaurants with opulent appointments, large staffs and high-priced food will always have their place, many have seen customers move on to less expensive food and more casual surroundings. The restaurateurs' response has been to extend their empires with restaurants where the tab is often half what it is in the parent establishment.
In New York, David Liederman, the owner of Chez Louis, where the average check is $40, is opening Broadway Grill, where the average check will be $26. In San Francisco, Stars sells its entrees for $18 to $20 while at its offspring, Stars Cafe, around the corner, the entrees average $9. The average check at Routh Street Cafe in Dallas is $75, while at Baby Routh it is less than half that.
The National Restaurant Association reports that business is generally flat and that growth is in cheaper, less formal restaurants. 
''The casualization of the American restaurant is the most important trend that is happening,'' said Jeff Prince, the senior director of the trade association in Washington, ''and it is going to change the nature of the restaurant business as we move into the 90's. Price is a very important part.''
A restaurateur was more blunt. ''I think it is 100 percent a price issue,'' said Mr. Liederman, who also owns David's Cookies and has owned Chez Louis since 1986. ''You can dance around and say that you want to do different kinds of cuisines and want to play around with how the food looks on the plate, but I think it all comes back to price.''
To get prices down and volume up, the newer restaurants rely on more informal service, fewer waiters, less costly ingredients, volume purchasing, simpler menus, smaller portions, cheaper locations and more seats.
''Volume is what cures all ills,'' said Drew Nierporent, the owner of the highly acclaimed Montrachet in New York and an operating partner with Robert De Niro in the new TriBeCa Grill. ''If you are guaranteed a certain volume you can lower your prices.''
''Right now there is a casual life style - casual dress, casual atmosphere - and restaurants are responding to this, '' said Jan Weimer, a food consultant and freelance writer in Los Angeles. ''Beyond that, the restaurants are also responding to consumers' ongoing strike against the extraordinary expense of food. After a while there has been a bit of a rebellion on the part of the public to $100 for a plate of pasta and a salad.''
The public that is driving this downscaling or ''casualization'' of restaurants is primarily the baby boomers who were in their 20's and 30's in the 80's.
''The truth of the matter is that new money always spends freely,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant. ''In the 80's there was a lot of new, fast money and now they are getting married, having children and looking for a job. In that order.
''We don't feel rich anymore,'' Mr. Wolf, who is 38 years old, continued. ''The 'Y' word is a dirty word. Being rich and powerful gets you four years in jail. Gordon Gekko was wrong,'' a reference to the antihero of the movie ''Wall Street.''
Pretension is unseemly. ''People want more casual food,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''They know food better and are less experimental. The 80's was a period of adolescence in food and now we've grown up a little bit and can be less pretentious.''
The bursting of the bubble took the restaurant industry by surprise. ''In 1985 we assumed it would go on well into the 90's,'' Mr. Prince said. ''One would think that when the baby boomers entered their prime wage-earning period they would want even more, but other things changed. The market changed; values changed and lately begotten families arrived.''
The owners of expensive and moderately expensive restaurants all over the country are taking this message to heart. Even those who say they are as busy as they ever were are branching out into bistros, trattorias, diners and fast-food chains.
Keith Famie, who owns Les Auteurs, a bistro in suburban Detroit, where entrees are $16 to $21, is opening Famie's Chicken, which he hopes will become a fast-food chain where the average check will be $3 to $5 for chicken, salad and a roll. Mr. Famie said he sees ''the handwriting on the wall: Americans want to eat healthier and cheaper.''
In San Francisco, Jeremiah Tower added Stars Cafe in 1988 to the building where he has operated the very popular Stars Restaurant since 1984. The average main course in the cafe is $9; in the restaurant it is $18 to $20. The cafe food is simpler, more rustic. There is also less of it.
''Deep in the heart of everyone,'' Mr. Tower said, ''there is an endearing love for bistro food, meaning uncomplicated. In this country that sort of presentation and food are equated with reasonable prices.''
When Roberto Donna opened I Matti, a trattoria in Washington, late last year, it filled up immediately, with many customers coming twice a week. For $20 they can go away happy and full. The regulars at Mr. Donna's older and highly acclaimed restaurant, Galileo, seldom come more than once a week and when they do it costs them $40 without wine, tax or tip. ''The last decade,'' Mr. Donna said, ''prices went up, up, up and no one thought about opening up a moderately priced restaurant.''
Inexpensive, however, is relative. Not all of the of the new lower-priced offspring are cheap by anyone's standards. Pazzia, a baby sister to Rex Il Ristorante, the most expensive restaurant in Los Angeles, offers a meal for $35 to $40, instead of $65, the price for the food alone at Rex. ''The time is past,'' said Mauro Vincenti, the owner, ''when six people came in here every Friday and spent $2,000 to $6,000 for wine.''
The restaurants are responding, not only with lower prices, fewer waiters in dinner jackets and more in aprons, but with booster seats andreal children's menus.
''I have a son who is 2, and it's a nightmare trying to find a decent restaurant to go to with a child,'' said Jean-Louis Gerin, the owner of the expensive Restaurant Jean-Louis in Greenwich, Conn., and now also the manager and consultant for his in-laws' much less expensive restaurant, Rene Chardain in South Salem, N.Y. ''On Sunday in Chardain there are many children,'' he said, ''and prices are a little less than in Greenwich because we want to be a little more family-oriented.''
Downscaling is taking many forms. There is, as Mr. Liederman of Chez Louis and the Broadway Grill said, ''more than one way to skin the price cat.'' Some restaurants are lowering prices, even changing their names. Yesterday Melrose, in Greenwich Village, became Barrow Street Bistro and lowered its prices. ''The days of spending $50 at a casual little restaurant in the Village with paper on the tables is over,'' said Lee Friedman, the owner of Barrow Street Bistro. His former partner and chef, Richard Krause, has left to open an even less expensive restaurant called Rose Cafe in the Village.
Others are offering early-bird specials.At Chez Louis there is a $14.95 prix-fixe dinner for customers who are seated by 6:30 P.M. ''To be brutally honest,'' Mr. Liederman said, ''I never would have thought about doing this 18 months ago. There was not that kind of pressure on restaurants to evaluate their pricing.''
All of the cheaper offspring are using less expensive ingredients. ''There are no gigantic veal chops and lobster at Broadway Grill,'' Mr. Liederman said. ''There's a lot more sausage, whole things roasting on the open rotisserie - lamb, chickens, pigs - making them more economical than Chez Louis.''
At Famie's Chicken, iceburg lettuce will be served instead of the radicchio, frisee and mache at Les Auteurs. To keep prices lower at Pazzia, Mr. Vincenti said he buys only California ingredients. ''At Rex we buy from all over the world and never ask how much it is but, 'Is this the best there is?' '' he said.
Simpler food and smaller menus require fewer people in the kitchen and less experienced, therefore less costly, help. There is a staff of 24 in the kitchen at Rex, feeding 90 people; Pazzia has 14 feeding 100 people.
Stephan Pyles, a co-owner of Routh Street Cafe and Baby Routh in Dallas, describes the fare at the latter as less refined, with meats like veal shanks instead of choice cuts.
In some restaurants, like Wollensky's Grill, an outgrowth of Smith and Wollensky in New York, the portions are smaller. ''We had a feeling that a lot of customers didn't want to eat a 16-ounce steak and a full bottle of wine,'' said Alan Stillman, the owner. ''They wanted a 12-ounce steak and a half-bottle of wine.''
At his new restaurants, La Cite and Grill de la Cite, the items may be served with less expensive ingredients. At La Cite, codfish with morel sauce and potato puree is $19 and at the grill, codfish Provencal-style with tomatoes and garlic is $16.75. The grill charges $16.50 for the same roast chicken that brings $19.50 in the restaurant. The grill can charge less because turnover is faster and volume greater, Mr. Stillman said. ''People eat less and eat faster in a casual atmosphere,'' he added. ''In a more upscale atmosphere they linger longer and drink more wine.''
What people are looking for now in all price ranges is value for money.
''How much money do you want to pay for a grilled chicken breast?'' said Mr. Tower of Stars in San Francisco, referring to some of the astronomical prices in New York's restaurant heyday. ''I don't care how rich you are. $28? Excuse me.''

Why Liberals and Their Beliefs Will Rise Again

BYLINE: By Herbert Mitgang

 BODY:

The Resurgent Liberal (And Other Unfashionable Prophecies)
By Robert B. Reich
303 pages. Times Books. $19.95.
The ''L-word'' - liberal - may be coming out of the political closet after being maligned by the Republicans and mothballed by the Democrats during the 1988 Presidential campaign. A winding down of the cold war has raised hopes of a domestic ''peace dividend'' that would benefit people in need of a bigger piece of the American promise. Robert B. Reich, a former director for policy planning for the Federal Trade Commission who now teaches at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, thinks that liberalism will soon be in the ascendancy again but, in the subtitle of ''The Resurgent Liberal,'' admits that his prophecy is unfashionable. 
Of course, nearly everyone has a different definition of political liberalism; that is, about the extent to which government is supposed to play a role in shaping life, liberty and the pursuit of a better living standard. Labels aren't always accurate for minor or major parties, in the United States or Europe. Parties calling themselves Liberal have different agendas and aren't necessarily on the left; the Liberal Party in Italy, for example, is a rather conservative party that draws most of its support from the Italian business community. Something about the claim of liberalism causes ridicule. In his 1834 satire ''The Infernal Marriage,'' Benjamin Disraeli said he considered it a great homage to public opinion that every scoundrel professed to be a liberal.
In ''The Resurgent Liberal'' - a mixed bag of popular and scholarly essays that advocates mild economic activism and government regulation - Professor Reich explains how liberals are viewed in the public mind today:
''The prevailing liberal public philosophy rests on notions of altruism and conciliation. The parable is that of wise and generous parents who skillfully accommodate the conflicting demands of their children, help their poorer cousins, and seek reconciliation with wayward relations. The modern liberal hero is a combination of Jesus and Robert Young in 'Father Knows Best.' ''
This rather far-fetched explanation wouldn't place the author in the company of the great liberal reformers of the 20th century in the United States: the New Dealers around President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930's. But then he goes on to say that his parable is too simplistic. He points out that popular wisdom now teaches that the welfare system doesn't reduce poverty; that full-employment budgets cause inflation and that charity and conciliation are worthy goals in our personal lives but cannot be national policy.
''The Resurgent Liberal'' covers a good deal of ground in short bursts. The author writes about the rise of the paper economy, ''the substitution of paper for product in American managers' hearts and minds.'' He discusses the ''incapacity of the economy to generate new wealth, due in part to the failure to invest in, and give meaningful voice and responsibility to, the American work force.'' He mentions ''economic nationalism'' - the political contest with the Soviet Union and the economic contest with Japan. The final essays in the book are on American politics, social trends and political thought. In this respect, the author, sounding as if the aim of his resurgent liberalism is to win elections, writes:
''It is with some personal anguish that I confess to my closest friends (and now, dear reader, to you) that I spent six months of my life advising Michael Dukakis in his dispiriting run for the Presidency.'' He notes that Governor Dukakis failed to respond forcefully to assertions that he was a liberal and card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union. ''At first, he told the American people that he, rather than George, was the real conservative,'' he says. ''Not until the last 10 days of the campaign, when it looked as though all was lost anyway, did he confess that, yes, he was a liberal. George had been right all along. Dukakis threw himself upon the mercy of the American electorate.''
Professor Reich seeks some obvious solutions that might lead to a resurgent liberalism: responding to Soviet troop reductions and arms expenditures with bold reductions and counteroffers of our own; improved education that would prepare Americans to compete in technologically intensive businesses; curbing hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts, and spending more for children's health and learning ''as an extension of policies for guarding our nation's long-term security and prosperity.''
Much of what he advocates sounds more like pragmatic neo-liberalism than the traditional humane liberalism that led to major social legislation and court decisions in American history.
The author's language often devolves into muddy generalities. For example, he writes: ''If it is to be useful to us, a new liberal philosophy must explain reality and yield palpable lessons for the future. But if it is to be accepted, it must do so in a manner that simplifies and reassures. Sadly, these two conditions are sharply at odds in this age of turbulent change and baffling complexity. Hence, the resurgent liberal's greatest challenge.''
A number of the essays in the book are derived from previously published magazine articles. However, events have moved so swiftly in the last few months, especially in the foreign policy realm, that there is a dated feeling in several places where the need for American liberalism is linked to revolutionary changes going on in Europe, Asia and Central America. It isn't necessarily the author's fault that a book's lead time is so long; but, geopolitically speaking, we are living in newspaper time.

HEADLINE: Early-Month Vehicle Sales Up Sharply

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Sales of cars made in the United States jumped by 29.8 percent in early January compared with a sluggish period a year ago, as buyers took advantage of factory incentives and flocked to showrooms after an absence of several months. Light-truck sales also surged, rising by 22.8 percent.
The upturn does not yet insure a recovery for the industry, analysts said today. But some said they were optimistic that sales would continue to improve, bolstered by expanded incentives, swollen demand and steadying consumer confidence. 
''These numbers confirm that the recent incentive programs are starting to stimulate showroom traffic,'' said John Kirnan, an anlyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York. ''The consumer isn't dead.'' 158,775 Cars Sold The eight domestic manufacturers said today that they sold 158,775 cars in the Jan. 1-10 period, translating into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.1 million, considered robust by several of the analysts. Total vehicle sales in the period were up by 27 percent, to 260,314 units.
The surge in sales helped reduce swollen inventories of unsold cars, which had reached alarming levels at the beginning of the month despite selective plant shutdowns in early December and the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's.
The 91-day supply of domestically made cars in dealers' lots at the end of December was the highest inventory backlog for that month in nine years, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. A 65-to-70-day supply is considered normal for this time of year.
 
Plants Being Closed
The large inventories are significant because they underscore that manufacturers are producing more cars than the dealers are selling. Mounting inventories have set off industrywide plant closings in January and early next month.
Last year, car sales in early January were particularly sluggish, mainly because rebates and low financing incentives ended the previous December. The number of vehicles sold each day in early January of this year lagged behind the daily sales rates in late December 1989. Eight selling days were in the current sales period, compared with seven in the 1989 period.
The General Motors Corporation fared the best of the Big Three, as a bevy of new models pushed its sales to 76,417 cars, an increase of 40.4 percent. Ford sold 49,369 cars, up by 15.4 percent. Chrysler sold 20,364 cars, up by 14.4 percent.
The Japanese manufacturers in the United States showed mixed results. The Toyota Motor Corporation had a fourfold increase in car sales, to 4,123, and Mitsubishi sold 1,344 cars, compared with 51 a year ago, when its plant was new.
 
Big Jump at Mazda
The sales of Honda's cars rose by 21.2 percent, to 5,531, while Mazda more than doubled the sales of its cars to 713 in early January. But the Nissan Motor Company's sales fell by 48 percent, to 914.
The sales of light trucks rose by 22.8 percent, to 101,539, in the 10-day period. Chrysler posted the largest increase over last year, with a 44 percent gain in light-truck sales, largely because of rebates offered for the first time on its popular mini-vans. Chrysler said it had sold about twice as many Voyager and Caravan models in early January compared with the period a year earlier.
G.M. sold 40,752 light trucks in early January, up by 28.4 percent. Ford sold 32,868 light trucks, a 10.8 percent increase. Nissan's light-truck sales fell by 63.2 percent, to 935.

Blue-Collar Blues: Who Is to Blame?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
ARE you better or worse off than you were four years ago, asked Ronald Reagan in 1980. But George Bush's image-makers chose not to press the rhetorical point in his Presidential campaign, and for good reason.
Young, male, blue-collar workers, part of the demographic coalition that has given Republicans a big leg up on the White House in recent decades, suffered devastating financial setbacks during the 1980's. While the real earnings of 25- to 34-year-old men who graduated college rose by 9 percent from 1979 to 1987, the earnings of high school dropouts fell 15 percent. High school graduates did not do much better, absorbing a 9 percent cut. 
Few economists are inclined to blame Republicans, or anyone else, for the way the chips fall in a free market: That would legitimize government tinkering with market-determined wages in order to right social wrongs. And the resulting efficiency losses would more than offset the social gains.
If the rich have acquired too large a slice of the pie and the poor too small - the majority view, one would guess, among American economists - the smarter way to redistribute shares is to change taxes and government benefit programs.
But it is still worth knowing how markets favor some and punish others, if only as a guide to figuring how much strain capitalism is putting on the social safety net. And probably no one has pushed the frontiers of knowledge on how blue-collar workers are faring further than the economists McKinley Blackburn of the University of South Carolina, David Bloom of Columbia University and Richard Freeman of Harvard University.
Their most striking findings, detailed in the National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 3186 (November 1989), are negative.
The real value of the Federal minimum wage fell by nearly one-fourth from 1980 to 1988. But, according to their study, the minimum affected so small a portion of the work force that it accounted for, at very most, 8 percent of the widening gap between high school dropouts and the college-educated.
Many think technology has favored ''knowledge workers'' over those who work with their hands. That might be true, say the authors. But simulations suggest that the magnitude of the impact is too small to explain much of the change in wage patterns in the 1980's.
Increased competition from women may have reduced men's wages. But this does not explain the growth in the blue/white earnings gap because the impact of the increased labor supply has been as great or greater on well-educated men.
The declining quality of public education may have slowed productivity growth since the mid-1960's. But if it were responsible for a fall in the relative wages of blue-collar labor during the 1980's, one would expect to find that those who finished school at the beginning of the decade were doing better than those who finished near the end. And once again, the numbers are uncooperative. What, then, does explain the widening earnings gap? A lot of different things, the authors believe.
The decline of unions, which typically raise blue-collar pay at the expense of white-collar workers, played a part. So did changes in the demand for labor, which channeled blue-collar workers into poorly paid service industries. So, too, did shifts in the relative supply of educated workers: A fall in the number of college graduates gave them an edge in salary negotiations.
This last phenomenon looms largest when the last decade is contrasted with the previous one. Most factors eroding the financial position of the less educated were already at work in the mid-1970's. What changed so dramatically in the 1980's was the relative supply of labor: a flood of non-college workers forced down pay rates. The universally celebrated growth in total employment during the Reagan years, it seems, had a lot to do with the declining fortunes of workers at the bottom.
This supply shift should be partly self-correcting in the 1990's: College enrollments are rising, even as the number of males reaching work age each year falls. But that alone, the authors believe, will not be nearly enough to put blue-collar workers back on an equitable earnings track.
The economic question, then, and perhaps the political question as well, is whether Washington is prepared to give lower-income workers a break on taxes or government benefits needed to narrow the gap. The capital gains tax cut being pressed by Republicans is hardly designed to win their gratitude. But a rollback in the regressive Social Security payroll tax, proposed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and supported by some Congressional Democrats, just might.
President Reagan's chickens may, at long last, be coming home to roost.

President Is Selected At Citibank and Parent

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Richard S. Braddock, for many years a key executive in Citicorp's highly profitable consumer banking business, yesterday was named president of Citicorp and its main subsidiary, Citibank.
With the new title, Mr. Braddock is the clear No. 2 executive at Citicorp to the chairman, John S. Reed. All businesses of Citibank, Citicorp's largest subsidiary, will report to Mr. Braddock. 
Mr. Braddock, who has spent his entire business career in consumer marketing, acknowledged that he had a lot to learn about other aspects of the banking business. ''There is a lot of learning for me to do, but I still consider myself pretty young,'' he said. 'It's a time to roll up my sleeves.'' The promotion of Mr. Braddock, who is 48 years old, was one of several changes announced yesterday as Citicorp coordinates the traditional bank corporate lending business with related activities in securities markets and financial advisory services.
In the past executives were divided between those with responsibility for the institutional bank, which provides lending services, and those in charge of the investment bank, which handles financial advice and securities activities.
Now, Citicorp is dividing executives between those in charge of the most developed nations, like the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and the third world countries, which Citicorp calls ''emerging economies.''
The consumer banking business, which earned a profit of $842 million for Citicorp in 1989, up from $362 million in 1986, will remain the responsibility of Mr. Braddock.
Lawrence M. Small, 48 previously in charge of the institutional bank, was named vice chairman of Citicorp and chairman of the executive committee.
Michael A. Callen, 49, previously head of the investment bank, was put in charge of investment and institutional banking in the developed countries markets. Alan S. MacDonald, 46, previously head of investment banking in North America, was named head of institutional and investment banking in emerging countries.
''These are the four guys who have all along been running the bank under John Reed,'' said Lawrence Cohn, a banking analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
Mr. Braddock joined Citicorp in 1973 as a a vice president in the New York banking group, followed by stints in charge of Citicorp's credit card business and European consumer operations. Since 1985, he has been in charge of all individual banking activities, one of the three major business groups at Citicorp along with institutional and investment banking, and information businesses.
Mr. Braddock said he enjoys a range of sporting activities, including squash, running, bicycling and tennis. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1963 with a degree in history and received a M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School in 1965.

HEADLINE: Ex-State Dept. Officer Takes Job at Fujitsu By MARTIN TOLCHIN

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
In what United States negotiators consider a major loss, the State Department officer who helped develop the negotiating strategy with Japan on high- technology issues ranging from semiconductors to space stations has joined Fujitsu Ltd., a Japanese electronics conglomerate.
David Olive, an economic and commercial officer at the State Department's Japanese desk, left the Government on Jan. 1 and last week became deputy general manager of Fujitsu's new Washington office.
''It's the company's embassy in Washington,'' Mr. Olive said in a telephone interview. ''I'll be reporting on what's going on to those executives who want to know more about Washington and its processes.'' 
Mr. Olive, 39 years old, described himself as a midcareer officer who was part of a team that wrote position papers on high-technology issues including semiconductors, supercomputers, space stations and high-definition television.
Lawyers at the Office of Government Ethics said Mr. Olive did not appear to have violated any laws.
Starting next Jan. 1, a law will prevent for one year former Federal employees who had been involved in trade or treaty negotiations from aiding or assisting any foreign company or government with which they had negotiated.
Under current law, a Federal employee is banned from representing clients before the Federal Government on issues in which he or she had been ''personally and substantially involved.''
The law also has a two-year ban on representing a client on matters that fell within the official's former responsibilities. But current law does not prohibit a Federal employee from going to work for such a client.
While at the State Department, Mr. Olive said, he had no dealings with Fujitsu officials.
But Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, sent a letter of protest today to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Mr. Helms, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations committee, said in his letter: ''I fear Mr. Olive's move to Fujitsu may represent a critical loss to the United States' trade negotiating position. Mr. Olive undoubtedly takes with him a detailed knowledge of our bottom-line positions on a number of high-tech industries which will be vital to our economy's health into the 21st century.''
The State Department had no comment on Mr. Helms's letter, which had not yet been received, or Mr. Olive's move.
American negotiators said Mr. Olive's departure was considered an even greater loss than that of Walter C. Lenahan, who helped formulate the Government's textile negotiation strategies as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Mr. Lenahan left the Government to work for a company that advised Hong Kong on textile negotiations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Dull Session While Gold Prices Weaken

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in lackluster trading yesterday amid few developments to affect the currency markets.
Gold prices were weaker. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, an ounce of gold fell $2.90. to $410.80. 
Foreign exchange analysts said the dollar fluctuated during the day on largely technical factors. The dollar was steadied by rising interest rates in the bond market and uncertainty about the political situation in the Soviet Union, said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc.
Higher interest rates in this country make the dollar a more attractive investment for foreigners, and the dollar also gains from overseas political problems because investors consider it a safe investment.
The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose to 8.24 percent yesterday from late Friday's 8.17 percent. The government bond market was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
In New York, the dollar fell to 145.30 yen from late Monday's 145.55 yen. The dollar gained against the British pound, which cost $1.6585 late in the day, compared with $1.6630.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.6950 West German marks, down from 1.6967; 1.5116 Swiss francs, up from 1.5110; 5.7630 French francs, down from 5.7635; 1,262.25 Italian lire, up from 1,261.625, and 1.16375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16575.
Gold bullion prices had moved higher overseas, before slipping in New York.
Gold closed in London, the major overseas market, at a bid of $413.25 an ounce, up from $412 late Monday. It rose in Zurich to $413 from $412.40. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $415.45, up from late Monday's $413.95.
Silver was also mixed. It fell 1.2 cents on the Commodity Exchange to $5.230 an ounce after rising a cent in London to a bid $5.25.

HEADLINE: A Pragmatist Is Selected by Campeau

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
G. William Miller, the new chairman and chief executive of Federated Stores Inc., has a dazzling resume in business and Government, but he has never run a giant retailing concern.
He has been a Coast Guard officer, a corporate lawyer and he helped build a medium-sized textile manufacturer into the giant aerospace conglomerate Textron. He also served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter Administration.
More recently, as a merchant banker in Washington, he developed a wide familiarity with turnaround situations as a director of various ailing companies - including two whose foreign owners, like Robert Campeau of Canada, led the concerns into financial difficulties. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Miller, 64 years old, has built a reputation as a quick study and a hard-working manager. But at the Federal Reserve he was widely criticized by Wall Street for being overcautious; some people said he was too slow to push up interest rates, allowing inflation to get out of hand.
 
Knows Directors and Officers
As chief executive of the newly renamed American operations of the Campeau Corporation, he is familiar with Federated's directors and senior officers after 15 years as a director, but has little operational experience with department-store retailing.
''He is an intense, very intellectual and yet a very pragmatic guy and not at all fancy,'' said Stephen Wald, a private investor in New York who has been a friend of Mr. Miller's since the early 1960's. ''Even though he is from Texas, I kind of think of him as a frugal New Englander. That's probably good for his new job.''
For his part, Mr. Miller said two experiences from his career would help him at Campeau: his role in the Government bailout of the Chrysler Corporation in 1981 and in the reorganization of a troubled steel company in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Miller said in an interview that he had learned a lot about giant restructurings from the $1.5 billion aid package to Chrysler. As Treasury Secretary, Mr. Miller was chairman of the committee of Government officials overseeing the package, which involved complex negotiations with unions, bankers and suppliers.
 
Valuable Lessons
Mr. Miller said he had also learned valuable lessons from the case of Korf Industries, renamed Georgetown Industries. Mr. Miller served as a director, when the steel company in Charlotte, N.C., avoided bankruptcy after its majority owner, Willy Korf, a West German industrialist, filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983.
Georgetown sold operations to raise cash and reduce debt, then grew by acquisition. It is now a thriving private company with more than $600 million in revenue last year.
''Everybody said I had a complex story,'' said Roger R. Regelbrugge, president and chief executive of Georgetown, ''but Bill showed he had a full grasp of all the important issues within a few minutes.''
And John J. Mulcair, president of the International Power Machines Corporation, where Mr. Miller is a director, said he had broad business contacts. ''He picks up the phone and all of a sudden it's old home week,'' Mr. Mulcair said.
 
Swiss-Style Business
Since leaving the Government in 1981, Mr. Miller has focused most of his business activities on G. William Miller & Company, which has offices in Washington and Providence, R.I. Besides Mr. Miller, the partners are J. Joseph Kruse, a former Textron executive; J. Joseph Garrahy, former Governor of Rhode Island; Michael H. Cardozo, former deputy counsel in the Carter White House, and Steven L. Skancke, a former Treasury official under Mr. Miller and Donald Regan.
Housed in a former residence of Theodore Roosevelt on 19th Street, the firm styles itself as a discreet, Swiss-style merchant bank that provides a variety of financial services to an international clientele.
It has been involved with a variety of companies, including Private Satellite Network, which beams television programming from satellites to rooftop receivers; United Press International, when the news service was up for sale in 1984; and Kleinwort Benson Australian Income Fund, a mutual fund investing in Australian and New Zealand securities.
Born in Sapulpa, Okla., on March 9, 1925, Mr. Miller grew up in Borger, Tex., the son of a a furniture-store owner who was also a city judge. After getting an engineering degree from the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1945, Mr. Miller was stationed in Shanghai, where he met his wife, Ariadna, a Russian emigre whom he married in 1946.
 
Legal Career
After earning a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1952, he joined the New York law firm of Cravath Swaine & Moore.
In 1956, he joined Textron Inc., a textile company in Providence, and stayed there 22 years. He rose to the position of president and chief operating officer in 1960, at the age of 35, under his mentor, Royal Little, the company's chairman. Mr. Miller helped build Textron, which had $383 million in revenue in 1960 and 29,000 employees, to a company with revenue of more than $3.2 billion in 1978 and 70,000 employees.
In 1978, President Carter named Mr. Miller chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Despite the criticism of his performance, Mr. Miller was widely praised for recommending his successor, Paul A. Volcker, who pursued a tough program to curb inflation. In August 1979, he was appointed Treasury Secretary.

HEADLINE: U.S. CUTS BACK TRIP QUAYLE WILL MAKE IN LATIN COUNTRIES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Lingering anxiety among Latin American nations over the American invasion of Panama has forced the Bush Administration to limit a diplomatic mission by Vice President Dan Quayle by putting off trips to Mexico and Venezuela, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Quayle's office announced today that he would travel late this month to Honduras and Panama, two nations that are reliable supporters of United States policy in Latin America. The Administration added a third stop in Jamaica.
But objections from Mexico and Venezuela, two vociferous critics of the Panama invasion last month, have forced the White House to set aside stops in those countries by Mr. Quayle. 
 
Continuing Problems
In Panama today, the new civilian President, Guillermo Endara, said he would go to Washington ''as soon as possible'' to ask for emergency economic aid, including a $200 million public-employment program and $40 million to rebuild homes destroyed in the invasion that toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. [Page A16.] When he announced on Jan. 5 that the Vice President would visit several Latin American nations, Mr. Bush called the tour ''very important diplomacy'' and an opportunity to spell out Washington's ''aspirations'' for Panama and the hemisphere.
The diplomatic sensitivity of Mexico and Venezuela, which are important to United States regional policy, dramatized the continuing political problems the Administration is facing in Latin America after its armed intervention.
 
A Meeting in Honduras
On Tuesday, Administration officials said they had postponed plans to deploy an aircraft carrier battle group off the coast of Colombia to help prevent drug shipments from Latin America to the United States. News reports of the plan had forced Mr. Bush to assure the Colombian President, Virgilio Barco Vargas, that no such action would be taken without his consent. Administration officials said the Colombian Government was unsettled by the Panama invasion.
The White House was trying to arrange a meeting for Mr. Quayle with President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela in Honduras, where the two will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 27, officials said. But there were no plans for him to meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico.
Mexico and Venezuela have said it is too soon after the Panama invasion for Mr. Quayle to visit, warning that such a trip at this time could cause domestic political trouble and set off demonstrations against the United States, Administration officials said.
The White House was also concerned that a visit might prove so awkward for the Governments of those two countries that it would harden their position against recognizing the new Panamanian Government and make it more difficult to enlist their help in economic relief programs for Panama, officials said.
Mr. Quayle's office announced today that he would visit Honduras, Panama and Jamaica on Jan. 27-29.
In March, Mr. Quayle will visit Chile and Brazil for presidential inaugurations, and Administration officials said he could add as many as three other South American countries, most likely Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, to his itinerary.
But, after weeks of delicate negotiations, the Administration decided not to send the Vice President to Mexico and Venezuela, officials said.
The White House also decided not to schedule an immediate visit by Mr. Quayle to Costa Rica, because that country has elections on Feb. 5, and the Bush Administration wants to avoid any appearance of meddling in the vote, officials said. No trip is scheduled to El Salvador. The United States has long been concerned about the possibility that top officials would encounter anti-American protests in Latin America. In May 1958, Vice President Richard M. Nixon cut short a visit to Caracas, Venezuela, after violent demonstrations broke out. A mob attacked his motorcade, shattering windows in his limousine, and tried to drag him from the car.
Today, Administration officials sought to put Mr. Quayle's mission in the best light, noting that he is to meet with regional leaders in Honduras, where he will attend the inauguration of Rafael Leonardo Callejas as President.
Mr. Quayle is to also meet privately with regional officials during the Brazilian and Chilean inaugurations, officials said. They noted that Mr. Bush will meet with the leaders of Colombia and Bolivia at a conference on drug trafficking that is to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, on Feb. 15. President Alan Garcia of Peru has said he will not attend the meeting in protest over the Panama invasion, and will probably send a high-ranking substitute.
Administration officials said the fact that Mr. Quayle would not travel to Mexico and Venezuela did not mark a setback to the Administration's fence-mending efforts in the hemisphere. ''No one wanted to make the point of visiting every country,'' a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Quayle said today at a luncheon appearance: ''There are no problems with consulting with the Latin American leaders. There is no problem as far as us taking our case to the leaders and discussing how we go about building democracy in Panama.''
But he acknowledged that there were ''diplomatic sensitivities'' about the timing of his visits to Latin America.
A senior Administration official said the United States had approached the Governments of Mexico and Venezuela about a visit by Mr. Quayle.
''They said it would be O.K., but not so soon,'' the official said.
''Obviously, we wanted a trip to produce something, like recognition of the Panamanian Government or money for economic relief,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: Greater Reliance on Foreign Oil Feared as U.S. Output Tumbles

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
America's oil production suffered its biggest single-year decline ever in 1989, falling by more than half a million barrels a day, the American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday.
Imports surged to make up for the drop in domestic oil production. As a result, the nation's dependence on imported oil rose to a near-record 46 percent of demand last year, the highest level in more than a decade, according to the institute, the industry's main trade association.
Experts predict that the rapid slide in domestic production will continue in 1990 and beyond. Oil is getting harder to find in the United States, they said, and prices, though rising recently, are too low to encourage the drilling needed to find enough new fields to make up for the aging ones. 
The increased dependence on imports means that if oil prices increase, the nation's trade deficit will probably widen further. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the trade deficit grew to $10.5 billion in November, the largest monthly gap in 1989. Oil imports accounted for 42 percent of the November deficit. [Page D1.] OPEC's Influence Grows Declining American output also means that the world's oil production capacity is once again increasingly concentrated within the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC's ability to influence prices grows as oil customers become more dependent on its supplies.
The trend of falling American oil output has been apparent since the mid-1980's. But Dr. Edward H. Murphy, the petroleum institute's director of finance, accounting and statistics, said that last year's record drop was nonetheless ''dramatic,'' adding that there is little prospect that the production decline will be reversed anytime soon.
Thomas R. McHale, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said, ''We're facing a unanimous belief that domestic production isn't going to go up again unless we have $40-a-barrel oil.''
Oil prices have recently hovered around $22 to $23 a barrel.
American production last year was at the lowest level since 1963, a time when domestic demand was roughly half what it is now, and imports were 16 percent of demand.
United States production will continue to drop because exploration dwindled in the late 1980's, when oil companies cut their spending because of low oil prices. Thus, imports will continue to rise, experts said, even if, as in 1989, demand for oil does not increase.
Dr. Murphy said the decline would continue even though the count of active drilling rigs - a closely watched indicator of exploration activity - has risen, to 1,029, from 872 at this time last year. Besides increasing its drilling activity, the industry is pressing for new tax incentives for drilling and for access to coastal areas where environmentalists have raised concerns about drilling.
 
A Drop in Investment
Peter C. Beutel, an oil trader at Elders Futures Inc., said that by 1987 investment in domestic drilling had fallen to one-fifth of what it was in the peak year, 1981. ''In the early 1990's, the oil we searched for in the mid- to late-80's will be coming on stream, and it's going to be a very small graduating class of barrels,'' he said.
Because of the decline in production last year, which amounted to 6.8 percent, oil imports rose to 46 percent of supplies last year. Crude oil production averaged 7.6 million barrels a day, and imports of crude oil and products were slightly less than eight million barrels a day.
The proportion of imports was second only to 1977, when imports were 47.7 percent. As recently as 1985, when high oil prices stimulated domestic drilling, imports supplied less than a third of the nation's oil demand.
The petroleum institute also reported that by a second measure, which is less frequently used, imports last year reached an all-time high. If inventory changes are taken out of the figures, imports' share of domestic deliveries in 1989 was 46.7 percent, compared to 44.8 percent in 1977.
Imported oil's share last year far exceeded the 38.8 percent of October 1973 when the Arab oil embargo produced the first oil-price shock. It also was above the 45.3 percent in 1979, when Iran sharply cut its production after the Shah fell, touching off another oil-price surge.
Now, oil supplies are increasingly coming from the Middle East, which supplied 21 percent of American oil needs last year, compared with 19.7 percent when the 1973 embargo occurred and 36.1 percent when the Shah fell.
The cost of imported oil last year was about $49 billion, accounting for about 44 percent of the trade deficit.
Analysts say declining oil production from Alaska, a comparatively young oil region by American standards, is another disturbing sign in the petroleum institute's monthly and full-year figures. Alaska production fell 7 percent last year, indicating that the region is past its prime.
But recent statistics also contain some signs of progress in improving the efficiency of the nation's use of energy. Energy efficiency is the quantity of oil or other fuel required to produce a unit of economic growth. Improved efficiency means that the economy uses less oil - and thus needs to import less - than otherwise would be the case. America's overall energy efficiency, while still far lower than in Western Europe and Japan, may have improved slightly last year, preliminary figures from the Department of Energy show.
In addition, demand for oil products grew by a mere one-tenth of a percent last year, the institute said. Total energy consumption rose by about 1.9 percent, but the main source of the increase was a 6 percent rise in the use of natural gas, the institute said. Domestic sources along with fields in Canada can supply almost all the nation's demand for natural gas.
New oilfields are increasingly difficult to find in the United States. Even when exploratory drilling reached a peak in 1981, the success rate was declining, said James J. MacKenzie, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, an environmental group in Washington. The industry can look harder, he said, but in the long run, ''We're not going to get any more of it.''
Given that situation, he and many experts believe that the only way to control the trend of rising dependence on foreign oil is for American households and companies to consume less.
But Dr. McHale of Drexel said of the prospects for reduced use: ''The conservation mindset that was developed in the 70's has essentially eroded. We have no one preaching energy conservation. Kids don't bother turning out the lights. Nobody really pays attention to gasoline prices.''

HEADLINE: Gorbachev in Danger, Kennan Says in Testimony

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
George F. Kennan said today the economic and political problems boiling over in the Soviet Union have put President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in ''danger,'' but he is not likely to be replaced in the near future because his troubles are so acute that even his rivals may not want his job.
Mr. Kennan's remarks were made in an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which amounted actually to a conversation with Sen. Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, the only member who had returned from the holiday recess that ends next week.
During his 90-minute testimony, Mr. Kennan, the intellectual father of the policy of containment of the Soviet Union and for many years the dean of American Government experts on the Soviet Union, also argued that the Bush Administration should offer a much more ''drastic reduction'' in conventional forces in Europe than the proposals now on the table because the prospect of a Warsaw Pact invasion today is ''absolute nonsense.'' 
 
Warning on East Germany
He also contended that East Germany was on the verge of imminent disintegration, and that this ''very, very delicate, dicey and dangerous situation,'' must be dealt with or it will throw all Europe into turmoil.
Mr. Kennan, who is 85 years old, is a professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., began his testimony by reading a statement in which he observed that the ''situation in the Soviet Union, is, at this moment, unstable in high degree'' and ''has created a situation of great difficulty and danger for Gorbachev.''
''So great are the political burdens he has now come to bear that it is doubtful in my opinion that he could have remained in office as long as he has were it not for his high international prestige, constituting as it does an important asset for the Soviet state, and for the fact that none of his senior colleagues has any program to offer as an alternative to the one he has created and carried forward,'' Mr. Kennan said.
So heavy ''is the burden of troubles'' Mr. Gorbachev must now carry, added Mr. Kennan, ''that it is questionable whether there is any among his potential rivals who would like, at the present time, to assume this burden in his place.''
 
Urges Deeper Arms Cuts
In arms control, Mr. Kennan called on the Bush Administration to offer much deeper conventional arms cuts in Europe than those now being negotiated with the Warsaw Pact at the Vienna talks.
''We could take a much more forthcoming attitude in the negotiations for mutual reductions of conventional arms in Europe,'' Mr. Kennan said. ''The relief that a drastic reduction of the Soviet forces in this region would bring to the Soviet government, and, incidentally, to ourselves as well, would be of greater significance, financially and otherwise, than any direct help we could conveivably extend.''
Mr. Kennan's most alarming statements were about East Germany, where he said the Government was on the verge of ''disintegration,'' which could create a sort of de facto unification with West Germany before the rest of the continent is prepared for such a situation.
Saying that ''this dangerous situation which is developing has to be stopped in some way or other,'' Mr. Kennan suggested that the Allied powers --the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union -- ''possibly establish a unified government of some sort in the city of Berlin, and then perhaps expand that into an emergency grouping which could try to stablize the position in Eastern Germany without prejudicing the future problems of unification and of European unity.''

HEADLINE: Political Leaders in Greece Agree to Elections by April

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ATHENS, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Greek political leaders agreed today to hold elections by early April, the third attempt in 10 months, to try to resolve political and economic crises and to allow American military bases to stay for at least another six months. 
''This government's service ends on April 8,'' said Prime Minister Xenophon Zolotas after meeting the leaders of Greece's three major political parties.
American bases were due to close by May 22 unless a new accord was signed, but Greek political leaders agreed today to a six-month extension for further talks.
Conservatives, Socialists and a Communist-led coalition formed the all-party Government in November after inconclusive elections.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Panama's new civilian President said today that he would go to Washington ''as soon as possible'' to ask for emergency economic aid, including $200 million for a public-employment program and $40 million to rebuild homes destroyed in the invasion that toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
''I know there are questions as to whether the United States owes us'' assistance, said the President, Guillermo Endara, who was sworn in near an American military base on the night of Dec. 19 as the invasion began. ''But I don't plan to go as a bill collector.''
Rather, he said, ''I just want to tell the United States, the Government and the people'' that if Panama does not receive ''the aid we really need,'' then the sacrifices in lives and resources both countries made during efforts to oust General Noriega are ''all going to go down the drain.'' [In Washington, an Administration official said the State Department, the White House and the Treasury were working on a package of aid for the new Government of Panama. ''We want to support'' the Endara Government, the official said. Funds for employment and housing programs are among the priorities, but ''we don't have details yet,'' the official said.] 'In Economic Ruins' 
Right now, President Endara said, ''Panama is in economic ruins.'' He added, ''There's horrible unemployment.''
Mr. Endara, who said he had not spoken with President Bush since Dec. 20, the first full day of the invasion, said, ''I have no definite travel plans yet, but I am seeking appointments to go as soon as possible.''
In recent weeks, American officials have been reluctant to make any specific public commitment on aid to restart Panama's economy, saying they needed to study the situation closely first.
But the 52-year-old President, in an interview in his office overlooking the Pacific, warned of ''a huge disaster'' unless assistance began flowing soon, even suggesting that in their frustration ''the people will seek other systems,'' including even Communism or a return to militarism.
''The Communists, the Marxists are really hoping that the United States doesn't come through,'' Mr. Endara said, speaking easily in English, ''because then they will make a big bid for power.''
The Panamanian leader, the first civilian President to serve in a nonmilitary Government in 21 years, added: ''For me, of course, I would be a laughing stock. I will go down in history as an awful President - weak, a traitor.''
 
Figure Not Set
Mr. Endara, settled comfortably on a sofa beneath ceremonial frescoes of eight past Panamanian presidents and two military strongmen, said he had not yet decided on the total amount he would seek from the United States. But other officials of the new Government have variously put the figure between $1.5 billion and $3 billion.
''I last talked to Mr. Bush on the 20th,'' Mr. Endara recalled. ''I don't remember his exact words, but he was very sure of aid. Of course, we couldn't quantify it then.''
Mr. Endara said a program to create jobs, ''something like the New Deal, but of course much smaller,'' would be a vital first step in rebuilding this nation of 2.4 million, where unemployment, aggravated by two years of American economic sanctions that were aimed at weakening General Noriega, has risen to 20 percent of the work force.
''We need a two-year program for temporary employment just to get the ball rolling,'' Mr. Endara said, saying it would involve putting unemployed Panamanians to work ''doing small jobs, rebuilding churches, rebuilding roads, doing jobs all around the country.''
The President also said that $40 million was needed to replace the homes of thousands of civilians in El Chorillo, the impoverished neighborhood of frame houses that was heavily damaged in three days of fighting around General Noriega's military headquarters.
 
Force May Be Expanded
On another subject, Mr. Endara said he and his aides had come to the conclusion that Panama needed ''a small military capability'' to deal with the possibility of anything from serious public disorders to the threat of guerrilla attacks.
For that reason, Mr. Endara said, he and First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon are leaning toward expanding Panama's Public Force, the newly formed, 1,000-member police agency composed of former Noriega soldiers, to 10,000. Out of that, he said, as many as four companies would be composed of troops rather than police officers.
''Our thinking is this - our Fuerza Publica must be a very professional, efficient, very good police force,'' Mr. Endara said. ''However, we know that this is not enough.''
While the lawyer and political neophyte said his new Government did not expect to ''have to fight any wars,'' he said ''we do have to face the fact that we might have to deal with guerrillas.''
 
U.S. Vetoes U.N. Resolution
UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 17 (Special to The New York Times) - The United States today vetoed a Security Council resolution declaring that the search of the Nicaraguan Ambassador's residence in Panama by United States military forces on Dec. 29 violated international law.
The United States was the only member of the Security Council to vote against the resolution. Britain was the only country that abstained.
The resolution called the ransacking of the Nicaraguan Ambassador's residence ''a violation of the privileges and immunities granted to diplomatic missions and agents by international law, codified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,'' held in 1961.
In his statement to the Security Council before today's vote, Nicaragua's representative, Alejandro Serrano Caldera, demanded an investigation of the incident and ''proper penalty set for those who are responsible for such attacks.''
But the United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said the matter should never have come before the Security Council in the first place.

HEADLINE: Sales Tax on Religious Goods Upheld

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that states may apply their general sales taxes to religious organizations' sales of religious books and articles.
Upholding a decision by a California appeals court, the Justices rejected arguments by the television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart that the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion prohibits states from taxing religious sales.
Mr. Swaggart's organization, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, had challenged the imposition of the California sales tax on nearly $2 million in sales of religious pamphlets, tapes, records and other items in the 1970's. The ministry sold the material to California residents both by mail from its Louisiana headquarters and in about two dozen ''crusades'' by Mr. Swaggart in the state. 
According to briefs filed in the case, California is one of only three states that apply their sales taxes to sales of religious articles by religious organizations. The others are West Virginia and Indiana. California is the only state to tax not only local sales but the mail-order sales from out of state that are a big source of revenue for some evangelical organizations.
 
An Issue Left Unresolved
In addition to his arguments concerning religious freedom, Mr. Swaggart had also challenged California's tax on his mail-order sales on the ground that his organization's connection with California was so remote that the state did not have constitutional authority to apply its tax.
But the Supreme Court said today that it did not have jurisdiction to decide this aspect of the case because the California courts had refused, on procedural grounds, to rule on it. That disposition means that someone else is free to raise the same challenge in the future.
But it was the religious arguments that attracted most attention to the case. Religious organizations, including the National Council of Churches and a number of evangelical ministries, filed briefs in Mr. Swaggart's behalf, warning that a decision in California's favor would effectively invite other states to stop granting tax exemptions for religious sales. Mr. Swaggart and the other organizations argued that the tax was an administrative and financial burden that, by adding to the cost of the items, would discourage potential customers.
In her opinion for the Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that ''we do not doubt the economic cost'' of being subject to a sales tax. But she said that ''such a tax is no different from other generally applicable laws and regulations, such as health and safety regulations'' that religious organizations must obey.
''The collection and payment of the generally applicable tax in this case imposes no constitutionally significant burden'' on the Swaggart organization's ''religious practices or beliefs,'' Justice O'Connor said. Tax Rate Not 'Onerous'
The 6 percent sales tax amounted to $166,000 plus interest and penalties over the eight years involved in the suit. Justice O'Connor noted that the constitutional analysis might be different if there were a ''more onerous tax rate'' that ''might effectively choke off an adherent's religious practices.''
The Swaggart organization had based much of its constitutional argument on two Supreme Court decisions from the 1940's that invalidated the imposition of licensing fees on itinerant preachers.
But Justice O'Connor said that those cases were very different because the fee was an unconstitutional ''precondition to the exercise of evangelistic activity.'' The sales tax in this case, she said, ''is not a tax on the right to disseminate religious information, ideas or beliefs per se; rather it is a tax on the privilege of making retail sales of tangible personal property.''
The ruling today, Swaggart Ministries v. California, No. 88-1374, was foreshadowed by a Supreme Court decision last year invalidating a sales tax exemption that Texas granted to religious publications distributed by religious organizations. The Court ruled in that case, Texas Monthly v. Bullock, that the exemption was an unconstitutional state subsidy of religion.
In contrast to the unanimity today, the Justices were deeply divided in the Texas case. There was no majority opinion, leaving the dimensions of the ruling somewhat unclear. But now that the Court has clearly stated that religious organizations have no constitutional right to a tax exemption, the exemptions granted by other states may well now be open to challenge in future cases.
Unrelated to his sales tax challenge, Mr. Swaggart was at the center of a scandal two years ago after admitting that he had paid a prostitute to pose for him in the nude. He was defrocked by the Assemblies of God, and lost more than half his television audience when he returned to the air three months later.
 
Another Unanimous Ruling
In another unanimous decision today, the Court ruled that the Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide lawsuits requiring an examination of possibly unlawful behavior by officials of a foreign government.
The Court gave a narrow interpretation of a longstanding judicial rule known as the act of state doctrine, which bars the Federal courts from declaring invalid an official act of a foreign government performed within its own territory.
The case today grew out of litigation between two American competitors for a construction contract in Nigeria. Environmental Tectonics Corporation, which lost the bid, filed a suit for damages against the successful bidder, W. S. Kirkpatrick & Company, after Kirkpatrick pleaded guilty to a Federal criminal charge of having bribed Nigerian officials.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, ruled that the lawsuit could procede. Kirkpatrick appealed to the Supreme Court on the ground that the suit should be barred under the act of state doctrine.
Writing the for Court today, Justice Antonin Scalia said that the doctrine did not apply because only the ''motivation'' of the Nigerian officials, and not the validity of the construction contract itself, was in question. Preventing Federal courts from examining the possibly unlawful motivation of foreign officials would be an unwarranted expanion of the act of state doctrine, he said. The case was Kirkpatrick v. Environmental Tectonics, No. 87-2066.

HEADLINE: H.U.D. Is Ending an Insurance Program That Lost a Billion

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp today ended a Reagan Administration program in which private lenders committed the Government to insuring mortgages.
Federal officials and independent auditors said the program has cost the Government $1 billion in losses since it began in 1983.
Under the program, private lenders supervised most of the underwriting of loans, the credit checks and appraisals for multifamily housing projects and assumed about 20 percent of the risk of insuring the mortgage. The Government assumed responsibility for the remaining 80 percent. 
 
'Bad Deal' for Taxpayers
''The co-insurance method is structurally flawed and fundamentally unsound as well as administratively unfixable,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''In comparing the losses resulting from co-insurance to the housing provided, it is clear that co-insurance has been a bad deal for the American taxpayer.''
The program, run by the Federal Housing Administration, was one of the Reagan Administration's major initiatives in public-private partnership. It was established by then-Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. as a way of allowing the private sector to perform functions previously performed by the Government in the hopes of speeding loan applications and reducing inefficiency.
But Congressional investigators found that some lenders had vastly overvalued property that was being mortgaged.
 
Economic Downturns
In the course of arranging these inflated mortgages, the investigators said, a lender would receive a large servicing fee based on the size of the mortgage. Later, when the owner or developer defaulted, the lender was able to pay its 20 percent share of insurance costs and still come away with a profit, leaving the Government responsible for the rest of the loss.
Investigators have also attributed some of the losses to economic downturns, especially in the Southwest that caused a rising number of defaults, and have said they found evidence that the housing department did not properly oversee the work of the private lenders.
Auditors from the Price Waterhouse accounding firm, hired by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded last fall that the program had amassed a $1 billion loss.
Mr. Kemp said today that the Government would take over the tasks previously given to private lenders, including credit checks and appraisals, and would fully guarantee the loans.
''A careful and prolonged examination of all the available options and the potential consequences of each to the American public has led to the prudent management decision to end co-insurance and rededicate the department to an enhanced program of full insurance,'' he said.
Because some projects are now being processed by the department, Mr. Kemp said the program would have to be phased out gradually. Officials said this interim period would probably take several months, or possibly longer.
In the meantime, he ordered that private lenders seeking to approve loans under the program first submit all documentation to the housing department for approval.
Mr. Kemp identified the program as the department's No. 1 ''material weakness'' in his report last month to the President and Congress.
The Housing Secretary said the agency would now receive 100 percent of the mortgage insurance premiums. But he said the private lenders would still be doing some of the screening for a fee.
As one of the worst examples of the program, Mr. Kemp cited the case of Colonial House, an apartment project in Houston that was insured for $47.2 million and defaulted because of high vacancy rates. The housing department was forced to take over the project and recovered only $8.9 million when it was auctioned last year.
 
Review of Program
The Secretary has taken several steps to review the insurance program and reduce the housing department's financial exposure. He suspended the program last summer as evidence of problems mounted and put a moratorium on new entrants into the program. He put six lenders on probation and suspended seven others.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether officials at the department who supervised the program were improperly influenced to give preferential treatment to at least one lender.
The co-insurance program is just one program that has caused losses for the Federal Housing Administration.
The General Accounting Office reported in May that the agency as a whole lost $452 million in 1988. Premiums paid by private lenders are the main source of the agency's income, and they have been declining as claims have been mounting, a result largely of a depressed real estate market.
 
'From H.U.D. to the Lender'
The housing department's literature for lenders explains that the insurance program ''reduces the number of persons who have to prepare and review documents at each processing step and shifts decision-making authority from H.U.D. to the lender.''
But a layoff of auditors at the department left ''nobody to watch the store'' when lenders arbitrarily ''did their own underwriting'' in the program, Dennis Penman, a Buffalo builder, said last summer.
A report in December 1988 said inadequate oversight had led to unsound loans, inflated appraisals and inflated mortgages, which in turn led to large fees for the lenders and losses for the department.

HEADLINE: Time for a Danube Basin Common Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The collapse of the Ceausescu Government in Rumania provides the nationalities of the old Hapsburg Empire with a historic opportunity to establish an economic common market of the countries of the Danube River basin. An economic union of Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Yugoslavia and Italy could be modeled after the very successful European Common Market begun in the 1950's. 
The formation of an economic union would cultivate cooperation in a region of divisive rivalries. A tariff-free common market would also be of value to the Soviet Union. In the early 19th century, the integrity of the Hapsburg monarchy was a key to Russia's security. The Crimean War disrupted that, and the ensuing rivalry between the monarchy and czarist Russia played a crucial role in the origin of World War I and the demise of both regimes.
A strong economic union would provide the Soviet Union with a buffer against a reunited economic German giant. West Germany or conceivably a united Germany would also benefit. Germany in the last century has had difficulty contending with its own strength. Weak states to its east have provided Germany with the opportunity to dominate them. Until the middle of the 19th century the Hapsburg monarchy balanced its expanding northern neighbor Prussia. It is with the Prussian defeat of the Hapsburg monarchy in 1866, and that monarchy's subsequent decline, that the growth of Germany's hegemony in central Europe can be correlated.
Many of the former Soviet satellite nations of the Danube basin have fledgling democratic institutions that would thrive better in an economically stable environment. It is in the security interests of the United States, the Soviet Union and a rejuvenated Germany to promote integrated economic growth in the Danube basin.

HEADLINE: Capital Gains Tax Cut Would Promote Fairness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Who's Demagoguing Capital Gains?'' (editorial, Jan. 11) notwithstanding, President Bush was on target in calling for an end to demagogy on his proposal to cut tax rates on capital gains. A prime example of such demagoguing is the charge that the cut would almost solely benefit the rich, when more than half of taxpayers reporting capital gains had incomes of $50,000 or less, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those people are far from rich. To be sure, the capital gains tax cut would benefit Donald Trump on the profitable sale of real estate more than Archie Bunker on the profitable sale of his bar. But don't try to convince Archie that's unfair; he'll be happy to take the money and run. 
In contrast to your contention that most scholarly research questions the positive economic impact of a capital gains tax cut, the nonpartisan analysis of Yolanda Henderson of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston demonstrates that half the sharp increase in capital costs resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was caused by the increase in capital gains tax rates. When you and other avid supporters of that legislation realize that it increased the capital cost of investment in productive equipment (from the standpoint of the investor) by upward of 40 percent, then perhaps the 1986 law will come to be viewed as a decidedly mixed bag, badly in need of improvement, rather than the Holy Grail of tax policy.
You would exclude old investments from the capital gains tax cut to save revenue and avoid rewarding ''the nation's wealthiest families.'' In other words, those thrifty individuals and businesses that have saved diligently and now are appropriately reaping the fruits of that saving through capital gains should drop dead - only future savers need apply. Furthermore, a tax cut on existing assets makes economic sense by encouraging capital mobility and leaving savers with a larger after-tax pool of funds for reinvestment.
Confining the capital gains tax cut to new assets would not be fair to the thrifty of the past, nor is it necessary. Highly credible revenue estimates at Treasury and by private sector economists point to net revenue gains from a broad-based capital gains tax cut in the early years and at least revenue neutrality over five years. Congressional revenue estimators disagree, but they have erred significantly on the pessimistic side in estimating the revenue impact of every capital gains tax cut in recent years. Capital gains revenue estimates beyond five years depend on so many unforeseeable factors as to be little more than conjecture.
President Bush's capital gains proposal is an important first step in promoting tax fairness to savers and the lower capital costs needed to enhance United States competitiveness. It should be broadened in scope, not cut back.

HEADLINE: An Alliance For All Europe

SERIES: Designs for Europe - An occasional series.

BYLINE: By Alexander M. Haig Jr.; Alexander M. Haig Jr., Secretary of State in 1981 and 1982, was Supreme Commander of NATO from 1975 to 1979.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the new decade begins, Europe heads the surprise list. In contrast to the Europe of the early 1980's, the Western system is now clearly ascendant. But Eastern Europe's broad yearnings to duplicate the success of the West, especially its economic success, are not the same as a triumph of Western values, as some too readily proclaim.
The societies of Central and Eastern Europe are wrecked but not yet reconstructed as either democracies or free-market economies. And the final word is not yet in on how all this will play in a Moscow that now seems behind the curve of change, rather than ahead.
President Bush has asserted, rightly, America's interest in the outcome of these tremendous events. We have earned our place - in blood and treasure - at the table. The reconstruction of a new Europe, without American participation at every stage, would simply repeat the historic blunders of the 1920's. 
But there is another historic blunder to avoid: Above all, we must not become an inadvertent accomplice in a Soviet attempt to divert Eastern Europe's march to democracy into the dead end of reform Communism. Still less should we deprive the people of the East of their free choice by helping to consolidate Soviet domination of the region through a so-called political Warsaw Pact.
Indeed, as we look ahead, several myths about the new Europe are already threatening to cloud our vision. The first is that the Warsaw Pact has a constructive, stabilizing long-term role to play. No one wants the transition from Marxist-Leninist dictatorship to democracy to be overtaken by mindless violence or a Soviet military reaction. But this tactical judgment should not be compromised by a judgment that we are giving Moscow a free, even if more humane, hand for an enduring Soviet supremacy.
The tactical consideration is short-ter - very short-term. Once the East German, Czech, Hungarian, Rumanian and Polish Governments have held completely free elections, the Warsaw Pact will remain a source of instability because it embodies Soviet domination of the region.
Nothing about the pact's history suggests it could be anything else. Its member nations are looking West, and Moscow knows it. That explains why the Soviets want the U.S. and NATO to bless a future political role for the Warsaw Pact. And it also explains partly the new Soviet haste on conventional-arms control.
The last six months have transformed the negotiations on conventional-force reductions in Europe. Far from placing a ceiling on the level of Soviet forces, the talks could establish a floor that would justify their long-term stay in countries -Czechoslovakia, for example - that do not want them or need them.
Therefore, we have good reason to readjust our sights on arms control. Newly democratic governments in Central and Eastern Europe may have radically different ideas about the real threat they face.
That brings us to the second myth: that the end of the cold war means the end of conflict in Europe. As the ice thaws, old tensions warm, especially on the issue of German reunification. No one fears the Germany of good times, the Germany of Helmut Kohl. It is the Germany of bad times, with a leader not yet on the horizon, that rattles the skeletons of history.
Now comes the real test for the West - whether we and our allies believe in our own values and judgment. The heart of our postwar achievement has been the restoration of German sovereignty and respect within the political and security framework of Western democratic values. The oxygen for this heart is supplied by democratic government, economic integration and trans-Atlantic collective security.
Will the economic and political accession of 17 million poor East Germans to the Federal Republic destroy what we and the West Germans and the other Europeans have built? Do we need a strong Soviet ''counterbalance,'' still dominant over Eastern and Central Europe, to keep the German state (or states) from becoming what Dean Rusk called ''a loose cannon on the decks of Central Europe''?
If the answers are yes, then we lack both the courage of our convictions and the elementary wisdom needed for any system of security. We must never accept the idea that the alternative to a Soviet threat can only be a German threat, and that the alternative to the cold war is a U.S.-Soviet condominium to ''hold down the Germans.'' This is the realpolitik that could produce another war, not a true and lasting peace.
Prudence demands that we be prepared to deal with the dangers of wrongful nationalism as much as with the dangers of wrongful ideology. But prudence must be allied with our values if it is to have any constructive direction. We must not revert to a balance-of-power politics in Europe that sets one nation against another without any way to assert the common interest or to reflect the weight of shared values. Instead, a ''whole and free Europe'' must be anchored in the same Western collective-security system that has kept the peace since World War II.
And that leads to the third myth: that NATO must wither away as the threat of Soviet invasion recedes. In his speech to the NATO ministers last May, President Bush invested NATO with a new political mission: to secure ''a whole and free Europe.'' This mission revives what has always been the alliance's primary political purpose, a purpose shaded over the years because of continuing serious military threat. Now, the political challenges are growing and the military problem is shrinking. That clearly calls for modifying but not abandoning the alliance's essential purpose.
NATO's future role is not to become a retirement home for unemployed soldiers and bureaucrats or an arms control seminar. NATO is above all an alliance of free peoples sharing burdens and risks and reconciling their disagreements peacefully.
NATO, far more than the cumbersome Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the Helsinki process), with its built-in Soviet veto, has the sinews of strength that sustain European security. NATO alone stations troops by consent.
While the new Europe takes shape, NATO's old role of deterring war remains valid. Once a whole and free Europe exists, a version of NATO will be needed to sustain it - an architecture built on Western democratic values and America's commitment to overall European security. Only that renovated NATO can guarantee enduring East-West reconciliation. Surely, the states in between Germany and the Soviet Union, now recreating the freedoms, will want to have their own relations with the only truly workable collective-security organization we have known.
The new Europe, then, will not be built on the myths of a stable Warsaw Pact, the end of the cold war as the end of conflict or the withering away of both alliances. It will not come from organizations dominated by selfish economic concerns or those overloaded by vetoes.
It can rise on the principles of democracy, self-determination in the context of collective security and the common values that have made the Atlantic ocean a bridge rather than a barrier. Its firmest foundations are Franco-German reconciliation, democracy from the Atlantic to the Urals, free market economics, international economic cooperation and the continued role of NATO. Only a Europe built this way will redeem the sacrifices of the 20th century with the freedom and peace of the 21st.
