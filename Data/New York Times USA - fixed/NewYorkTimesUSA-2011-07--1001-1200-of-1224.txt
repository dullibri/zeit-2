HEADLINE: UBS and Deutsche Bank Results Underscore Anxiety

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER; Julia Werdigier reported from London.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Two of Europe's largest financial institutions delivered a reminder on Tuesday that investment banking remains a fickle source of revenue, as UBS issued a profit warning and Deutsche Bank reported earnings that were below expectations.
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, warned that it would probably miss an earnings target set two years ago after its profit fell by half in the second quarter, in part because of a dismal performance at its investment banking unit. Deutsche Bank fared better, reporting a 6 percent increase in net profit that still missed forecasts. Revenue from trading fell because of uncertainty caused by Europe's debt crisis, the bank said, while warning that profit from investment banking would fall short of targets.
The results may help reinforce Deutsche Bank's decision on Monday to split its leadership between Anshu Jain, the head of its volatile investment banking business, and Jurgen Fitschen, a member of the management board with closer ties to the more stable retail banking business in Germany. They will succeed Josef Ackermann, who is expected to become chairman of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board, in May. 
While banks have experienced a recovery in investment banking profits since the financial crisis, they are under pressure by regulators to reduce risk, and they continue to face market turbulence caused by the European sovereign debt crisis and the budget deadlock in the United States. In addition, there are signs that growth is slowing in Europe.
Deutsche Bank has responded by putting more focus on its network of branches in Germany, while UBS is slashing costs.
''Banks' returns have declined overall in the last 12 months, reflecting deleveraging and the actions being taken in advance of increased capital requirements,'' Oswald J. Grubel, the chief executive of UBS, said in a statement.
UBS's profit fell to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion) in the three months through June, from 2 billion francs in the comparable quarter a year earlier, the company said. Pretax profit in the investment banking unit slumped to 376 million francs, from 1.3 billion francs in the same period last year.
UBS said in 2009 that it intended to reach a pretax profit of 15 billion francs by 2014. But Mr. Grubel said on Tuesday that goal ''is unlikely to be achieved in the original time frame.''
Mr. Grubel added that UBS was ''likely'' to ''book significant restructuring charges later this year'' after a series of cost cuts.
Mr. Grubel has been focusing UBS on its main wealth management and investment banking activities to repair a bank that was among the hardest hit in the financial crisis.
But some analysts have recently started to doubt that Mr. Grubel's plan would be enough. Its investment banking unit has continued to struggle, and the stricter capital requirements have hurt profitability.
A string of departures by bankers and lower appetite for risk among clients have hampered efforts to repair the unit.
UBS said Tuesday it plans to cut costs by as much as 2 billion francs over the next two to three years. At the same time, a decline in demand for its services because of a weaker economic outlook is expected to ''constrain growth prospects.''
Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany, said it increased revenue from noninvestment banking businesses such as retail banking, helping lift net profit to 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion). The numbers showed that Deutsche Bank was making progress in reducing its dependence on investment banking. Pretax profit in the corporate and investment bank was flat at 1.3 billion euros, while pretax profit from private clients and asset management more than doubled to 684 million euros, the bank said.
''Our efforts to recalibrate and rebalance our platform are paying off nicely,'' Mr. Ackermann said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank said that Europe's sovereign debt crisis has unsettled investors and led to lower sales and trading revenue, making it unlikely that the bank would meet its pretax profit goal for 2011 of 6.4 billion euros for the investment banking unit. However, the bank as a whole will still meet its full-year pretax target of 10 billion euros because of improved performance by the other units, Deutsche said.
Deutsche Bank also said it took a charge of 132 million euros to reflect the decline in value of its Greek bonds. It thus became one of the first European banks to recognize losses from Greece following a debt-relief agreement by European leaders.
''While the earnings environment remains tough for investment banks, Deutsche Bank has fared better than European peers and arguably faces lower short-term earnings risk,'' Jon Peace, banking analyst at Nomura International, said in a note.
Late Monday, Deutsche Bank resolved a leadership crisis by saying that Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen will share chief executive duties. Mr. Ackermann, 63, has been chief executive since 2002.
Investors had favored Mr. Jain, 48, whose unit continues to supply by far the greatest share of profits, as chief executive. But Mr. Jain, a native of India who is not fluent in German, was regarded as not ready to assume the statesmanlike duties expected of the head of an institution that holds a prominent place in the nation's identity.
Mr. Fitschen, 62, is expected to help overcome reservations by Deutsche Bank staff members about Mr. Jain.
Julia Werdigier reported from London.

HEADLINE: Neglected Manhattan Transit Hub Is to Undergo a Major Makeover

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
For decades, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Upper Manhattan has seemed like the also-ran of Manhattan transportation hubs.
Unlike the Port Authority Bus Terminal on West 42nd Street, where a traveler has dozens of options for heading across the Hudson River and across the country, the George Washington has only a handful of commuter lines serving New York and New Jersey, and one subway line, the A train.
And even though the building, with its sloping tentlike roof panels, was designed by the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi, it has never had the cachet of, say, Warren & Wetmore's Grand Central Terminal, perhaps because of its modernism but also its distance from Midtown. 
The two-block station, between West 178th and West 179th Streets, near the ramps to the upper deck of the George Washington Bridge, seems poorly maintained, with large chunks missing from the tile mosaic above the main entrance. The retail spaces around and in the three-level structure, which is divided into two sections by Broadway, are often vacant.
Now, though, a long-delayed plan to refurbish and expand the station is back on track, as its Upper Manhattan neighborhood goes through changes of its own.
On June 30, the board of commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the building's landlord, voted to proceed with a $183.2 million renovation of the 294,000-square-foot station, which has not had a major renovation since opening in 1963.
In a private-public collaboration, the Port Authority has joined with a development team of principals of SJM Partners, of Palm Beach, Fla., and Slayton Equities, of New York. The team will develop and manage the space for 99 years, under the terms of a lease signed on July 21. The Port Authority will contribute $83.2 million and the developers $100 million.
''There's been a long time when we've wondered, how do you transform what's really just plastic unappealing space?'' said Christopher O. Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority. ''The challenge is, the industrial architecture of 1960s transportation facilities does not always lend itself to a modern retail world.''
To meet that challenge, the renovation will quadruple the amount of retail space at the station, to 120,000 square feet, in part by opening long-shuttered space on the eastern half, which has storefronts on Broadway and West 178th and West 179th Streets.
But the developers will also install tenants on the site's west side, in spaces that, based on surviving signs, once housed a barber, dentist and an off-track betting parlor.
Developers would not name specific retailers during negotiations, but Stephen J. Garchik, the president of SJM, said a supermarket is poised to take one of the station's largest spaces, a 25,000-square-foot ground-level berth, along a part of Broadway with many chain restaurants.
Other possible tenants include a women's clothing store for a 25,000-square-foot space, and a fitness center for a 20,000-square-foot third-floor space, Mr. Garchik added, saying that he would pay $800,000 a year to rent the station for 99 years. He hopes to collect rents of as much as $175 a square foot for some of the stores, more than four times the current top rents of $40 a square foot.
The deal also is attractive because the station is exempt from property taxes as a public building, and eligible for various tax credits because it is in a low-income area, he said.
''The size is not overwhelming for us,'' said Mr. Garchik, whose firm usually does construction projects and whose portfolio includes the National Science Foundation headquarters in Arlington, Va., which has stores and straddles a subway line. ''But it's very exciting.''
The renovation, which is to begin in January 2012 and is expected to be finished in spring 2013, will include the station's waiting areas, concourses and gates. Many of those spaces appear dingy, with dropped ceilings that seem to be stained with cigarette smoke. Circular banks of pay phones that dot stone floors are among the station's period details.
The phones and ceilings are likely to be removed in the renovation, which is intended to give the station a brighter and airier look, Mr. Garchik said.
In addition, Mr. Ward said, the station, which handled four million passengers and 300,000 bus trips in 2010, will increase the number of gates to 22 from 17, to help alleviate crowding at the Port Authority station on West 42nd Street, where the 183 gates are near capacity. The Port Authority said the station would continue to function during the renovation.
The Port Authority has come close to renovating the station before. In 2008, the commissioners approved a $152 million deal, though the recession dashed those plans. Similarly, in 1999, a plan to build a 12-screen movie theater on the roof fizzled.
But the current project may be coming at an auspicious time. Many of the nearly 20,000 employees of nearby Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, which are expected to continue their expansions, commute from New Jersey by bus through the station.
In addition, the expansion of Columbia University into the nearby Manhattanville neighborhood will increase the need for better bus service there, says Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group.
Given that the trains of New Jersey Transit and PATH are often full, and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels regularly jammed, ''anything we can do to take pressure off the Hudson crossings is a real plus,'' he said.
Mr. Nervi, the architect of the station, was known for designing the Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome, which was used in the 1960 Summer Olympics. Mr. Yaro said the station renovation might give people a better appreciation of the architect's work as well.
''It's a remarkably elegant building, and when it's restored,'' Mr. Yaro said, ''it will be even more so.''

HEADLINE: Can't We Do This Right?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There is only one thing worse than Republicans and Democrats failing to agree to lift the debt ceiling, and that is lifting the debt ceiling without a well-thought-out plan and with hasty cuts totaling trillions of dollars over a decade. What business do you know -- that is still in business -- that would operate this way: making massive long-term cuts, negotiated by exhausted executives, without any strategic plan? It certainly wouldn't be a business you'd expect to thrive. Maybe you can grow without a plan. But if you cut without a plan, you will almost surely hit an artery or a bone that could really debilitate you. That, I fear, is where we are heading.
Stop for a minute and ask: What would it look like if we were approaching this problem properly? 
For starters, two years ago Congress and the Obama administration would have collaborated on a series of hearings under the heading: ''What world are we living in?'' They would have included a broad range of business, education and technology leaders testifying about what are the major trends and opportunities that are expected to shape the job market for the next decade. Surely, the hyperconnecting of the world, the intensification of globalization and outsourcing, the challenges of energy and climate and the growing automation of the work space that is rapidly increasing productivity with fewer workers all would have figured prominently.
Then we would have put together ''The National Commission for 21st Century America,'' with this assignment: Given these big trends, what will America need to thrive in this world and how should we adapt our unique formula for success?
Yes, we have developed such a formula over the course of American history, and it is built on five basic pillars: educating the work force up to and beyond whatever technology demands; building the world's best infrastructure of ports, roads and telecommunications; attracting the world's most dynamic and high-I.Q. immigrants to enrich our universities and start new businesses; putting together the best regulations to incentivize risk-taking while curbing recklessness (not always perfectly); and funding research to push out the boundaries of science and then let American innovators and venture capitalists pluck off the most promising new ideas for new business.
Only after we had done all that would we then sit down with a blank sheet of paper and say, ''O.K., given our current fiscal predicament, where should we cut spending and where must we raise new tax revenues so that we can bring our government back to solvency and, at the same time, reinvigorate our formula for growth and success.''
After all, ''we don't just need a plan for regaining American solvency. We need a plan for maintaining American greatness and sustaining the American dream for another generation,'' argues Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins University foreign policy expert (and co-author with me of a forthcoming book). ''Such a plan requires cutting, taxing and spending. It requires cutting because we have made promises to ourselves on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that we cannot keep without reforming each of them.''
But we cannot possibly generate the savings -- or the new investments we need in our formula for success -- by just taking funds from these social programs and shredding the social safety nets, adds Mandelbaum. ''That would trigger a backlash against free-market capitalism. And free-market capitalism is the engine of our growth, and growth is the best way to reduce the deficit.''
That is why we need to raise new tax revenues as well -- so we can simultaneously shrink the entitlements programs, but still keep them viable, and generate the funds needed to strengthen all five parts of our growth formula. Anyone who says that either entitlement reform or tax increases are off the table does not have a plan for sustaining American greatness and passing on the American dream to the next generation.
Alas, that is the Tea Party. It is so lacking in any aspiration for American greatness, so dominated by the narrowest visions for our country and so ignorant of the fact that it was not tax cuts that made America great but our unique public-private partnerships across the generations. If sane Republicans do not stand up to this Hezbollah faction in their midst, the Tea Party will take the G.O.P. on a suicide mission. No American politician was more allergic to debt or taxes than Thomas Jefferson, but he also appreciated the need to have the resources to make the Louisiana Purchase and insisted that on his tombstone it be written that he founded the University of Virginia.
Personally, I'll support anyone with a real plan to cut spending, raise revenues and boost investment in the five pillars of our success -- be they Democrats or Republicans. But if neither Republicans nor Democrats can see that we need a hybrid politics today -- one that requires cutting, taxing and investing as part of a single nation-building strategy (phased in over time) -- then I'll hope for a third party that does get it and can take us where we need to go.

HEADLINE: Profit Outlook and Debt Weigh on Shares Again

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a second consecutive day amid wrangling by lawmakers over plans to raise the federal debt limit and earnings forecasts from several companies that disappointed investors.
After projecting full-year earnings that did not meet analysts' estimates, 3M lost 5.4 percent, the most in the Dow Jones industrial average. UPS, the package-delivery company, dropped 3.3 percent after predicting the third quarter will be ''fairly slow.'' Industrial shares led losses among eight of the 10 main groups in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Tuesday.
Other companies like Lexmark International, however, rose after reporting better-than-estimated earnings. 
The S.& P. 500, which rallied 2.2 percent last week, dropped 0.4 percent to 1,331.94. The Dow lost 91.50 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 12,501.30. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.1 percent to 2,839.96.
''We have multiple sources of uncertainty, including what's happening in Washington with the debt ceiling,'' Mark Freeman, co-chief investment officer at Westwood Management in Dallas, said by telephone. ''The longer the uncertainty goes on, the greater the risk is that it will negatively affect businesses.''
Negotiations over the nation's debt limit have whipsawed stocks. Republicans and Democrats are sparring over separate plans to raise the federal debt limit and avoid a government default.
President Obama, in an address Monday night from the White House, said he remained confident that the stalemate could be resolved if both sides compromised. Both S.& P. and Moody's Investors Service are considering downgrading the nation's credit rating.
On Tuesday, stocks pared losses as a report showed confidence among consumers rose unexpectedly in July from an eight-month low, led by a rebound in the outlook for jobs in the next six months. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence climbed to 59.5 from a revised 57.6 reading for June that was lower than previously estimated. Economists predicted the July gauge would fall to 56, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 13/32, to 101 14/32. The yield fell to 2.96 percent, from 3 percent late Monday.
All 12 stocks in a gauge of home builders declined after a separate report from S.& P./Case-Shiller showed house prices in 20 metropolitan areas declined 4.5 percent in May from May 2010.
Shares of Netflix dropped 5.2 percent to $266.91 after its third-quarter sales and profit forecast missed estimates and the company said a price increase was hurting its ability to sign up new users.
RadioShack surged 20 percent to $15.69 as it announced that it would provide Verizon Wireless products in its stores starting Sept. 15 and that it was ''comfortable with the range of analysts' earnings estimates for the remainder of 2011.''
Baidu, which owns China's most popular Internet search engine, climbed 5 percent to $164.36. It said third-quarter sales would be at least $611.1 million, compared with the average analyst forecast for $568.4 million.
Lexmark International surged nearly 18 percent, the biggest gain since 2000 and the most in the S.& P. 500, to $33.93. The company, which makes laser and inkjet printers, reported second-quarter profit excluding some items of $1.36, beating the average $1.03 estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg on strong demand from corporate customers.

HEADLINE: Steel Makers Warn Profits Will Be Lower for 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Shares of steel makers fell sharply on Tuesday after the companies warned of lower third-quarter profits because of the slow economic recovery, a drop in steel prices resulting from overcapacity, and higher raw material costs.
The AK Steel Holding Corporation on Tuesday reported second-quarter profit that missed Wall Street expectations and said third-quarter operating profit would be down from the second quarter.
AK Steel's second-quarter profit rose to $33.1 million, or 30 cents a share, from $26.7 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.79 billion from $1.59 billion. 
The United States Steel Corporation reported a lower-than-expected second-quarter profit late on Monday and also warned that earnings would fall in the current quarter.
Last week, the Nucor Corporation said results in its current quarter would be lower because of pricing pressure and sluggish demand in some industrial sectors. Shares of Nucor were down 2.4 percent to $39.71.
''The results were terrible, especially AK's,'' said Charles Bradford, an analyst at Bradford Research in New York. ''Their third-quarter outlook was so bad it's not much better than break-even,'' he said of AK Steel's results.
He said that although the third quarter was traditionally slow, weak demand from some industrial sectors like construction would be exacerbated by too much steel in the marketplace.
After the recession, most steel makers cut back production. They have been slowly inching up capacity as demand warrants.
But Mr. Bradford said steel prices had come down recently since the reopening of the huge Sparrows Point plant in Maryland, which added more steel to the marketplace. The plant's new owner is RG Steel, an affiliate of the Renco Group.
''Too much capacity has come on line,'' Mr. Bradford said.
Mark Parr, a steel industry analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, said U.S. Steel's third-quarter outlook implied lower earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization than Wall Street's expectation of $450 million.
''But we do believe investors had not built much faith in second-half 2011 expectations, given the recent declines in flat-rolled pricing realizations and choppy macro data,'' Mr. Parr wrote in a research note.
John Surma, chief executive of U.S. Steel, warned in the company's quarterly results announcement that the United States and Europe ''continue to face an uneven economic recovery.''
''Reflecting the effects of a slowing economy, we expect to report an overall lower operating profit in the third quarter,'' Mr. Surma said.
AK Steel said its average per-ton selling price was likely to fall by about 1 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. Combined with higher costs, that is likely to result in an operating profit of about $15 a ton in the quarter, down from $46 in the second quarter, it said.
Shares of AK Steel, which is based in West Chester, Ohio, fell $2.71, or 17.5 percent, to $12.81.
U.S. Steel earned $222 million, or $1.33 a share, in contrast to a loss of $25 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $5.12 billion from $4.68 billion.
Shares of U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, fell $3.67, or 8.3 percent, to $40.62 a share.

HEADLINE: Affluent Buyers Reviving Market For Miami Homes

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
MIAMI -- South Florida is the default capital of the country. Here in Miami-Dade County, one out of five households with mortgages is in foreclosure. Nearby Broward and Palm Beach counties are not far behind. Nearly 200,000 South Florida families are stuck in the mire of default.
And yet much of Miami is gripped by a housing mania as the oversupply of distressed homes dries up and foreigners and investors swoon. Only a few years after it seemed there were so many unwanted high-rise condominiums that the only solution was to tear some of them down, there are plans to build even more.
Home sales in the metropolitan area during the first half of the year rose 16 percent from 2010 for the best spring since 2007, according to the research firm DataQuick, far outpacing the negligible growth in the rest of the country. Two-thirds of the sales were all cash. 
Prices, after a brutal drop, are firming up or even increasing. During the first six months of the year, there were 439 sales for at least $2 million, up 13 percent from last year.
''People thought it would take at least a decade to get back to this point,'' said Peter Zalewski, founder of Condo Vultures, a real estate consultant.
Gil Dezer, who co-developed the beachfront Trump Towers, saw 90 percent of the buyers in the project's uncompleted second and third buildings abandon their deposits in the crash. Last week, Mr. Dezer achieved a milestone: he sold enough condos to pay off the $265 million mortgage on the property. Only about 12 percent of the apartments remain.
''The Brazilians walk in, they don't even negotiate,'' said Mr. Dezer, who said he would announce two new projects by the end of the year. ''It's a no-brainer for them.''
For more than four years, the fate of the housing market here and across the country has been closely tied to the tremendous wave of foreclosures. In some communities, more than half of all home sales were bank repossessions. These cheap, often half-destroyed properties undermined neighborhoods and accelerated the market's descent, prompting even more owners to walk away.
But now, as new foreclosures slow and lenders are forced to let old cases languish for legal reasons, some of the regions that were worst off when foreclosures were at flood tide are much improved with the process stalled.
''People should thank the foreclosure mills,'' said Mr. Zalewski, referring to the law firms that brought about freezes in foreclosures when they were caught using illegal methods. ''They gave the whole market a reprieve.''
As a result, the balance between supply and demand in South Florida is shifting. In late 2008, as the financial crisis was peaking, there were 108,000 properties for sale and hardly any buyers. The region became a symbol of excess. Buyers abandoned their deposits and reneged on deals, buildings went bankrupt and squatters moved in.
Now there are fewer than 48,000 properties for sale, Condo Vultures said. And with supply diminished, homes have value again.
Whether Miami and other stricken markets like Phoenix, Las Vegas and parts of California will continue to make progress depends on the fate of the two million American households in foreclosure and another two million in severe default. The nation's attorneys general and the Obama administration are negotiating with the top mortgage servicers for new procedures for those in trouble. If the lenders get immunity from prosecution, foreclosures might speed up and the housing market could suffer another relapse.
In the meantime, the South Florida market is busy, although it offers a problematic blueprint for a national recovery. For the traditional buyer who wants to put down no more than 20 percent, loans are somewhere between tough and impossible. Many of the sales are to investors, rich people or foreign citizens benefiting from a weak dollar.
''Two years ago, everyone was gripped with fear,'' said a mortgage broker, Grant Stern. ''Now investors are gripped by greed.''
Mr. Stern is suffering the consequences of better times. The landlord on his high-rise rental finally managed to make a deal with the bank to sell it for less than he owed. Last week, Mr. Stern had to move.
His old place, a three bedroom, was $1,300 a month. Across the street, he is paying $2,179 for a two bedroom. ''I'm downsizing my space by 30 percent yet spending 50 percent more,'' he said.
Projects that were left for dead during the bust have sprung back to life. The Everglades, a two-tower, 49-story project that went bankrupt in 2009 with fewer than 10 percent of its units sold, has been reintroduced under the name Vizcayne.
Paramount Bay, a 47-story condo building that was supposed to open in 2009 but ended up foreclosed, is finally on track to start selling in September.
A developer and marketing team that suffered sharp reversals in the crash, the Related Group and the International Sales Group, issued a promotional report a few weeks ago asserting that ''the next chapter begins.'' The tens of thousands of new condos built during the boom -- and abandoned during the crash -- will all be occupied by the end of next year, they said.
''Do I want to say 'boom'? '' Philip Spiegelman, a Related ISG executive, wondered in an interview. ''That's a little overly aggressive, but we clearly are being rewarded for offering very inexpensive real estate.''
Inexpensive is a relative term. Miami prices are about half what they were at the peak, but units in the project, called Apogee Beach, start in the high six figures. All 49 condos were reserved in 60 days. If construction begins as planned in November, it will be the first postcrash building in the area.
Some experts think Miami's reprieve will be short-lived. ''The banks will only keep the Grim Reaper at bay for so long,'' said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant. ''There is going to come a day of reckoning when they will have to move this inventory.''
Indeed, Dade County foreclosure filings in June ticked up 30 percent from May for the highest monthly total since October. Even so, the rate is about a third of what banks were filing early last year.
For some investors, the unknown future is all the more reason to do deals right now.
Andres Zapata was a young, inexperienced real estate investor at the end of the last boom, trying to flip houses. ''I went down like a lot of other people did,'' he said.
He went to Iraq with the National Guard and is now back in real estate with several like-minded buddies. After about four months of looking for good deals, they just bought two houses in a Miami suburb.
''We'll either flip them or rent them out,'' said Mr. Zapata. ''So far, so good.''

HEADLINE: On All Levels of the Economy, Concern About the Impasse: Losing Top Rating Could Cost Growth And Job Creation

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and LOUISE STORY; Eric Dash and Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Economists and analysts are trying to gauge the costs to the economy and consumers if the United States loses its solid-gold credit rating -- a move that appears more likely now that the standoff in Washington over government spending has calcified.
Some economists say the effects of lowering the federal government's credit rating to AA from AAA can be measured in the billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs for the government, and in the billions more that consumers, corporations, states and municipalities will have to pay for their credit. It could also erode consumer and business confidence, slowing even further the economy and job creation. 
The prospect of a downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies once seemed almost unimaginable. But the impasse in Washington over the government's deficit and $14.3 trillion debt limit has led some global financial players to expect the change.
A downgrade on debt issued by the United States would have less severe consequences than a default, which takes places when a government fails to pay its creditors. Many Wall Street bankers on Tuesday said they still believed a default would be avoided because its consequences for the markets and economy could be catastrophic. They were less certain, however, what the cumulative effect might be of a downgrade.
The view among many on Wall Street on Tuesday was that long-term Treasury yields could edge up by 0.10 percentage points, to 0.70 percentage points. That would eventually increase the amount of interest the United States pays on its debt by as much as tens of billions of dollars each year. The government now pays $250 billion a year on interest costs to service its debt.
The size of the increase depends on how long the stalemate in Washington continues, Terry Belton, the global head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan Chase, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.
On the high end, the government's interest payments could climb an additional $100 billion a year, Mr. Belton said. ''That is a huge number, representing a long-term permanent increase in U.S. borrowing costs.''
Rates would also increase on some markets priced off Treasuries, including mortgages, credit cards and student and auto loans, analysts warned.
For a typical consumer with a $200,000 mortgage, the increase in yields could translate into an increase of $200 to $400 a year in their loan payments, according to Citigroup analysts.
Treasuries are also widely held as collateral in the huge repurchase markets that are used by banks around the world to raise overnight loans, and in clearing houses for financial derivatives. If Treasuries decline in value, participants could be asked to put up more collateral, which could cause selling across a broad swath of the markets.
Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economist at the investment firm Pimco, said he believed lawmakers would reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avert a default on the country's debt, but that the nation's rating would remain vulnerable.
''A downgrade would mean a weaker dollar, somewhat higher interest rates and a further blow to the already fragile national economic confidence,'' Mr. El-Erian said. ''This translates into weaker growth and even greater headwinds when it comes to job creation, which is absolutely critical at this stage.''
Standard & Poor's, one of the three major ratings agencies, has said that just raising the debt ceiling would not be enough. Without a ''credible'' plan by Congress for at least $4 trillion in savings, the agency has warned, the United States' credit rating might still be downgraded.
Analysts and economists pointed to that stance this week when they expressed growing concerns about a downgrade. On Monday, some of the country's largest state pension funds sent a letter to President Obama and Congress, warning that ''the fallout will be felt all across America'' and that economic growth ''will stall for years to come.''
Standard & Poor's has warned that if the United States is downgraded, many other sectors and institutions could be as well, which would cause them to face higher borrowing costs. Among those it put on a negative credit watch in mid-July were some bond issues by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a few insurance companies, 604 structured finance transactions that totaled $373 billion when issued and some municipal debt backed by the United States.
It was unclear whether the borrowing costs for these entities would climb much higher. Some investors said they did not give much weight to the difference between a triple-A and a double-A.
But in the broader economy, if money that might have gone to new purchases or increased investment were instead diverted to higher interest payments, the result could be slower economic growth and a higher jobless rate for the remainder of the year, analysts warn.
Macroeconomic Advisers said the country's gross domestic product could slow in the second half of this year to 2.6 percent from a forecasted 3.2 percent, and that the jobless rate could end the year at 9.6 percent, above the 9.2 percent expected.
Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, said any change in interest rates would probably be small and not felt for several years. ''The real story is whether the uncertainty will cause consumers and companies to stop spending,'' he said.
On that front, some analysts noted that corporations stopped spending long before the debt-limit debate hit the news.
''Companies clearly have had record cash on the books for a year and a half now,'' said Alec Young, an equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''Yes, they're not spending the money, they're not hiring, but is it because of this issue?''

HEADLINE: Facing Obstacles, G.O.P. Delays Vote On Plan For Debt

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and CARL HULSE; Sarah Wheaton, Jada F. Smith and Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republican leaders were forced on Tuesday night to delay a vote scheduled on their plan to raise the nation's debt ceiling, as conservative lawmakers expressed skepticism and Congressional budget officials said the plan did not deliver the promised savings.
The pushback on the bill was the latest chaotic twist in the fiscal fracas on Capitol Hill, as the clock ticked closer to Aug. 2, when the Obama administration has warned that the nation risks defaulting on its bills. The scramble to come up with a plan that could be put to a vote, now moved from Wednesday to Thursday, represents a test of Speaker John A. Boehner's ability to lead his restive caucus. The expected showdown over the legislation is the culmination of months of efforts by Tea Party-allied freshmen and fellow conservatives to demand a fundamentally smaller government in exchange for raising the federal borrowing limit. 
Mr. Boehner rolled out a two-stage plan on Monday that would allow the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit to rise immediately by about $1 trillion in exchange for $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. The plan tied a second increase early next year to the ability of a new bipartisan Congressional committee to produce more reductions.
The plan was met with skepticism -- and in many cases outright rejection -- by several conservative House members who said its savings did not go far enough. President Obama and most Congressional Democrats also have rejected the proposal, saying it is only a short-term solution and could lead to market uncertainty and instability.
Mr. Boehner's troubles piled up late Tuesday afternoon when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said his plan would cut spending by $850 billion during the next decade -- about $150 billion less than the $1 trillion increase proposed for the debt ceiling.
Mr. Boehner was forced to quickly retreat from the bill. Republican leaders said they would probably rework it to in a way that would reflect the decreased savings by raising the debt limit by less than $850 billion. Such a change would mean that the Obama administration would need to make another request for an increase in a matter of months, making the deal even less palatable to Democrats.
''As we speak, Congressional staff are looking at options to adjust the legislation to meet our pledge,'' Mr. Boehner said late Tuesday night in a prepared statement. ''This is what can happen when you have an actual plan and submit it for independent review -- which the Democrats who run Washington have refused to do.''
Almost as soon as Mr. Boehner introduced his plan, Republican party leaders faced a barrage of criticism that the cuts were not nearly deep enough.
Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader, tried to spur his members to support their leaders. Mr. Cantor told Republicans in a Tuesday morning meeting to ''stop grumbling and whining and to come together as conservatives and rally behind'' Mr. Boehner's plan.
But others argued the opposite case. Four Republican senators with Tea Party links wrote a letter to their House colleagues on Tuesday urging them to vote against the measure. The Club for Growth, which scores members on their fiscally conservative votes, came out against the plan, as did other conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of Tea Party groups around the country.
Some House members said they had already concluded that the bill was flawed.
''The burden of persuasion is pretty high,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, a Republican who does not support the bill.
The scramble for votes came on a day when the phone lines of lawmakers jammed with calls and lawmakers' Web sites frequently shut down after President Obama's plea on Monday night for Americans to call members of Congress and push for a compromise.
Dan Weiser, a spokesman for the House's chief administrative officer, said the calls spiked at midday when members' offices received about 40,000 phone calls -- roughly double a normal hour's call volume.
''I have had phone calls from constituents all across the Third District suggesting we raise taxes,'' said Representative Steve Womack, Republican of Arkansas. ''But this economy is too fragile.''
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, waiting to see how Mr. Boehner's measure fares, has not brought his own debt legislation to the floor.
Mr. Reid's proposal would raise the debt ceiling through 2012 and cut $1.2 trillion from federal agency budgets and recurring programs like agriculture subsidies. Like some earlier Republican plans, the plan also counts about $1 trillion in savings from winding down combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
''Speaker Boehner's plan is not a compromise,'' Mr. Reid said, after meeting with Senate Democrats, referring to the earlier version of the bill. ''It was written for the Tea Party and not the American people. Democrats will not vote for it. Democrats will not vote for it. It's dead on arrival in the Senate, if they get it out of the House.''
Before Mr. Boehner postponed the vote on his measure, the White House had sent a two-sentence message to Congress, saying that if the Boehner bill landed on Mr. Obama's desk, ''the president's senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.''
Although Wall Street analysts and some Republicans expressed doubt that time would really run out on Aug. 2, leading to a possible default, the White House said that Treasury's estimate of the deadline was not a charade.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ''has exercised all the wiggle room available to him,'' said Jay Carney, the White House spokesman.
Moody's Investor Service warned mutual fund clients that the impasse was threatening money market mutual funds. ''Direct risks include the potential for a missed interest or principal payment on government bonds for a short period of time, as well as incremental weakening of the overall credit quality of money-market fund portfolios that have U.S. government exposure,'' the ratings company, based in New York, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Analysts Unsure of Date U.S. Would Reach Debt Limit

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It turns out the federal government is sitting on some extra cash.
Thanks to an inflow of tax payments and maneuvering by the Treasury Department, the government can probably continue to pay all of its bills for several days after Aug. 2, providing potentially critical breathing room for Congress to raise the debt ceiling, according to estimates by several Wall Street banks and a Washington research organization. 
The consensus is that the government will not run short of money until Aug. 10, when it would be unable to cut millions of Social Security checks without borrowing more money.
President Obama has described Aug. 2 as a ''hard deadline'' for Congress to increase the maximum amount that the government is allowed to borrow.
''We have to do it by next Tuesday, Aug. 2, or else we won't be able to pay all of our bills,'' Mr. Obama told the nation in his speech on Monday night.
Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, restated that position on Tuesday.
''That's not a guess. That's not a political opinion,'' Mr. Carney said. ''It is the judgment of career analysts at the Treasury Department. We give up our borrowing authority without action by Congress. And the result of that risks default for the United States for the first time in our history.''
That description, however, conflates two distinct events.
The government will exhaust its ability to borrow more money on Aug. 2, which is equivalent to maxing out a credit card. But there still will be cash in the federal wallet.
Some Republicans have expressed skepticism about the Aug. 2 deadline, describing it as an artificial line drawn by the Obama administration for political reasons. Analysts emphasize, however, that the deadline is real; it's just the date that is inexact.
''Should policy makers wait till Aug. 10 to come to an agreement? If they can agree sooner, absolutely not. There are no definites in this case,'' analysts for Barclays Capital wrote in a note to clients entitled ''Is August 2 really 'August 2'?''
Analysts also said that all of the estimates, including those from Treasury, were necessarily inexact, because they relied on variables like incoming tax payments. That means each passing day without a deal increases the risk that money will run out.
''This is more like predicting the weather than predicting the sunrise,'' said Jay Powell of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit in Washington that has analyzed the issue.
There are other risks in waiting. The Treasury must continue to repay debts as they come due, then borrow the same amounts anew. Officials are concerned that it will become harder to find investors for United States government securities, and that remaining buyers will demand higher interest rates.
The Treasury plans to auction about $87 billion in short-term securities next Monday and Tuesday. The following week it plans to hold a much larger auction of long-term debt.
All told, the government plans to borrow almost $500 billion in August. If interest rates climb by even a tenth of a percentage point, the annual cost would rise by $500 million.

HEADLINE: Risk-Free Assets, Undermined

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan acknowledged that the financial crisis pulled the rug out from under 40 years of market ideology to expose a ''flaw'' in his thinking. The United States' tottering AAA credit rating may do the same to investors the world over.
America's credit faces a downgrade even if Congress can strike a fiscal deal with President Obama. Some European countries could, in time, suffer a similar fate as a result of the Greek bailout. If the pool of liquid assets plausibly considered ''risk-free'' was on the wane, it would undermine a broad area of investment thinking. 
A ''risk-free return'' is central to much modern financial theory. The widely embraced capital asset pricing model, for example, produces its ''investment frontier'' by assuming that risky investments can be combined with those without any theoretical risk to produce the appropriate blend for a desired return.
Similarly, the Sharpe ratio evaluates securities and portfolios by their excess return over that of a risk-free investment, enabling managers to determine whether they are paid adequately for their risk. In options theory, the popular Black-Scholes model assumes an ability to ''delta hedge'' an option by trading in the underlying security, and then either borrowing the cost of buying or investing the proceeds of selling at the same risk-free rate.
Banks and regulators confront a similar conundrum. Risk management theory assumes the possibility of eliminating risk from portions of a balance sheet. The Basel bank regulatory program weights Treasury securities of governments that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at zero.
If the risk-free status quo gets upended, the complexities of remodeling would be considerable. At first, investors and other market participants might simply treat AA American bonds the same way they do ones currently rated AAA. But that philosophy wouldn't necessarily hold, especially if the country's credit further weakened.
Banks and hedge funds could require greater amounts of capital. Widely used strategies to exploit gaps between short-term and long-term rates would be less profitable. Bigger spreads in option markets might appear as investors adjusted for the differential between borrowing and lending costs. There would be many more unintended, and potentially painful, consequences. But exposing ''risk-free'' for the illusion that it is would nevertheless correct another major flaw.
Petrobras Disappoints
For all its promise, Brazil's oil bounty has so far disappointed investors. Petrobras, the state-controlled giant, has trailed rivals by a wide margin since the Brazilian government forced it to pay through the nose for offshore oil reserves nearly a year ago. Now the company is trying to make amends by trimming unpopular refining spending and lifting output goals. The pledges deserve skepticism.
It has been a grim 10 months since Petrobras raised $70 billion in the biggest share offering ever. Its 15 percent stock price decline has been particularly abysmal considering the 50 percent surge in the price of Brent crude. This has propelled shares of peers like Exxon Mobil by about 40 percent.
Petrobras's punishment is understandable. In its September 2010 offering, the government grossly overcharged for new oil wells, transferring billions of dollars of value away from shareholders. It also promised $74 billion of capital investment in refining over five years, which seemed aimed at creating jobs rather than generating returns.
The latest five-year plan at least suggests Petrobras is not entirely deaf to such concerns. Extracting Brazil's vast deep-sea trove will be allotted a higher percentage of the $225 billion capital spending budget. Refining will get $3 billion less over five years.
Petrobras also appears to be disavowing any plans to issue new shares -- no small mercy after increasing the tally about 50 percent last year. And in an uncharacteristic nod to fiscal responsibility, the company is also talking about $13.5 billion in asset sales.
Still, these look like baby steps considering Petrobras's dismal valuation. It's trading at just 55 percent of net asset value, as estimated by IHS, an energy consultancy, down from about 80 percent before its offering and compared with 70 percent for Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
Petrobras's credibility is further dented by stretching its 2020 production goals to 6.4 million barrels of oil a day from the 5.4 million barrels many analysts already considered overambitious. Investors have been burned once by Petrobras. Until the company actually delivers on some of its promises, a discount is warranted.

HEADLINE: A Decision for Clean Air

 BODY:
Federal mandates under the 1970 Clean Air Act have produced cleaner cars, fuels and factories, significantly improving the air Americans breathe. Yet the underlying standards setting limits on ground-level ozone, the main component of harmful smog, have remained unchanged since 1997 -- even as science has made it abundantly clear that the standard is still not strong enough to protect public health. 
The Environmental Protection Agency has drawn up new and tighter rules, but the final decision rests with President Obama. The White House is under relentless pressure from industry and some legislators to keep the current rules. Mr. Obama should support the agency.
The new rules would force large sections of the country to produce new cleanup plans to reduce pollution, requiring new investment in cleaner power plants and factories. ''This is a jobs election. These are job killers,'' John Engler, the former Michigan governor, said last week as he and his colleagues on the Business Roundtable pressed their case with the White House.
Mr. Engler is wrong. Costs almost always turn out to be more manageable than industry forecasts, and new investments can mean more jobs, not fewer. The main issue is health, not jobs. The E.P.A. has a clear obligation under the law (reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2001) to set standards protecting public health ''with an adequate margin of safety,'' based on the latest science.
The current ozone standards -- 80 parts per billion -- were set in 1997 by Carol Browner, then President Bill Clinton's E.P.A. administrator, after a similarly ferocious battle with industry. It was the best Ms. Browner could get at the time. Within a decade, new research showed that harmful respiratory effects occur at much lower levels. Experts began calling for a much more protective standard of between 60 parts to 70 parts per billion.
True to its practice of ignoring politically inconvenient science, the administration of George W. Bush set the standard at 75 parts per billion in 2008. This was immediately challenged in court by public health groups. Lisa Jackson, the current E.P.A. administrator, has now asked the White House to let her set the standard between 60 parts and 70 parts per billion, consistent with the science. Setting the number at the lower end of the range would obviously do the most good.
The White House is nervous about critics who claim that that E.P.A. is issuing too many new rules -- on greenhouse gases, fuel economy standards and toxic pollutants like mercury. All of these rules are overdue, and protecting the environment and public health is the agency's job. President Obama cannot allow politics to trump science.

HEADLINE: Iowa Polling to Test Paul's Move From Fringe to Mainstream

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- Representative Ron Paul has a message for the ardent followers who read his books with a highlighter and donate to his fund-raising ''money bombs'' on the Internet: Winning the Iowa Straw Poll next month would ''rock the establishment.''
Mr. Paul's libertarian views have moved from the fringe toward the mainstream of conservative thinking in the past several years, with his warnings about fiscal meltdown gaining new resonance and the 2008 financial crisis allowing him to press his longstanding critiques of the Federal Reserve. 
Now, as he again seeks the Republican presidential nomination, he is hoping to show that he can translate the new attention into votes. And his first test is the straw poll next month, where he is hoping he can organize his band of followers into a political machine capable of beating some or all of his brand-name rivals.
Even if he does not win, a strong showing by Mr. Paul could dent the campaigns of other candidates, especially Tim Pawlenty and Representative Michele Bachmann.
The straw poll, to be held in Ames on Aug. 13, is, if nothing else, a closely watched test of organizing capabilities and an early rehearsal for the Iowa caucuses after the turn of the year. Particularly for candidates needing to raise their profiles, it is an opportunity to exhibit credibility and win media attention and donors.
Mr. Paul, of Texas, has a number of factors going for him. He has a legion of passionate supporters, many of them young, who in the past have flooded other straw polls that he has won.
His effort in Iowa is well financed. His latest online fund-raiser, ''Ready, Ames, Fire,'' brought in $550,000, added to the $4.5 million he raised in the second quarter.
The money has bought time for radio and television spots, for six paid staff members in the state and to fly in Mr. Paul by private jet (''Operation Top Gun'') for weekly rallies, including two he attended Monday here and in Ames.
''Doing well in Iowa means activating volunteers,'' said Jesse Benton, his national campaign chairman. ''Reaching out and touching 100 Iowans at a time.''
The campaign outbid all others and paid $31,000 to claim the most central spot at the straw poll for its supporters. The event is a daylong political midway with bands and barbecue on the campus of Iowa State University. Mr. Paul is offering a bus ride from anywhere in the state, plus lunch for $10.
Phil Luetchford, 24, an engineer who left Mr. Paul's appearance here at a Marriott hotel carrying a half-dozen Ron Paul lawn signs, plans to drive with co-workers and church members to Ames. ''I'm really upset about the bailouts,'' Mr. Luetchford said. ''I don't understand how the elite can choose who stays in business.''
Another volunteer, who asked not to be named because he has taken a 30-day leave from the military to campaign, which is discouraged, said: ''Ron Paul tells his supporters, come and support him in the straw poll, and we come because we will walk through fire to vote for Ron Paul. He speaks to us.''
When asked how Mr. Paul, a 75-year-old former obstetrician who still has the manner of a folksy country doctor, speaks to a much younger generation, many cite his decades as a Cassandra warning about ruinous federal debt.
''I'm the one who has to pay the bills,'' said Ben Kmack, 30, a professional diver, who heard Mr. Paul speak in Ames.
Mr. Paul dismissed the debt ceiling crisis embroiling Washington as a nonissue. The government is already bankrupt, in his view, and disguises it by printing money. ''There's no way the checks aren't going out to Social Security,'' he told the crowd. ''The real question is what is the money going to buy when you get it.''
Many audience questions were technical, posed by people who knew his views well: As president, could he issue an executive order to make the Federal Reserve exchange gold for dollars? How quickly could he abolish the Fed altogether?
If the specifics of his monetary views are still unconventional, if not outright dismissed by most economists, his broad critique of a bloated government that needs to shrink to avoid catastrophe has become widely accepted in the Republican Party. His argument that many of the activities taken on by the federal government are illegal under the Constitution is a tenet of the Tea Party.
''In 2007 people laughed at him,'' said A. J. Spiker, a vice chairman of the Paul campaign in Iowa. ''John McCain and others laughed at these ideas. A lot of candidates are now echoing what Ron Paul says.''
Mr. Spiker is one of four Paul supporters elected to the Iowa Republican Party Central Committee, the largest bloc for any candidate, a sign of reawakened populism in the heartland, with its distrust of central bankers and bureaucrats.
While Mr. Paul says publicly that he will ''hopefully come in first'' in the straw poll, his campaign insiders talk about a Top-3 finish. If he beats Mrs. Bachmann, of Minnesota, or Mr. Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor, both of whom are barnstorming around Iowa with the same focus, it could undermine their campaigns.
Mr. Paul is also prepared to have a strong finish discounted by those wedded to the idea that he is a fringe figure. ''I heard somebody said if I come in first that proves the Ames straw vote has no value, and if I come in fifth that proves Ron Paul can't do it,'' he said in an interview.
Whether his loyal core of activists can entice thousands of other Iowans to turn up remains to be seen. One positive development for him is that his crowds are different from those of four years ago -- more diverse in age and in their political views.
Charlotte Coppess, 57, voted for Mike Huckabee, the winner, in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. Mr. Paul held no interest for her then. But she was curious to hear what he had to say here.
''I think Ron Paul is a man whose time has come,'' Ms. Coppess said.

HEADLINE: Raul Castro Again Offers No Speech At a Rally

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
CIEGO DE AVILA, Cuba -- For the second year in a row, Raul Castro left the rhetoric to his vice president.
Mr. Castro waved to the crowd gathered here on Tuesday in the countryside for the annual rite of a revolutionary holiday. But as was the case last year, the actual message -- calling on Cubans to work harder and accelerate economic reforms -- came from a party stalwart who fought at his side during the rebellion.
''We have to definitively break the mentality of inertia,'' said Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, standing before a sign praising ''the victory of ideas.'' Instead of emphasizing what they lack, he added, Cubans must ''evaluate how much more can be done with what is available.'' 
The event celebrating the attack on the Moncada barracks in 1953 -- the public debut of a rebel movement that toppled President Fulgencio Batista six year later -- offered yet another example of the revised socialism that has come to characterize Mr. Castro's government. While his older brother Fidel used speeches to rally the country with an absolutist moral vision, casting Cuba as hero and the United States as a villain, Raul Castro has spoken less often and emphasized current needs.
Expert say this is partly a matter of urgency. The world economic crisis plunged Cuba into an abyss not seen here since the years after the Soviet Union collapsed. And even before that, this island of 11 million people had been suffering from decades of economic deterioration. Many Cubans, especially in Havana, say the reforms Raul Castro has been rolling out since officially taking over in 2008 are at least 20 years overdue.
Nonetheless, the changes in content and approach are significant. The most visible shift so far has been an effort to re-engineer employment. Cuba has opened up nearly 200 professions to limited private enterprise, and in the past year, the government says, the ranks of the self-employed have doubled to 325,000.
The flood of interest is especially visible in Havana. Handwritten signs on creaking colonial doors now advertise items for sale, like baby shoes and pork chops. New private restaurants also seem to be opening almost every day -- which, in a country still dominated by centralized control and limited resources, has led to other problems.
Cubans now complain, for instance, that competition is increasing prices for basic items like food and construction materials, which are typically bought on the black market (after being stolen from state distributors).
In his 25-minute speech, Mr. Machado acknowledged some of these obstacles. An octogenarian hunched slightly with age and wearing a white guayabera, he criticized pilfering and the misuse of resources. Addressing a crowd of a few thousand, he called on Cubans to live according to the values that now appear on new billboards featuring Raul Castro: ''Order, discipline and rigor.''
But experts say the government is struggling with a more fundamental question: How much can be changed, and how quickly, to create economic growth without chaos?
''The reform plan has lots of moving, interdependent parts and in many ways the key task is sequencing,'' said Philip Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute.
Mr. Peters and other analysts said Mr. Castro's government seemed to recognize that timing was as important as substance. In a surprise move to many Cuba watchers, Raul, as he is called here, seems to have expanded the role of feedback and adjustments.
''I wouldn't say he is more of a democrat, but he has a management style that is much more pragmatic,'' said Ted Henken, a professor of Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York. ''He wants things to work.''
In some cases, that has meant backtracking. ''For example, last fall the government announced that by this past spring, the state sector would shed a half-million workers,'' Mr. Peters said. Then came public resistance. Now, Mr. Peters said, ''the layoffs are proceeding, but slower than that, much slower. This seems to reflect a decision that job creation comes first.''
Mr. Castro's government has also announced that there will soon be other changes. Political liberties are not included, beyond a promise to let Cubans travel abroad more easily. But Mr. Castro is expected to speak when Parliament opens in August, where he may more fully outline plans for a major change to private property laws, which would allow the purchase and sale of real estate and cars.
Many Cubans seem uncertain about whether to trust that the government will be able to manage all the new laws and impacts. ''It's complicated'' has become the common phrase ending discussions on what amounts to a new social contract in a country where very little is new. Others, however, insist that there is still too much talk and not enough action.
''We're still in crisis,'' said Enrique Suarez, 50, as he prepared for the July 26 festivities.
His friend, Belkis Fernandez, put it just as plainly: ''It's still bad.''

HEADLINE: After Aiding Republicans, Business Groups Press Them on Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent millions of dollars last year helping elect Republicans to Congressional seats, is struggling to convince the House it helped to build that the debt ceiling must be increased.
The chamber and other business groups have pressed with increasing urgency for Congress to raise the maximum amount that the government can borrow. They have cataloged the consequences of default at meetings, parties and dinners and over drinks.
On Tuesday, the chamber threw its weight behind the proposal of the House speaker, John A. Boehner, telling recalcitrant Republicans that a pending vote on the plan was a with-us-or-against-us moment that would be remembered during the next election campaign.
But as the government runs out of money, those efforts have not produced the desired result. The freshman class of House Republicans, along with longer-serving members, is balking at Mr. Boehner's plan, let alone anything that Senate Democrats and the White House might be willing to accept. 
The tension highlights the distance between the pro-business stalwarts of the traditional Republican Party and the populism of its newer representatives, many of whom seem to view Wall Street and Washington with equal suspicion.
''I think they're very pleased with the antigovernment inclinations of the Tea Party Republicans when it comes to taxes and regulation,'' said David Axelrod, one of the president's chief political advisers. ''But now we have a situation where the integrity of the economy and the U.S. financial system is at stake, and they're being hoisted on their own petards.''
The chamber and its allies say that they remain confident that Congress will act to raise the debt ceiling, and moreover that they have supported the demands of House Republicans that the government should be allowed to borrow more only if it starts spending less.
''There's nothing more important for financial stability than getting the debt ceiling raised and putting our nation on a prudent financial path, a message we have been delivering to lawmakers for weeks,'' said Rob Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum, which has joined with the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers to press the issue.
The manufacturers' association joined the chamber on Tuesday in endorsing the Boehner plan, which the White House has described as unacceptable because it allows only enough borrowing room to pay the government's bills until early next year, when a new agreement would be required.
The chamber made a big splash during the midterm elections with advertisements that attacked Democratic incumbents, particularly those who supported the president's health care legislation, for being antibusiness. It issued endorsements describing their Republican opponents as ''invaluable'' leaders on business issues who would support economic growth.
Among the beneficiaries was Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican. The chamber spent $250,000 on ads blasting the Democratic incumbent, Representative Alan Grayson. Mr. Webster won.
In July, Mr. Webster introduced legislation instructing the Treasury to prioritize interest payments, then military spending, then Social Security checks, then Medicare payments, ''in the event the debt ceiling is reached.'' Experts regard the idea as unworkable.
The chamber spent $436,953 helping to elect Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, almost 20 percent of the total that he was able to raise and spend on his own.
This month, Mr. Pearce told the radio program ''News New Mexico'' that cutting federal spending was just as important as increasing the debt ceiling.
''We have talked a lot about Armageddon if we don't pass the debt ceiling,'' he said. ''There's an equal Armageddon on the other side if we don't start curing the spending problems.''
In May, the chamber gave $2,000 to Representative Patrick Meehan, a Pennsylvania Republican already building up a war chest for the 2012 campaign.
A few weeks later, Mr. Meehan said he was ''hopeful that we will reach an agreement that stops our massive borrowing and reckless spending without risking a default.''
It has been clear since last fall that the government would hit the debt ceiling, the legal maximum that it can borrow, at some point during 2011. In May, the Treasury said that it had reached the legal limit and that it would begin to cancel obligations to other parts of the government, allowing it to borrow enough money to pay all of the government's bills until early August.
The president asked Congress to increase the limit. House Republicans refused unanimously, insisting that Democrats first agree to cut spending by the same amount.
Business groups stayed mostly on the sidelines for months. The chamber orchestrated a May letter from business groups to political leaders calling for an agreement. In July, the groups sent a second letter, this time signed by several hundred chief executives. It was nothing in comparison with the efforts the same groups have made in recent years to oppose legislation on health care and financial regulation, or their recent advocacy in support of free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.
One reason for the relative silence was the assumption that the ceiling would be raised. Even now, there is widespread confidence that the parties will strike a deal -- a state of affairs most clearly reflected in the ease with which the government continues to borrow money from investors.
''Also you don't want to be on the wrong side,'' said Tom Block, the longtime head of government relations for JPMorgan Chase and now a private consultant. ''They had the confidence that this is going to be resolved without their participation, so why participate?''
Another difference has been the absence of a piece of legislation to hail or hammer.
Mr. Axelrod said business groups were constrained by their desire to win the support of House freshmen on other issues, including the trade agreements and efforts to roll back regulation.
''I just think that there was, at least on the part of the chamber, a reluctance to tangle with, or pressure, the same group in the House that they're depending on to gut financial reform and undo environmental regulation and so on,'' he said. ''But I think the gravity of the situation is now clear.''
Business groups disputed that characterization, but agreed with the conclusion.
''We've worked with the broader business community over the last month,'' said Aric Newhouse, senior vice president for government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It's the right thing to do to provide certainty for the country and the economy.''
J. P. Fielder, a spokesman for the chamber, said it the group was encouraging members to address the debt ceiling so they could return to other issues.

HEADLINE: Not O.K. At the O.K. Corral

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
So we'll never go back to the future?
A group of physicists at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have revealed time travel to be more fiction than science.
They have released a research report proving that a single photon, a unit of light, cannot exceed the speed of light, as time-travel conjurers from H.G. Wells to Rod Serling to Woody Allen had hoped.
The physicists determined for the first time that the photon follows Einstein's theory that the speed of light is ''the traffic law of the universe,'' and that nothing can travel faster than light. 
So if President Obama is fantasizing about climbing Marty McFly-style into a juiced-up DeLorean and going back to a more civilized, productive era when America wasn't an over-the-hill deadbeat and when Washington wasn't a shrieking, destructive, primal, feudal, apocalyptic wasteland of partisan banshees, he's out of luck. Or science.
For half a century, our trust in government has been falling off a cliff. Some presidential elections have been more about voting against somebody rather than for somebody. There were upticks in faith when Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton delivered prosperity.
But now trust levels are drooping even lower. The public has less faith in Congress than Wall Street, and that's saying something. Most Americans either feel that government is broken or that the fix is in, so that special interests and a handful of people at the top are the only ones benefiting.
The last century was the American century. But this one will not be, thanks to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, who used their boots and spurs to ride roughshod over the globe and American economy. They spent eight years and trillions of dollars either barging into stuff they should have left alone or leaving alone stuff they should have intervened on.
W. accomplished the impossible: He made the Daddy Party less quick-draw. Republicans' isolationist wing is stronger now because some conservatives and libertarians don't want to pay to stumble into endless, pointless wars.
Still, if the epic budget battle being waged on the Potomac is our own version of the Harrison Ford-Daniel Craig movie ''Cowboys & Aliens'' -- where our favorite American myths collide -- the Republicans will want to be the cowboys.
How else can they continue to paint the president as an aloof, intellectually arrogant, pointy-eared alien?
President Spock, who so sparingly makes emotional connections, felt he had a real one with John Boehner. Chomping Nicorette through the stressful negotiations, Obama actually grew fond of the old-school Republican speaker puffing on cigarettes.
An alien and a cowboy, trying to connect on a fairway rather than a frontier and save America from a credit rating that would be alarmingly comparable to mine.
The Republican ''Taliban wing,'' as some Democrats dub the rabid Tea Party militants, was determined to break up any budding Obama-Boehner bromance.
Shockingly, the president was left waiting by the phone one day last week while the speaker would not take or return his calls. At some point, Obama, the jilted lover, simply gave up and went to bed.
The White House feels that its foes not only want to stomp on any reasonable compromise; they want to make sure that Obama never has the presidency he dreamed of, one that isn't about digging out from W.'s intractable messes; one that helps the parties reason together and move into the future.
Obama, after all, is a new entity. He's not really a Democratic president. Or a Republican one. He's the first Independent president, creating his own party.
''Obama's interests are not the same as the Democrats in Congress in terms of what he needs to do for his own agenda, election and legacy,'' said one Democratic strategist, who notes that now the president can benefit from an obstructionist Republican House as a foil.
White House officials dryly joke that the president's ''sweet spot'' is his ability to alienate his base and infuriate his foes while falling short of his goals.
Republicans, growing more optimistic in the last 90 days that they can make Obama a one-term president, want to use the budget battle to mark him not only as alien, but too weak to run cowboy nation.
You could argue that Obama created his own nightmare by failing to read the class rage of the public and aggressively cut government fat as soon as he came into office. His passivity allowed the Tea Party to rise, fed by fury over Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats stuffing pork into the 2009 stimulus package.
But whatever the criticisms of Obama, it's Republicans who are overtly playing politics. Even though Obama compromises ridiculously easily, the Republicans are showing no willingness to compromise at all.
There's only one thing we can predict about the outcome of this high-noon summer showdown: Trust in government will continue to crater.

HEADLINE: The Continuing Impasse Over the Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Congress in the Lead,'' by David Brooks (column, July 26):
The speech I heard President Obama give Monday night was far from a ''campaign speech.'' Rather, I heard a president imploring citizens to use their ''people power'' to cut through the intransigence and the embarrassing debacle in Washington about an issue that, in any other administration, would be routine: raising the debt ceiling.
Mr. Brooks writes, ''The Old Guard wins.'' Hardly. Were there an ''Old Guard'' in charge, the debt ceiling would have been raised six months ago and not tied to spending, a separate issue entirely. 
VICTORIA C. BOND New York, July 26, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''The Republican Wreckage'' (editorial, July 26): Let's get this right. The same party that robustly supported the ill-advised and costly invasion of Iraq while passing a tax cut for the ''can you believe our luck'' wealthiest is now on a campaign to cut government spending -- the bigger the cuts the better, and no revenue increases.
Of course, the spending cuts that House Republicans are keen on will affect millions of Americans who are now unemployed, or in college or without adequate medical care. And they will hurt an economic recovery that is, at best, sputtering.
What the Republicans are thinly masquerading as wise governing is in fact an agenda that is supremely destructive to the well-being of the nation.
FELICIA MASSARSKY Hoboken, N.J., July 26, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''The Party That Can't Say Yes'' (editorial, July 23):
You state that ''it was Speaker John A. Boehner who torpedoed the talks.''
The speaker and President Obama had a deal, and in the 11th hour the president demanded another $400 billion in revenue increases, which you refer to as ''a paltry $400 billion.''
Is $400 billion ''paltry'' when the original deal on revenue increases was for $800 billion?
So who torpedoed the talks?
You call the president's demeanor at his subsequent press conference ''righteous fury.'' I call it arrogance. I see a president creating a poisonous atmosphere by insulting his negotiating partners by taking the position that he is the only adult in the room.
Let the president identify one specific program that he is willing to cut.
So who can't say yes?
HARVEY SHERMAN Plainview, N.Y., July 23, 2011
To the Editor:
It is simply mind-numbing to watch the national psychodrama that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has dragged us through for the last month.
It is hard, actually painful, to hear once again how Speaker John A. Boehner refused to accept President Obama's overly generous, politically risky offer to make major cuts in both Medicare and Social Security over a difference of $400 billion in additional tax revenue over 10 years.
Whatever happened to splitting the difference as the basis of negotiation and compromise? That an ideologically rigid minority of Tea Party House Republicans is willing to sacrifice the nation's well-being on the altar of ''no new taxes'' is a tragic commentary on our political dysfunction.

HEADLINE: Washington's Folly: The crisis is rooted in Republicans' denial of reality

 BODY:
How can so many Republican lawmakers justify pushing their country toward catastrophic default just to score ideological points? The answer can be found in their statements and writings: They are constructing an alternative reality far different from that of most Americans.
A large number of Republican lawmakers, for example, simply don't accept that the United States is going to be in default as of Tuesday. (Wall Street banks say the nation will run out of money within a few days of that date.) 
The Treasury Department, which keeps the government bankbook, set the Aug. 2 deadline, but they say it cannot be trusted because it is an arm of the Obama administration. Representative Joe Walsh, a freshman from Illinois, recorded an instantly notorious video in which he accused President Obama of ''lying'' about the dangers of default. ''There's plenty of money to pay off our debt and cover all of our Social Security obligations,'' he said, without saying where all these billions might be hidden.
Representative Michele Bachmann, the Tea Partier running for president, went even further, saying there would be no default at all because the government would always find a way to pay the interest on its debt. Her level of disbelief in any statement made by the White House is so complete that she disregarded the possibility that the global financial system could impose its own devastating downgrade on the government's obligations.
Mrs. Bachmann's denial of economic reality puts her at the far-right end of the House, alongside eight other Republicans who voted against the ''Cut, Cap and Balance Act'' last week because it was too liberal. More typical are those who are sticking by that bill and its balanced-budget amendment, though the Senate effectively rejected it.
Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads an influential group of House conservatives, said he is willing to go down with the cut, cap and balance ship even if default is the only option, since he, too, is not persuaded that the Treasury is telling the truth. He and several members of his Republican Study Committee said Tuesday they could not support Speaker John Boehner's watered-down version of ''cut, cap,'' because it does not require passage of a balanced-budget amendment before the debt ceiling can go up.
(In Mr. Boehner's alternative reality, by the way, it just popped into Mr. Obama's head to ask for ''the largest debt increase in American history, on the heels of the largest spending binge in American history.'' The president was required to ask for an increase by law, and the spending was mostly incurred by his Republican predecessor.)
Mr. Jordan's words offered one of the best explanations of the House's determination to beat Mr. Obama at any cost. A former state champion wrestler, he told The National Review that in politics you pin your opponent whenever possible. ''We want to get the win now,'' he said.
House members have been encouraged in their destructive daydream by many outside organizations and Web sites. An arm of the Heritage Foundation sent out a letter Tuesday saying the government should live under the current debt ceiling rather than pass the Boehner plan, ignoring the need to raise the ceiling to pay for bills already incurred. Several right-wing bloggers, notably Erick Erickson of RedState, have threatened brimstone on any errant Republican lawmaker who even considers compromise with the president.
If the economy does begin to crumble next week, the trail back toward the reason will not be hard to follow.

HEADLINE: Negotiators Nearing Deal On Mileage For Vehicles

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Obama administration and automakers are nearing an agreement to increase fuel economy standards for vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, a lower target than the White House had sought. 
The administration had earlier proposed a goal of 56.2 miles per gallon, while Detroit automakers and Michigan lawmakers have been pushing for a lower standard.
But people close to the talks said Tuesday that some automakers were now willing to support a 54.5 m.p.g. rule, particularly because the ramp-up period is less aggressive for light trucks than for passenger cars. The new proposal would almost double the current fuel-efficiency standards of about 27.8 m.p.g.
The talks among the administration, automakers, environmental groups and California officials have been continuing for weeks, as the various sides grappled with how to reduce global warming emissions, cut fuel consumption and reduce the costs that consumers pay at the pump.
The new administration proposal calls for increasing fuel efficiency for light trucks by 3.5 percent annually from 2017 to 2021. It would then be increased by 5 percent a year from 2022 to 2025.
Passenger cars would need to become 5 percent more efficient every year over the entire eight-year span of the standard.
In 2009, automakers agreed to an administration plan to increase fuel economy to about 35 m.p.g. by 2016.
The proposed standard has the potential to curtail vehicle emissions drastically and reduce the nation's dependence on oil. However, industry groups have argued that the changes could add thousands of dollars to the price of new vehicles in the showroom.
There was no immediate comment from the White House on Tuesday, but people familiar with the discussions said the talks appeared to be nearing a conclusion.
''We are encouraged by the strong, positive feedback we are receiving from many companies and look forward to wrapping up the discussions in the near future,'' said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing.
One item still under intense discussion is the so-called midterm review of the standard. Environmentalists were concerned that a review stipulation could allow automakers to circumvent increases in fuel efficiency in the latter stages of the agreement.
''Until the White House provides us the full details, we are not in a position to assess whether this a strong proposal or whether there are any significant flaws,'' said Roland Hwang, the transportation program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.
A spokesman for General Motors, Greg Martin, said the nation's largest auto company was optimistic that an agreement could be reached that balanced the economic concerns of the industry with the goal of reducing fuel consumption.

HEADLINE: Washington's Folly: One plan to cut spending is merely bad, the other is awful

 BODY:
With only days to go before the deadline to raise the debt limit or face national default, there are two plans on the table: the Reid plan endorsed by President Obama; and the Boehner plan, which Mr. Obama has suggested he would veto it if ever reaches his desk.
The plans each call for cutting federal spending by trillions of dollars over the next 10 years without bringing in any additional revenue. They are a choice between bad and worse. Americans will inevitably be harmed as government programs are cut sooner than they should be in this weak economy and far deeper than they need to be because of the Republicans' refusal to accept any tax increases -- even on the wealthiest Americans. 
If this debate were really about fixing the deficit, Congress would start over. What the country needs to get its fiscal house in order, without stalling the fragile recovery, is increased relief-and-recovery spending in the near term, coupled with a credible plan for deficit reduction -- including spending cuts and tax increases in equal measure -- to be implemented as the economy recovers.
Unfortunately, that is not where Congress is heading. If the country is going to avoid default, Congress and the White House are going to have to agree on a plan that does the least possible harm. Here is a look at the choices:
THE REID PLAN This is the less objectionable of the two mainly because it would extend the debt limit through 2012, avoiding a replay of brinkmanship next year. It at least holds out the possibility of future tax increases.
It would cut the deficit by $2.7 trillion over the next 10 years, with spending cuts alone: $1.2 trillion from reductions in discretionary programs; $1 trillion from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the rest from interest savings and other measures.
The Democrats' decision to abandon their demand for a balance of spending cuts and new revenues means that middle-class and low-income Americans -- who benefit more from spending programs -- would bear a disproportionate burden. By locking in spending cuts upfront, it relieves pressure on Republicans to agree to tax increases in future budget negotiations.
The Reid plan does not call for spending cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and other entitlements. That's a fair political trade-off given that Republicans have refused to accept tax increases. But until both sides are able to put tax increases and entitlements on the table, there will be no lasting deficit reduction.
THE BOEHNER PLAN This one is irredeemably awful. It calls for cutting $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending over 10 years and would only raise the debt limit until early next year. Then it calls for a second round of spending cuts, $1.8 trillion, which must be enacted before the debt limit is raised again.
Because the first round of cuts would eviscerate discretionary programs -- and because the plan does not count the anticipated $1 trillion in war savings -- the second round of cuts would need to come from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other safety-net programs. To get cuts that deep in 10 years would require cutting the benefits of current retirees and beneficiaries or gutting health care reform, or savaging the safety net for low-income Americans, or some combination of the three. But even all that would not be enough for some House Republicans, who were threatening as of Tuesday night to reject the plan.
There is no good compromise between bad and worse, but there is still scope for damage control. With both sides asking nothing from high-income taxpayers, they should both be willing to explicitly shield programs that serve the most vulnerable Americans. With the two sides both calling for big discretionary cuts, they should consent to phase them in gradually. And they must extend the debt limit through 2012. The country has more pressing problems to deal with.

HEADLINE: Weiner's Exit Sets Off a Race To Be Israel's Better Friend

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Assemblyman David I. Weprin, the Democratic candidate to replace former Representative Anthony D. Weiner in a special election on Sept. 13, is a Modern Orthodox Jew who keeps kosher, observes the Sabbath and has been to Israel at least eight times. So it comes as a surprise that, at this early stage of the short campaign, New York's Ninth Congressional District finds itself talking about an unlikely subject -- whether Mr. Weprin, who is unabashedly pro-Israel, is the best pro-Israel advocate.
Just as a May special election in a conservative district of western New York turned into an unexpected referendum on the Republican Party's proposals about Medicare, the coming special election in a heavily Jewish district of Brooklyn and Queens is, at least for that district, emerging as a potential referendum on President Obama's proposals about the Middle East.
''It will be a one-upsmanship on who is more pro-Israel,'' said Chris Malone, an associate professor of political science at Pace University. 
On Monday, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, endorsed the Republican candidate in the race, Bob Turner, a retired cable television executive, at a press conference at which he stood next to an Israeli flag. Mr. Koch has acknowledged that Mr. Weprin is a strong supporter of Israel, but argued that the election of Mr. Turner would serve as a rebuke to Mr. Obama for saying that Israel's pre-1967 border should be the basis for a peace agreement.
Both Mr. Weprin, 55, and Mr. Turner, 70, have criticized the president's position on Israel, and both promote their support for Israel on their campaign Web sites.
But Mr. Koch said that although he and Mr. Weprin had similar political ideals, he had concluded that Mr. Weprin could not be ''an effective messenger'' to Mr. Obama.
''I said to him that it's not a personal matter, but I want you to understand that it's an issue that's bigger than you and that's bigger than me,'' Mr. Koch said. ''The president is not likely to be offended or feel threatened by David Weprin, Democrat from Queens, saying something critical of him.''
What did Mr. Weprin think of the former mayor's concern? ''My first thought is to quote one of Mayor Koch's famous lines: 'That's ridiculous!' It's just absurd.''
Mr. Weprin and Mr. Turner are vying to represent a New York City district that includes Forest Hills and Kew Gardens in Queens, as well as parts of Flatbush and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. The district is about one-quarter Jewish.
And Jewish voters are expected to be particularly important in the special election, which is likely to have low turnout, said Jerry Skurnik, a partner at Prime New York, a political consulting firm. Mr. Skurnik said that Jewish voters tended to vote in higher percentages than the general population, and he estimated that Jewish voters made up 30 percent to 35 percent of active voters in the district.
''You definitely can't get wiped out in the Jewish vote and expect to win a district like this,'' Mr. Skurnik said.
The district is solidly Democratic, but conservative by New York standards, and Mr. Turner won 40 percent of the vote when he ran against Mr. Weiner in 2010. Mr. Weiner, who was staunchly pro-Israel, resigned after acknowledging having exchanged sexually explicit online communications with women.
Assemblyman Weprin's relationship with elements of the district's diverse Jewish community is also complicated by his vote in Albany in favor of the legalization of same-sex marriage, which is opposed by Orthodox Jewish leaders.
Dovid Z. Schwartz, an Orthodox Jewish activist from Kew Gardens, said of Mr. Weprin's same-sex marriage vote, ''To the mind of many people, the vote itself was the point of no return.'' And Mr. Schwartz also argued that because Mr. Weprin is a ''career political insider'' and of the same party as Mr. Obama, he could not be a ''fierce advocate'' pushing back against the president's Middle East policy.
''A vote against David Weprin would send a clear message to the administration that they cannot take the Jewish vote for granted,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
But the Weprin campaign argued that Mr. Obama would be more likely to listen to criticism of his Israel position from a fellow Democrat. ''If voters want to send a message to the president, they won't do it by sending another rank-and-file Tea Party extremist Republican to Congress,'' Mr. Weprin's campaign manager, Jake Dilemani, said.
Mr. Weprin is supported by the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, also an Orthodox Jew, who said Israel was ''the No. 1 concern among Jewish voters.'' But Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, dismissed the strategy of voting for Mr. Turner to send a message to Mr. Obama as ''a political game.''
''The record of David Weprin is such that there's no choice,'' he said.
Cynthia Zalisky, the executive director of the Queens Jewish Community Council, called the candidates ''admirable,'' but said that ''how these candidates feel about Israel and the president's concept of pre-1967 borders is going to resonate in this district.''
Both Mr. Turner and Mr. Weprin's camps are trying to play down the importance of Israel as a campaign issue, while simultaneously burnishing their credentials on Israel.
In an e-mail, Mr. Turner's campaign said its candidate was focused on ''getting our economy moving again and creating jobs,'' but it criticized Mr. Obama as being ''no friend to Israel.''
Asked whether there was any difference between Mr. Turner and Mr. Weprin on Israel, Mr. Turner's spokesman said: ''David Weprin walks the party line. Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East, and it is morally and historically wrong -- and strategically unwise -- to blame Israel for the lack of peace with the Palestinians. That is what President Obama has done, and David Weprin hasn't said a peep about it.''
In a phone interview, Mr. Weprin said, ''It is very important that the United States maintains that very special relationship they have with Israel, and I would be a strong advocate for that.''
When Mr. Weprin spoke to a senior center in Queens last week, he addressed his position on Israel, but fielded more questions on financial matters.
''Everybody's mind is on the budget, the deficit, the debt ceiling, which we're backing up against, and the potential cutting of Medicare and Social Security,'' he said. ''I would say Medicare and Social Security cross all boundaries, all ethnic boundaries, and even all age groups.''
Dr. Malone, the Pace political scientist, predicted that other issues would indeed emerge in the campaign, but said the importance of the Jewish vote would remain.
''There's bigger fish to fry,'' he said, ''as long as they're fried kosher.''

HEADLINE: India, Citing Inflation Fears, Raises Interest Rates Again

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- The central bank of India raised its benchmark interest rates more than expected on Tuesday, saying that it was far more concerned about inflation than it was about slowing economic growth.
The Reserve Bank of India raised its repo rate, the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks, by 0.5 percentage point, to 8 percent, its 11th increase since October 2009. Most analysts were expecting an increase of 0.25 point.
''Policy needs to persist with a firm anti-inflationary stance'' to counter inflation of nearly 9 percent, the central bank said, noting that while economic growth had moderated, ''there is no evidence of a sharp or broad-based slowdown as yet.'' 
The benchmark Nifty 50-stock index fell 1.9 percent Tuesday. The Indian rupee climbed modestly against the dollar.
The Reserve Bank of India's move is likely to slow one of the fastest-growing major emerging economies at a time when growth also appears to be easing in developed economies like Europe, Japan and the United States. Policy makers in China, another major fast-growing emerging market, are also trying to cool the economy amid inflation concerns.
''We certainly have a far more hawkish central bank than we had six or seven months back, when there was a conscious effort to balance growth and inflation,'' said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, a large Indian lender.
The Indian economy expanded at a rate of 8.5 percent in its last fiscal year, which ended in March. Some analysts say growth could slow to 7.5 percent in the current business year. The central bank held to its own forecast of 8 percent growth on Tuesday.
In its statement, the central bank was clear that it remained focused on bringing down India's inflation rate, one of the highest in the world. In May, India's consumer price index climbed 8.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, down from 9.4 percent in April.
The central bank said it would like to limit inflation to 4 to 5 percent.
''Several indicators such as exports and imports, indirect tax collections, corporate sales and earnings, and demand for bank credit suggest that demand is moderating, but only gradually,'' the central bank said. ''As such, demand side inflationary pressures continue to prevail.''
The policy statement appears to put the central bank at odds with Indian fiscal policy makers, who have been emphasizing the need for faster growth and have suggested that inflation will soon subside.
Last week, the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, invited Indian reporters and editors to his office to offer assurances that the government's reform agenda had not been paralyzed by a series of corruption scandals and that the economy would indeed grow 8.5 percent, down from a previous government forecast of 9 percent.
In its statement Tuesday, the central bank subtly sought to put the onus for the persistently high inflation on the government, saying it needed to do better in areas in which it has struggled to make progress.
''It is important to recognize that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore,'' the Reserve Bank of India said.
Mr. Barua of HDFC Bank said the central bank appeared to believe that it had no choice but to act more forcefully, but he warned that the high interest rates could significantly slow the economy.
''It's the monetary policy's job to pick up the slack, which worked to a point,'' he said. ''But there is every possibility of monetary policy overdoing things.''

HEADLINE: Ford Continues Profit Streak

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company on Tuesday said second-quarter earnings declined 7 percent, to $2.4 billion, from the period a year earlier, largely because of higher costs for raw materials and new product development.
But it was the ninth consecutive quarterly profit for Ford, which was to begin contract talks with the United Automobile Workers union this week. With first-half profit totaling $4.95 billion, the carmaker remains ahead of its pace in 2010, when it earned $4.7 billion in the first half and $6.6 billion for the full year. 
''We delivered very good second-quarter results, while growing the business globally and serving more customers in every region,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. ''Despite an uncertain business environment, we further strengthened our balance sheet and continued to invest for the future.''
The second-quarter profit, equal to 59 cents a share, compares with earnings of $2.6 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2010.
Revenue increased 13 percent, to $35.5 billion, and sales rose 7 percent. Automotive operating margins fell to 7 percent from 9.1 percent in the period a year earlier.
Ford's operating profit in North America was flat, at $1.9 billion. Operations in South America, Europe and Asia Pacific-Africa were profitable, but each of those regions fared worse than a year earlier.
Ford said it paid down its debt by $2.6 billion during the second quarter, to $14 billion. It ended the quarter with $22 billion in its cash reserves, an increase of $700 million from three months earlier.
Excluding special items, including personnel reductions and winding down the Mercury brand in the United States, Ford's pretax operating profit was $2.88 billion, or 65 cents a share. That figure beat Wall Street's consensus forecast of 60 cents a share, but is below the operating profit of $2.94 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Investors will be closely watching negotiations with the U.A.W. to assess their effect on Ford's profit potential in the future. The U.A.W.'s contract with each of the three Detroit carmakers expires in September.
Ford was not able to obtain no-strike pledges from the union, unlike General Motors and Chrysler, and the more money it makes, the more that workers have been clamoring for a rollback of the concessions they took in recent years.
Mr. Mulally, on a conference call with analysts Tuesday, said the results did not suggest that Ford could acquiesce to demands for higher pay and benefits. Instead, they show ''what can we do together to continue to improve the competitiveness of the business,'' he said.
Ford's chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, said the contract talks were a major hurdle to regaining an investment-grade credit rating, which would reduce the company's borrowing costs. Ford lost its investment-grade rating in 2005; its credit is currently rated two notches below that level by Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings and three levels below that by Standard and Poor's.
''We're doing everything we can to improve our business, and at some point the ratings agencies will recognize that,'' Mr. Booth told reporters at Ford's headquarters. ''We expect to get to investment grade sooner rather than later.''
The second-quarter profit is less than the $2.55 billion Ford earned in the first quarter. Ford previously warned that the first-quarter profit probably would be its largest of the year because of rising commodity and structural costs.
Mr. Booth said prices were climbing for many of the commodities Ford uses, including steel, plastics, copper and aluminum. The company was on track with its previous projection that it would have to pay about $2 billion more for materials this year than in 2010, he said.
Ford already has raised prices across its lineup three times this year, in part to compensate for the higher commodity costs.
Ford is the only one of the three Detroit carmakers to survive the recession of 2009 without filing for bankruptcy protection and taking a federal bailout.
Sales across the industry slowed in the United States during the second quarter as prices rose, partly caused by inventory shortages after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March. The seasonally adjusted, annualized selling rate dipped to 12.1 million in the second quarter from 13.1 million in the first quarter, according to the Autodata Corporation, which tracks sales.
Ford says it expects industry sales for the year to be at the lower end of its earlier forecast of 13 million to 13.5 million. But executives say they believe sales will rise as Japanese manufacturers restock dealerships where popular models have become scarce.
''We still expect to see some recovery in the second half,'' Mr. Booth said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Medicare Drug Plan Reduces Health Spending

BYLINE: KATIE THOMAS


HIGHLIGHT: A Harvard analysis shows that patients with the government's Part D drug plan appear to have been less likely to need costly inpatient care.

 BODY:
The federal government's prescription drug plan for the elderly, known as Medicare Part D, has been heralded as a success when it comes to reducing out-of-pocket expenses for many patients and encouraging them to use and continue taking essential medicines.
But since its implementation in January 2006, it has also been criticized as too costly. President Obama even singled out the plan as contributing to the nation's debt crisis in his speech to the nation Monday night, calling it an "expensive prescription drug program" that was "simply added to our nation's credit card."
 Now, a new study is arguing that Medicare Part D's cost has been at least partly offset by reduced spending in areas like hospitalizations and short-term stays in nursing homes, because patients who benefited from the plan were less likely to need more costly inpatient care.
 "That has a direct budgetary implication," said Dr. J. Michael McWilliams, an assistant professor of health care policy and medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study, which will appear in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. "Medicare Part D probably did not cost us as much as was originally thought."
 The study compared two groups of elderly patients - those who described their prescription plans as generous before 2006, and those who said they had limited coverage - and tracked their Medicare claims from 2004 through 2007 to gauge how their health care spending changed after the plan was carried out. The nearly 3,500 patients with limited coverage spent about 10 percent less, or about $1,200 each, than expected on annual non-drug related medical care after 2006.
The decrease was explained mostly by reductions in spending on inpatient and nursing-home care, the study found, suggesting that patients were able to manage serious health conditions through medication and prevent complications that could send them to the hospital. In addition, because of the expanded drug coverage, doctors may have been able to treat patients on an outpatient basis for conditions that previously required an inpatient stay in order to be covered by Medicare.
The 2,500 patients who previously had generous drug plans also saw a decrease in non-drug medical spending after Part D was carried out, but the difference was not significant, Dr. McWilliams said. Similar decreases were not observed in a control group of patients whose spending patterns between 2002 and 2005 were analyzed. The study was supported by grants from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the William F. Milton Fund, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Dr. McWilliams said the findings could mean that additional savings will come as the Medicare Part D program gradually closes the so-called "doughnut hole" in coverage over the next decade, as mandated by the federal health care law. Many beneficiaries find themselves paying hefty out-of-pocket expenses for drugs after they hit a spending limit, but before they are covered again under their catastrophic coverage. 
Savings could also increase with the rise of accountable care organizations, groups of doctors and hospitals that work together in an effort to improve care and reduce costs, he added. Under the health care law, accountable care organizations that work with Medicare get to keep a portion of the money they save, so "they will have an incentive to work with the drug plans to make sure their patients have coverage," Dr. McWilliams said.
Because researchers did not have access to drug claims before and after Part D was put in place, the study could not analyze precisely how much was spent on drug costs for the patients in the study. But Dr. McWilliams said the reduction in spending in other medical areas shows that "clearly these plans are doing something right."

HEADLINE: When You Want to Collect Social Security vs. When You Should

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com is a new calculator that shows you the best time to begin collecting benefits, and how that compares to when you want to file for benefits.

 BODY:
When you want to start collecting Social Security isn't necessarily when you begin to collect Social Security. Another new calculator, called MaximizeMySocialSecurity, helps you compare those two options.
This tool, which costs $40 a year, was developed by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, who also created the more comprehensive ESPlanner financial planning software.
His latest calculator generates two big numbers: the present value of your Social Security benefits based on when you think you'd like to file, and how that compares with the maximum amount you would collect if you filed at the best possible time - all based on a specific life expectancy.
This calculator accounts for several things that some of the others do not. It works for widows and those who have been divorced, for instance. It also factors in the effects of working and collecting benefits before your full retirement age, since that could cause a portion of your monthly benefits to be withheld and recalculated later. The program also considers whether your children may be eligible for benefits. (Some children are eligible if they meet certain conditions, like having a disabled or retired parent who is entitled to benefits.)
Meanwhile, certain government employees and other workers whose employers did not withhold Social Security taxes but provided pensions may be affected by the so-called Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. Those could reduce their Social Security benefits. The calculator factors that in, too.
Do you believe that politicians will ultimately prevail in cutting benefits in some way? If so, you can factor that in as well - say, a 2 percent benefit reduction beginning in 2025. Users can also set their own life expectancy.
The results aren't quite as simple to read when compared with some of the other calculators, though Professor Kotlikoff says he is working on improvements.
Getting the results is also going to require a little more work on your part. Be prepared to manually enter what you expect to earn in the future, and what you earned each year for your entire career thus far (you can use your annual Social Security statement, if you have one; to save money, the government didn't mail them out this year and will send them only to people 60 and older starting next year). Professor Kotlikoff said that using your past and projected earnings would make it possible to generate a result even more accurate than relying on the Social Security Administration's retirement estimator.
Married people are also asked if they want to consider the "file and suspend" strategy, which allows one spouse to file for benefits, and then immediately suspend them so that the benefits continue accruing - while allowing their significant other to collect spousal benefits. The Web site explains how it all works; the rules can be confusing. That's why it encourages you to test various assumptions, which will ultimately be compared against the optimal strategy, which the program will calculate on its own.
You'll also be asked to plug in some economic assumptions, like a projected inflation rate and a safe rate of return that you would expect to receive if you collected benefits early and invested them (if you're unsure, you can rely on the default values). This information is used to formulate the "present value" of your benefits, which is a fancy way of saying that the benefit amounts you see account for the time value of money, or the fact that receiving $100 today is more valuable than receiving the same amount at some point in the future, since you could have invested it or spent it today.
I tested the calculator using two different possibilities: a single woman and a married couple. The results show how much you could conceivably leave on the table if you don't file for benefits at the optimal time, though it doesn't list all the various less-than-perfect possibilities, like the SocialSecurityChoices calculator does.
The results also don't spell out what steps you need to take to follow a particular strategy, though you can figure it out by reading the chart that's generated on the results page. (Professor Kotlikoff says he's working on making those results more specific.) For instance, if there is a number in the "spousal benefits" box, that means you would take those benefits until the year that "retirement benefits" show up. There's some helpful commentary on the last page, too.
What do you think of this calculator?

HEADLINE: The Auto Industry, Stuck in the Slow Lane

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A business consulting firm forecasts continued sluggishness in car sales in the United States, despite hope that the sector could help fuel an economic recovery.

 BODY:
Many of those grasping for a sign of economic optimism these days have pointed to the auto industry. The argument is that as supply chains come back on line following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, more automobiles will be available for sale to consumers who have been waiting for cars to arrive.
 But don't expect a roaring comeback yet. A report released Wednesday by AlixPartners, a business consulting firm, projects modest sales growth for the foreseeable future. The report forecasts that United States auto sales will reach 12.7 million units this year, up from the 11.5 million of 2010, but still far below the 16 million-plus that the industry regularly posted in the mid-2000s. AlixPartners forecasts 13.6 million in 2013, and does not project that the industry will get back to its pre-recession peaks "in this current cycle."
 According to the report, several factors are restraining growth in car sales. Unemployment remains high and housing values are depressed, making it difficult for families to tap housing wealth for car purchases. Historically, the report found, one in five vehicles sold has been financed by an appreciation in a car buyer's home value. 
 And in a survey of 1,000 Americans by AlixPartners, 83 percent said they had delayed the purchase of a vehicle or planned to wait another year before buying a car.
John Hoffecker, managing director at AlixPartners, said that the level of sales before the recession was unsustainable. "Many people were thinking that was the norm," Mr. Hoffecker said. "And our view was that it was not actual demand." Instead, he said, sales were buoyed by easy financing by carmakers and rapidly appreciating home and stock values. What's more, he said, automakers did not pay enough attention to their cost structure when selling cars, sometimes at a loss. 
On the positive side, said Mr. Hoffecker, American automakers have already regained their profits. And future sales will be fueled by population growth in the United States as well as growing demand in developing markets. 
The bad news is that the depressed level of auto sales will not help all the laid-off autoworkers get back to work. While engineers and sales representatives have been rehired to pre-recession levels, Mr. Hoffecker said, production labor "is not going to come back any time soon."

HEADLINE: Where the Job Growth Is: At the Low End

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A report finds that the jobs lost in the recession were largely in the middle tier of wages, but most of the jobs created in the recovery have been low-wage positions.

 BODY:
There's more unhappy news for the millions of Americans hoping for a surge in the number of good, high-paying jobs - a new report concludes that the great bulk of new jobs created since the economic recovery began are in lower-wage occupations, paying $13.52 or less an hour. 
The report by the National Employment Law Project, a liberal research and advocacy group, found that while 60 percent of the jobs lost during the downturn were in midwage occupations, 73 percent of the jobs added since the recession ended had been in lower-wage occupations, like cashier, stocking clerk or food preparation worker.
According to the report, "The Good Jobs Deficit," the number of jobs in midwage and high-wage occupations remains significantly below the prerecession peak, while the number of jobs in lower-wage occupations has climbed back close to its former peak.
"During the Great Recession, employment losses occurred across the board, but were concentrated in midwage occupations," the report said. "But in the weak recovery to date, employment growth has been concentrated in lower-wage occupations, with minimal growth in midwage occupations and net losses in higher-wage occupations."The report gives additional ammunition to those who argue, like David Autor, an economics professor at M.I.T., that there is a distinct hollowing out of the middle. It found that the number of jobs in midwage occupations remained 8.4 percent below the prerecession peak, while jobs in higher-wage occupations remained 4.1 percent below and lower-wage jobs were just 0.3 percent below their former peak.
The report divides the nation's occupations into equal thirds: lower-wage, midwage and higher-wage. It found that during the downturn, the nation lost 3.9 million jobs in midwage occupations, while losing 1.4 million in lower-wage occupations and 1.2 million in higher-wage ones. The report said that of the net employment losses during the recession, 60 percent were in midwage occupations, while 21.3 percent were in lower-wage occupations and 18.7 percent in higher-wage ones.
Since the recession ended, the report said there had been a 1.7 million increase in the number of jobs in low-wage and midwage occupations, with low-wage jobs accounting for nearly three-quarters of that. But the number of jobs in high-wage occupations has declined by 461,994 since the recession ended (from first quarter 2010 to first quarter 2011).
"We should emphasize that it is too early in the recovery to predict whether these trends will continue," the report said.
The report found that real wages had shown "a mild decline" since the recession began, of 0.6 percent. For workers in lower-wage occupations, median wages fell 2.3 percent after inflation - partly because many of the newer workers hired had lower wages than others in that group. For workers in midwage occupations, wages slipped by 0.9 percent, while there was some good news for workers in higher-wage occupations - their wages rose by 0.9 percent. 
The report said the biggest job losses among higher-wage occupations came among managers, computer scientists and systems analysts, human resources workers, registered nurses and accountants and auditors.
The report was written by Annette Bernhardt, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project. It said lower-wage occupations were those with median hourly ranges of $7.51 to $13.52 an hour (translating to $15,621 to $28,122 a year for a full-time worker), midwage occupations were $13.53 to $20.66 an hour ($28,142 to $42,973 for yearly full time) and high-wage occupations had median hourly ranges of $20.67 to $53.32 ($42,994 to $110,906 for yearly full time).

HEADLINE: A Last Call at the Oak Room at the Plaza

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: An iconic New York bar and restaurant is closing, though the Plaza says it is in negotiations "with a noted New York restaurant operator" to move in.

 BODY:
Every time Jaelin Sarper, a teacher from Singapore, visits New York, she makes sure to spend time savoring one of her favorite local icons. It's not the Statue of Liberty or a trip to Magnolia Bakery for cupcakes. She makes her way to the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel where she had her first martini, bought by her father. But on Monday night, as she sipped a tall vodka tonic at the vast wraparound bar, she soaked up the news that she may have one fewer icon to visit -- the Oak Room restaurant, which reopened in 2008 after a renovation that included the historic murals by Everett Shinn of Central Park, is closing for good Wednesday night after last call. 
"It's memories," Ms. Sarper said as she leaned over the bar and sipped her drink. "I'm sure it has a place in everyone's heart." After a protracted and bitter battle with the Plaza's owners over noise levels, money and alleged lease violations, among other things, the Oak Room's proprietors said in May that they would close. 
Kristin Franzese, executive vice president of the Shops at the Plaza, said that the hotel was "in serious negotiations with a noted New York restaurant operator and expect an announcement soon." She added that the Shinn murals would remain on site.
But the long-term future of the space, known since 1907 as the Oak Room, offered little consolation to the workers losing their jobs Wednesday night. 
Roni Pervizi, a bartender at the Plaza since it reopened in 2008, tried to advise customers to select their drinks from whatever alcohol he had left. (The Plaza ran out of Pimm's and Sancerre a couple of weeks ago.) He encouraged customers to hold on to their receipts as mementos and shared his fears of finding a job in a sluggish economy, even though his resume includes bartending stints at BLT Steak, BLT Prime and the River Cafe. "It's a lot of people to find jobs for," said Mr. Pervizi as he glanced over at the handful of bartenders with fewer than a dozen customers to wait on in the dimly lit space as the rain pelted outside. The news left some tourists reconsidering their future travel plans.
"This is an icon, you can't close an icon," said Randy Hitchens, a consultant from Atlanta and regular visitor who was sipping an aperitif. He said he had wanted to come back with his wife in December on their annual holiday travels. He has a new plan now. "We'll just go straight to Puerto Vallarta and bypass New York."

HEADLINE: Reversing the Brain Drain: Expanding Medical Opportunities in Rwanda

BYLINE: JOSH RUXIN


HIGHLIGHT: Guest blogger Josh Ruxin writes about two Rwandan doctors who are building a medical school in Rwanda--only the second in the country--to deal with the dearth of physicians in Rwanda.

 BODY:
For decades, young doctors and nurses have been fleeing poor countries for the bright lights and fat paychecks of wealthier nations, abandoning the parts of the world with the highest burden of disease and most desperate need for medical help. Sixty percent of medical doctors who trained in Ghana in the 1980s have since left the country, and there are more Ethiopian doctors in Washington DC than in all of Ethiopia. Sub-Saharan Africa today houses more than a tenth of the world's population, and shoulders a quarter of the global burden of disease, but it has just three percent of the world's health care workers. That said, some young Africans have broken the mold.
Cousins Gerard Urayeneza and Vianney Ruhumuliza were born and raised in a small, isolated town in Southern Rwanda. Both grew up with lofty dreams of practicing medicine. With a little luck and a lot of opportunity, they were able to access medical training in Rwanda. Vianney even finished his schooling abroad in Michigan. Gerard and Vianney did something even more unusual, though: they bucked the international brain-drain trend that is dangerously affecting medicine in the developing world, and committed themselves to building local medical capacity in their native country.
Rwanda, where I live, has just one medical school for a growing population of nearly 11 million. Aspiring students face stiff competition for the limited number of spots available in the school -just 42 students will graduate this year - so many have no choice but to desert the dream of becoming a doctor or nurse altogether. The result is that medical capacity in Rwanda is severely limited, and many rural districts (with about 300,000 people per district) have fewer than a dozen full time medical doctors. Without a robust medical educational system that promises high pay for public health doctors, it's hard to imagine how Rwanda will overcome its current situation. 
Well aware of how grave the challenges are, my ears perked up a few years ago when Dr. John Streit, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist from Saratoga Springs, New York, told me that he was working with Gerard and Vianney to start a new Rwandan medical school. John met Gerard at a conference in Rwanda and was compelled by his story: After Gerard received his medical training, he worked as a skilled nurse practitioner and ultimately transformed a rural, two-room clinic near his hometown into a fully functioning health center - no small feat with his limited resources. Today, it is a three-story regional facility called Gitwe Hospital. It serves 285,000 Rwandans, has 200 beds, and employs nine doctors and 50 nurses. 
Next, Gerard started Rwanda's first private college, which has four majors (including pre-medicine) and a widely respected reputation; another impressive accomplishment for anyone, especially a man from a rural village in Rwanda. There is still one huge problem, though: when students graduate from this college, they face extraordinary challenges if they want to become doctors. The one medical school in the country housed at the National University of Rwanda simply does not have enough capacity to train them all. 
Recognizing this challenge, Gerard connected with his cousin Vianney to lay the groundwork for building and staffing a second medical school. A partnership with the Rwandan Government and the NGO Medical Missions for Children (www.mmfc.org) jumpstarted plans to make Kigali Medical University (KMU) a reality. Gerard and Vianney designed an English curriculum and invited John Streit to serve as President. What's more, recognizing the promise of the initiative, The Rwandan Development Bank added funds to the KMU Foundation (www.kmuf.org) by granting a one million dollar loan to help construct the complex and provide more space for hospital-teaching purposes. Construction on the first of three academic buildings is nearing completion.
Not all the graduates from KMU will choose to stay in Rwanda, though with guidance from Gerard, Vianney, and John, most probably will. But building educational institutions in this developing country has more benefits than meets the eye. Rwanda doesn't have much in natural resources. But it does have a great reserve of human capital: Citizens ready, willing and able to serve their country. Rwanda must develop that resource, and there is perhaps no better way to start than through education.
KMU will accept its first class of medical students this year and the school will continue to expand. Though perfect targets for the brain-drain phenomenon, talented Rwandans now have the chance to train, practice and serve at home, healing Rwanda in more ways than one.

HEADLINE: Should Religion Play a Role in Politics?

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: Portraying partisan political positions as religious convictions is an obstacle to meaningful debate. 

 BODY:
As our electoral process has begun to accelerate, questions about religious affiliation and calls for candidates to sign pledges supporting religious stances are in the news. Here are some reflections on the general question of the role of religion in our political life.
One view, attractive to many Americans, holds that religion has no place at all. Roughly, the idea is that religion concerns the private sphere: what pertains to me as an individual or as a member of a voluntary community of like-minded individuals (e.g., a church). Political life, by contrast, concerns the public sphere: what pertains to me as a member of a wider community (a city, state or nation) of individuals with diverse views on issues such as religion. This distinction seems necessary once we realize the hatred and violence historically associated with religious disagreements. Unless we simply agree to disagree about matters of such intense division, there is little hope of sustaining a civil society.
This exclusion of religion from public discussion has historically attracted Americans from two quite opposed perspectives. Some have found the rival claims of different religions all equally absurd and so all equally to be ignored. Other have taken at least their own religious views as true and important, but, fearing the political triumph of conflicting views, have agreed to a truce under which all religious claims are withdrawn from the public sphere but are allowed to flourish in private.
As long as we are talking about specific theological doctrines, Americans for the most part agree that religion has no place in our public life. Few think that transubstantiation, predestination, Trinitarian theology or the nature of episcopal authority are legitimate topics of political discussion. Religion enters our public discourse primarily as a voice on certain moral issues.
But should religious viewpoints, even on moral issues, have any role in our political debate? Some say no, on the grounds that effective arguments require premises that virtually everyone taking part in the discussion accepts. A religious argument, based on, say, the authority of the Bible or of the Pope, would therefore, be out of place in a public debate among citizens with every variety belief and disbelief.
But this line of thought misunderstands the point of political debate. The goal is to reach consensus about conclusions, but not necessarily consensus about the reasons for the conclusions. We have, for example, come to a consensus about extending full civil rights to all adult citizens, regardless of race or gender. But some argued for this conclusion from the equality of all human beings as children of God, others from self-evident truths about human nature, and still others from the overall increase in well-being that would result from equal treatment. Not everyone accepted the premises of all of these arguments, but that did not prevent such arguments from having an essential role in our national debate about civil rights. They helped form what John Rawls called an "overlapping consensus," in which different groups of citizens accepted the same conclusions from quite different arguments. So there is no objection in principle to religious arguments in political debates.
What is striking on the current American scene, however, is the extent to which people see certain political and economic positions as required by their religious commitment. We may understand - even if we do not accept - the thinking of those who condemn abortion on religious grounds. But many conservative religious groups endorse a wide range of political and economic positions that have no religious basis. For example, The Family Leader (the group that has called for presidential candidates sign a pledge supporting "family values") has a Voter's Guide that specifies the "attributes of a strong Christian leader." According to the guide, a strong Christian leader "understands key elements of God's law," which means that, for example, the leader "upholds the Biblical principles of responsibility and accountability in civil life, thereby limiting the size and cost of civil government"; "encourages an ethical and free enterprise system, and understands it is the only economic model in accord with Biblical principles"; and "understands the right to bear and keep arms" for defensive purposes. The guide also specifies that strong Christian leaders must subscribe to various views about how to interpret the United States Constitution.
There is no honest line of argument from what the Bible says to substantive conclusions about the size of the United States government, the need for a free enterprise system, the right to bear arms or the proper interpretation of the Constitution. Family Leader (and many other religious groups with a conservative political agenda) are disguising partisan political positions as religious convictions. This cripples efforts to have meaningful discussions about their political views.
Proponents of conservative views that require sober argument from empirical facts and generally accepted principles, instead merely assert them with religious fervor. Opponents are understandably irritated by the irrationality of claims that distinctively modern questions about capitalist economics and democratic government were answered in the Bible 2000 years ahead of time. Eschewing this sort of appeal to religious considerations would be a good start toward reducing the acrimony and frustration of our political debates.

HIGHLIGHT: Is having a baby of one sex rather than the other more than just random chance? 

 BODY:
Annie Murphy Paul wanted her second child to be a boy. She announces this in the first sentence of Chapter 5 of"Origins: How the Nine Months Before Birth Shape the Rest of Our Lives,"where she writes:I want a boy. Is it all right to say that out loud? 
I want a boy because I already know about girls. Growing up I had one sister, and 30 female classmates at my all-girls' school; childhood was a clutter of hair ribbons and Barbie shoes, adolescence a mist of Secret deodorant and Love's Baby Soft perfume. I knew almost nothing of boys until I gave birth to one, which may be why they captivate me now. it O.K. to say it out loud? We have discussed that heatedly and often on Motherlode, and you can use the comments to continue the conversation. But first, Ms. Paul has a lot more to say about sex and gender, specifically about how different sexes experience the womb differently.
There is something, she writes, to some of those "old wives' tales." For instance: Women who are pregnant with girls may indeed experience more nausea. ... Several large investigations have found that women afflicted with severe morning sickness, called hyperemesis gravidarum, in the first trimester are more likely to be carrying a female fetus. Doctors, concluded one study, "can say with confidence to a woman who has hyperemesis gravidarum that she has a 55.7 percent chance of delivering a girl." The sicker she is, the more likely this is to be true: a 2004 study by epidemiologists at the University of Washington found that women who were extremely ill -- hospitalized for three days or more -- had odds of having a girl that were 80 percent higher than those of women who did not experience severe nausea. A hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin may be to blame: female fetuses produce more of it than males.Likewise, she continues, boys can make you eat more:Obstetricians have long known that boy babies tend to be bigger than girl babies at birth, by an average of 3.5 ounces. But they weren't sure how this difference came about. A 2003 study tracked the diets of more than 300 women receiving prenatal care at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Women who were pregnant with boys consumed about 10 percent more calories than those who were pregnant with girls -- more protein, more carbohydrates, and more fats, adding up to about 200 extra calories per day. Testosterone secreted by fetal testicles, the researchers speculate, could be sending mothers a signal to eat more. (Another possibility occurs to me: perhaps women who learn they're carrying male fetuses are already obeying the cultural dictate to feed growing boys.)Women just might have some sort of "sense" that tells them if they are having a boy or a girl:... one small but intriguing study found that, "contrary to expectations," women who rely on dreams and emotions to guess their babies' sex have a surprisingly good chance of being correct. Among a group of 45 well-educated pregnant women -- all of whom had chosen not to learn fetal sex from prenatal tests -- 17 said they had a "feeling" about whether their fetus was male or female, and 13 were right. Eight of the women reported having a dream about their fetus's sex, and every single one of them was on the money. "It is always possible that this was a spurious finding," acknowledged the authors, from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. "It is equally likely that there is simply much about the maternal-fetal connection that we do not know."So, fetuses of different sexes might just be sending different signals from the inside to the outside. But what about the other direction? Are there external influences that determine the sex of a child in the first place?
Nature usually provides a male to female ratio of 105 to 100. Except when it doesn't. A thick blanket of coal smoke covered London in December of 1952, so thick that people "couldn't see their own feet, or more than a foot in front of their noses," Ms. Paul writes, and more than 4,000 people died. Nine months later, area hospitals recorded 144 female births compared with 109 male. The ratio was similarly skewed after the East German economic collapse in 1991, the Kobe earthquake in 1995, and the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. In each case, more girls were born than boys.
What besides national catastrophe has been linked to such natural sex selection? Among the triggers that have been studied are: stress (47 percent of those most distressed on Danish psychological tests had boys, while 52 percent of those who were least distressed did); single parenting (boys are slightly less likely to be born to women who are not living with a man at the time of conception); skipping breakfast (women who ate cereal every morning at time of conception had greater chance of delivering boys).
Now, let's say that, like Ms. Paul, a woman wants a child of a certain sex. What to do to influence gender before pregnancy?
There are attempts recorded back to Greek times, Ms. Paul reports: lying on one's right side, binding the left testicle, or biting the woman's right ear during sex. There is no evidence that any of these actually worked. Equally unproven is the theory that intercourse three days before ovulation will produce a girl, while waiting until the day of will result in a boy, but that lack of evidence has not kept the book suggesting the method, "How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby," from selling 1.5 million copies since it was published in 1970.
Ms. Paul, who tried none of these approaches, gave birth to the boy that she so badly wanted.
Which leads back to the original question: Is it all right to say that out loud?

HEADLINE: Dunkin' Brands Sweet Debut

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The owner of the Dunkin' Donuts, which priced its offering at $19, opened at $25 on Wednesday in a robust trading debut.

 BODY:
Dunkin' Brands Group, the owner of the Dunkin' Donuts and the Baskin Robbins chains, got a sweet reception from investors in its market debut on Wednesday, one of the busiest weeks for public offerings since the financial crisis.
Shares of the initial public offering, which priced at $19, opened at $25, rising more than 31 percent. At that level, Dunkin' Brands, which trades on the Nasdaq market under the ticker symbol DNKN, is valued at more than $3.2 billion.
In its much-anticipated offering, the company sold 22.25 million shares, raising $422.75 million. The underwriters have the option to sell another 3.34 million shares, allowing the company to bring in as much as $486.16 million.
It's been an active week for the I.P.O. market. So far, three companies have priced their offerings, including Dunkin' Brands. Another seven are set to do so this week, according to Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. advisory firm, including two more retail companies Teavana and the Chefs' Warehouse.
Nasdaq was keen to celebrate the Dunkin' I.P.O., saying that it was "unofficially changing its name to Nasddaq, incorporating Dunkin' Donuts' iconic pink and orange D's into our traditional logo," according to Bruce Aust, executive vice president of Nasdaq's corporate clients group.
Dunkin' Brands -- owned by a consortium of buyout firms, including Bain Capital Partners, the Carlyle Group and THL Partners -- is also the latest private equity-backed company to go public this year. Among the earlier I.P.O.s: Freescale Semiconductor Holdings, the chip maker; the hospital operator HCA; and Nielsen Holdings, the consumer ratings company. 
Like many of its private equity-owned peers, Dunkin' Brands plans to use the proceeds of its offering to help pay down its debt. As of March 26, the company's debt load stood at $1.89 billion, according to a recent filing.
Investors in Dunkin' Brands, in part, are betting on the growth opportunity. Dunkin' Donuts is mainly concentrated in the eastern United States. In New York and New England, the chain has roughly 1 location for every 9,700 people.
The company plans to focus its expansion efforts in under-penetrated areas east of the Mississippi River and make "disciplined" moves into the rest of the country. Currently, there is 1 store for every 1.19 million people in the western United States.
"It's an expansion story," said Paul Bard, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital. "The company says it can double the numbers of stores in the United States. You can't say the same for McDonalds."
The company's growth, though, depends more on cappuccinos, Coolattas and coffee than cream-filled donuts. In 2010, beverages and beans accounted for 60 percent of sales at the Dunkin' Donuts chain. The company overall earned $26.9 million last year, on revenue of $577.1 million.
There are 14 underwriters are working on Dunkin's I.P.O., including JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.

HIGHLIGHT: Shares of the owner of Dunkin' Donuts, which priced its offering at $19, opened at $25 on Wednesday in robust trading.

 BODY:
4:23 p.m. | Updated 
The Dunkin' Brands Group, owner of the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins chains, got a warm reception from investors in its market debut on Wednesday, one of the busiest weeks for public offerings since the financial crisis.
Shares of the company, which were priced at $19 for the offering, opened at $25, and continued to rise, closing up 46.6 percent at $27.85.
At that level, Dunkin' Brands, which trades on the Nasdaq market under the ticker symbol DNKN, is valued at about $3.35 billion. (Starbucks, in comparison, has a market value of nearly $29.5 billion; Krispy Kreme Doughnuts -- a hot I.P.O. in 2000 -- has a market value of $570 million.) 
In its much-anticipated offering, Dunkin' Brands sold 22.25 million shares, raising $422.75 million. The underwriters have the option to sell an additional 3.34 million shares, allowing the company to bring in as much as $486.16 million.
It has been an active week for the I.P.O. market. Three companies have priced their offerings, including Dunkin' Brands. Another seven are set to do so this week, according to Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. advisory firm, including two more retail companies -- Teavana and the Chefs' Warehouse.

Over all, Dunkin' Brands earned $26.9 million last year on revenue of $577.1 million, nearly all from franchising.

HEADLINE: BMW Group Appoints New President for North American Region

BYLINE: MATTHEW DEBORD


HIGHLIGHT: Ludwig Willisch will replace Jim O'Donnell, inheriting a region with sales momentum that could lead the brand past Lexus by year's end.

 BODY:
Jim O'Donnell, the president of BMW of North America, is retiring on a high note, with the company entertaining realistic notions of becoming the No. 1 luxury automotive brand in the United States. The executive will be succeeded in October by Ludwig Willisch, who oversaw BMW's M performance division before being promoted to head European sales.
Mr. O'Donnell maneuvered BMW of North America through an exceptionally rough period for the luxury auto market, taking over in July 2008, just in time to run damage control during the global financial crisis.
Combined sales for the BMW and its Mini subsidiary brands fell by 20.3 percent in 2009. But a year later, as the crisis abated, sales rebounded, rising 10.1 percent.
Mr. O'Donnell probably can feel comfortable handing the keys to Mr. Willisch, as 2011 sales are up 18.1 percent through June relative to the same period in 2010. This puts the American operation on pace to beat the 2010 total and challenge Toyota's Lexus division for the top spot among luxury nameplates, a position held by Lexus since 2000.
Mr. O'Donnell drew some ire this past April when he expressed skepticism at the prospect of electric vehicles achieving wide appeal. Critics said that this attitude could undermine BMW's ambitious E.V. program; the brand introduced its E.V.-centric i sub-brand in February.
He quickly backtracked, but in the course of apologizing, Mr. O'Donnell attacked tax incentives for E.V. buyers, saying in an official statement that incentives should be targeted toward "a range of innovative actions that can meet diverse needs, rather than only one or two technologies."
Mr. Willisch, the fourth German to lead BMW of North America since 1975, joined the automaker in 1996. He takes over the region at a high point, but also when its hard-won share of the market is being threatened by Audi and Mercedes-Benz, both of which recently announced plans to expand their production footprints in North America and also have reported robust sales growth.

HEADLINE: An I.P.O. Built on the Basics: Sugar and Coffee

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Dunkin' Brands received a market reception to its debut worthy of a sizzling Internet company, as the fast-food chain's shares surged 46.6 percent.

 BODY:
The latest splashy stock debut had all the markings of a sizzling technology start-up company: a better-than-expected offering price, a swarm of investors clamoring for shares and a first-day pop that defied a broader market drop.
But the company was not an online music service or a social networking site. It was a fast-food chain that sells bite-size Munchkin doughnuts and extra-large cups of coffee.
On Wednesday, shares of the Dunkin' Brands Group, which priced its initial public offering at $19 a share, soared 46.6 percent, to close at $27.85. In spite of the turbulent market conditions related to the gridlock over the debt ceiling talks, the stock was flying high.
The gains on the first day mimicked those of newly minted Internet stocks like LinkedIn, Yandex and Pandora. At that level, Dunkin', whose shares trade on the Nasdaq market under the ticker symbol DNKN, is valued at about $3.5 billion.
"People love brands, and we have two iconic brands with real history," said Nigel Travis, the company's chief executive. "We felt like this was good timing."
For all the attention heaped on Facebook, Groupon, Zynga and other technology start-ups developing the next new thing, demand has been just as strong for some basic businesses that sell food, clothes and other consumer goods.
A crush of international and domestic investors tried to get initial public stock offering shares of Dunkin', with orders amounting to more than 20 times the size of the eventual offering, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. In all, Dunkin' sold 22.25 million shares and raised $422.75 million.
Over the last year, 20 consumer-oriented companies have gone public, generating average returns of 29.5 percent, according to Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. advisory firm. Francesca's Holdings, a women's boutique chain that went public last week, is trading 56 percent above its offering price. Despite getting off to a shaky start, retail offerings overseas have also posted strong gains, with Prada up 25 percent from its initial offering and Ferragamo up 44 percent.
By comparison, there have been 50 technology offerings in the last 12 months that have gained a more modest 21.7 percent on average. The initial offering market over all is up 16.4 percent in the same period, based on Renaissance Capital data.
"Consumer I.P.O.'s are resonating well because they are easy to understand," said Paul Bard, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital. "Despite cautious signals, investors are looking forward and expecting consumer spending to improve."
For Dunkin's new investors, the offering was an opportunity to bet on a well-known brand that is expanding in the United States. Its brands Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins have long been staples in America's quick-food industry, with histories stretching back to the 1950s. Five years ago, the spirits maker Pernod Ricard sold the company for $2.4 billion to the private equity firms Bain Capital Partners, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, which still own 78.3 percent.
Dunkin', which makes nearly all its money from franchising, blankets the New England and New York areas with about one store for every 9,700 people. In contrast, the Western half of the United States suffers from a severe Coolatta shortage. Unlike the coffee-peddling rivals McDonald's and Starbucks, which have thousands of locations in the region, Dunkin' Donuts has just 109 outlets. According to Mr. Travis, the company will open about 250 stores this year and will double the number of American stores in 20 years.
 "This is a long-term play for us," said Josef Schuster, the founder of the money manager IPOX Schuster, which got shares in the Dunkin' offering. "Although their sales growth is modest, they haven't touched the West, and that's where strong earnings growth can come from."
Unlike Web start-ups, consumer stocks are often established companies generating cash and profits. In 2010, Dunkin' Brands earned $26.9 million on revenue of $577.1 million. Teavana and the Chefs' Warehouse, other retail companies that are expected to start trading this week, are both profitable, too.
The consumer stocks are also cheaper in many cases. Dunkin' is selling for about six times sales. LinkedIn trades around 39 times trailing sales.
"Many of these companies have a strong earnings record and are modestly priced," said Mr. Schuster, who also owns the stocks of other recent offerings like Francesca's and Vera Bradley, the accessories maker. "As these stocks continue to perform well, demand increases for consumer brand I.P.O.'s."
 Consumer stocks, particularly newly minted ones, are hardly a sure bet, particularly in an environment with a weak job market, anemic economic growth and global uncertainty. The private equity-backed Dunkin' has the added burden of a $1.89 billion debt load. The company plans to use proceeds from the offering to help pay down its debt, according to a recent filing.
Retail companies typically do not have the same trajectory as fast-growing technology start-ups, either. Revenue at Dunkin' increased 7 percent in 2010. LinkedIn's sales more than doubled in the same period.
And today's hot I.P.O. can always turn out to be tomorrow's dud. Shares of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, the fast-food chain that had a popular offering in 2000 and at one point traded for nearly $50, is currently at $8.27.
Still, the mood was celebratory on Wednesday when Dunkin' went public on Nasdaq. To mark the day, the stock exchange unofficially changed its name to Nasddaq and splashed its logo with the signature pink and orange hues of Dunkin' Donuts.
As shares of Dunkin' climbed higher, Mr. Travis and his team sipped on the brand's coffee and nibbled on a generous spread of doughnuts, Munchkins and Baskin-Robbins ice cream, which came in flavors like mint chocolate chip and strawberry.
"I've had at least seven cups of coffee today and a doughnut," said Mr. Travis. "I'm delighted with the current enthusiasm, but I'll wait until next week before I get too excited."

HEADLINE: Lehman Suit by Investors Is Allowed to Continue

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit against former top Lehman Brothers executives, directors and auditors cleared a major hurdle as a federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss the case. 

 BODY:
6:21 p.m. | Updated 
A lawsuit against former top Lehman Brothers executives, directors and auditors cleared a major hurdle on Wednesday, as a federal judge largely rejected a bid to dismiss the case.
In a 106-page ruling, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the United States District Court in Manhattan said that several investors who had bought Lehman securities before the firm failed in September 2008 could continue their claims against former top executives like the chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr.; the president, Joseph Gregory; and the chief financial officer, Erin Callan. The Lehman officials, the suit said, had misled investors about the firm's accounting practices and efforts to manage risk.
"It is entirely plausible to conclude," the judge said, "that the misleading picture that Lehman portrayed played a material part in keeping its stock higher." Consequently, he said, some of the investors' losses may have been "attributable to the alleged fraud."
The ruling is the latest step in a case that has dragged on since 2008. Now, after several delays, the judge cleared the way for each side to begin discovery and potentially proceed toward a trial.
"This is a significant victory for plaintiffs," said Steven B. Singer, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman who is representing pension funds and other investors in the case.
Judge Kaplan did dismiss some smaller claims against the Lehman executives and the most significant accusations facing their auditor, Ernst & Young.
"We are pleased that Judge Kaplan's ruling dismisses most of the claims against us in this matter, and we strongly believe that we will ultimately prevail on the remaining claim," Charlie Perkins, a spokesman for Ernst, said in a statement. 
But the auditing firm still faces a lawsuit from the New York attorney general, who accused the firm of helping Lehman "engage in a massive accounting fraud." Ernst & Young has said it stands by its audits.
The remaining claims against the former Lehman executives charge that the giant investment bank overstated its financial health as it was collapsing in 2008.
The complaint centers on Lehman's questionable use of so-called Repo 105 transactions, short for repurchase agreements. The transactions, which some accounting experts have labeled as a gimmick, helped Lehman temporarily hide billions of dollars in assets off its balance sheet and appear to reduce its mounting leverage. Lehman executed the transactions in Britain, some say, because it was unclear whether they would be legal under United States law.
"This repetitive, temporary, and undisclosed reduction of net leverage at the end of each quarter is sufficient to make out a claim," Judge Kaplan said in his ruling.
The practice first came to light through a court-appointed examiner's report in 2010. The investors seized on the report's findings while lawyers for Lehman officials played down its significance.
"As if it were manna from heaven, plaintiffs have relied on certain parts of the report, but ignore its conclusions," said a filing by lawyers for the defendants. "The report found no colorable claim against any party arising out of four of the five topics that are the subject" of the suit.
Lawyers for Mr. Fuld, Ms. Callan and Mr. Gregory did not return requests for comment.
The suit accuses the Lehman executives of exaggerating the firm's risk management practices on conference calls with investors. For instance, in a March 18, 2008, conference call, Ms. Callan referred to Lehman's "continued diligence around risk management," according to the suit.
But as Lehman promoted its standards, investors say, the firm was suffering from excessive risk-taking that spawned its demise.
Judge Kaplan, at least for now, agreed.
The lawsuit, he said, "sufficiently alleges facts giving rise to an inference that these defendants were involved in setting Lehman's risk policies and knew that the statements concerning enforcement of risk management policies were false."

HIGHLIGHT: Why Harry Reid's debt ceiling plan might be better than John Boehner's.

 BODY:
John Boehner's debt ceiling proposal, which the House will vote on tomorrow, would raise the debt ceiling sufficiently to allow the government to function through February of 2012. In the mean time, it would empower a bipartisan commission to come up with $1.6-1.8 trillion in further savings by November of 2011, which would then be voted on in both houses of Congress under up-or-down, no filibusters allowed rules. If the bipartisan commission's recommendations are passed, the president would be authorized to request a further debt ceiling increase that would carry the country through the rest of his first term.
But even without filibusters and amendments, is there really any plausible scenario in which the commission's recommendations can actually pass both houses of Congress? If House Republicans don't want to vote for revenue increases and Senate Democrats don't want to vote for significant entitlement reform , with more than a year to go until the next election, why would either faction become more amenable to compromise by this autumn? And for that matter, what are the odds that a commission with six Republicans and six Democrats can come to $1.6 trillion agreement on in the first place? In other words, aren't we just headed toward another dance with a potential default six months from now, with no real prospect of getting any structural changes to the country's finances in return? (And keep in mind that we're going to spend the autumn replaying the government shutdown fight, because the fiscal year is ending in October ...)
This is why I'm inclined to prefer the longer-term debt ceiling increase in Harry Reid's proposed framework to the short-term increase in the Boehner bill. The Reid framework eliminates any chance of achieving further significant deficit reduction between now and the 2012 election. But the chances of such deficit reduction actually happening seem low enough, and the economic risks associated with going through this process again high enough, to make postponing the debate seem wiser than renewing it. (Whether Reid's framework, or some version thereof, can actually pass both houses of Congress is another question, obviously.)
Here is how National Review concludes today's editorial in support of the Boehner framework:... a plan that does everything we conservatives think necessary to secure our fiscal future cannot be enacted in today's Washington. The election of Barack Obama in 2008, and the Democratic retention of the Senate in 2010, had consequences that continue to this day.
The 2012 elections will have consequences, too. If Obama is reelected, the further socialization of American medicine will proceed and the modernization of entitlements will not. Taxes will very likely go up. If Republicans want to return the federal government to its proper constitutional dimensions, the legislation they advance now must do as much good as possible while also laying the groundwork for the election of conservatives, and the defeat of liberals, in 16 months. The easier they make it for Obama to blame Republicans for hurting the economy with debt-limit brinkmanship, the more they will undermine that goal.
What Republicans should do, then, is simple, albeit difficult. Cut spending. Hold the line on taxes. Avoid a fiscal crisis. Defeat Obama and Senate Democrats. And with a new mandate and additional allies, set to work bringing lasting change to Washington.I agree with this analysis. But it seems like a case for Reid's plan more than for Boehner's.

HEADLINE: Scorecard: Republican Supporters and Opponents of Boehner Plan

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans -- and outside groups that often support them -- have had to choose sides on the bill on the debt ceiling put forward by House Speaker John A. Boehner.

 BODY:
A debt plan by Speaker John A. Boehner has forced the nation's Republicans -- and outside groups that often support them -- to choose sides.
A mix of conservative lawmakers and Main Street business groups have come forward to support -- with little enthusiasm -- the speaker's two-step plan to raise the debt limit by next Tuesday.
But an equally vocal group of Tea Party lawmakers, antitax groups and conservative commentators have declared their opposition to the plan, saying it fails to meet their expectations for spending cuts.
The result is a mixed scorecard for Mr. Boehner as he heads into what could be the most important vote of his tenure as House speaker. Mr. Boehner can only afford to lose 23 Republican votes before he needs Democratic support to pass his legislation -- something he would rather not have happen.
The skepticism within the House Republican caucus, combined with a report from the Congressional Budget Office that the plan would deliver only $850 billion in savings -- $150 billion less than the $1 trillion proposed hike in the debt ceiling, forced Republican House leaders to delay a vote to Thursday on Mr. Boehner's bill as they searched for more cuts. 
Here is an explanation of some of the bill's key supporters and opponents, and how their decisions could effect the Washington debt showdown over the course of the next seven days.
AGAINST: 
* The Republican Study Committee. Led by Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the R.S.C. signals how dozens of conservative House Republicans might vote. The committee, which claims over 175 Republican lawmakers as members, is home to a core group of about 35 or 40 lawmakers who have vowed to oppose any increase in taxes. Mr. Jordan's opposition could rob Mr. Boehner of support for his legislation from those members.
* Heritage Action. Support from the conservative interest group might have given some political cover to Republicans who wanted an excuse to vote for Mr. Boehner's legislation on Wednesday. But the group declared his bill to be "regrettably insufficient to our times." That makes it tougher for some members to justify a yes vote to their constituents back home.
* The Club for Growth. Like Heritage, the club's decision to oppose Mr. Boehner's plan is a blow for Republican unity in the House. And the group's threat to remember the vote in their annual legislative scorecard will not be overlooked by Republican House members who face reelection -- and the possibility of a primary challenge -- next year. "We are urging club members to call their members of Congress and ask them to oppose it," the group's president, Chris Chocola, said on Tuesday.
* Republican senators. Four conservative senators wrote a letter to their House colleagues on Tuesday urging a no vote on Mr. Boehner's bill. Their argument? It's not enough. "We urge you to hold the line for real reform, to vote no on the debt limit extension," they wrote in the letter. A more moderate senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also opposed the bill, saying in a Twitter message that "the Boehner proposal, no matter how well-intentioned, will be a straight-jacket on real spending reform."
* The Cut, Cap and Balance Coalition. Composed largely of local Tea Party organizations, the group's opposition puts more pressure on Mr. Boehner's coalition from the outside. "To be clear," the group said on its Web site, "we are not criticizing the speaker; however, we cannot support his framework."
* Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina. Mr. Shuler is a Democrat, but his opposition to Mr. Boehner's plan is significant because he is one of a handful of Democratic members who supported the earlier House plan to "cut, cap and balance" the budget. His decision to abandon the speaker makes it more important that Mr. Boehner hold his own coalition together.
* Tim Pawlenty. The former governor of Minnesota said in a statement late on Tuesday that Mr. Boehner's plan did not go far enough. "I am for the plan that will cut spending, cap it, and pass a balanced budget amendment, but unfortunately this latest bill does not accomplish that," Mr. Pawlenty said. That makes him one of the first of the Republican presidential hopefuls to come out against the plan, and increases the pressure on the speaker.
FOR: 
* The United States Chamber of Commerce. The business group is often aligned with conservative organizations like Heritage. But their support for Mr. Boehner's bill suggests that the powerful lobbying group is getting pressure from its members, some of which are the biggest corporations in the world. The threat of a default that could lead to higher interest rates has pushed the chamber to oppose many of the freshmen Republicans that it helped elect in 2010.
* Representative Allen West of Florida. Mr. West is about as conservative as they come -- a member of the Tea Party and, famously, the lawmaker who called a female colleague "vile, unprofessional and despicable." So his support for Mr. Boehner's plan suggests that it is certainly possible for conservative Tea Party members to vote for it. 
* National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. The N.A.W. is one of those groups that has worked hard to elect the new Republican members. But like the Chamber, the group is in tune with its big-business (and small-business) members who fear a default. "Passage of this legislation is critical. Holding out for the unattainable perfect will help ensure default, which will constitute a self-inflicted economic wound of enormous and long term consequence," wrote the group's president, Dirk Van Dongen, in a letter to Congress on Tuesday.
* Representative Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader. It seems obvious to put Mr. Cantor in the for column. But there have been moments during the last several weeks that it looked like Mr. Cantor, who is very conservative, was distancing himself from the deals cut by his boss, Mr. Boehner. The fact that Mr. Cantor expressed "150 percent" support for the speaker's legislation could give some reticent members second thoughts.

HEADLINE: John McCain Vs. The Tea Party

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The fiery, independent version of Senator John McCain attacked Tea Party-allied Republicans for abandoning reason in the debt fight.

 BODY:
Is the old John McCain back?
The fiery, independent version of the Republican senator from Arizona took to the floor of the Senate Wednesday morning. Demanding "straight talk," Mr. McCain accused conservative opponents of the House Republican leader's plan of abandoning reason in the debt fight.
Mr. McCain mocked Tea Party-allied Republicans in the House for believing -- wrongly, he said -- that President Obama and Democrats will get the blame for a default if Republicans refuse to increase the nation's debt ceiling.
By that flawed logic, he said, "Democrats would have no choice but to pass a balanced budget amendment and reform entitlements and the Tea Party Hobbits could return to Middle Earth."
"This is the kind of crack political thinking that turned Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell into G.O.P. nominees," he jeered, referring to two losing Tea Party candidates for the Senate in 2010.
Mr. McCain's comments recall the visage of the senator prior to the 2008 presidential campaign against President Obama, when Mr. McCain eventually abandoned his "straight talk" mantra and ran as a more conventional conservative. And during Mr. McCain's reelection campaign in 2010, he downplayed the "maverick" label that he had long proudly worn in the Senate.
But on Wednesday morning, it looked like the maverick had returned.
Mr. McCain assailed the conservative Republicans in the House who are threatening passage of the debt cutting plan by House Speaker John A. Boehner, calling their political logic "bizarro" and noted sarcastically that they have only been in office a short time.
"Maybe some people who have only been in this body for six or seven months or so really believe that," he said. "Others know better. Others know better."
Mr. McCain's last foray into the middle of a financial crisis did not end well for him. In September of 2008, he abruptly suspended his presidential campaign to return to Washington and help pass the emergency bank bailout known as TARP The effort was criticized as a campaign gimmick and helped Mr. Obama look steady during the financial crisis.
But Mr. McCain waded in again on Wednesday, urging passage of a debt ceiling increase.
"It's time we listened to the markets," he said. "It's time we listened to our constituents. But most of all, it's time we listened to the American people and sit down and seriously negotiate something."

HEADLINE: The Game Is Afoot, But Which One?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As the debt ceiling debate goes on, each day brings new metaphors about who is playing what kind of game.

 BODY:
President Obama said on Monday night that the battle over the debt ceiling was "a dangerous game we've never played before, and we can't afford to play it now."
But what game?
Listening to the debate rage across Washington and on the Internet, there is little agreement on that critical question.
In the words of Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, the game being played is chicken, a longstanding model of game theory in which two players head toward each other on a collision course, swerving at the last possible moment.
"We remain confident that sanity will prevail, that everyone here recognizes that the stakes are too high to play chicken with the economy, and in the end we will get a compromise," Mr. Carney said on Fox News Channel's "Special Report" program this week.
That game sounds like it could be right, although it's typically played with two players. And in Washington, there are at least three: President Obama; House Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican; and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader.
So another possibility would be that Mr. Obama and the lawmakers are playing poker, shoving the nation's finances into the middle of a pot in a kind of crazy "all-in" bet.
The Sunday Times of London went with that idea in a headline over the weekend: "Washington Plays Poker With World Economy."
Of course, poker is now becoming a kind of mainstream game, removed from its more seedy roots. Few people actually get hurt playing poker anymore. So maybe the game that Mr. Obama was referring to was something more dangerous.
Like Russian roulette.
That's the view of Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor. In an interview with CNBC recently, Mr. Buffett described the debt debate in Washington as similar to the game in which a person puts a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger.
"We raised the debt ceiling seven times during the Bush administration," Mr. Buffett said. "Now, in this administration, they are using it as a hostage. You don't have any business by playing Russian roulette to get your way in some other matter. We should be more grown-up than that."
But perhaps that's not intellectual enough to describe the kind of stealthy game being played by the politicians on Capitol Hill and in the White House.
Maybe it's more like chess, a game of strategy and cunning and maneuvers that require the players to think five and six moves ahead of their opponents.
As an article in The New York Times said this week: "It was a day of legislative chess moves, back-to-back party caucuses and closed-door meetings that ended with a nationally televised presidential address and a rebuttal by the House speaker, John A. Boehner. Their separate speeches reflected that the two sides are farther apart than ever."

HEADLINE: Republicans Show a Motivational Video

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The clip from the Hollywood movie "The Town" may not have been the best choice for House Republicans to show at their caucus meeting Tuesday.

 BODY:
As motivational videos go, you can see how it might be appealing.
But the clip from the Hollywood movie "The Town" may not have been the best choice for House Republicans to show at their caucus meeting Tuesday.
The clip opens with the character played by Ben Affleck entering a room and saying, "I need your help. I can't tell you what it is. You can never ask me about it later. And we're going to hurt some people."
The other character thinks about it for a minute and then asks: "Whose car are we going to take?"
Democrats on Wednesday seized on the clip. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, gleefully attacked the choice of that particular section of the movie.
"In the scene they chose to inspire their House freshmen, one of the crooks gives a pep talk to the other right before they both put on hockey masks, bludgeon two men with sticks, and shoot a man in the leg," Mr. Schumer said, a wicked grin on his face. "Literally in the movie, the protagonists say, 'People are going to get hurt.' But they have to go ahead and do it anyway. "Ladies and gentlemen," he continued, "this is your House Republican majority."
Aides to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority whip, who showed the movie clip to his colleagues during a closed-door caucus meeting, declined to comment on the matter.
But Mr. Affleck, in Turkey for a movie about the Iranian hostage crisis, told The Huffington Post that he thought Republicans should have chosen a different movie.
"If they're going to be watching movies, I think 'The Company Men' is more appropriate," Mr. Affleck told the Web site. The company, as the Huffington Post noted, is about workers at a company who have been laid off during a recession.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Promise to Reject Boehner Plan

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Even if he can get his debt ceiling bill through the House, 53 Democratic senators tell John A. Boehner, it will die in the Senate.

 BODY:
Fifty-three Democratic senators have signed a letter to House Speaker John A. Boehner saying they intend to vote against his plan for an increase in the debt ceiling, virtually assuring its defeat in the Senate even as the speaker lines up Republican votes to pass it in the House on Thursday.
Votes are not final until they are cast. But if the Democrats hold to their promise in the letter, Mr. Boehner's plan for a six-month increase in borrowing authority will not make it to President Obama's desk.
"We heard that in your caucus you said the Senate will support your bill," the senators say in the letter. "We are writing to tell you that we will not support it, and give you the reasons why."
In the letter, the senators argue that a short-term extension of the debt ceiling would "put America at risk" and "could be nearly as disastrous as a default."
The speaker has been arguing publicly that he is confident that the Senate will pass his plan if the House approves it. Senate Democrats and President Obama have argued that the legislation cannot pass muster in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
If Mr. Boehner's bill fails -- either in the House or the Senate -- lawmakers in the Senate are expected to consider a competing plan being developed by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.
Under Mr. Reid's legislation, the debt ceiling would be raised enough to allow the country to keep borrowing past the 2012 elections. Mr. Obama has said that is necessary so that the economy does not suffer the uncertainty of another debt fight in Washington during a presidential election year.
"We now have only five days left to act," the Democratic letter concluded. "The entire world is watching Congress. We need to do the right thing to solve this problem. We must work together to avoid a default the responsible way - not in a way that will do America more harm than good."
Complete letter text:
Dear Speaker Boehner,
With five days until our nation faces an unprecedented financial crisis, we need to work together to ensure that our nation does not default on our obligations for the first time in our history. We heard that in your caucus you said the Senate will support your bill. We are writing to tell you that we will not support it, and give you the reasons why.
A short-term extension like the one in your bill would put America at risk, along with every family and business in it. Your approach would force us once again to face the threat of default in five or six short months. Every day, another expert warns us that your short-term approach could be nearly as disastrous as a default and would lead to a downgrade in our credit rating. If our credit is downgraded, it would cost us billions of dollars more in interest payments on our existing debt and drive up our deficit. Even more worrisome, a downgrade would spike interest rates, making everything from mortgages, car loans and credit cards more expensive for families and businesses nationwide.
In addition to risking a downgrade and catastrophic default, we are concerned that in five or six months, the House will once again hold the economy captive and refuse to avoid another default unless we accept unbalanced, deep cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security, without asking anything of the wealthiest Americans.
We now have only five days left to act. The entire world is watching Congress. We need to do the right thing to solve this problem. We must work together to avoid a default the responsible way - not in a way that will do America more harm than good.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Ratings Up for Bloomberg and Kelly

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: The poll suggested that after a decade getting to know the mayor, New Yorkers seemed to be warming up to him as a person, with 64 percent saying they liked him.

 BODY:
After enduring a brutal spring in the public opinion polls, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seems to be making some inroads with the public, according to the latest poll by Quinnipiac University.
 In July, more New Yorkers approved of Mr. Bloomberg's overall performance than disapproved. His approval rating was 45 percent, compared with 40 percent in May, when Mr. Bloomberg was still smarting from the failed appointment of his schools chancellor and the city's botched response to the December blizzard.
 Those approval ratings are a far cry from Mr. Bloomberg's all-time high of 75 percent, but they were greeted with relief inside City Hall and held up as evidence that Mr. Bloomberg's third term was not jinxed, as some political analysts have argued. Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, suggested that the mayor's improved numbers were tied, in part, to his stewardship of the city's economy. 
"These are tough times," Mr. Loeser said, "and the mayor is making the difficult decisions that are helping New York City come out of the recession faster and stronger than the rest of the country."
 When it came to picking Mr. Bloomberg's successor, New Yorkers were divided. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, garnered the most interest, with 23 percent of New Yorkers saying he should be elected mayor in 2013. But Mr. Kelly, with a sky-high 67 percent approval rating of his own, has not indicated that he has any plan to run for mayor.
 The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who maintains a lead in campaign fund-raising, was favored by 18 percent of New Yorkers. She was followed by the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz (12 percent); Comptroller John C. Liu (10 percent); the former comptroller and 2009 mayoral candidate William C. Thompson Jr. (10 percent); the public advocate, Bill de Blasio (6 percent); and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer (4 percent).
 New Yorkers did seem to agree on one thing: The next mayor should have spent most of his or her career in government, not business, like Mr. Bloomberg. 
 "We've tried the businessman-as-mayor for three terms," Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in a statement. "Next time, New Yorkers say, let's pick a politician."
 The poll suggested that New Yorkers seemed, after a decade getting to know the prickly mayor, to be warming up to him as a person, with 64 percent saying they liked him.
 "A lot of New Yorkers think Mayor Michael Bloomberg's third term isn't as good as his first two," Mr. Carroll said. "But they've grown to like Mike as a person."
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg faces challenges in some areas, including education. Public school parents, by a margin of 69 percent to 29 percent, disapproved of his handling of the schools.
 But Mr. Bloomberg's new schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, fared better, with 44 percent of public school parents approving of his performance.
The poll, conducted from July 19 to July 25, was based on phone calls to cellphones and land lines of 1,234 registered voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

HEADLINE: How the South Bronx's Ruins Became Fertile Ground

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Powell explores how the combination of support by Mayors Koch, Dinkins, Giuliani and Bloomberg and the work of community groups helped restore areas feared to be beyond help.

 BODY:
This week in my Gotham column I wrote of the resurrection of the South Bronx, a brilliant coming back to life that owes much to the multidecade efforts of government.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg alone has pumped $8.5 billion into the creation of enough low- and middle-income apartments to house a population the size of Minneapolis.
 Much credit goes to mayors -- from Edward I. Koch to David N. Dinkins, Rudolph W. Giuliani and now Mr. Bloomberg. But their co-stars in this too-often-unremarked-upon drama are a multitude of community groups, many of which scratched and clawed to save their neighborhoods in the 1970s, and grew into remarkably sophisticated operations, capable of leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in bank investment.
These groups range from the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, to the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes to UHAB (the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board) and Los Sures and St. Nick's Alliance and Bridge Street Development in Brooklyn, and so on and so on across the city. 
As Michael Gecan, an organizer with New York Industrial Areas Foundation, whose Manhattan and Bronx affiliates spearheaded the fight to create the gleaming Mott Haven campus with four new schools, noted recently, the city's human expertise in the business of rebuilding neighborhoods is without peer nationally. 
Meanwhile, many readers have pointed out that while we ran a haunting photograph of the broken Bronx to illustrate the column, we offered no shot of the borough's handsome reincarnation. To that end, I contacted the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and its spokeswoman, Catie Marshall, forwarded a few photographs of a neighborhoods where seedlings of change have turned to oaks. 
There is also an architectural rendering by Jonathan Rose Companies of the Via Verde, an environmentally friendly and architecturally distinguished new apartment building that will serve as home for more than 200 working-class and poor families. 
 Finally, several readers and a conservative blog critic or two leveled three indictments against my argument, which run like this; The revival of the South Bronx is old news; second, the Bronx remains dirt poor (so where is the revival, they ask); and third, government played a key role in destroying the South Bronx in the first place.
 Let's take it from the top. Mine was not a new discovery, although the borough's revival gains speed by the day - sprouts are turning to oak trees.
It's also true that the South Bronx remains a sea of working-class and poor people, and, it should be noted, real working-class wages have fallen steadily for decades across the nation. Arguably, that renders the rebuilding more impressive. Not so very long ago conservative theorists assayed a cultural theory of decline, arguing that the poor could not take care of their lives and their buildings. 
The present success tends to put the lie to that argument.
As to government's role in the decline of the Bronx, as the saying goes, terrible mistakes were made. Robert Moses, the original power broker, laid down a highway through its heart, city officials built Co-Op City, a vast middle-class bulwark, far off in the northeastern reaches of the Bronx, thereby encouraging flight. And social policy dumped too dense numbers of poor into already declining neighborhoods.
But this only scratches at the surface of terrible decline. De-industrialization, the beginning of the end of manufacturing, and white flight to the post-war suburbs: The South Bronx died a death of many formidable causes. 
More to the point, this argument leads to a broader question. Let's concede that leaders in the 1950s and 1960s made mistakes. Should a later generation, beginning with Mayor Koch and extending to Mayors Dinkins, Giuliani and Bloomberg simply have tossed up their hands and said: "Ah well, government made mistakes decades ago and so we should do nothing now"? 
That would have been defeatism of the worst sort, and deprived the city and hundreds of thousands of families of a splendid rebirth.

HEADLINE: How the South Bronx's Ruins Became Fertile Ground

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Powell explores how the combination of support by Mayors Koch, Dinkins, Giuliani and Bloomberg and the work of community groups helped restore areas feared to be beyond saving.

 BODY:
This week in my Gotham column I wrote of the resurrection of the South Bronx, a brilliant coming back to life that owes much to the multidecade efforts of government.
 Michael R. Bloomberg alone has created enough low and middle-income housing to house a population the size of Minneapolis.
 Much credit goes to mayors -- from Edward I. Koch to David N. Dinkins, Rudolph W. Giuliani and now Mr. Bloomberg. But their co-stars in this too-often-unremarked-upon drama are a multitude of community groups, many of which scratched and clawed to save their neighborhoods in the 1970s, and grew into remarkably sophisticated operations, capable of leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in bank investment.
These groups range from the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, to the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes to UHAB (the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board) and Los Sures and St. Nick's Alliance and Bridge Street Development in Brooklyn, and so on and so on across the city. 
As Michael Gecan, an organizer with New York Industrial Areas Foundation, whose Manhattan and Bronx affiliates spearheaded the fight to create the gleaming Mott Haven campus with four new schools, noted recently, the city's human expertise in the business of rebuilding neighborhoods is without peer nationally. 
Meanwhile, many readers have pointed out that while we ran a haunting photograph of the broken Bronx to illustrate the column, we offered no shot of the borough's handsome reincarnation. To that end, I contacted the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and its spokeswoman, Catie Marshall, forwarded a few photographs of a neighborhoods where seedlings of change have turned to oaks. 
There is also an architectural rendering by Jonathan Rose Companies of the Via Verde, an environmentally friendly and architecturally distinguished new apartment building that will serve as home for more than 200 working-class and poor families. 
 Finally, several readers and a conservative blog critic or two leveled three indictments against my argument, which run like this; The revival of the South Bronx is old news; second, the Bronx remains dirt poor (so where is the revival, they ask); and third, government played a key role in destroying the South Bronx in the first place.
 Let's take it from the top. Mine was not a new discovery, although the borough's revival gains speed by the day - sprouts are turning to oak trees.
It's also true that the South Bronx remains a sea of working-class and poor people, and, it should be noted, real working-class wages have fallen steadily for decades across the nation. Arguably, that renders the rebuilding more impressive. Not so very long ago conservative theorists assayed a cultural theory of decline, arguing that the poor could not take care of their lives and their buildings. 
The present success tends to put the lie to that argument.
As to government's role in the decline of the Bronx, as the saying goes, terrible mistakes were made. Robert Moses, the original power broker, laid down a highway through its heart, city officials built Co-Op City, a vast middle-class bulwark, far off in the northeastern reaches of the Bronx, thereby encouraging flight. And social policy dumped too dense numbers of poor into already declining neighborhoods.
But this only scratches at the surface of terrible decline. De-industrialization, the beginning of the end of manufacturing, and white flight to the post-war suburbs: The South Bronx died a death of many formidable causes. 
More to the point, this argument leads to a broader question. Let's concede that leaders in the 1950s and 1960s made mistakes. Should a later generation, beginning with Mayor Koch and extending to Mayors Dinkins, Giuliani and Bloomberg simply have tossed up their hands and said: "Ah well, government made mistakes decades ago and so we should do nothing now"? 
That would have been defeatism of the worst sort, and deprived the city and hundreds of thousands of families of a splendid rebirth.

HEADLINE: S.B.A. Unveils New Venture Capital Fund

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The fund will seek companies that have already proven themselves, generating revenue of at least $20 million a year and profit of $3 million to $5 million. 

 BODY:
The Small Business Administration announced on Thursday that it had formed a $130 million venture capital fund to invest in high-growth companies in Michigan. The fund is the first of what Karen Mills, the S.B.A. administrator, said is a $1 billion commitment over five years through what the agency calls Impact Investment funds, part of the Obama administration's Startup America initiative announced in January.
In Michigan, the S.B.A. has joined forces with the State of Michigan Retirement Systems, which will contribute $35 million through its own investment fund, and Dow Chemical, which will invest $15 million. The S.B.A. will provide up to $80 million in debt financing. In the next three or four years, the fund, called the InvestMichigan! Mezzanine Fund, will invest between $5 million and $15 million in about 20 companies that either do business or have a substantial presence in Michigan or are poised to relocate there.
Speaking on a conference call that included the chief executive of Dow and Rick Snyder, Michigan's Republican governor, Ms. Mills said the state's dire economic situation made it a logical starting point for the program. "This is an economy in transition," she said. "But the good news is the opportunity is also there. Many of the high-growth firms in Michigan simply need more capital to grow, scale up, and hire." (As it happens, the state is certain to be a battleground in the 2012 presidential election.) 
The Impact Investment Fund initiative is a new variation on the agency's longstanding, and grossly under-utilized, investment program. As currently constituted, the program allows funds, called small-business investment companies, to borrow money from the S.B.A. and in turn re-loan that money to their portfolio companies. The S.B.A. then pools the money lent to the small-business investment companies and sells the debt as debentures on Wall Street; because the investment is guaranteed by the government, the interest rate is low. According to Kelly Williams, a managing director of Credit Suisse and a manager of the InvestMichigan! fund, the interest rate on these debentures is presently about 4 percent - much lower than a bank loan.
The program, which is self-financed through the interest payments and fees charged to the investment companies, is authorized to loan $3 billion each year; last year, Ms. Mills said, it committed only half that.
But the initiative does have limitations. Though the program is called Startup America, Invest!Michigan will not invest in start-ups. Because small-business investment company investment is typically more debt than equity - in the case of Invest!Michigan, about 70 percent debt, according to S.B.A. spokeswoman Hayley Meadvin - the companies receiving the investment must have enough cash flow to make regular interest payments to their backers. Indeed, according to Ms. Williams, the fund will seek companies that have already proven themselves, generating revenue of at least $20 million a year and profit of $3 million to $5 million.
Until 2004, the S.B.A. also licensed small-business investment companies that took pure equity stakes in portfolio companies, and so could invest in risky early-stage companies. However, the Bush administration, convinced that losses in that program would cost the government billions of dollars, stopped issuing new licenses for those types of investment companies. The program's authorization eventually expired, and Congress has not renewed it.
The Obama administration has not sought to renew the equity program, either, though the S.B.A. says it is developing a $1 billion fund for early-stage companies, set to be launched in late 2011 or early 2012. In the meantime, the administration has channeled more private-sector dollars into the debenture program. And with the Impact Investment initiative, it has taken a decidedly more hands-on approach. Unlike a typical S.B.I.C., where an investment manager would first organize the fund and then approach the S.B.A. for a license, this fund was in fact organized by the agency itself.
While many newly elected Republican governors have taken pains to distance themselves from Obama administration initiatives that they view as heavy-handed federal intervention, Gov. Snyder had no such qualms on Thursday. "We're pleased that you look upon Michigan as a great opportunity, because we want to be a pioneer on an opportunity like this," he said to Ms. Mills on the conference call. "It's very exciting to be part of this process."
Ms. Williams said the fund has already started scouting for prospective investments. The first deal, she said, would close within a month or so.

HEADLINE: Appealing to Runners, Even the Barefoot Brigade

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
UNLIKE the economy generally, sales for running shoes are sprinting along, with retail sales for the first half of 2011 up 18 percent over the same period last year, according to SportsOneSource, a market research firm that focuses on sporting goods.
Those gains come not from traditional models -- which add stability and cushioning to cater to a variety of gaits, and whose sales are actually down as much as 18 percent over last year -- but rather from a new crop of pared-down running shoes, whose sales are up 283 percent. 
Inspired by Christopher McDougall's best-selling book, ''Born to Run,'' which chronicles how a tribe of Tarahumara Indians in Mexico run distances exceeding 100 miles wearing thin sandals, many runners are experimenting with running barefoot or with so-called barefoot shoes, like FiveFingers, by Vibram, which have articulated toes and thin, pliable soles.
A recent print campaign by FiveFingers, featuring naked models (with artfully placed hands and arms) and the slogan, ''You are the technology,'' alluded to traditional athletic shoe ads that boast about technological advances.
Now, to promote its new NB Minimus collection, New Balance is making a case to runners who may be considering going barefoot or converting to barefoot-style shoes, but still would like something more significant between the bottom of their feet and bottle caps on the trail.
In one new spot, an actor running on a trail in the woods at night comes upon a clearing with a strip of glowing coals. After giving a watch-this nod to a raccoon, his first step is accompanied by a sizzling sound and the actor yelping, followed by a silent step as he smiles, a pattern that repeats for several steps before the camera reveals that his left foot is bare while the right is shod in an NB Minimus shoe.
The commercial closes with the hissing sound of the runner lowering his bare foot into a bucket of water, a close-up of the shoe, and the tagline for the campaign: ''Like barefoot only better.''
In another spot, the same single-shoe-wearing actor trots into a convenience store, where a store clerk first chides him for his prohibited bare foot, then admires the sneaker on the other.
The spots, by Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of Havas, were scheduled to begin appearing Thursday on networks including ESPN, Comedy Central and the Discovery Channel.
Advocates of barefoot running contend that modern running shoes, which over the decades have increasingly swaddled feet in cushioning, may actually cause injuries in some runners rather than prevent them.
To protect the heel, conventional running shoes typically are about half an inch higher in the back, which helps absorb impact for heel-strikers, meaning runners who land on the back of the foot rather than on the forefoot or midfoot.
But, as stiletto wearers well know, the higher a shoe's heel, the more apt that heel will be to hit the ground first, which means that running footwear may actually encourage heel-striking.
What the author Mr. McDougall observed with the Mexican tribe of runners wearing primitive footwear -- if any at all -- was that they took shorter strides and tended to land more gently on their forefoot, and were spared the Achilles' tendon and knee injuries that hobble runners elsewhere.
Still, David Willey, editor in chief of Runner's World, cautions against switching from a conventional running shoe to a minimal one hastily.
''If you've been running for five or 10 years with little or no injury problems, you should think twice about messing with your running form and jumping on the barefoot bandwagon because you may introduce injuries where you didn't have them,'' Mr. Willey said.
Mr. Willey advocates introducing barefoot or minimal shoes into running routines only gradually (as he has himself), using them at first to run as little as 50 yards, because runners need to gradually adapt to taking shorter strides, landing on the forefoot, and strengthening the foot and leg muscles required to do so.
Or else risk injury.
Marybeth Crane, a podiatrist in Grapevine, Tex., who also is a marathon runner and specializes in sports medicine, told Men's Health recently that ''85 percent of my patients get injured trying to transition to the new shoes.''
For its part, New Balance is cautioning runners with stickers on the boxes of NB Minimus shoes that the ''product increases the strain on the foot, calf, and Achilles' tendon'' and ''should be introduced slowly into a running exercise routine,'' starting with only ''10 percent of overall running workouts and very gradually increasing time and distance.''
The NB Minimus line -- like the similarly stripped down Nike Free Run, Saucony Kinvara, and Brooks Green Silence -- looks like a standard running shoe. But rather than the typical half-inch, the Minimus rises only one-sixth of an inch at the heel, and the shoes are considerably lighter than most running shoes.
''What consumers are looking for is not necessarily a true barefoot shoe but rather the benefits, a product that encourages a more natural gait,'' said Katherine Petrecca, manager of the NB Minimus line at New Balance.
Marketers at the brand refer to the line as ''a high-tech approach to low tech,'' and Mike Howard, a creative director at Arnold, said the tagline, ''Like barefoot only better,'' reinforces that.
''Instead of saying take all your technology away and be super hard-core, this is saying that there's a measured approach,'' Mr. Howard said.
New Balance spent $24.2 million on advertising in 2010, up from $14.8 million in 2009, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
Of course, if running barefoot were a panacea, it would most likely not be a shoe company that would trumpet that fact. But Ms. Petrecca, of New Balance, said she would have her doubts regardless.
''If I thought barefoot running was the be-all and end-all, I would quit and make foot soap,'' Ms. Petrecca said.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Try to Curb Environmental Rules

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
With the nation's attention diverted by the drama over the debt ceiling, Republicans in the House of Representatives are loading up an appropriations bill with 39 ways -- and counting -- to significantly curtail environmental regulation.
One would prevent the Bureau of Land Management from designating new wilderness areas for preservation. Another would severely restrict the Department of Interior's ability to police mountaintop-removal mining. And then there is the call to allow new uranium prospecting near Grand Canyon National Park. 
There is little chance that all the 39 proposals identified by Democrats will be approved by the Senate, which they control, or that a substantial number could elude a presidential veto. In fact, one measure -- to forbid the Fish and Wildlife Service to list any new plants or animals as endangered -- was so extreme that 37 Republicans broke ranks Wednesday and voted to strip it from the bill.
Although inserting policy changes into appropriations bills is a common strategy when government is divided as it is now, no one can remember such an aggressive use of the tactic against natural resources. Environmental groups and their Democratic allies in Congress worry that more than a few of these so-called riders could stick when both sides negotiate and leverage budget concessions in the fall.
''You have a fatal political momentum,'' said David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. ''They are going to load up this bill in an unprecedented fashion.''
Republicans frame their proposals -- which are being debated and voted on this week on the House floor -- as the best way to counter overreaching regulatory agencies.
The unusual breadth of the attack, explained Representative Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho, is a measure of his party's intense frustration over cumbersome environmental rules.
''Many of us think that the overregulation from E.P.A. is at the heart of our stalled economy,'' Mr. Simpson said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. ''I hear it from Democratic members as well.''
But Democrats argue that the policy prescriptions are proof that Republicans are determined to undo clean air and water protections established 40 years ago.
Many of these new restrictions, they point out, were proposed in the budget debate earlier this year and failed. They are back, the Democrats say, because Republicans are doing the bidding of industry and oil companies.
''The new Republican majority seems intent on restoring the robber-baron era where there were no controls on pollution from power plants, oil refineries and factories,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat, excoriating the proposal on the floor.
Environmental regulations and the E.P.A. have been the bane of Tea Party Republicans almost from the start. Although particularly outraged by efforts to monitor carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas linked to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere, freshmen Republicans have tried to rein in the E.P.A. across the board -- including proposals to take away its ability to decide if coal ash can be designated as a toxic material and to prevent it from clarifying rules enforcing the Clean Water Act.
The appropriations bill in question covers the Department of Interior, the Forest Service and the E.P.A., and it was voted out of committee and onto the House floor strictly along party lines -- with the Republicans prevailing 28 to 18. The bill cuts annual combined funding for agencies by 7 percent -- and by nearly 18 percent for the E.P.A. alone -- but it is controversial mostly because of the onslaught of policy changes.
Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington and ranking minority member on the appropriations committee, said Republicans were adding provisions unchecked to the law and getting away with very little scrutiny. He expected even more regulatory rollbacks to be added to the bill this week. The bill is under open debate on the House floor, and policy changes requested by members but not included by the appropriations committee can now be added one by one to the bill, in addition to the 39 riders that came out of the committee.
''It is already like a wish list for polluters,'' Mr. Dicks said, ''and it is going to get worse on the floor.''
Conservatives have been adding amendments at a furious pace. Earthjustice, an environmental advocacy group, counted more than 70 anti-environmental amendments filed as of Wednesday morning and was monitoring for more.
Dave Conover, a senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington analysis and advocacy group, and a former Republican staff member with the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said the large number of provisions was less about policy and more a way for the conservatives in the House to signal the depths of their discontent with a broken political process.
''It is clear that the Senate is not going to pass all these appropriations,'' said Mr. Conover, adding, ''And the message is that in a down economy excessive environmental regulations are a bad move.''
But Mr. Goldston of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that although most of the policy attachments would never become law, the Republican appropriations flurry was still unnerving -- and could pose more reason for concern in coming months. ''We are then going to be in a situation again where the Senate and president face the question of whether they are willing to shut down the government or appease a motley group in the House over a spending bill,'' he said. ''No one knows how that plays out.''

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Documents Worsening Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The economy worsened in about half of the country earlier this summer because of weak home sales and signs of a slowdown in manufacturing. 
A Federal Reserve survey said Wednesday that seven of the Fed's 12 bank regions reported slower growth in June and early July compared with the spring. That's a worse showing than in the previous survey.
Of the remaining five districts, four reported modest growth. A fifth, the Minneapolis district, said its economy was disrupted by bad weather and the shutdown of Minnesota's state government.
The job market remained weak in most districts, the report said. Employers added few jobs in June, the government said earlier this month.
Droughts and severe flooding badly hampered seven districts with large agricultural sectors, the report said.
Manufacturing output rose overall. But many districts reported only ''steady or slowing'' growth, the Fed's report said. Only two districts reported rising manufacturing activity. Companies in three districts -- Philadelphia, Richmond and Atlanta -- reported slower growth.
The weak picture of the national economy echoes recent data on hiring and manufacturing. Economists expect growth for the April-June quarter, which will be reported Friday, to fall below 2 percent, the second straight quarter of anemic expansion.
The report, known as the ''Beige Book,'' is based on anecdotal information gathered by officials at the 12 Fed regional banks. It is released eight times a year and provides an on-the-ground snapshot of the economy. Wednesday's report covered the roughly seven weeks between May 27 and July 15.

HEADLINE: Saving on Real Estate In a Down Economy

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
From 2009 to 2010, the commercial real estate market in the United States seemed bottomless. Whether seeking manufacturing, office or retail space, those looking to lease or buy were in the driver's seat, said Fred Schmidt, president and chief operating officer for Coldwell Banker Commercial in Parsippany, N.J. After the supply of space hit a peak in the fourth quarter of 2010, he said, the market began a slow recovery -- ''but it's definitely still a tenant's and buyer's market.''
Many small businesses have taken advantage of the market to negotiate more favorable lease terms or lower rents or to move to better space. Some were able to buy a building, a pipe dream for many in the prerecession real estate market. Still, putting together a deal requires timing, cash and market savvy. The best deals take time and tenacity, so start looking long before your lease expires, said Brian Netzky, president of Interstate Tenant Advisors in Lincolnwood, Ill. ''Don't be reactive, because then no matter what the economy is like, you're in the worst position.''
Below are several examples of small-business owners who have taken advantage of one bright spot in a dark economy. 
PAYING CASH UPFRONT Tired of paying rent for office space, Andrew E. Samalin called a broker last year and started looking for a building to buy. At the time, Mr. Samalin, a principal in an investment firm, Samalin Investment Counsel, was paying a high $4,500 a month for 700 square feet in suburban Mount Kisco, N.Y. In March 2010, he found a building in nearby Chappaqua that had been built in 1865 and needed work. The previous time it had been up for sale -- at the height of the market -- the asking price was $1.3 million. This time, Mr. Samalin saw an opportunity.
The seller would take only cash, so Mr. Samalin offered $600,000. After his offer was accepted, he put up $250,000 in cash for renovations. ''I knew I could get the mortgage financing in place later,'' he said, ''but if I offered the cash upfront, I could get a really good price for the building.'' The mortgage came after renovations were complete, because then it was less risky for the bank.
Mr. Samalin's mortgage payment is now $3,500 a month. But he had enough extra room to take in a tenant, who pays $2,400 a month, reducing Mr. Samalin's portion to $1,100. Because of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the entire cost of the renovations was tax deductible. Mr. Samalin said he feels pride in owning a restored historical building, and his staff and clients love the space. ''I consider this one of the greatest deals of my life,'' he said.
NEGOTIATING AGGRESSIVELY Mark Censits, owner of an upscale wine, beer and spirits shop, CoolVines, wanted to move his Princeton, N.J., location -- 350 square feet on the outskirts of town -- to a bigger, better location. In 2007, when the market was still strong, he found 1,500 square feet in the center of town. The building's opening was delayed for three years and by the time it was ready for tenants last fall, the market was tanking. ''I was able to reopen discussions twice, each time negotiating more aggressively,'' he said.
Because there were few creditworthy tenants bidding, Mr. Censits used CoolVines' record of success -- and the expectation that it would bring foot traffic -- to persuade the landlord to lower the price from about $41 a square foot to $35.
The soft market also prompted Mr. Censits to move another location, this one in Westfield, N.J. ''I knew if we were ever going to expand, this was the time to do it,'' he said. The original Westfield store was 750 square feet and cost about $54 a square foot. Mr. Censits found a new location that offered 2,400 square feet downtown with parking, and is located between Williams-Sonoma and Banana Republic stores.
Feeling confident after the success of his Princeton negotiations, Mr. Censits started with a lowball offer of $33 a square foot; he got the space for $37, and the landlord agreed to freeze the rent for three years. After that, increases are limited to 2 percent annually for the seven years. ''I also got him to do a significant amount of demolition to the place -- probably $50,000 worth -- so we could build it out the way we wanted,'' Mr. Censits said.
PAYING LESS FOR MORE Three years ago, when the lease on his manufacturing facility was ending, Scott Pievac thought he was ready to buy new space for the Sam Pievac Company, which makes retail displays and fixtures and was founded by Mr. Pievac's father. At the time, however, prices were high and inventory low, so he continued to rent in Santa Fe Springs, Calif.
This year, when he started shopping around again, he found few people wanted to sell in the middle of a downturn. But with the help of a broker, he located an old Firestone tire storage plant for sale in Chino, about 25 miles away. The price was $65 a square foot, a great deal, he said. ''That building would have been $100 a square foot five years ago. It had been on the market a week, and they had five offers.''
Several factors converged in Mr. Pievac's favor. His broker introduced him to the broker representing the sellers, and they found they had mutual friends. The Sam Pievac Company had been in business 50 years and was financially stable, making it an attractive candidate.
In addition, the Small Business Administration increased its lending limit on loans for the acquisition of fixed assets in 2011 to $5 million, which helped Mr. Pievac arrange the financing he needed. The total cost of the building with improvements was $7.2 million. The company moved into the new warehouse space in April, and the office space will be ready this week.
Mr. Pievac's rent used to be $42,000 a month; now, he has more space, owns the building and pays $40,000 a month.
FINDING COMFORTABLE SPACE In early 2010, the employees of M. Studio, a design and branding agency, were spilling out of their northern New Jersey offices. Jenna Zilincar, a founder and creative director, said four people were crammed into 800 square feet that they called ''the hamster cage.''
Ms. Zilincar wanted to move closer to her clients and was able to find several affordable options in Asbury Park that had not been available a year earlier. One space was triple the size of M Studio's previous office. The space needed modifying, Ms. Zilincar said, but she got the landlord to put up walls and take out doors, creating offices and a conference room. Ms. Zilincar was also able to sublease two small offices she did not need, substantially reducing her monthly costs.
Now, M Studio has five people working full-time in an open space. The office has a waiting area, a conference room and a kitchen. Ms. Zilincar also got the landlord to put in hardwood floors, outside lighting, air-conditioning and baseboard heating. She and her broker negotiated a slightly lower rent than the asking price, no increases for a year and a half and a $50 increase for the 18 months after that. If she renews for another three years, the increase will be 5 percent.
Ms. Zilincar believes the new space has helped her close deals. ''People's level of comfort went up because this space is more legitimate,'' she said. ''We don't have to meet clients in coffee shops anymore.''

HEADLINE: Anemic Growth, and Some Slowing, Seen in Fed Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods fell in June and economic activity across much of the nation slowed through mid-July, casting doubt over how quickly the economy might escape its soft patch.
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the recovery lost steam in eight of 12 regions it tracks in recent weeks, with hiring modest, wages soft and price pressures subdued. 
''Economic activity continued to grow; however, the pace has moderated in many districts,'' the Fed said in its report, known as the beige book.
Separately, the Commerce Department said weak receipts for transportation equipment pushed down durable goods orders 2.1 percent last month after a 1.9 percent increase in May. A closely watched reading on business spending plans also fell.
Excluding transportation, orders edged up just 0.1 percent.
''We're getting confirmation that this is more than just a soft patch in the first part of the year, that it's a more fundamental slowdown triggered in part by the political environment and jittery markets,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Economists said the drop in the so-called core category of factory orders that is used as a proxy for business spending plans was troubling and could yield slower growth in spending by businesses on equipment and software in the third quarter.
That measure -- nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft -- slipped 0.4 percent last month after a 1.7 percent rise in May.
''The June decline is somewhat worrisome regarding the vigor of the trend in capital spending,'' said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company in New York. ''This is particularly so given that the June data probably predates any debt ceiling-driven precaution on the part of business behavior.''
Durable goods are items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more. Though orders tend to be volatile, last month's unexpected decline suggested factory activity was slowing.
The Fed report, based on comments by business contacts in the central bank's 12 districts, also presented a glum picture.
While most districts saw modest hiring gains, labor markets remained soft, the Fed said. Home sales were little changed since the beige book issued in early June, and most districts reporting on home prices found them flat or declining.
Against that backdrop, wage pressures were subdued and price pressures moderated somewhat, the Fed said.
The economy has been hurt by high gasoline costs and supply chain disruptions after the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but economists had hoped the recovery would be picking up speed by now.
Businesses, sitting on $2 trillion in cash, have been spending heavily on equipment and software. Economists said businesses still had pent-up demand, but much would depend on developments in the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington over the next days.
A range of American companies -- like Emerson Electric and Corning -- on Wednesday warned that demand was weakening.
Emerson Electric said American and European economies had ''clearly slowed'' in the last two months, sending its own shares down. Other industrial shares were also lower across the board.
Brian Levitt, an economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York, said a resolution of the budget standoff in Washington ahead of an impending deadline for Congress to raise the nation's borrowing limit could help lift the cloud hanging over the economy.
''We're going to need some clarity over the next week, and if events turn out as the market hopes it will, there is still some impetus for growth as we head out into year-end,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Growing From Underground

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
AS a way to save the world, digging a ditch next to a hillock of sheep dung would seem to be a modest start. Granted, the ditch was not just a ditch. It was meant to be a ''swale,'' an earthwork for slowing the flow of water down a slope on a hobby farm in western Wisconsin.
And the trenchers, far from being day laborers, had paid $1,300 to $1,500 for the privilege of working their spades on a cement-skied Tuesday morning in late June.
Fourteen of us had assembled to learn permaculture, a simple system for designing sustainable human settlements, restoring soil, planting year-round food landscapes, conserving water, redirecting the waste stream, forming more companionable communities and, if everything went according to plan, turning the earth's looming resource crisis into a new age of happiness. 
It was going to have to be a pretty awesome ditch.
That was the sense I took away from auditing four days of a weeklong Permaculture Design Certificate course led by Wayne Weiseman, 58, the director of the Permaculture Project, in Carbondale, Ill.
The movement's founders, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, coined the term permaculture in the mid-1970s, as a portmanteau of permanent agriculture and permanent culture.
In practice, permaculture is a growing and influential movement that runs deep beneath sustainable farming and urban food gardening. You can find permaculturists setting up worm trays and bee boxes, aquaponics ponds and chicken roosts, composting toilets and rain barrels, solar panels and earth houses.
Truly, permaculture contains enough badges of eco-merit to fill a Girl Scout sash. Permies (yes, they use that term) like to experiment with fermentation, mushrooming, foraging (also known as wildcrafting) and herbal medicine.
Yet permaculture aims to be more than the sum of those practices, said David Cody, 39, who teaches the system and creates urban food gardens in San Francisco.
''It's an ecological theory of everything,'' Mr. Cody said. ''Here's a planet Earth operating manual. Do you want to go along for a ride with us?''
It's hard to say just how many have climbed aboard the mother ship. In San Francisco, Mr. Cody saw more than 1,500 volunteers turn out in 2010 to create Hayes Valley Farm, a pop-up food garden near the site of a collapsed freeway ramp.
''I like to say it was the largest sheet-mulching project ever done in the world,'' said Mr. Cody, who designed the garden following the permaculture principles and directed the process of covering the ground with a cardboard weed barrier and organic material.
''We sheet-mulched about an acre and a half,'' he said. ''That's something like 80,000 pounds of cardboard diverted from the waste stream.''
In the last four years, Mr. Cody has helped train 250 students through the Urban Permaculture Institute in San Francisco.
Scott Pittman, 71, who directs the national Permaculture Institute from a farmstead outside Santa Fe, N.M., estimates that 100,000 to 150,000 students have completed the certificate course since the philosophy was developed in Tasmania over three decades ago. ''In the U.S., I would say we represent 40,000 to 50,000 of that number,'' he said.
But then pemaculture has no membership rolls or census-takers. By intention, ''it has been, for all of the years I've been involved, a pretty decentralized movement,'' Mr. Pittman said. The message seems to get out in its own fashion, without publicists. Mr. Mollison, for example, has been permaculture's leading figure since the late 1970s, and his books have hundreds of thousands of copies. Yet his name has apparently never warranted a mention in this newspaper.
Permaculture, Mr. Pittman said, is ''guided by the curriculum and a sense of ethics, and that's pretty much it.''
The ethic of permaculture is the movement's Nicene Creed, or golden rule: care of the earth; care of people; and a return of surplus time, energy and money, to the cause of bettering the earth and its people.
In its effort to be universal, permaculture espouses no religion or spiritual element. Still, joining the movement seems to strike many of its practitioners as a kind of conversion experience.
MR. Pittman first encountered Mr. Mollison and his teachings at a weekend seminar in New Mexico in 1985. As a system, permaculture impressed him as panoptic and transformational. ''It shook my world,'' Mr. Pittman said.
Almost on the spot, he decided to drop his work and follow Mr. Mollison to the next stop on his teaching tour: Katmandu, Nepal. Soon after, he began to lead courses alongside Mr. Mollison, in cities and backwaters around the globe.
Mr. Mollison hasn't toured the United States in almost 15 years. At 83, Mr. Mollison has ''kind of faded into semi-retirement in Tasmania,'' Mr. Pittman said.
Yet in recent years, Mr. Mollison's ideas seem to have bubbled up from underground, into the mainstream. ''I just trained the Oklahoma National Guard,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''If that's any kind of benchmark.'' The troops, he said, plan to apply permaculture to farming and infrastructure projects in rural Afghanistan.
It's a system, permaculturists contend, that can work anywhere. In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Claudia Joseph, 53, has used the precepts of permaculture to develop new food gardens at the Old Stone House. (Its original 1699 Dutch edifice was a locus of the Battle of Brooklyn in the Revolutionary War.) ''It's a huge breakthrough,'' she said. ''To go from a swatch of grass to 1,000 blueberry bushes.''
The parks department recently bulldozed two of her gardens in an overhaul of the playground in the surrounding Washington Park. But in a few protected spots, Ms. Joseph, an environmental educator and consultant who lives two blocks away, has already started on an edible food forest.
This ''guild'' of complementary plants is the opposite of annual row-crop agriculture, with its dead or degraded soil and its constant demand for labor and fertilizer. Permaculture landscapes, which mimic the ecology of the area, are meant to be vertical, dense and self-perpetuating. Once the work of the original planting is done, Mr. Mollison jokes in one of his videos, ''the designer turns into the recliner.''
At the lowest level of a food forest, then, are subterranean crops like sweet potatoes and carrots. On the floor of the landscape, mushrooms can grow on felled logs or wood chips. Herbs go on the next level, along with ''delicious black cap raspberries,'' Ms. Joseph said.
Other shrubs, like inkberry, winterberry and elderberry, are attractive to butterflies and birds. They're an integral part of the system, too.
But more likely to appeal to the children who attend the nearby William Alexander Middle School is a Newtown Pippin apple tree, ''a variety first grown in Queens,'' Ms. Joseph said.
Ruling the forest's heights are the 40 large pin oaks already in the park, whose abundance of acorns will make a banquet for squirrels. Permaculture also looks favorably on high-quality bushmeat. But Ms. Joseph will be leaving that harvest well enough alone.
WITH its focus on close planting and human-scale projects, permaculture is ideally suited to a small suburban yard or a patio garden. But most of the students I met in Wisconsin had their own 1,000-blueberry-bush visions and ideas on how permaculture could help fulfill them.
Kellie Anderson, a 27-year-old rolfer, lived for five months in a giant sequoia tree named Keyandoora. (At the time, she was protesting a logging plan in Humboldt County, Calif.) After the workshop, Ms. Anderson said, she planned to inhabit a 1986 diesel school bus that she and her boyfriend were in the process of converting into a camper. But fortune seems to have taken her instead to Sanibel Island, Fla., where she is now helping to plan a sustainable-housing community.
Kris Beck, 48, a founder of an energy-efficiency tech company, had a notion to build a sanctuary with a megalithic stone circle (think Stonehenge) on her family's old Wisconsin dairy farm, along the Mississippi River bluffs.
Bruce Feldman, 60, who spent two decades as an English teacher overseas, experienced the collapse of the baht in Thailand (he was being paid in that currency), and an earthquake in Japan, in 1995, that left him wandering the streets for four days. These events, Mr. Feldman said, ''got me thinking that I should start preparing for my own future,'' ideally, a four- or five-acre self-reliant homestead in the Ozarks of Arkansas.
The site of the workshop was a permaculture Shangri-La unto itself: 60 acres of rolling pasture and woodlands, a few miles from the Buffalo River in Wisconsin. In 2004, Jeff Rabkin and his wife, Susan Scofield, bought this Amish farm for $125,000.
The original plan was to lease out the fields and build a cordwood cabin as a weekend home. Instead, under the influence of permaculture, Mr. Rabkin became seized with the idea of stewarding the property himself. To this end, he and a permaculture buddy, Victor Suarez, 44, bought a small flock of sheep and planted 300 fruit and nut trees.
During the work week, Mr. Rabkin, 49, and Ms. Scofield, 48, run a marketing and public relations firm in Minneapolis. That background is apparent in the catchy name they gave the place: Crazy Rooster Farm and Amish Telephone Booth.
But the Amish telephone booth is no gimmick. The couple installed a phone line in the shed next to their farmhouse, and their neighbors roll up in buggies to make calls.
While Amish visitors mill around in Mr. Rabkin's yard, they may strike a deal to sell him three steer and two heifers, or 20 black-locust fence posts. Like a coneflower patch draws honeybees, Mr. Rabkin said, ''I like to say that the telephone attracts beneficial wildlife -- our Amish neighbors -- which is what permaculture tells us to do.''
Ms. Scofield collected asparagus, beets and raw milk from neighboring farms to feed the permies. The occasional Amish visitor, like Thomas Zook, who delivered a bucketful of new potatoes in the middle of a downpour, gave a glimpse of what low-impact living might look like, taken to an extreme.
Mr. Zook's father, Jonas Zook, even dropped in to watch a video about pond management, but walked out after a minute or two. After marathon days of PowerPoint presentations, I wouldn't have minded joining him. For all its exhilarating ideals, permaculture is a movement grounded in ''zones,'' ''patterns'' and ''functions.''
Labs, as it were, took place in the toolshed. On the first day, Mr. Weiseman demonstrated how to create biochar, or partly burned charcoal, in a primitive ''rocket'' stove, a device he assembled out of a piece of ductwork and a paint can.
Helpful mineral elements attach themselves to the unique molecular structure of biochar, Mr. Weiseman explained. Mixed with compost, it makes a top-dressing for trees.
Next, he started bubbling compost tea with an aquarium pump in a plastic bucket. (''Even petroleum has a place in permaculture,'' he said. ''The five-gallon bucket is the greatest application of petroleum in the world.'') He wrapped a clump of standard compost in a cloth like a hobo's bandanna pack and dunked it in water. Next, he added molasses to feed the brew.
After a couple of days, we would fling this brownish broth over the kitchen garden to enrich the soil with beneficial bacteria.
That was the concept, anyway. A week after the workshop, I ran these theories past Jeff Gillman, 41, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and an author of four books about gardening practices and the environment.
He professed to be ''a believer in the whole concept of permaculture.'' But he dismissed the compost tea as ''lunacy.'' Scattering a few foreign microbes into a sea of soil, he said, was like parachuting 10,000 people across the breadth of the Sahara. They would not survive.
Normal compost, the solid stuff from a backyard bin, ''should already contain all the microbes that are beneficial to the soil,'' he said. And if it doesn't, ''beneficial microbes move in very, very quickly.''
With biochar, Mr. Gillman admitted to a bit of bafflement. ''Charcoal, in general, is not in and of itself harmful to soil,'' he explained. ''It helps to hold on to nutrients. But having said that, it boggles my mind why you would take a perfectly good block of wood that you could use as compost or mulch, and burn it.''
IN a broad sense, though, permaculture is not about the scientific method or textbook agronomy.
''I don't know that anyone has ever done a double-blind study of permaculture,'' said Mr. Pittman of the national Permaculture Institute. ''Most people in permaculture are not that interested in doing those kinds of studies. They're more interested in demonstrating it. You can see the difference in species diversity and yield just by looking at the system.''
As Mr. Weiseman observed, permaculture may be a ''leap of faith.'' But not leaping might have its own consequences.
Beginning with Mr. Mollison, permaculturists have forecast a near future of resource scarcity. ''Not just peak oil,'' Mr. Weiseman said, ''but peak water, peak soil.''
And the news, with its drumbeat of economic decline and ecological catastrophe, feeds the prophecies. In this dystopia to come, permaculture won't be a lifestyle choice, but a necessity.
''We know what's right,'' Mr. Weiseman said. ''We know what's best. We feel this thing in our bones and in our heart. And then we don't do anything about it. Or we do. And I did. And it's bearing fruit.''
But preparing for doomsday in San Francisco, Mr. Cody said, is not what draws a crowd of busy souls to shovel horse manure on a drizzly Saturday morning. To the 12 central tenets of permaculture, then, Mr. Cody added a 13th: ''If it's not fun, it's not sustainable.''
In other words, why mourn the eventual demise of our office blocks and factory farms, when there's a feast to be made, right now, in your own backyard?
The Movement in Your Backyard
A GOOD introduction to permaculture is Bill Mollison's 1991 book, ''Introduction to Permaculture'' (Tagari Publications, $25). For a start, it's 350 pages shorter and about $75 cheaper than his ''Permaculture: A Designers' Manual,'' the movement's full, unexpurgated testament.
The greatest hits of permaculture are all in the ''Introduction'': the ecological ethics, the landscape design principles, the domestic architecture. The book also dabbles in some colorful minutiae. Will shredded licorice root make suitable wall insulation? Does a goat like to munch carob pods? (Spoiler alert: the answer to both is yes.)
New Yorkers won't have much use for the section on ''Avenue Cropping Techniques for Monsoon Tropics.'' Permaculture's philosophy may be universal, but its practice, focusing on microclimates and native ecosystems, is strictly local.
In this spirit, dozens of cities hold regular permaculture gatherings. The New York Permaculture Meetup Group is one such place to post questions and view local projects. New members can join at nycpermaculture.info, and attend the next assembly on Aug. 2, said Alice Lo, 29, of Rego Park, Queens, one of the event's hosts.
If Meetup participants go home believers, they may be ready for the baptism of an immersive Permaculture Design Certificate Course. Many of these workshops take the form of a residency. Ms. Lo suggested a permaculture-and-yoga biathlon, Aug. 5 to 25, at an ashram/ranch in the Catskills. For information: (845) 436-6492 or sivananda.org/ranch/perma--design.html.
Wayne Weiseman, who taught my course at Crazy Rooster Farm and Amish Telephone Booth, worked as an organic farm manager, an outdoor skills instructor, a public school teacher, a cabinetmaker, a luthier and a New York cabdriver. He brings these trades to the teaching of permaculture. Mr. Weiseman will lead fall workshops in Jessup, Md., and Americus, Ga. (For information: www.permacultureproject.com).
Permaculture should be practiced at home. Commuters can be sojourners at courses in Brooklyn (permaculture-exchange.org), San Francisco (upisf.com), Oklahoma City and Albuquerque (permaculture.org).
And if all these newly minted permies feel compelled to quit their day jobs and start urban farms? Well, there goes the neighborhood.

HEADLINE: This Is Your Brain on Summer

BYLINE: By JEFF SMINK. 
Jeff Smink is the vice president for policy for the National Summer Learning Association.

 BODY:
Baltimore
THE American ideal of lazy summers filled with fun has an unintended consequence: If students are not engaged in learning over the summer, they lose skills in math and reading. Summers off are one of the most important, yet least acknowledged, causes of underachievement in our schools.
Decades of research confirm that summer learning loss is real. According to a report released last month by the RAND Corporation, the average summer learning loss in math and reading for American students amounts to one month per year. More troubling is that it disproportionately affects low-income students: they lose two months of reading skills, while their higher-income peers -- whose parents can send them to enriching camps, take them on educational vacations and surround them with books during the summer -- make slight gains. A study from Johns Hopkins University of students in Baltimore found that about two-thirds of the achievement gap between lower- and higher-income ninth graders could be explained by summer learning loss during the elementary school years. 
This learning loss is cumulative, summer after summer. It has a tremendous impact on students' success, including high school completion, post-secondary education and work force preparedness.
As a result, no matter how effective other school reforms are, our traditional 180-day school calendar creates an incredibly inefficient system of learning. We cannot afford to spend nearly 10 months of every year devoting enormous amounts of intellect, energy and money to promoting student learning and achievement, and then walk away from that investment every summer.
This waste is preventable. According to the RAND report, good summer programs with individualized instruction, parental involvement and small classes can keep children from falling behind and reduce the achievement gap.
Yet many districts, including New York City, have not fully embraced the summer's potential. In New York, around 34,000 third through eighth graders are required to take summer school classes this year in order to be promoted to the next grade. The classes typically last only half the day, leaving many on their own for the afternoon. And since such classes are primarily remedial, they often carry a stigma that can affect struggling students and their parents.
Fortunately, this remedial and often punitive model, which accounts for summer school's bad reputation, is beginning to change. Dennis M. Walcott, New York's schools chancellor, has expressed interest in more innovative summer school programming in collaboration with community partners.
Districts in Pittsburgh, Chicago, Providence and Baltimore have begun to move away from the remedial model and embrace a new vision of summer school that is both fun and an essential component of their education reform agendas. Pittsburgh is offering full-day summer programs framed as ''camp'' for all their elementary and middle school students that incorporate academics along with enrichment activities like judo and rowing.
Such programs are in high demand. A 2010 report by the Afterschool Alliance found that, while only 25 percent of students participated in summer learning programs, 83 percent of parents supported spending public funds on such programs and 67 percent of low-income parents said their children would enroll in a summer program if they could.
All students in high-need schools should have at least six weeks of full-day summer school that is comprehensive and engaging. Of course, summer school costs money, and money is tight. But there are many existing financing streams that can be tapped for summer schools, like the federal Title I program and school improvement grants. Schools could also do a better job of partnering with complementary summer programs run by libraries, parks and youth employment agencies.
Americans cherish the notion of summer as a time of relaxation and fun, but it comes at a heavy cost to poor students and the schools that serve them. This fall, despite any progress made during the school year, millions of students in urban communities will come back to school further behind than they were last spring. Until our nation addresses summer learning loss, efforts to close the achievement gap will continue to fall short.

HEADLINE: Dunkin' Offers A Bubble Lesson

BYLINE: By ROB COX, LISA LEE, FIONA MAHARG-BRAVO and GEORGE HAY

 BODY:
Silicon Valley has no monopoly on bubble thinking. This week's initial public offering of Dunkin' Brands, owner of the coffee and doughnuts chain and Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops, shows that in a low-growth world, even old-school businesses are capable of exciting investors to new heights of giddiness.
There's nothing fancy about Dunkin'. The company, which is based in Canton, Mass., has been doling out sugar and caffeine for 61 years. Indeed, it was the company's relatively mature and stable franchise model that attracted the local Boston buyout firms Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital, along with the Carlyle Group, to lard it up with debt a few years ago. 
Yet investors are treating Dunkin' as if it were a growth stock. The shares priced Tuesday at $19 a piece, nearly 20 percent above the bottom of the expected range. And in their debut on Wednesday they surged to close at $27.85. That pop of nearly 47 percent may sound relatively modest compared with some other recent market openings. Shares of LinkedIn, the professional social network, more than doubled at one point on their first day of trading earlier this year.
Trouble is, Dunkin' has no Internet frisson. Sure, it has the opportunity to expand geographically, both in the coffee-saturated American market and overseas. But at about $28 a share, the company sports an enterprise value of $5.4 billion.
Apply a healthy 10 percent growth rate to Dunkin's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the year ended in March, and the group is trading at 17 times those earnings.
By comparison, its fancier rival Starbucks is worth about 13 times 2011 estimated Ebitda. McDonald's, which is projected to improve its profit 11 percent this year, has a multiple of around 10.5 times.
Dunkin' hasn't given any indication in the recent past it can grow faster. Moreover, its net debt comes out to more than four times Ebitda. In short, it's a highly leveraged, older company trading at a big premium to its peers. The exuberance for perceived growth is spreading further and wider through the markets.
Weakness at Home
Banco Santander, Spain's biggest bank, may have passed the European-wide bank stress tests easily, but its first-half results were less of a breeze. Profit at the $85 billion institution fell short of expectations thanks to a one-time charge in Britain.
Contagion from within is still the bigger worry, even though Spain is a fraction of global business. Santander needs to do more to clear the danger. The extra $1 billion charge in Britain may have been unexpected, but it's hardly surprising. Other British banks have moved to cover claims on payment protection insurance -- cover that pays out on loan obligations in the case of illness or unemployment. Santander's first-half profits dropped 21 percent because of the charge. Strip this out, and the drop would have been 7 percent.
Bad loans in Spain and Brazil caused more grief. Brazil, which accounts for a quarter of Santander's net profit and is usually a bright spot, had a worrying 11 percent profit decline from the previous quarter.
But it is Spain that continues to be the largest source of concern. This may seem unfair: the country accounts for just 12 percent of Santander's profit, and loans to real estate developers are just 3.4 percent of the loan book. But every time Spanish bond yields rise, Santander shares dip.
The best way for Santander to distance itself from its home market, other than buy businesses abroad, is to increase provisions for losses related to property. Santander has set aside 32 percent of the value of foreclosed properties -- 40 percent on plots of land.
But this is not enough considering the dire state of the market. Increasing the overall coverage to 40 or 50 percent could relieve its balance sheet of the deadweight. Similarly, the coverage level for nonperforming and substandard real estate loans looks too low at 26 percent.
Even if it does an aggressive cleanup, Santander may not be rewarded by investors right away. And Spain is not its only problem -- poor stock market conditions have stalled a planned listing of its British arm. But more concerted action at home may eventually improve the flow of credit to the economy. Maybe it's time Santander took the lead.

HEADLINE: U.S. Unlikely to Default, S.&P. Chief Tells Panel

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States is unlikely to default on its debt obligations but its credit rating could still be lowered if it doesn't come up with an adequate plan to address spending and its soaring budget deficit, an official from one of the country's largest credit rating agencies told a House panel Wednesday.
The official, Deven Sharma, president of Standard & Poor's, added that deficit-reduction plans currently being considered in Congress could be enough to allow the United States to keep its triple-A credit rating. 
But Mr. Sharma declined to specify what level of cuts would be needed to maintain the top-level credit rating.
He said news articles last week ''misquoted'' a July 14 S.& P. report as saying that Congress would need to achieve at least $4 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years to maintain the country's triple-A rating.
A cut of $4 trillion, a number that is cited in the S.& P. report and that has been the focus of concern on Wall Street over the last two weeks, was ''within the threshold'' of what S.& P. thinks is necessary, Mr. Sharma said. But he declined to draw a bright line, saying only that ''some of the plans'' currently being considered on Capitol Hill ''could bring the U.S. debt burden and the deficit level in the range of a threshold for a triple-A rating.''
The remarks came at a hearing by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee. The hearing was scheduled to examine the performance of the major credit ratings agencies since changes in policies affecting the companies were instituted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The credit ratings agencies were sharply criticized after the financial crisis for offering top-level ratings on billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities that later lost substantial value when the housing market collapsed.
But the hearing quickly turned to the issue of what would happen if the nation were unable to meet its obligations because Congress did not raise the federal debt ceiling.
Pressed by Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, on whether the deficit-reduction plans put forth by the Obama administration or Senate Democrats would be sufficient to maintain the country's credit rating, both Mr. Sharma and Michael Rowan, global managing director in the commercial group of Moody's Investors Service, declined to comment.
Banking regulators who testified at the hearing were less hesitant to give their views about how a downgrade of the country's credit rating would affect the financial markets and banks.
David K. Wilson, senior deputy comptroller and chief national bank examiner in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said that members of Congress were ''right to worry'' about the possible unknown effects of a downgrade.
At the least, he said, borrowers would have to increase the amount of Treasury securities they offered as margin, or collateral for loans. A downgrade of the country's credit rating would probably also be followed by lower ratings on state and local government debt, he said.
Any difficulties would be ''manageable in the short term'' because even a downgrade to AA from the current AAA rating would still mean that Treasuries were ''very high-quality securities,'' Mr. Wilson said. The long-term effects of a ratings downgrade, he added, were unknown.
Asked by Representative Brad Miller, a Democrat from North Carolina, if he were ''right to worry that this could be real bad if our debt were downgraded,'' Mr. Wilson replied, ''You know, it's hard to measure, but I think you're right to worry. I mean, it could happen. It could be a big thing.''
Representatives from the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the comptroller's office all said they believed that the credit rating agencies were doing a better job of accurately assessing risks in their credit ratings now than they were before the financial crisis.
However, Mark E. Van Der Weide, senior associate director in the division of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, said ''the crucial thing is that no matter how good we think they're doing, we not over-rely on them -- not the government, not the private sector.''
Republican members of the panel also asked Mr. Sharma whether Treasury Department officials had pressured the company not to downgrade the United States credit rating.
In an April 27 letter to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the oversight subcommittee, questioned the appropriateness of the government protesting ratings changes ''given its regulatory and oversight role over the agencies.''
In a June 13 response, Mr. Geithner said the department had ''entirely appropriate'' contacts during the ratings review process with Standard & Poor's, which, he noted, ''we do not regulate or oversee.''
Mr. Sharma told the committee that its contacts with Treasury, which included the sharing with the department a draft news release about S.& P.'s decision to put the United States' credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade before the move was announced to the public, were ''standard operating process.''
Online Correction: July 27, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that officials from two credit rating agencies said the United States was unlikely to default.

HEADLINE: Someone Just Like Me Said, 'Buy It'

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
MAGAZINES have long been oracles of beauty advice for women. These days, beauty bloggers, celebrities and tweeting makeup artists also dole out tips and tout must-have products -- that they may have received free. But Makeup Alley, a 12-year-old low-frills Web site that focuses on user-generated reviews, has quietly come to be the standard bearer for the unvarnished truth about beauty products online.
According to its New York-based founder, Hara Glick -- who, unlike most beauty editors, is so low-profile that she didn't even want to be photographed for this article -- Makeup Alley now has 1.1 million members, which is roughly equivalent to the circulation of Allure. They hotly debate the finer points of Clarisonic skin-cleansing gadgets on the site's message boards, which get 45,000 posts daily (the site had 2.1 million unique visitors in June), Ms. Glick said. They also swap their used blush, lipstick and other items, so no ill-suited purchase goes to waste and something ''new'' is always in the mail, even if funds are low and outsiders think it's gross. 
On MUA, as Makeup Alley is known to its members (or MUA-ers), classics like Maybelline Great Lash are forever being debunked, and off-the-beaten-path finds like the exfoliating Salux nylon Japanese bath towel -- which, one reviewer joked, would be pried from her ''cold, dead, exquisitely exfoliated hands'' -- are talked up.
Most notably, Makeup Alley (which does not sell anything, and carries minimal and discreetly placed advertising) has a library of well-cataloged, super-specific criticism that allows women to do their prepurchase research among peers they trust, despite or perhaps because of their pseudonymity.
Becky Kester, a 36-year-old medical assistant from Bixby, Okla., and a top reviewer known as LuvsBrdedDragns at Makeup Alley, said that she trusts a product rated with four out of five ''lipsticks'' (the rating system) on MUA more than the winners of readers' awards in magazines like Allure and Self.
''It might be the 'best thing she's ever tried,' '' she said, referring to a hypothetical magazine tester, ''because they've given her $400 of free products -- really, everyone is for sale.'' But not MUA members, in Ms. Kester's judgment, because ''it's your sister, your neighbor, your co-worker; it is the people who are using the same product you're using without any kickback.''
''They got out and purchased it, used it,'' she continued, ''and they say, 'This is worth the money,' or 'Don't waste your money.' ''
Lupita Valdes, 33, a top reviewer at MUA under the pseudonym sugarmartini, estimated that no less than 98 percent of her purchases are based on MUA reviews. ''I take the time to look at reviews on my mobile before I buy,'' said Ms. Valdes, who works as a publicist in the entertainment industry in Panama.
Another fan is Umair Haque, the author of ''The New Capitalist Manifesto: Building a Disruptively Better Business,'' who stumbled on the site while searching for a perfume for a girlfriend. ''It's an economic engine for transparency and accountability in makeup,'' he said. Mr. Haque, a blogger for the Harvard Business Review, said he thought MUA was exemplary because ''people trust peers more than they trust anyone else, more than journalists or marketing departments.''
Why? ''They don't have a strategic conflict with their peers.''
As for beauty editors and reporters who recommend products? ''I'm not saying they don't have value,'' Mr. Haque said, ''but if you're looking for an unconflicted source, you'll probably look to a fellow consumer.''
Unlike magazine beauty editors or in-the-fold bloggers who might worry that they'd be disinvited to the next Chanel shindig, the average woman has little reason not to rant about the bad reaction she had to, say, one of the company's lipsticks.
During a recent interview, Ms. Glick -- a brunette with a few sprouting grays who was chicly dressed in white jeans, an airy blouse and tan ballet flats with a sparkly toe box -- was self-effacing, yet adamant about keeping the MUA community pure. Her company, which employs fewer than 10 people, makes its money solely from advertising; its purpose, she said, was to give members the tools to become ''informed consumers.''
Ms. Glick, who when it came to her age would say only that she is in her early 40s, would not say whether MUA is in the black, but high profits do not seem to be the point. ''We are not saving lives, but what we are doing is noble,'' she said. ''We allow consumers to connect to other consumers and gain knowledge, and that's a noble thing.''
Top MUA reviewers have hundreds, even thousands of critiques under their pseudonyms, so if someone posts a one-word review (''awesome!''), or has only a few, then users are quick to flush them out. (One can't start a review thread on the site without having more than 20 reviews, and ones that contain advertising or profanity are rejected.) The most prized recommendation comes from a ''skin twin,'' MUA-speak for a woman who mirrors one's complexion and concerns. (Members may remain virtually invisible, or disclose the color of their hair and eyes, skin tone and type, and age.)
And now, MUA itself is getting a kind of skin twin -- with a commercial edge. Bloom.com, a ''social beauty store'' that makes its official debut in August, will allow members to fill out a profile, including data about their skin, age and concerns. A search for a specific product, like mascara, will produce six recommendations, based on the reviews of 20,000 women who participated in focus groups or who are currently members. Soon, members will be able to see who recommended the products, and click that person's reviews, before buying.
''The best recommendations come from women like you,'' said Julie Mahloch, 42, who founded Bloom.com with Nick Hudson, 39, who worked for Boots for 12 years. She added: ''My friend might have my best interests at heart, but probably not the same skin type or concerns that I do. We want to take it to the next level and, using the power of thousands of women, to match you based on a number of profile data points with women who are like you.''
Matching women with similar beauty concerns leads to ''an extremely high satisfaction rate,'' said Mrs. Mahloch, who previously worked on hayneedle.com, a home furnishing site.
The founders are so confident in peer-to-peer recommendations that Bloom.com will offer refunds for up to a year after purchase, sort of like allowing a half-eaten meal to be sent back to the kitchen. ''One of our goals is to end the beauty graveyard,'' she said.
Eleven percent of Bloom.com members have olive, dark and very dark skin. However, Mr. Hudson expects that figure will more than double to 24 to 28 percent after August when the site is officially open. By contrast, Makeup Alley is diverse enough to have plenty of ppps (or porcelain pale princesses) and lolas (lovely Latinas) as members nickname themselves. In the spirit of recycling, they pack up and trade purchases they regret.
''Every woman has a drawer of makeup they wear twice a year,'' said Ms. Kester, the medical assistant from Oklahoma, who has traded 700 times. (Most products can be sanitized, she said, but she'll trade only with someone with a proven track record or have the new member send her package first to prevent ''swap-lifting,'' or one-sided trades).
But not everyone wants other people's makeup, or amateur advice in a world that also offers tweets from makeup artists like Pat McGrath, the creative adviser for Dolce & Gabbana the Makeup.
''The masses could be using the product incorrectly,'' said Polly Blitzer of Beautyblitz.com, an editorial site that positions itself as a ''the insider's insider.'' ''We are the beauty editors. The stuff we say is good is sifted through.'' She has looked at MUA only once or twice, she said, but she can see why some beauty-obsessed consumers use it.
''Some women don't want to have a face-to-face adviser, someone at a counter; they think they could be biased,'' Ms. Blitzer said. ''Sometimes they want to gather information and have a chat and see what people think.''

HEADLINE: Delta's Earnings Hurt by Fuel Costs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines on Wednesday reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street estimates as fuel costs grew faster than revenue. Shares in the company fell to a new low for the year. 
Concerns about a fall travel slowdown and an uncertain global economy have hurt airline stocks in the last week. On Wednesday, AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines and US Airways Group also hit new lows for the year.
''The market, especially with cyclicals like airlines, is just very nervous,'' said Ray Neidl, senior aerospace sector analyst with Maxim Group, ''and then pile on top of that the uncertainty with fuel prices,''
Delta, the second-largest airline behind United Continental Holdings, has invested in new airplane seats and better food and wine offerings to increase revenue. It is also cutting costs not related to fuel.
The airline is reducing flying in areas where revenue is not keeping up with rises in fuel cost. It said Wednesday that it would cut fourth-quarter capacity by 4 to 5 percent. Earlier this month, it said it would end unprofitable service to some smaller American cities like Butte, Mont.
More than 2,000 Delta workers will be leaving under a voluntary exit program, the airline said. The carrier is also consolidating its United States facilities and is retiring its least fuel-efficient planes.
Delta said it expects a profit for the current quarter but that it still had a lot of work to do to lower costs.
''The challenge to the airlines right now is absorbing higher fuel costs,'' said Matthew Jacob, senior airlines analyst at ITG Investment Research.
He added: ''It's hard to overlook the silver lining that higher oil prices have on the industry at large in that it really forces the airlines to be more disciplined with costs and with capacity plans.''
Net income at Delta was $198 million, or 23 cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with $467 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, Delta earned 43 cents a share, a penny short of analysts' average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters.
Quarterly revenue rose 12 percent, to $9.15 billion. Operating expenses rose 19 percent, with aircraft fuel and related costs up 36 percent.
Delta said its average fuel price for the second quarter was $3.22 a gallon, up 90 cents from a year earlier. It expects an average fuel cost of $3.20 a gallon for the current quarter.
Shares of Delta ended Wednesday down 5.11 percent, to $7.61, 17 cents below the previous low for the year. They traded as low as $7.29 earlier in the session.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Battle Over Airline Carbon Fees

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Sharply divergent climate change policies on opposite sides of the Atlantic are setting off political fireworks as European environmental regulators prepare to extend their reach across the ocean. Starting Jan. 1, the European Union will require all carriers entering or leaving its airports to either reduce their emissions or pay a charge -- whether the airline is United, Air France or Lufthansa.
Until now, the United States and Europe have taken a to-each-his-own attitude on how to handle the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, leaving American consumers largely immune to aggressive European environmental regulation and its costs. But come 2012, Americans flying to Europe are likely to be paying indirectly for the emissions their trips create -- chiefly through steeper fares, although uncertainty persists about how much higher they will be.
American carriers and air freight companies will also face a new type of competition, because the ''cleanest'' airlines will pay less in emissions fees. 
The United States airline industry has fought aggressively against inclusion in the European Union Emissions Trading System, most recently in a lawsuit filed before the European Court of Justice, the European Union's highest court. It argues that the European Union has no legal right to regulate American carriers or flight emissions that are released over other countries or into international airspace as planes make their way across the ocean. A ruling is not expected until late this year at the earliest.
The issue has also created diplomatic tensions. ''The European Union is imposing this on U.S. carriers without our agreement,'' Wendell Albright, director of the Office of Aviation Negotiations at the State Department, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''It is for the U.S. to decide on targets or appropriate action for U.S. airlines with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.''
He said the Obama administration had voiced its displeasure to the European Union and was ''exploring various options'' to address the standoff.
The European emissions trading system relies on a cap-and-trade mechanism in which companies that exceed their government-mandated targets for reducing their carbon dioxide emissions must buy carbon permits from businesses that earned them by emitting less than they were allowed. New industries enter the program each year.
American carriers project that they will end up spending $3.1 billion on the carbon permits by 2020. That could ultimately raise the price of a trans-Atlantic ticket as much as $57 for a flight from New York to London, according to some industry estimates.
The European Union is ''attempting to regulate the airlines of the world,'' said Nancy Young, vice president for environmental affairs at the Air Transport Association, the largest airline industry group in the United States. ''The plan violates international law.''
European Union officials are standing firm, saying that adding civil aviation and cargo flights to Europe's expanding emissions trading system is both legal and nonnegotiable.
''In Europe, we're trying to do something with climate change and we now have emissions targets for sector after sector,'' said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action. ''We now include power producers, we now include manufacturing, so how can we not include aviation?''
Under the current plan, all airlines flying into airports within the European Union will have to reduce their emissions next year by 3 percent from average levels between 2004 and 2006, or buy carbon permits to make up the difference.
Ms. Hedegaard added that was unfair to require European airlines to pay for their pollution on routes that United Airlines or Air China flew for free.
At a hearing before the European Court of Justice last month, lawyers from the European Union and environmental groups said inclusion was legal, comparing the emissions fees to a landing charge or to a prohibition on overly noisy aircraft.
Annie Petsonk, a lawyer who attended for the Environmental Defense Fund and who previously worked for the Justice Department, said: ''The E.U. system is not a tax -- if you don't want to pay you can reduce your emissions. ''
At the heart of the dispute are the disparate political positions taken by Europe and the United States on appropriate measures for reining in greenhouse gas emissions and the gravity of climate change. Carbon dioxide emissions from air travel are one of the fastest-growing sources of the gases that scientists say are warming the planet, and they have an outsize effect because they are released high in the atmosphere, scientists say.
While a substantial contingent in Congress continues to express skepticism that human-caused climate change is a serious problem, European countries have been obliged to reduce emissions since 2005 under the Kyoto Protocol, which was never ratified by the United States.
Countries like Britain have written stringent emissions reductions targets into law. With those in mind, Britain refused last year to permit construction of a new runway at Heathrow Airport because it would enable more air travel. British companies, including the telecommunications company Vodafone and Aveva, a software giant, have taken steps to cut business flying.
International climate treaties assign the International Civil Aviation Organization, a body that governs protocols and procedures for global aviation, to oversee the reduction of airline emissions through its member states. The Obama administration, while emphasizing that it supports programs to reduce the growth in airline emissions, has cited such treaties in arguing that the European Union has overstepped its jurisdiction.
But critics counter that the aviation organization, which consists of representatives from 190 nations, has been ineffective on that front, relying on purely voluntary measures. ''We would have liked to see a global agreement, but for how long can this sector avoid being part of the solution to the climate problem?'' Ms. Hedegaard said.
Perry Flint, a Washington spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, said that the American airline fleet was generally older and therefore less fuel-efficient than its Western European counterpart. But many American carriers are already taking steps to reduce emissions, like buying more fuel-efficient jets and flying more direct routes. Those efforts have been driven primarily by high fuel costs and a desire to project an environmentally friendly corporate image, not by the anticipated European mandates.
This month, American Airlines, which has flown an all-Boeing fleet since 2009, announced that it had bought more than 250 new planes from the European manufacturer Airbus, citing efficiency as a big factor.
With their European Court case unlikely to be decided soon, American carriers have started monitoring and reporting emissions from their flights to the European Union as required in preparation for entering the system -- albeit ''under protest.''
Other foreign airlines like the national carrier Air China have been negotiating separately with the European Union. The Europeans have said that airlines could be exempted from the system if they proposed equivalent emissions-reducing measures at home; these might include using cleaner fuels.
Part of the uncertainty over the extent of a ticket price increase -- the European Union suggests it might just be a few dollars -- is rooted in how carbon permit prices vary over time, depending on demand. Currently the price is low because of the global recession.
In 2012, the European Union plans to hand out a substantial number of free credits to ease the transition. But airlines that significantly improve their environmental performance might not need to buy the credits at all. They could even earn extra credits to sell, which could in theory reduce the price of a ticket.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prioritizing Payments

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department is preparing to answer a question that it has dodged and rebuffed for months: If there's not enough money for everyone, who is left empty-handed? 
Officials said Wednesday that the department would address the issue later this week unless it became clear that Congress would vote by Aug. 2 to let the government borrow more money.
The outlines of the answer, however, already are clear. Officials have said repeatedly that Treasury does not have the legal authority to pay bills based on political, moral or economic considerations. It cannot, for instance, set aside invoices from weapons companies to preserve money for children's programs.
The implication is that the government will need to pay bills in the order that they come due. President Obama has warned as a result that the government ''cannot guarantee'' payments of Social Security benefits or other popular programs. Officials also have disputed the assertion of some Republicans that the government could prioritize interest payments.
Several independent analysts estimate there is enough money on hand to pay the bills until Aug. 10. Treasury has declined to provide its own estimate.
''You're basically running on fumes from midnight Aug. 2 forward,'' the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters Wednesday.
With time running short, a planning process that began early this year with small meetings that even participants did not take entirely seriously has grown into a consuming preoccupation.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, continues to meet with staff still working on other issues. On Thursday morning he is scheduled to meet the president of the Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara. But most of Mr. Geithner's time is now devoted to advising the president and bracing the department.
The technical challenges are formidable. The government keeps its cash on deposit at the regional banks of the Federal Reserve, which issue payments at Treasury's direction. The process, largely automatic, must be adjusted to allow for human intervention.
Officials also are starting to address the consequences likely to flow from a disruption in payments.
The federal agency that oversees national banks said Wednesday that it would tell banks to ''exercise judgment'' before penalizing customers who overdrew their accounts because money from the government that did not arrive on schedule.

PERSON: Rev. John Stott 

HEADLINE: Rev. John Stott, Major Evangelical Figure, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON; Dennis Hevesi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Rev. John Stott, one of the world's most influential figures in the spread of evangelical Christianity over the past half-century, died Wednesday in Lingfield, Surrey, in the south of England. He was 90.
His death was confirmed by Suanne Camfield, a spokeswoman for his publisher, InterVarsity Press.
The religion scholar Michael Cromartie once said that if evangelicals could elect a pope, they would be likely to choose Mr. Stott. Though less known in the United States and hardly a household name outside the evangelical sphere, Mr. Stott, an author, preacher and theologian, was often compared to the Rev. Billy Graham, his American contemporary.
But while Mr. Graham's influence is rooted in a rousing preaching style and a personal magnetism that has filled stadiums, Mr. Stott's relied on a proliferation of books -- grounded in learning but accessible to all -- and the evangelical organization he founded, Langham Partnership International, named after its cradle, All Souls Church at Langham Place in London's West End. 
''We must be global Christians,'' he once wrote, ''with a global mission, because our God is a global God.''
Beginning at the college campus level and branching out country by country, the Langham Partnership (known as the John Stott Ministries in the United States) grew into an organization comprising 5 national and 10 regional nondenominational movements.
Before then, through the Anglican Church, Mr. Stott had led a revival of evangelical Christianity in Britain, exhorting Britons to find personal salvation by repenting sin and accepting Jesus as their savior.
But he also demanded that evangelicals look beyond liturgy and Christian tradition and remain engaged in worldly matters -- ''to take more responsible attitudes toward economics, the arts, politics and culture in general,'' as Mark A. Noll, a University of Notre Dame professor and scholar of the movement, said in an interview in 2007.
''And perhaps most importantly,'' Professor Noll added, Mr. Stott became ''a patron, mentor, friend and encourager of thousands of pastors, students and laypeople from the newer Christian parts of the world.'' He became a bridge, Professor Noll said, ''between the West and the rising Christian world.''
Mr. Stott was dedicated to helping the poor in developing countries, what he termed the Majority World. Using royalties from his books, he set up trusts to help gifted students from the developing world earn doctorates abroad and then return to their native countries to teach in theological seminaries.
For all his fame on several continents, Mr. Stott's travels and appearances were remarkably devoid of pomp, befitting his simple message of reason and faith and his unassuming demeanor. Those in his ministries knew him simply as Uncle John. In his later years, he lived in a two-room apartment over the garage of a London rectory, and for many years he kept a small cottage on the Welsh coast, where he did much of his prodigious writing in longhand and, until 2001, without electricity.
''Pride is without doubt the greatest temptation of Christian leaders,'' Mr. Stott said in 2006 during a visit to the United States. ''And I'm very well aware of the dangers of being feted and don't enjoy it and don't think one should enjoy it.''
Believing the college campus to be the most effective pulpit from which to preach, he frequently led weeklong evangelist meetings at universities in Australia, Asia, Africa, North America and elsewhere around the world. One event drew as many as 18,000 students. Until 2003 he was an active vice president of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students.
''I declare myself an impenitent believer in the power of preaching,'' he told an evangelical group in New York in 2006, by then a frail and stooped figure walking with a cane. ''The pew cannot rise higher than the pulpit.''
Mr. Stott, a leading evangelical theologian, was regarded as the framer of the Lausanne Covenant, a declaration of the movement's beliefs and global aspirations. Drafted in Switzerland in 1974 at an international evangelical congress, it is regarded as a 20th-century milestone of evangelicalism.
Mr. Stott was the author of about 50 books published in 65 languages. Among his best known are ''Basic Christianity'' (1958), ''Christ the Controversialist'' (1970) and ''The Cross of Christ'' (1986).
''Basic Christianity'' alone has been translated into more than 60 languages and has sold more than 2.5 million copies, according to the John Stott Ministries, which said his books have sold more than eight million copies worldwide. His last book -- he himself described it as such -- was ''The Radical Disciple: Some Neglected Aspects of Our Calling,'' published in 2010.
''To read Stott is to see someone practicing 'thoughtful allegiance' to Scripture,'' David Brooks wrote in The New York Times in an admiring column 1n 2004 titled, ''Who Is John Stott?''
''For him, Christianity means probing the mysteries of Christ. He is always exploring paradoxes. Jesus teaches humility, so why does he talk about himself so much? What does it mean to gain power through weakness, or freedom through obedience? In many cases the truth is not found in the middle of apparent opposites, but on both extremes simultaneously.''
The books have become staples of evangelicalism, said David Neff, editor of the evangelical publication Christianity Today. ''Almost anyone who is a leader in American evangelicalism has read those books and been shaped by them.''
John Robert Walmsley Stott was born in London on April 27, 1921, the youngest of three children of Sir Arnold W. Stott, a prominent physician and an agnostic, and his wife, Emily, a Lutheran who attended All Souls. His older sisters died before him. A lifelong celibate, he left no immediate survivors.
The young Mr. Stott originally intended to train for the diplomatic service, but influenced by the Christian Gospel, he changed plans while still in preparatory school, determined to enter the Anglican Church.
He graduated from Trinity College at Cambridge in 1943; transferred to Ridley Hall Theological College, also at Cambridge; and was ordained a minister in the Church of England in 1945. He started as an assistant curate at All Souls Church. After receiving a master's degree at Cambridge in 1947, he advanced, at the age of 29, to rector of the church in 1950. When he turned rector emeritus in 1975, he moved from the rectory to a modest apartment over its garage.
The British government acknowledged his contributions in 2006 by naming him a Commander of the British Empire. He was appointed a chaplain to the queen in 1959 and served in that post until he reached retirement age in 1991. In 2005, Time magazine selected him as one the world's ''100 Most Influential People.'' He retired from the public ministry in 2007.
An avid birder and bird photographer, Mr. Stott took his binoculars and cameras on all his travels and wrote a book about the many species he encountered. Titled ''The Birds Our Teachers: Biblical Lessons From a Lifelong Bird-Watcher'' (1999), the book is illustrated with his own photographs.
At Mr. Stott's death at the retirement home, his friends and associates were at his bedside, reading Scriptures and listening to Handel's ''Messiah,'' the All Souls Church Web site said.
''The evangelical world has lost one of its greatest spokesmen,'' Mr. Graham said in a statement on Wednesday, ''and I have lost one of my close personal friends and advisers. I look forward to seeing him again when I go to heaven.''

HEADLINE: Kosovo Firebombing Underscores New Ethnic Tensions

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Two violent episodes this week along Kosovo's northern border with Serbia -- the latest being Wednesday's firebombing of a customs post by a group of about 200 Serbs -- have shed new light on the increase in tensions in the area between ethnic Serbs and Albanians. 
No one was hurt in the firebombing, according to The Associated Press. It occurred hours after Kosovo's special police withdrew from the area after seizing a border post on Monday night and trying to take control of a second one. A Kosovo police officer was killed in the police action.
The Kosovo government had said it was exercising its right as a sovereign country to take control of its own borders, but the action took the European Union and NATO by surprise and stirred fears of a new cycle of ethnic unrest in Kosovo, a country of 1.7 million people.
Despite the presence of more than 5,000 NATO troops and 3,200 European Union officials, the area remains volatile, and the episode prompted Serbia to request an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council. A closed meeting of the 15-member Council was set for Thursday so it could be briefed by the peacekeeping department. Diplomats said they needed to learn more information about the situation in Kosovo before deciding whether it needed to be addressed in a larger, open session.
American and European officials called on President Boris Tadic of Serbia and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of Kosovo to ease the crisis.
''Unilateral actions by one side or the other are not helpful,'' said Nicholas Hawton, a spokesman for the European Union's Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, known as Eulex, which has been responsible for the border crossings between Kosovo and Serbia since 2008. Ethnic Serbs living in these enclaves and border towns depend on financial, economic and social assistance from Serbia.
Mr. Tadic urged an immediate end to the violence. ''Hooligans who cause violence are not defending Serbia or the Serbian citizens,'' he said in a statement. He also called on Serbs in Kosovo to remain calm.
Mr. Tadic, who won widespread praise for handing over Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander and war crimes suspect, to the Hague tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, also tried to calm the situation by sending top officials to Kosovo to negotiate with NATO. ''We do not want any war,'' Mr. Tadic said, according to Tanjug, the Serbian news agency.
In an effort to defuse the situation, NATO opened talks between all parties, a move that was praised by the United States.
Northern Kosovo's border area, which is populated mainly by ethnic Serbs, has been a source of tension since Kosovo declared independence in early 2008, a move that was recognized by the United States and all but five European Union countries but not by Serbia or Russia. Kosovo owes its independence to NATO, which intervened in 1999 to stop the ethnic cleansing being carried out by Serbian forces.
Serbia has imposed a unilateral embargo on Kosovo goods, and last week Kosovo retaliated with a similar ban on Serbian products. In addition, Serbs sending goods to Kosovo have refused to accept on their customs declaration forms the stamp with the Republic of Kosovo insignia. Serbian commercial vehicles, however, are still allowed to cross into Kosovo as the European Union continues to try to negotiate some kind of compromise.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Announces Morning Discussions

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Business, not cultural affairs, will be on the breakfast menu at Lincoln Center this fall as the Center begins a morning series where leaders will ''discuss significant issues facing American society.'' Reynold Levy, the center's president is to announce the breakfast series on Tuesday. 
The Lincoln Center Dialogue series will be held at the David Rubenstein Atrium and its first conversation on Sept. 28 - ''Private Equity, Public Scrutiny'' - will feature the venue's namesake, David Rubenstein, the managing director and co-founder of the Carlyle Group who is also on Lincoln Center's board. The other participant is Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the Blackstone Group.
The discussions this fall will be moderated by Tom Brokaw, the journalist and author, and will all focus on business and the economy. Mr. Levy said future dialogues would feature other topics.
In bringing early morning activity to the campus, the program represents an ongoing effort to remake Lincoln Center as a 24/7 hub of activity and the 200-seat atrium offers an intimate setting, Mr. Levy said. ''You'll have a good shot at asking a question,'' he added, ''and getting an answer.''
On October 12, Blair Effron, the founder of Centerview partners and a Lincoln Center trustee, and Greg Fleming, the president of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will discuss the American economy. On Nov. 16th Peter R. Orszag, the vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup and Ruth Porat, the executive vice chairwoman and chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley will address America's competitive challenges. Morgan Stanley is the series' corporate sponsor.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Debt Impasse Fuels Sharp Fall in Stocks

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Skittish investors pulled back from stocks on Wednesday as the impasse over lifting the nation's debt limit wore on in Washington.
In addition, traders continued to worry about the nation's economic outlook as some companies delivered disappointing earnings. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 27.05 points, or 2.03 percent, to 1,304.89. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 198.75 points, or 1.59 percent, to 12,302.55. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 75.17 points, or 2.65 percent, to 2,764.79.
Juniper Networks fell 20.89 percent, to $24.66, after it forecast market weakness and lower spending by businesses.
Cisco Systems lost 3.68 percent, to $15.69.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to 101 7/32, and its yield rose to 2.98 percent, from 2.96 percent late Tuesday.
Stanley A. Nabi, chief strategist for Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said investors were also focused on a number of companies with earnings this week that had some disappointing aspects, like 3M. The company said on Tuesday that it had record second-quarter sales but full-year growth would be affected by the Japan earthquake.
''I think this has raised a red flag of caution,'' he said.
''On the Nasdaq, the small caps are getting hurt more than the general market. On a relative basis, they have become considered overvalued,'' Mr. Nabi said.
The Federal Reserve's survey of economic conditions in 12 districts throughout the country, known as the beige book, said on Wednesday that some companies were already feeling the effect of the uncertainty as the debt talks dragged on and were delaying business decisions.
Advertising and consulting firms in the Boston district, for example, ''say their services may be some of the first cut if companies become pessimistic and retrench, so they fear that failure to resolve the debt ceiling issue could have huge negative ramifications for their firms and for the general economy,'' the report said.
The survey also reported that growth had moderated, based on information collected on or before July 15.
But it was the lack of a deal to raise the debt limit in the United States that has been predominantly hanging over the financial markets for the last week. And while there was little movement to bring the two sides in Washington closer to a deal, there was plenty of action in the markets.
''The downgrade of U.S. credit is not going to be a good thing for us,'' said Laura LaRosa, director of fixed income at the investment firm Glenmede. ''If the U.S. gets downgraded, that is a disrupting event for the markets, no matter what. We have never been anything but triple AAA.''
Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said the negotiations, ''or lack thereof, continue to command much of the investment community's attention right now.''
''But the risk that the political dysfunction will take us too close to the brink increases with each passing day,'' he wrote in a research note.

HEADLINE: New Museum Struggles on Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- When the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art opened in November in Biloxi, Miss., residents were not sure what to make of the quirky little museum dedicated to an eccentric Mississippi potter and designed by the architect Frank Gehry.
Some loved it. Some hated it. And plenty of people along the stretch of the Gulf Coast often called the Redneck Riviera wondered if there was room for high art and architecture amid the casinos and fishing charters. 
There may not be. After surviving Hurricane Katrina, the gulf oil spill and an economy that has battered the tourist trade, the museum is almost out of cash, hurt by fewer visitors than it had hoped for, higher operating costs than it expected and less city support than it had counted on.
''We'll need some intervention within a matter of weeks or we will be totally out of funds,'' said Larry Clark, president of the museum's board.
Already, hours have been cut back. Insurance, which is exceptionally expensive for a building that houses irreplaceable art just yards from the Gulf of Mexico, has been negotiated down to its minimum.
Among the other tremendous expenses: Simply trying to keep the galleries below 30 percent humidity to protect art in a climate where the humidity can reach 90 percent costs thousands of dollars every month.
The O'Keefe Foundation, named after a local businessman, Jerry O'Keefe, the museum's benefactor, has allowed an emergency infusion of $100,000. Several donors have also been tapped, Mr. Clark said. And a major fall fund-raiser sponsored by the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino is planned.
The museum, which features curving brickwork and twisting stainless steel structures, is only partly finished. Three of five buildings are open, and another is scheduled for early spring.
Although there are rotating exhibits, the centerpiece is a collection of fancifully glazed ceramics by George Ohr, the self-described ''mad potter of Biloxi'' who died in 1918 and is regarded as a forerunner of the American modern art movement.
''The sad part is we have the money in the bank to finish the campus,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We are hoping that tourism in our area rebounds and we can get assistance from the city.''
The city says it is broke.
''They have been coming to us ever since it started,'' said A. J. Holloway, the mayor. ''We help them as much as we can, but the financial condition of the city is real tough right now. We don't have any surplus.''
The city owns the four acres on which the museum sits, and in 2004 gave in-kind support and cash worth $185,000, said the executive director, Denny Mecham. The mayor, who considers himself more of a jock than an art connoisseur, said, ''We're hoping a fairy godmother comes up and puts some money on the table.''
Museum backers and even civic leaders who do not much like the building still hope for what has come to be known as the ''Bilbao effect.'' When Mr. Gehry's massive, titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum opened in Bilbao, Spain, in 1997, thousands of art tourists helped revive that dying industrial town.
That has not happened yet in Biloxi, although the building and its collections have earned critical praise. ''It wasn't really a popular thing for the city,'' Mr. Holloway said. ''The residents of the city were never really behind it.''
Part of the problem might have been the four supersize, twisted steel eggs that make up part of the galleries, which sat on the side of the road for years while the area tried to recover from the hurricane. People likened them to giant crushed beer cans.
Then there was the cost, which climbed to more than $45 million from about $15 million .
Museum officials said Mr. Gehry was aware of the problems. His office said he was out of the country and would have no comment on them.
Backers of the museum are not giving up.
''We've come an awful long way, and we're not going to stop now,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We're still kicking.''

HEADLINE: At Ikea's Only U.S. Factory, Workers Vote to Join Union

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Workers in southern Virginia at Ikea's only factory in the United States voted Wednesday to belong to a union. 
Employees at the Swedwood plant in Danville, Va., voted 221-69 to have the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers represent them in collective bargaining, union and plant officials said. The National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the vote, has not officially released the results.
Bill Street, a union organizer and director of the international's woodworkers unit, said he was surprised by the margin of victory. He said ''everything's on the table'' when union officials sit down with the company once the vote is certified. Ken Brown, site plant manager, said in a statement that the company officials ''fully support the right of our co-workers to make this decision.''
The union described working conditions at the Danville plant as akin to those in a developing nation. The 312 workers assemble the utilitarian bookshelves and coffee tables that the Swedish furniture giant sells. Union officials say they have complained of low wages, unsafe working conditions and erratic scheduling.
Ikea said the Virginia plant, in an economically depressed region, operates by the same principles as its 26 Swedwood plants in Europe.

HEADLINE: An I.P.O. Built on the Basics: Sugar and Coffee

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
The latest splashy stock debut had all the markings of a sizzling technology start-up company: a better-than-expected offering price, a swarm of investors clamoring for shares and a first-day pop that defied a broader market drop.
But the company was not an online music service or a social networking site. It was a fast-food chain that sells bite-size Munchkin donuts and extra-large cups of coffee. 
On Wednesday, shares of the Dunkin' Brands Group, which priced its initial public offering at $19 a share, soared 46.6 percent, to close at $27.85. In spite of the turbulent market conditions related to the gridlock over the debt ceiling talks, the stock was flying high.
The gains on the first day mimicked those of newly minted Internet stocks like LinkedIn, Yandex and Pandora. At that level, Dunkin', whose shares trade on the Nasdaq market under the ticker symbol DNKN, is valued at about $3.5 billion.
''People love brands, and we have two iconic brands with real history,'' said Nigel Travis, the company's chief executive. ''We felt like this was good timing.''
For all the attention heaped on Facebook, Groupon, Zynga and other technology start-ups developing the next new thing, demand has been just as strong for some basic businesses that sell food, clothes and other consumer goods.
A crush of international and domestic investors tried to get initial public stock offering shares of Dunkin', with orders amounting to more than 20 times the size of the eventual offering, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. In all, Dunkin' sold 22.25 million shares and raised $422.75 million.
Over the last year, 20 consumer-oriented companies have gone public, generating average returns of 29.5 percent, according to Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. advisory firm. Francesca's Holdings, a women's boutique chain that went public last week, is trading 56 percent above its offering price. Despite getting off to a shaky start, retail offerings overseas have also posted strong gains, with Prada up 25 percent from its initial offering and Ferragamo up 44 percent.
By comparison, there have been 50 technology offerings in the last 12 months that have gained a more modest 21.7 percent on average. The initial offering market over all is up 16.4 percent in the same period, based on Renaissance Capital data.
''Consumer I.P.O.'s are resonating well because they are easy to understand,'' said Paul Bard, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital. ''Despite cautious signals, investors are looking forward and expecting consumer spending to improve.''
For Dunkin's new investors, the offering was an opportunity to bet on a well-known brand that is expanding in the United States. Its brands Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins have long been staples in America's quick-food industry, with histories stretching back to the 1950s. Five years ago, the spirits maker Pernod Ricard sold the company for $2.4 billion to the private equity firms Bain Capital Partners, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, which still own 78.3 percent.
Dunkin', which makes nearly all its money from franchising, blankets the New England and New York areas with about one store for every 9,700 people. In contrast, the Western half of the United States suffers from a severe Coolatta shortage. Unlike the coffee-peddling rivals McDonald's and Starbucks, which have thousands of locations in the region, Dunkin' Donuts has just 109 outlets. According to Mr. Travis, the company will open about 250 stores this year and will double the number of American stores in 20 years.
''This is a long-term play for us,'' said Josef Schuster, the founder of the money manager IPOX Schuster, which got shares in the Dunkin' offering. ''Although their sales growth is modest, they haven't touched the West, and that's where strong earnings growth can come from.''
Unlike Web start-ups, consumer stocks are often established companies generating cash and profits. In 2010, Dunkin' Brands earned $26.9 million on revenue of $577.1 million. Teavana and the Chefs' Warehouse, other retail companies that are expected to start trading this week, are both profitable, too.
The consumer stocks are also cheaper in many cases. Dunkin' is selling for about six times sales. LinkedIn trades around 39 times trailing sales.
''Many of these companies have a strong earnings record and are modestly priced,'' said Mr. Schuster, who also owns the stocks of other recent offerings like Francesca's and Vera Bradley, the accessories maker. ''As these stocks continue to perform well, demand increases for consumer brand I.P.O.'s.''
Consumer stocks, particularly newly minted ones, are hardly a sure bet, particularly in an environment with a weak job market, anemic economic growth and global uncertainty. The private equity-backed Dunkin' has the added burden of a $1.89 billion debt load. The company plans to use proceeds from the offering to help pay down its debt, according to a recent filing.
Retail companies typically do not have the same trajectory as fast-growing technology start-ups, either. Revenue at Dunkin' increased 7 percent in 2010. LinkedIn's sales more than doubled in the same period.
And today's hot I.P.O. can always turn out to be tomorrow's dud. Shares of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, the fast-food chain that had a popular offering in 2000 and at one point traded for nearly $50, is currently at $8.27.
Still, the mood was celebratory on Wednesday when Dunkin' went public on Nasdaq. To mark the day, the stock exchange unofficially changed its name to Nasddaq and splashed its logo with the signature pink and orange hues of Dunkin' Donuts.
As shares of Dunkin' climbed higher, Mr. Travis and his team sipped on the brand's coffee and nibbled on a generous spread of doughnuts, Munchkins and Baskin-Robbins ice cream, which came in flavors like mint chocolate chip and strawberry.
''I've had at least seven cups of coffee today and a doughnut,'' said Mr. Travis. ''I'm delighted with the current enthusiasm, but I'll wait until next week before I get too excited.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Investors, Worried About Debt Talks, Look for Havens

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Think of it as the flight to safety every investor would like a seat on. The only problem? Nothing is taking off.
Investors are seeking alternatives to United States Treasury bonds as worries escalate that lawmakers will fail to reach an agreement to rein in the deficit and raise the federal debt limit in the coming days. Some have shifted funds into corporate bonds, others are forgetting about yields entirely and parking their money in cash, and more are looking to those classic safe havens of yore, gold and the Swiss franc.
Investors are getting leery of stocks, however. Shares dropped on Wednesday amid growing worry about the deadlock in Washington and the economic outlook for the country. The broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed 2.03 percent lower, or 27.05 points, to 1,304.89. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 198.75 points, or 1.59 percent, to 12,302.55, its fourth straight decline. 
Still, Treasury bond prices remained firm on Wednesday, with the benchmark 10-year bond rising two basis points to 2.98 percent. That shows demand is still healthy for the roughly $10 trillion of United States government debt circulating in the global financial system.
Investors are concerned that a downgrade of United States government debt by the rating agencies, or even the more remote possibility of a default, would erode the value of Treasury securities, which have long been considered virtually risk-free. The trouble is that in the end, safety is hard to find.
''Where are you going to go?'' asked Carl Kaufman, who helps manage just under $2 billion at the Osterweis Strategic Income fund in San Francisco. Mr. Kaufman said he was loading up on high-yield bonds, like those issued by HCA, the hospital operator, and Dollar General, the retailer.
Other institutional investors are looking to faster-growing emerging markets.
Daniel Arbess, manager of the $3 billion Xerion fund at Perella Weinberg Partners in New York, is investing in companies that are benefiting from strong growth overseas, especially in countries like China and other Asian markets. Another strategy he favors is investing in natural resources and precious metals like gold that will preserve their worth even if paper currencies decline in value.
''These are our safe havens, not U.S. Treasuries,'' he said. ''You've got to hold your positions with conviction and concentrate on the fixed points on the horizon.''
Gold, already trading near record levels, dipped slightly Wednesday to close at $1,615 but is still up about 40 percent from a year ago. The Swiss franc, another classic refuge for safety-conscious investors, has jumped nearly 17 percent this year versus the United States dollar.
Other traditional havens, including stock and currency markets in Japan and Europe that might have been tempting in the past, are hardly appealing today, given the slow growth and mushrooming debt problems in those areas.
''Safety is a relative concept,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citigroup. ''There have to be alternatives and the alternatives aren't that wonderful.''
Corporations are also striking a defensive posture, stockpiling cash at record levels. And as the deadline for Washington to reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling nears, many could start taking action, according to a survey this month of 305 large corporations by the Association of Financial Professionals.
Nearly one-quarter of the companies said they would sell some or all of their holdings of Treasury securities, while another 28 percent said they would not add Treasuries to their portfolios. A little fewer than half of the companies said they would not make any significant changes to their positions.
Even though default on government debt remains a remote possibility, some companies are already trying to get out in front of the market jitters. Capital One Financial, for example, moved up a $5 billion sale of billions in stock and bonds to avoid possible turbulence ahead of the Aug. 2 deadline the Treasury had set for lawmakers to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.
Money market funds, which traditionally have big holdings of short-term Treasury bills, are increasing their cash positions in anticipation of possible investor redemptions, said Joseph Abate, money market strategist at Barclays Capital. Government-only money funds are now holding about 70 percent of their assets in securities that mature in less than a week, up from nearly 50 percent three months ago.
The funds are shifting more of their assets into securities with a duration of one day, rather than run the risk of holding positions for a week or longer. They are also steering clear of government notes that are due in the first two weeks of August, fearful that a breakdown in the debt talks could force the government to miss a payment.
''The anxiety level around potential money fund redemptions is certainly higher than it's been,'' Mr. Abate said Wednesday.
Fears of a potential government default are showing up in the derivatives market, too.
For instance, there are 4.9 billion euros worth of derivatives known as credit-default swaps, which insure against a default of government debt and will most likely pay out if the nation does not make its bond payments. That is 1 billion euros higher than in May, according to the Markit Group, a financial data firm based in London. As the summer has progressed, the cost of buying that sort of insurance, which is essentially a bet that the United States government will default on its debt, has risen to 84,000 euros a year ($121,450) to insure Treasuries valued at 10 million euros, up from 35,000 euros ($50,600) in June.
Along with credit-default swaps, big investors and corporations are also eyeing so-called political risk insurance, which pays out in a government default.
In the past, customers largely inquired about coverage for developing countries, like Nigeria or Kazakhstan. Two years ago, they called about Greece, Portugal, and Spain.
But in the last few months, some foreign investors who rely on the government's clean-energy subsidies to profitably develop wind and solar farms have asked the insurance giant Marsh & McLennan about political risk coverage on payments made by the United States.
''Out of the blue, this has come to my desk,'' said Stephen Kay, senior vice president for the political risk division of Marsh.
Retail investors are largely staying on the sidelines, at least for now. Some, according to interviews with brokers and asset managers, are moving into six-month and one-year certificates of deposit.

HEADLINE: The Path From Poetry To Drudgery

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Just three months ago, for at least a little while, everything felt so different. You were triumphant, the audaciously hopeful gambler who had rolled the dice and vanquished Bin Laden, even though some of the experts advising you had put the odds well below 50-50. For showing extraordinary nerve, you were repaid with exceptional luck.
Even three weeks ago, you were in a better place. Unbeknownst to most of the partisan warriors and nearly all of the cynical scribes around town, you and John Boehner had been huddling in the White House, talking trillions, tracing the heady contours of a grand bargain. It was another big bet, but with odds no worse than the last one, or so you calculated. And in Boehner, you believed, you'd found a similarly motivated accomplice with a similarly long-range view. Despite your customary reserve, you experienced the stirrings of a real fondness for him. 
Then . . . breakdowns. Standoffs. Near chaos on Capitol Hill. And, now, a piteous basket of pathetic final-hour fixes that could yield a downgrade of the country's credit rating and aren't durable solutions: Band-Aids where a tourniquet was once discussed. Even if default is averted, the nation's mountainous debt will likely remain a source of anguish and acrimony through and even past the 2012 election. Will there ever be any money or oxygen for actually getting stuff done?
That was part of what a grand bargain was supposed to accomplish: not just badly needed fiscal discipline but badly wanted Obama liberation; one emphatic, enduring push past this constipated juncture; a changed discussion before Election Day; enough cutbacks and revenue to permit some spending again down the line. Republicans sensed all of that. It gave them added incentive to stop you, not that they needed much more. They don't trust you. No matter how reasonable a face you show them, they're convinced that a raging liberal lies beneath, biding his time.
What a crew they are, tarring you as the Spendthrift-in-Chief, though the fiscal crater in which Washington languishes was dug in enormous measure by an economic slowdown that preceded you and by the tax cuts and military campaigns of their president. You got stuck with the mess. That's your cinching, suffocating, unjust reality. Your campaign had all the romance of history in the making; your presidency has all the drudgery of a toxic cleanup. You orated your way into janitorial work.
Into a ceaseless, tedious blame game, too. That's Washington's default pastime, and it's a blood sport, which you and Boehner were playing during your rival addresses Monday night, when the battle wasn't just about the debt ceiling but about images and reputations in the aftermath. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it was the Republicans who looked more incompetent and immature, as Boehner fought to subdue the obstructionists in his ranks, purists who won't brook even the most picayune compromise, let alone the tiniest tax increase. Some of them don't fear default. They somehow regard it as a fleeting, instructive purgative.
But if the country winds up there, and even if it doesn't, it's hard to see how this embarrassing mess doesn't taint you. There will be questions about whether you put your marker down at the right time, with enough specificity and force. There will be assertions that you didn't make a persuasive and coherent enough case to voters.
At least a majority of them still blame your predecessor for the gasping economy. But that can last only so long, and it's not a refrain you can tote onto the campaign trail, swapping ''Yes We Can'' for ''Not My Fault.'' Your fortunes may well be manacled to an unemployment rate that, to your thinking, is more reflective of dynamics beyond your control than of any tinkering you can do. So you watch. You wait. The aloofness observers ascribe to you could just as accurately be described as fatalism.
It has been a challenging few years, and not just politically. Michelle wasn't as prepared for the airlessness and isolation of ''the bubble'' as some of the first ladies before her. It's one of Washington's worst-kept secrets that she has known happier times. The coming campaign won't thrill her.
But you're still catching breaks. Your field of Republican challengers is weak. None have your personal narrative, your symbolic power. Even Americans unsure of you remain invested in you. A second term could be yours.
Would it be much better and freer than the first? With the $4 trillion package that you and Boehner once discussed long gone, will you ever be able to govern during a chapter free of limits, ceilings, boxes, constraints? You got health care reform, and then you got heartache. What you must worry that you'll never get is a sustained, true chance.

HEADLINE: The Costs of Stalemate: America's credibility and its credit-worthiness are at risk

 BODY:
Until this week, Wall Street has shrugged off each new low in the debt-limit debate, confident -- in a whistling-past-the-graveyard kind of way -- that Washington would raise the debt limit on time. 
Many Republican politicians have insisted that the economy and the country could shrug off a default. Up to Wednesday, the most conservative members of the House seemed to be welcoming a default. They refused to support a plan to raise the limit -- and impose overly harsh spending cuts -- put forward by Speaker John Boehner.
The cost of this fecklessness should now be clear to everyone. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 200 points on Wednesday and is down 421 points since Friday when Mr. Boehner left President Obama waiting for a phone call that never came about a deal that never closed.
With bond-rating agencies issuing dire warnings, investors have begun to demand higher rates on Treasury bills that come due in August. Prices have surged on credit default swaps, which are used by investors to protect against default and by speculators to bet on the likelihood of default.
On Wednesday, with Mr. Boehner warning his troops to ''get your ass in line'' to keep things from getting worse, several hard-line members began switching their votes and chances increased that his plan would pass the House. Whether that gets Washington any closer to a tolerable deal isn't clear.
It would be reassuring to chalk up the market volatility to endgame tension. Even if default is avoided, the prolonged stalemate has left the United States vulnerable to losing its AAA credit rating. For credit raters, the issue is political risk -- the danger of dysfunctional politics leading to continued fiscal disarray. The risk is especially high if any deal only raises the debt limit until early next year, as called for in the speaker's plan. The potential repercussions of a downgrade include an even larger deficit, as higher interest rates raise borrowing costs for the government, as well as higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. As money that might have been spent or invested is instead used to pay debt, the slowing economy would slow even more and joblessness would rise.
The contractionary impact would be amplified because higher interest costs could hit at the same time as stimulus payments wane: Federal unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut for employees expire at the end of this year. Deep spending cuts that may accompany a deal would add to the distress.
Financial markets could also be roiled by a downgrade, in part, because a drop in the nation's credit rating might trigger payouts on derivatives bets that counterparties would not necessarily be able to meet.
Not least, a downgrade would be a blow to American credibility and prestige, made all the worse for coming so shortly after the made-in-America global financial crisis. As a correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt wrote a few days ago, ''Out of the American 21st-century crisis could come the downfall of the dominant power of the 20th century.'' That may be overheated. But no one can shrug it off. The markets and the rest of the world are worried, and they should be. We all should be.

HEADLINE: Support Is Surer For Rival Plans On Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Carl Hulse and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans and Senate Democrats gained substantial support on Wednesday within party ranks for their separate plans to resolve a looming debt crisis, but the momentum seemed to be pushing both sides further from a compromise.
It was a day in which Capitol Hill seemed to operate in alternate realities: Republicans in the House sharing near universal belief that the Senate will eventually cave and accept their plan, and Senate Democrats assured that they will have the last word over the weekend and ultimately force the hand of the House.
As the House headed for a vote on Thursday, Congressional officials suggested that Senate leaders from both parties were keeping an open line for a potential compromise they could both brook. So far no such agreement appeared likely, and the Senate moved toward its own series of votes that could run through the weekend and perhaps into Monday, just one day short of the Aug. 2 date that the White House has insisted is the deadline for extending the debt ceiling for paying the nation's bills. 
Earlier in the day, at a House hearing, a representative of one of the credit rating agencies said that while the United States was unlikely to default on its obligations, its credit rating could still be cut if Congress failed to come up with a plan to reduce spending sufficiently. In the markets, investors sought alternatives to Treasury bonds and pushed down American stock prices for the fourth straight day as reverberations from the legislative impasse appeared to take a toll. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 198.75 points, or 1.59 percent, on Wednesday; the broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index lost more than 2 percent.
Speaker John A. Boehner began mustering support for his budget-cutting plan early in the day as he cracked a verbal whip in meetings with his members even as Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, made it clear the House legislation was dead on arrival in his chamber.
Less than a day after an unfavorable evaluation from the Congressional Budget Office forced Mr. Boehner to delay a vote and rework his bill to gain support, the speaker and other Republican leaders met with their conference Wednesday morning and bluntly commanded that they line up behind the reworked plan to cut spending at least as much as the $1 trillion increase proposed for the debt ceiling.
With the hope of picking up more votes, Mr. Boehner revised his deficit-reduction plan to achieve additional savings of $65 billion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office said the revised proposal would save $915 billion over 10 years, up from an estimate of $850 billion in savings from the original plan.
The revisions involved technical changes in annual limits on spending in 2012 and 2013, but they produced substantial additional savings.
In a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday morning, Mr. Boehner and the majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, scolded members for allowing Democrats to unify in protest against them. ''This is the bill,'' Mr. Boehner said, according to those who attended the meeting, who said he advised them to ''get your ass in line.''
On the other side of the Rotunda in the Senate, Mr. Reid sent Mr. Boehner a letter signed by all 51 Senate Democrats and two independents assuring that his legislation, which would raise the debt ceiling for roughly six months -- far less than President Obama wants -- faced certain failure in his chamber. ''Your approach would force us once again to face the threat of default in five or six short months,'' the letter said. A number of Senate Republicans also oppose the House bill, largely because they find the spending cuts insufficient.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, reiterated his support for Mr. Boehner's bill on the Senate floor on Wednesday. ''The fact is, Republicans have offered the only proposal at this point that attempts to get at the root of the problem, and which actually has a chance of getting to the president's desk,'' he said.
Mr. McConnell's aides vehemently denied that their boss was negotiating any side deal with Mr. Reid or that he intended to do so.
Mr. Reid's package would cut roughly $2.2 trillion in spending over 10 years and raise the debt limit through 2012, according to an analysis from the budget office. ''The bottom line is there's only one bill in Congress that's a true compromise,'' he said Wednesday. ''We're running out of time, and it's time to get serious about finding that compromise.''
Despite Mr. Reid's warnings to the House, rank-and-file House Republicans -- scores of whom initially seemed inclined to flee the House bill over what they felt were insufficient spending cuts -- fell back in line behind Mr. Boehner, sensing that a compromise with Senate Democrats, which they would less favor, might otherwise be in the offing.
Mr. Boehner made it clear he needed members, even those who believed the bill did not go far enough in cutting spending, to help him avert either a default or Senate victory. ''I can't do this job unless you're behind me,'' people who attended the meeting recalled him saying.
The appeal was apparently effective.
''We've got this back and forth between have we cut enough, how much have we cut, how do we get a long-term solution on this,'' said Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma. ''I like tea sweet enough to stand the spoon up in it,'' he said. ''This is not super-sweet tea. But it is not unsweetened, either.''
Mr. Reid's members threw their support behind him in equal measure. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, a leading liberal voice in the Congress, endorsed the majority leader's plan on the Senate floor, calling it ''substantive; it's real and it's achievable.''
Mr. Reid's plan would save $2.2 trillion over 10 years, less than the $2.7 trillion that the Democrats had claimed. Even discounting the savings achieved from winding down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (about $1.04 trillion) and related savings in interest on the public debt (about $250 billion), that would mean total savings of $900 billion compared with the Republicans' $850 billion as tallied by the budget office.
Assuming the House is able to pass its bill on Thursday, the Senate has several options. The first is to simply vote to table the House measure, which would likely inflame Republican senators, deprived of the right to have a substantial debate on it.
Another option would be to have a quick vote on the House bill, and assuming it fails, immediately take up either Mr. Reid's bill as a substitute for the House bill -- a procedural move that allows it to be voted over the course of the weekend rather than Monday -- or perhaps, some form of a compromise measure drafted with Republican senators, for a Saturday vote.
Alternatively, Mr. Reid could begin the procedural clock on his own bill on Thursday, requiring votes on Saturday and Monday, dragging the process out further.

HEADLINE: Ford to Increase Its Plant Capacity in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The Ford Motor Company plans to invest almost $1 billion in northwest India, building factories to make nearly a quarter of a million cars a year, company executives said on Wednesday. 
The investment is Ford's latest push into fast-growing markets in Asia and Africa, where it lags other big automakers.
The company's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said this year that Ford aimed to get a third of its sales from these two regions, about double what it was getting now. Ford has been adding factories, rolling out new models and opening dealerships in countries including South Africa and Thailand.
India, where passenger car sales grew 29 percent in the last fiscal year, to 2.5 million, is expected to become a critical market over the next decade, Ford executives said Wednesday. Ford expects a ''dramatic spike up in India'' by the middle of the decade as incomes increase, said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Asia Pacific and Africa, during a meeting with reporters in Delhi.
Ford is investing in the state of Gujarat, whose chief minister, Narendra Modi, has drawn international attention for his business-friendly attitude. But Mr. Modi, a longtime Hindu nationalist, also remains one of India's most polarizing politicians because of allegations that he played a role in 2002 riots that left more than 1,000 dead, mostly Muslims.
Ford executives said they had chosen Gujarat because of its probusiness environment and because it had ports, which could allow the company to export from India in the future and to diversify from its existing Indian operations in the south.
''These are long-term investments,'' said Mr. Hinrichs. Ford is ''trying to make the right long-term business decisions for multidecade investments, which will last far beyond any one political career.''
Ford plans to build two new factories in Sanand, Gujarat, by 2014 that will employ 5,000 and have the capacity to assemble 240,000 cars and build 270,000 engines. Ford already has operations in the southeastern state of Tamil Nadu that employ 5,000 in manufacturing and 5,000 in back-office work and information technology.
Growth in India's booming passenger car market may outstrip that of China's this year, as the Chinese government tries to slow its sector's growth, removing subsidies and incentives for new car purchases.
Ford is not alone in channeling more capital into India. The Toyota Motor Corporation said on Wednesday that it would invest an additional $220 million in the country, to double production capacity to 310,000 units by 2013.
Ford's performance in India has lagged its performance in other markets. The company sells only 3 percent of all passenger cars in India, compared, for example, with 10 percent of Brazil's cars.
Ford was the only Detroit automaker to emerge from the 2009 recession without going into bankruptcy. And on Tuesday it reported its ninth consecutive quarterly profit, although its rebound was showing signs of slowing.
''Because we came out of the crisis much stronger financially, we now can make long-term investments, and that is what we are doing,'' Mr. Hinrichs said.

HEADLINE: President on Sidelines In Critical Battle Over Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For an hour on Wednesday the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, fielded questions about what, if anything, President Obama was doing to help end the impasse in Congress over the imminent need to raise the nation's borrowing limit.
He spoke repeatedly but without specifics of private conversations and nonstop meetings involving administration officials ''up to the highest levels'' -- White House shorthand for the president. Finally, exasperated, he asked whether reporters expected ''a President Bartlet moment'' -- say, a march up Capitol Hill to whip Congress in line, a la fictional president in ''The West Wing'' television series.
''Yes,'' one reporter replied.
Reality is not so simple. The two parties remain seemingly further apart than just days before the Treasury Department's Aug. 2 deadline for raising the $14.3 trillion debt limit, threatening a financial crisis that could ripple through the economy. But with the collapse last week of Mr. Obama's back-channel talks with House Speaker John A. Boehner, the action has shifted to Congress. 
Having already deployed the heavy weapons from the presidential arsenal, including a national address on Monday night and a veto threat, Mr. Obama is in danger of seeming a spectator at one of the most critical moments of his presidency. Having been unable to get the grand bargain he wanted -- a debt limit increase and up to $4 trillion in debt-reduction through spending cuts and taxes -- Mr. Obama's challenge now is to reassert himself in a way that produces the next-best outcome, or at least one that does no harm to his re-election hopes.
Behind the scenes, administration officials led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, and Mr. Obama's budget director, Jacob J. Lew, are scrambling via telephone, e-mails and trips to the Capitol to try to shape the emerging legislation as Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats want. Their goal is a $2.4 trillion increase in the debt limit that would extend the government's borrowing authority past the 2012 election campaign, not the shorter increase the Republicans now want, and also provide a similar amount in deficit reduction over the decade.
On a parallel track the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is ''omnipresent'' at the White House, by one official's description, leading the effort with Mr. Lew to plan for emergency actions by the government and the financial system should Congress and Mr. Obama fail to reach an agreement.
No measure can pass without the president's signature, so Mr. Obama is far from irrelevant. But his limited ability in a divided government to affect the legislation and his inability before now to shape a compromise with House Republicans, many of them dedicated to never compromising with him, is proving the most significant test to date of his campaign promise to bridge the two parties and make Washington work.
Worse, with the health of a still-fragile recovery resting on the outcome, a bad ending could leave Mr. Obama more vulnerable politically than he is now, with 9 percent unemployment, on the issue that is likely to define the 2012 elections -- his handling of the economy.
''I don't think a president is ever completely helpless, but having said that, my interpretation of the nationally televised address that he gave was that he had no arrows left in his quiver,'' said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research organization. ''If he'd had another card to play, that was surely the time to play it. He's the ultimate decider but, on the other hand, I think his capacity to shape what gets to his desk has been substantially reduced'' as Republicans stand their ground, Mr. Galston said. Even Mr. Boehner has found it hard this week to get an agreement with the Republicans he ostensibly leads, he added.
Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman, said Mr. Obama could be hurt by the summer's saga even though his position in the debt-limit debate -- for a balanced package of spending cuts and revenue increase -- is more popular than Republicans' demands for deep spending cuts only, and a reshaping of Medicare and Medicaid.
''I think that his position on the issue is more broadly shared than Republicans would like to think, but he is damaging his leadership image because people don't see him solving the problem,'' Mr. Weber said.
''I'm not saying the president has an easy task ahead of him and he can do it at the snap of his fingers,'' Mr. Weber added, in reference to Congressional Republicans' hard line. ''I'm just saying in the end the failure to solve this problem is going to weigh more heavily on him than on anybody in Congress.''
Administration officials and many Democrats disagree, citing both national polls showing that more Americans blame Republicans for the current stalemate and the example of the mid-1990s, when President Bill Clinton regained his political footing after his budget showdowns with Congressional Republicans dramatized the two parties' different visions of government.
Certainly Mr. Obama has not acted like a bystander since the end of the White House negotiations.
On the weekend he called Mr. Boehner in another attempt to restart their talks. Failing to do that, on Sunday night he convened a meeting at the White House with the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, to ensure that the Democrats had a united front and strategy.
On Monday he gave his televised speech and urged Americans to contact their lawmakers to plead for compromise. On Tuesday, Congressional phone lines were swamped and the White House threatened a veto of Mr. Boehner's proposed bill calling for an increase in the debt limit to mid-2012.
Anticipating that the run-up to Aug. 2 would be dominated by the debt-limit clash, the White House kept Mr. Obama's schedule for the final weeks of July and early August clear of the weekly trips he had been taking for economy-related events and Democratic fund-raisers.
Officials said they have no White House war room for this nail-biting climax. Instead they described a rolling series of meetings in the offices of Mr. Biden, Mr. Daley, Mr. Lew and, daily meetings in the Oval Office.
Advisers parcel out assignments for appearances on cable and network television to make the administration's case. There are calls or meetings with leaders and members of Congress and with labor and business groups. Mr. Daley, Mr. Geithner and Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser, are reaching out to business and financial leaders to enlist their help in spreading the word of the urgency of raising the debt limit.
''We have continued to have conversations with -- at all levels -- with Democrats, Republicans, principals and staffers -- in search of a solution to this problem that's balanced and fair,'' Mr. Carney said. ''We continue to this day and to this hour to do just that.''

HEADLINE: As 11th Hour Nears, a Look at the Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
For a time it seemed safe for many people going about their summers to try to ignore the debt ceiling drama playing out in Washington. If Wall Street so far has not seemed overly concerned that the United States was headed toward default, why should anyone else worry? And there is the long history of crying wolf in Washington: in April everyone finally got up to speed on the threatened shutdown of the federal government just in time to see it averted by an 11th-hour deal.
But now, palms in Washington are beginning to get sweaty and President Obama is breaking into ''The Bachelorette'' to address the nation about the debt crisis. Perhaps the time has finally come for a crash course in all things debt ceiling.
Q.Republicans and Democrats alike keep talking about the need to reduce the federal deficit. Won't refusing to raise the debt limit cut the deficit? 
A. No. The debt limit, or ceiling, which is the amount that the nation is allowed to borrow, must be raised if the United States is to pay for all the things that Congress has already bought: the spending in the budget bills it has already passed, the Social Security checks promised to retirees, the payments due to private companies with federal contracts and the interest on bonds it has sold. Washington has long spent more money than it takes in, and planned to make up the difference with borrowing. Both parties agree that this cannot go on forever. But if the debt limit is not raised, it will not cut the nation's deficit or allow the government to get out of its existing obligations. It will simply make it impossible to borrow the money that the government needs to pay for them.
Some Republicans argue that the dangers of a default are being overstated, and that the only way to curb the nation's debt problem is to reduce its legal ability to borrow. (As a senator, Mr. Obama voted against raising the limit himself.) But economists say the dangers of default are real, with ramifications ranging from slowing the economy to making mortgages and car loans more expensive. But analysts say that freezing the debt ceiling would have little immediate effect on debt levels. ''While debates surrounding the debt limit may raise awareness about the federal government's current debt trajectory and may also provide Congress with an opportunity to debate the fiscal policy decisions driving that trajectory, the ability to have an immediate effect on debt levels is limited,'' the Government Accountability Office reported. ''This is because the debt reflects previously enacted tax and spending policies.''
Q.This sounds like an odd system. Do you mean that Congress can pass a budget that requires borrowing, and then argue later about whether to approve that borrowing?
A. That's right. The system goes back to World War I, when Congress first put a limit on federal debt. The limit was part of a law that allowed the Treasury to issue Liberty Bonds to help pay for the war. The law was intended to give the Treasury greater discretion over borrowing by eliminating the need for Congress to approve each new issuance of debt. Over the years the limit has been raised repeatedly, to $14.3 trillion today from roughly $43 billion in 1940. But outside observers have noted that the failure to make increases in the debt limit part of the regular budget process can be risky. The G.A.O. concluded that it would be better if ''decisions about the debt level occur in conjunction with spending and revenue decisions as opposed to the after-the-fact approach now used,'' adding that doing so ''would help avoid the uncertainty and disruptions that occur during debates on the debt limit today.''
Q. So, what happens to government spending if the debt limit is not raised? Will the United States default?
A. The United States will not have enough money to pay all of its bills. The country technically hit the debt ceiling in May, but it instituted a series of temporary measures to avoid having to raise the limit that the Treasury estimates will run out around Aug. 2. So what does that mean? The United States will owe about $307 billion during the rest of August, but is expecting to take in about $172 billion in revenues, according to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Without enough money to pay all of its bills, the government will have to decide what to do. The possibilities range from ''prioritizing'' some payments and paying them first to paying bills in the order in which they were received.
The Bipartisan Policy Center analysis notes that if the government were to choose to pay the interest on its debt, Social Security benefits, Medicaid and Medicare payments, defense contractors and unemployment benefits, it could not have enough left to pay for the salaries of federal workers and members of the military, Pell grants for college, highway construction or tax refunds, among other things. Some analysts argue that as long as the nation continues making its payments on the national debt, it will not be in default. The Treasury Department disputes that, arguing that ''adopting a policy that payments to investors should take precedence over other U.S. legal obligations would merely be default by another name, since the world would recognize it as a failure by the United States to stand behind its commitments.''
Q.What could a default mean for the economy?
A. It could be bad, on several levels. A default is typically a decision not to pay government bondholders back, in part or in full, but the rating agencies have said they might consider the United States in default if it fails to pay other creditors like government vendors. If the federal government interrupts payments, whether to Social Security recipients or contractors, those people will then have less money to spend, and the economy will slow down. And if the United States defaults on its debt, there is a risk that the investors -- foreign and domestic -- could demand a higher interest rate. Then, consumers could also feel the pinch: because the interest rates paid by corporations and consumers in the United States are tied to the rate the nation pays, interest rates could go up for everything from credit cards to mortgages. A homeowner with a mortgage for $100,000 might see her annual mortgage costs go up by $100 to $200 a year, economists say.
So the failure to raise the debt limit could slow the nation's recovery, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in a speech last month. ''Failing to raise the debt limit would require the federal government to delay or renege on payments for obligations already entered into,'' he said. ''In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the Treasury's debt obligations could cause severe disruptions in financial markets and the payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States and damage the special role of the dollar and Treasury securities in global markets in the longer term. Interest rates are likely to rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well be a protracted period.''
Q.What could it mean for states and cities?
A. States, still recovering from the downturn, could be hurt in two ways. First, if the federal payments they rely on for everything from Medicaid to highway construction are interrupted, states that are still recovering from the recession could face serious cash-flow problems. Second, the broader economic disruptions of a default could lower tax collections again as they are still rebounding from the dive they took during the Great Recession.
''If the government stopped paying federal workers or held back Social Security checks, the resulting loss of individual income could have a profound effect on state and local tax revenues,'' the Pew Center on the States warned in a recent report. The United States Conference of Mayors approved a resolution last week urging Congress to raise the debt ceiling, writing: ''Economists agree that default will have an immediate and catastrophic impact on our cities, and the implications are global. A credit downgrade will plunge us into a deep, double-dip recession. We urge Washington to act now.''
Some states are already feeling the effects. Maryland postponed a bond sale after it was warned that its credit rating would probably be lowered in the event of a federal downgrade. California, which typically issues short-term bonds for cash-flow reasons at this time of year, is working to arrange bank loans instead, citing the market uncertainty. Some state pension funds are worried that a default could erode the value of their investments, which are still recovering from losses during the recession.
Q.What about the rest of the world? Will other countries continue to invest in the United States? Would a default send investors to the safety of other currencies?
A. There are already indications that this is beginning to happen. Switzerland's franc strengthened to a record high against the dollar this week, as concern about the debt limit in the United States and worries about the euro, given the Greek crisis, sent investors looking for safety. Some bond funds are already moving to invest in bonds from Canada, Mexico and China. And there are concerns about what would happen if America's foreign creditors, led by China, were to try to dump some of their American debt. In the last decade, foreign money has poured into the United States, creating so much demand for Treasury bills that it has kept the United States' interest rate low. This month, the authorities in Beijing expressed concern about the debt standoff in the United States. ''We hope that the U.S. government adopts responsible policies and measures to guarantee the interests of investors,'' said Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
Q.How many times has the debt ceiling been raised, and by whom?
A. It has been a bipartisan exercise. By the Treasury Department's count, Congress has acted 78 times since 1960 to raise, extend or alter the definition of the debt limit -- 49 times under Republican presidents, and 29 times under Democratic presidents. The Obama administration has taken pains to note that President Ronald Reagan, a hero to many Republicans in Congress, raised the debt limit. In a letter on the debt ceiling last month to Republicans in the Senate, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner quoted a letter Mr. Reagan wrote a generation ago, urging Congress to increase the debt limit. ''The full consequences of a default -- or even the serious prospect of default -- by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate,'' he quoted Mr. Reagan as writing. ''Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result.''
Q.How has the debt risen this high, and how much are we paying in interest as a nation?
A. The United States has not always operated with such a large debt. After financing World War II with substantial borrowing, the outstanding debt held pretty stable for the next 25 years, going up to $283 billion in 1970 from $242 billion in 1946. But over the last 30 years, the debt has increased under every president -- with the biggest increase under President George W. Bush, who cut taxes, added a drug benefit to Medicare and fought two wars. As the debt has grown, so have the country's interest payments. In 2003, for instance, the government paid about $150 billion in interest costs; this year it is up to $250 billion. These interest payments are taking up more federal spending now than federal outlays on education, transportation and housing and urban development combined. Though the interest costs are substantial, they have remained lower than some economists predicted because the world has continued to lend money to the United States at very low interest rates, even as the nation's debt has grown.
Q.Has what is going on in Washington already hurt the economy and the reputation of the United States in financial markets around the world?
A. While the drastic slide on Wall Street that some feared had not materialized as of early this week, Treasury market analysts and traders are already saying that the credibility of the United States has been damaged. Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said last week: ''Our aura is diminished. You know people really view the U.S. as the AAA, the gold standard, and I think we're tarnishing that.'' Treasury bonds have always been considered to be virtually risk-free, and that is why many investors -- in the United States and abroad -- hold them and many companies use them to back up other investments. If their security is questioned, investors may shift away from them. The caveat, though, is that there are few safe places today for investors to put their cash. So some traders say that investors may see few alternatives, and opt to stay put.
Q.Has the United States defaulted on its debt before?
A. Technically, yes. In 1979, as Congress was considering raising the debt limit, negotiations ran down to the wire. The Treasury Department had what it called technological glitches, and it was late paying a relatively small number of its Treasury notes. This amounted to a technical default, not a permanent one, because the note holders were eventually paid in full. Some finance professors who have studied the incident say it led to higher interest rates.

HEADLINE: Mayor Gains With Public, A Poll Finds

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
After enduring a brutal spring in the public opinion polls, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seems to be making some inroads with the public, according to the latest poll by Quinnipiac University.
In July, more New Yorkers approved of Mr. Bloomberg's overall performance than disapproved. His approval rating was 45 percent, compared with 40 percent in May, when Mr. Bloomberg was still smarting from the failed appointment of his schools chancellor and the city's botched response to the December blizzard.
Those approval ratings are a far cry from Mr. Bloomberg's all-time high of 75 percent, but they were greeted with relief inside City Hall and held up as evidence that Mr. Bloomberg's third term was not jinxed, as some political analysts have argued. Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, suggested that the mayor's improved numbers were tied, in part, to his stewardship of the city's economy. 
''These are tough times,'' Mr. Loeser said, ''and the mayor is making the difficult decisions that are helping New York City come out of the recession faster and stronger than the rest of the country.''
When it came to picking Mr. Bloomberg's successor, New Yorkers were divided. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, garnered the most interest, with 23 percent of New Yorkers saying he should be elected mayor in 2013. But Mr. Kelly, with a sky-high 67 percent approval rating of his own, has not indicated that he has any plan to run for mayor.
The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who maintains a lead in campaign fund-raising, was favored by 18 percent of New Yorkers. She was followed by the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz (12 percent); Comptroller John C. Liu (10 percent); the former comptroller and 2009 mayoral candidate William C. Thompson Jr. (10 percent); the public advocate, Bill de Blasio (6 percent); and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer (4 percent).
New Yorkers did seem to agree on one thing: The next mayor should have spent most of his or her career in government, not business, like Mr. Bloomberg.
''We've tried the businessman-as-mayor for three terms,'' Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in a statement. ''Next time, New Yorkers say, let's pick a politician.''
The poll suggested that New Yorkers seemed, after a decade getting to know the prickly mayor, to be warming up to him as a person, with 64 percent saying they liked him.
''A lot of New Yorkers think Mayor Michael Bloomberg's third term isn't as good as his first two,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''But they've grown to like Mike as a person.''
Still, Mr. Bloomberg faces challenges in some areas, including education. Public school parents, by a margin of 69 percent to 29 percent, disapproved of his handling of the schools.
But Mr. Bloomberg's new schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, fared better, with 44 percent of public school parents approving of his performance.
The poll, conducted from July 19 to July 25, was based on phone calls to cellphones and land lines of 1,234 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
Asked about Mr. Kelly's poll numbers at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg called him ''one of the most competent people in our administration.''
''To the best of my knowledge, he has no interest in being mayor,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Seeing Threat, Boehner Tries Tougher Tack

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner is a laid-back leader who likes to say that his role is to let the House work its will. But with the nation's economic standing and his own political future at risk, Mr. Boehner jettisoned his usual laissez-faire approach on Wednesday.
''I didn't put my neck on the line and go toe to toe with Obama to not have an army behind me,'' Mr. Boehner declared at a private party meeting, according to some House members. He demanded the fealty of conservatives who were threatening to sink his budget proposal and deny him the chance to confront the Senate with a take-it-or-leave offer on a debt ceiling increase. 
Mr. Boehner really had no choice but to go all out. A defeat of that plan -- which seemed likely Tuesday night before its prospects improved Wednesday -- would have been a disastrous repudiation, in effect a stinging vote of no confidence in him.
Since taking over what some people now describe as the worst job in Washington, Mr. Boehner has found himself caught between two imperatives: to lead his majority, bolstered by Tea Party newcomers, in its crusade to cut spending and the size of government, while serving as responsible partner in governing with a Democratic White House and Senate.
The current impasse is the starkest illustration yet of that tension as the speaker labors to persuade House Republicans, who find the notion of increasing the debt limit repugnant, to do so in order to prevent what Mr. Boehner, a former businessman himself, knows could be a disastrous default.
In a conference call to his membership on Sunday, Mr. Boehner reminded his caucus members that they had a duty to the nation, even if they did not like what he was asking them to do.
''Let me thank all of you for your patience, and for your confidence, and for your commitment to our country,'' Mr. Boehner said, according to participants on the call. ''We're doing the right thing, and you all know that the right thing isn't always the easiest thing to do.''
The speaker has used the many resources at his disposal to coax along his fellow Republicans, from listening sessions in which House leaders sought to educate Republican newcomers on the issue, to an informal party last week. It was held in a storied room on the first floor of the Capitol known as the Board of Education, where another speaker from Ohio, Nicholas Longworth IV, used to gather with colleagues during Prohibition to unwind. Mr. Boehner fed the freshmen debt limit talk along with pizza, sliders and chicken wings.
But it remained a tough sell, with Mr. Boehner in danger of losing the vote, particularly after a Congressional Budget Office report showed that the House plan fell short of the savings estimated by the speaker. The leadership regrouped, beefed up the savings in the measure, used the party meeting to make its case and appeared to gain ground headed into Thursday's floor fight.
Though Mr. Boehner seems to have temporarily regained his footing with his Henry V performance in the party meeting -- he received his third standing ovation in three days -- he is hardly out of danger.
Even if he prevails in the House vote expected on Thursday, the next few days could still spell the difference between success and catastrophe for Mr. Boehner, whose Republican establishment temperament diverges sharply from the fire-breathing conservatives among the rank and file.
While it seems unlikely now, getting the Senate to swallow the House proposal would be a major victory for the speaker, who will have delivered the solution to the debt impasse over the objections of Democrats and President Obama. But if Republican intransigence is blamed for a default or his caucus is forced to accept some version of the Senate Democratic plan -- an outcome some House members would consider far worse than allowing the nation to not pay its bills -- Mr. Boehner could be weakened.
Still, many Republicans consider him safe because of the general good will he has built with many members despite their differences. And there are few signals from other Republican leaders that they are ready, or even want, to take him on.
''I find it hard to believe that even if some critics have a beef with Boehner on how the final debt limit solution will look (and surely some will), that they will have the courage or the inclination to try to oust him,'' John Feehery, a party strategist who served as a top aide to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, wrote on his blog on Wednesday. ''Boehner has done a good job.''
In interviews in recent weeks, roughly two dozen members, even some who vehemently oppose Mr. Boehner's plan, said they respected how he had conducted his negotiations with the White House. And they said they appreciated his inclusiveness, especially freshmen who expected otherwise as they pushed early on for more aggressive cuts.
''Leadership gets great credit for having been very straightforward,'' said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia.
Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina said she came to Washington suspicious of Mr. Boehner. At Tea Party rallies before she was elected, she heard that he was part of the problem.
''When I got here I realized that wasn't the case at all,'' she said. ''I was told he wasn't conservative. He is conservative, and that's what I tell other people in our discussions. He has been great to all the freshmen.''
Allies of the speaker say they expect that most of the 87 Republican freshmen will back the House debt limit plan in the end.
Despite all the vitriol in the debt limit fight, Democrats have been careful to not go too far in impugning Mr. Boehner -- Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, on Wednesday called him a ''good and reasonable man'' -- in the event they have to work with him. But they have also sought to portray him as a captive of the right wing of his caucus.
Still, Democrats are keeping the door open for Mr. Boehner, hoping that in the final resolution of the impasse he will have to join with them in enacting a debt limit increase that extends through 2012. At the moment, though, Mr. Boehner is not ready to walk through the opening.

HEADLINE: Which Is in Worse Shape, U.S. or Europe?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: All eyes may be on the debt limit in the United States, but a far more crucial issues is the continuing search of health-care costs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The United States and Europe seem to be competing hard this summer for the title of "biggest economic problem." Based on the latest news coverage, Europe might seem to be experiencing something of a resurgence, as last week the euro zone agreed on a deal involving mutual support and limiting the fallout from Greece's debt problems. 
In contrast, the United States seems to be mired in a political stalemate that becomes more complex and confused at every turn.
But rhetoric masks reality on both sides of the Atlantic. The euro zone still faces an immediate crisis: the can was kicked down the road last week, but not far. The United States, on the other hand, is in much better shape over the next decade than you might think after listening to politicians of any stripe. 
American problems loom in the decades that follow 2021, so there is still plenty of time to sort these out; the bad news is that almost no one is talking about the real issues.In a policy paper released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics on July 21, Peter Boone and I went through the details on the euro-zone crisis, including how this common currency area got itself into such deep trouble and what the likely scenarios are now (you can also see the discussion and contrasting views at the publication event). In our assessment, the issue is lack of effective governance within the euro zone. Governments had an incentive to run reckless policy - either in terms of budget deficits (Greece), out-of-control banks (Ireland) or refusal to create an economic structure that would support growth (Portugal). 
These policies were financed by loans from other countries, particularly within the euro zone, creating and sustaining the widely shared perception that if any country were to get into trouble, it would be bailed out by deep-pocketed neighbors (a phrase that in this context always means Germany).
At the heart of this system was a great deal of "moral hazard"; investors stopped doing meaningful credit analysis, so Greek or Spanish or Italian governments could borrow at just a few basis points above the rate for the German government (one basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point, 0.01 percent).
What has shocked investors' thinking over the last three years are the realizations that Greece and some other "peripheral" countries have so much debt they may not be able to make all the contracted payments by themselves and that Germany and other northern countries have become convinced that foolish investors should suffer some losses. 
Imposing losses on banks that made bad decisions is a sensible principle - but getting from here to there is not easy, particularly when the "periphery" includes Italy, with a far larger economy than Greece or Ireland or Portugal and with gross debt of nearly two trillion euros (about 120 percent of its gross domestic product).
Either Europe really ends moral hazard and widely restructures sovereign debts, or it keeps the bailouts coming, with the deep involvement of the European Central Bank, which will ultimately be inflationary. The package announced last week is a classic case of muddling through; it doesn't really solve anything. (See the Economix Q. & A. on Greece's latest debt deal.)
If Europe and the world now experience a growth miracle, these debt problems will recede in importance, because solvency is all about debt burdens relative to G.D.P. But if near-term growth is not strong, as seems increasingly likely, market participants will soon resume their contemplation of European dominoes.
In contrast, the United States has a simple fiscal problem - as I discussed in my testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee this week. Government debt surged from 2008, not because of Greek-style profligacy but rather because of an Irish-style banking disaster. When credit collapses, so does revenue. As the economy recovers, revenue comes back.
The single most interesting point about today's debt ceiling debate is that over the 10-year forecast horizon that frames for the entire discussion, by any conventional definition no fiscal problem exists. In 2021, the United States is likely to have a small primary surplus at the federal level - meaning that the budget, before interest payments, will no longer be in deficit. (James Kwak elaborates on this point on Baseline Scenario, the blog we run together.)
The really bad budget numbers for the United States come after 2021, but these are not the focus of anyone's current proposals on Capitol Hill. Compared with other countries, the increase in health-care spending from 2010 to 2030 is most troublesome and what will ruin us (see Statistical Table 9 in the International Monetary Fund's Spring 2011 Fiscal Monitor; or, if you prefer a single picture that cuts to the chase, look at where the United States falls in Figure 1 on page 9 of the I.M.F.'s recent report on how to handle "fiscal consolidation" in the Group of 20 developed economies.) 
The debate in Washington is both heated and off course, because no one is grappling with the difficult issue of how to control health-care costs. The Tea Party enthusiasts are intent on near-term government spending cuts as a condition of supporting any increase in the debt ceiling. 
If this version of a libertarian tax revolt carries the day, the resulting fiscal contraction will slow the economy and fewer jobs will be created. It does nothing directly to address the looming budget issues beyond 2021.
In the near term, the Europeans have the bigger problem - and this will only be compounded by slower growth in the United States (home to about one-quarter of the world economy). Over the longer haul, it remains to be seen when and how politicians in the United States will take up the real budget issues. 
So far, the evidence is not encouraging.

HEADLINE: Cataclysms, Climate Change and California Opinion

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The share of California Republicans who believe climate change is already under way jumped noticeably, from 30 percent to 40 percent, in the past year. But the proportion who consider it a serious threat remained unchanged at 18 percent. 

 BODY:
One of the pleasures of following the annual surveys of the state's environmental attitudes by the Public Policy Institute of California is witnessing how one-time cataclysms (financial crises, tsunamis, oil spills and the like) throw the neat progression of opinion change out of whack for a year or so. And then, like a rubber band springing back into shape, the attitudes largely revert to their old patterns; the cataclysm seems to have little lasting influence.
So it was last year, when the gulf oil spill knocked 17 percentage points off overall support for offshore oil drilling, from 51 percent to 34 percent. In this year's poll, the support column gained back much of what it had lost; now 46 percent support offshore drilling. In 2010 the Climategate ruckus seemed to be responsible for knocking 7 percentage points off the total share of Californians who thought global warming was underway begun; it declined to 54 percent from 61 percent. This year the seven points were regained. 
This year's nuclear catastrophe in Japan had an impact similar to that of Climategate in late 2009 and early 2010 and the oil spill in the spring and summer of 2010: the latest P.P.I.C. survey showed that support for more nuclear energy development dropped from 44 percent to 30 percent. It will be interesting to see if next year's poll shows a resurgence in support.
 But cataclysms tend to mask other trends. In one interesting development, California Republicans appear to be getting more concerned about climate change again.
In2006 and 2007, 47 percent of Republicans surveyed they believed the effects of global warming were already being felt. In 2009 this dropped sharply, to 36 percent. Last year it declined further, to 30 percent. But in the most recent survey, the share of Republicans agreeing that the effects of global warming are palpable climbed to 40 percent.
In the same five-year period, from 2006 to 2011, the percentage of California Republicans saying climate change will never happen rose and fell, beginning at 19 percent in 2006, peaking in 2010 at 40 percent and declining to 32 percent this year. 
Nonetheless, that 32 percent is a considerably higher proportion of utter skeptics than the 19 percent who registered this opinion five years ago. Within the Republican Party in the country's most populous state, there is both a rebound in those who believe that climate change is already under way and a hardening of opinion at the other end of the spectrum. 
But the divergence among Republicans is not so striking when it comes to their opinions about the threat posed by global warming. Just 18 percent thought the threat to the economy and quality of life in California was serious; 27 percent felt it was somewhat serious (a trusty 32 percent thought it was not at all serious). Which may mean that a good chunk of Republicans think it is happening but the nation and the world can adapt.
On another question, whether or not California should go its own way in making policies to deal with climate change, 40 percent of Republicans agreed, along with 72 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Independents. But 52 percent of Republicans disagreed.
The percentage of Democrats believing climate change is upon us dipped in 2010, but not as strikingly. The share of Democrats with this conviction, however, is now at 69 percent, still below the 74 percent who felt that way in 2006.
The long-running survey is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

HEADLINE: Innovation from the Bottom up

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A foundation tries an innovative approach to finding places to use its money to foster progress -- through innovation. 

 BODY:
The Rockefeller Foundation, in deciding how to dispense tens of millions of dollars in grants each year, typically sends scouting teams around the world to search out problems impeding human well-being and organizations or individuals working to address them.
This year, the foundation tried something new, convening a hundred or so people from a variety of fields and positions at an "innovation forum" in Manhattan on Wednesday. The task of half dozen small groups was to explore ways to foster innovations aimed at sustaining access to water and food and sustaining cities -- a particular focus of Rockefeller -- as human appetites and numbers crest in coming decades. (I was a participant.)
Innovations can be technological, as in the design of cheap water filters or cleaner, more efficient cook stoves. This is the world of Paul Polak, the author of "Out of Poverty" and guru of a movement to "design for the other 90 percent" - meaning the vast majority of global citizens, for whom an iPad or Netflix or Nissan Leaf are not innovations with any meaning but who comprise an enormous market.
The innovations can be financial - the realm of microfinance -- which has been a transformative force, although one suffering deep growing pains in India -- and its less well-known cousin, microfranchising (a model best illustrated by VisionSpring's network of homegrown entrepreneurs providing cheap eyeglasses in poor places).
They can also be conceptual, in taking an approach to problem-solving that isn't focused on symptoms, but root causes. That was what the foundation's leadership seemed to be looking for at the forum. (In my group, focused on sustaining cities, my prime point was the important role of colleges and universities, and particularly students -- through learning-by-doing projects -- in making a difference in communities, whether just outside the ivy-covered walls or spread across the globe.)
Judith Rodin, the president of the foundation and former president of the University of Pennsylvania, where she led an effort to take the university "out of the ivory tower and into the streets," explained the foundation's innovation focus in a speech at the meeting.
It's worth excerpting at some length here because it centers on the power of innovation not only to create wealth and well-being for the top billion, but to directly address the profound challenges impeding the lives of the world's poorest, most vulnerable populations.
Here are portions of her remarks, starting with the case study of an unconventional approach to wiping out hookworm in the United States nearly a century ago: Innovation is quite literally "seeing the world anew," and in doing so better understanding the nature of a challenge, and therefore the nature of the solution. This is first type of innovation I'd like to address - innovation that begins by reframing a problem in which the solution seems all but unknowable.... 
Take the case of hookworm, an insidious, debilitating disease that ravaged poor communities in the United States in the early 1900s, and is rampant today in the most impoverished corners of the world. It saps victims' energy, leaving them unable to learn or to work. In 19th century America, hookworm contributed significantly to Southern states' impoverishment. It remains a terrible, global scourge.
At the turn of the 20th century, in response to this epidemic in the US, John D. Rockefeller established the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm with a million dollar grant - an astounding sum at the time. But what's more astounding is how it was spent.
In looking at this problem anew, the commission noted that while treatment was available, it simply wasn't enough to end the disease. The existence of a cure for hookworm had not managed to mitigate its spread, they realized, because of how and where the disease was contracted: in impoverished areas, where sanitation was insufficient or nonexistent, where shoes were often a luxury, and where the parasite could easily invade the feet of its hosts.
With this important insight, the commission reframed the problem of eradicating hookworm. By viewing the disease as a problem of poverty, sanitation, and education - and not merely a medical condition needing treatment -- a breakthrough occurred.
Over a five-year period from 1910 to 1914, a team of doctors, nurses, and health officials led a vigorous public health campaign - the first of its kind - to eliminate the disease. Education was considered just as important a part of the campaign as treatment, and public school systems and the press were enlisted in the effort, alongside medical professionals.
This was a radical innovation. Nothing like it had ever been tried at such a scale. And needless to say, the public health campaign worked....
Clearly, if we hope to achieve impact of this dramatic scale in the 21st century, we must do what our predecessors did so bravely and so well: see the world anew; experiment based on new and different perspectives; and find, fund, and then scale the innovations that emerge.
That is precisely the process we engaged in today, at this inaugural Innovation Forum, with the participation of so many in this room. We shared our perspectives to reframe a variety of problems, with the hope of collectively uncovering innovations that might change the course of shared, global challenges.
But we also engaged here in a second type of innovation that melds powerfully with the first - a type of innovation that we call "recombinant." By undertaking this effort together, we have literally recombined our experience, ideas, and perspectives in a way that has proven in a variety of contexts to be highly and uniquely transformative.
Andrew Hargadon of UC-Davis, one of the foremost thinkers on innovation, argues that what we typically consider to be some of the most important "inventions" are actually "recombinant innovations." In other words, bring existing pieces together and recombining them in a way that is fundamentally different, and fundamentally powerful; taking the best of what's already out there, and putting it all together in a game changing new way.Here's a quick aside encouraging you to review my videotaped interview with Hargadon for Dot Earth in 2009:
Now back to Rodin:As an example, Hargadon cites Thomas Edison, whom he notes didn't actually invent the light bulb. That honor goes to J. W. Starr, who filed the patent 30 years earlier. Edison's real genius was recombinant innovation. He recognized that the light bulb was merely a parlor trick without figuring out the electric power generation and transmission systems to make it truly useful. So Edison adapted all the existing technology, including Starr's patent, and created the first system of electric lighting. 
In this way, the "invention" of electric lighting that we take for granted was, in fact, a recombinant innovation.
At the Rockefeller Foundation, we know from almost 100 years of experience the power of recombination to drive innovation. Recombination has fueled many of our signature innovations over nearly a century.
Earlier this year, for instance, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of IRRI, the International Rice Research Institute. In the 1960s, Rockefeller co-founded and then seconded its best scientists to this experimental facility in the Philippines, where discoveries from decades of previous research were recombined in search of new ways to grow more crops to feed starving and malnourished populations.
Researchers at IRRI used recombinant breeding techniques to make plant stalks shorter, not taller, and roots that absorbed and held precious water more effectively. They recognized that food security was more than agricultural science. So they combined traditional disciplines in new ways to accelerate impact.
Agricultural science. Sociology. Psychology. Economics. They were all brought together to create a revolutionary recombinant innovation: new varieties of rice that yielded two to three times what farmers had previous been able to attain; and new ways of spreading the message to farmers and country leaders, in order to assure life-saving, widespread adoption.
Today, we know this historic, collaborative, recombinant innovation in the 1960s as the Green Revolution, which saved a billion lives in Asia.
Our commitment to innovation has not only continued into this new century. It has escalated. Today, we continue to reframe and to recombine as a means of discovering and employing new techniques like design thinking and crowd-sourcing to address complex social challenges.
As an example, we recently partnered with InnoCentive, a spin-off of Eli Lilly and Company, to test the feasibility of crowd-sourcing solutions to science-based social and environmental problems.
[Here's Cornelia Dean's Science Times article on this initiative.]
This has been a great resource for pharmaceutical R&D, and many discoveries have emerged at very low cost. Through InnoCentive's online network of 300,000 engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs -- the world's first open innovation marketplace -- we offered prize money in exchange for successful solutions to problems in the social space that confounded experts working in only one place.
As a result of this virtual collaboration, surprising new recombinant innovations emerged. One of the most exciting is an inexpensive device that might be one day be credited with vastly reducing the number of cases of malaria worldwide, which currently number in the hundreds of millions.
The prize we offered was won by an American entrepreneur, Tom Kruer, and his son Nathan, after they extensively investigated existing scientific literature regarding malaria vector mosquitoes. They learned what is well known among researchers - that mosquitoes are attracted to the heat and sweat of the human body. But they then recombined this knowledge in a fascinating way. They reframed the problem around trapping mosquitoes with a device that is cheaper and more effective than bed nets.
The Kruer's prize-winning invention is a solar-powered, mosquito-repellent, anti-malarial device, costing less than ten dollars, that is now in production. That sounds fantastically technical. But in reality, it's amazingly simple. Tom and Nathan created a cone of paraffin wax that is placed outside in direct sunlight during the day to absorb and retain heat. At night, the sweat from a wristband that is worn during the day is placed inside the cone. The cone steadily releases the heat it absorbed throughout the night, which mosquitoes are attracted to, along with the scent of sweat. They enter the cone, unable to distinguish the heat and scent from that of a human, and are then trapped inside.
This simple, cheap, and amazing new invention is, in fact, a recombinant innovation. And it was discovered by charting the wise course suggested by one of our partners, who said that in the 21st century, "if you want an answer, ask everyone."
Consider today's news. The debt crisis in Greece. The budget battle in Washington. Severe drought in Africa. These challenges contribute to economic insecurity the world over.
Consider environmental degradation the immense pressures of economic forces on local communities the dire need for sustainable urbanization, affordable infrastructure, and accessible communication. These issues are deeply intertwined and perhaps inseparable from one another.
Where climate change ends, economic uncertainty begins. Where economic uncertainly ends, urban poverty begins. This is the nature of 21st-century social challenges. And this is why innovation, more than ever, is crucial.
Working together -- by building bridges between different people and disciplines, different perspectives and experiences -- we can discover new ways of framing problems, new ways of recombining, and new ways of seeing the world 
More than ever, we need collaborative reframing. More than ever, we need recombination. More than ever, we need innovation. Because more than ever, we have the obligation and the opportunity to build a better world.

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Impasse Rattles Short-Term Credit Markets

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Big banks and companies have withdrawn $37.5 billion from money market funds that invest in Treasury debt, underscoring how institutions are rethinking their view of Treasury notes. 

 BODY:
The reverberations of Washington's impasse over a debt deal are already being felt in the short-term credit markets, a key artery of the economy that daily supplies trillions of dollars of credit.
Over the last week, big banks and companies have withdrawn $37.5 billion from money market funds that invest in Treasury debt and other ultra-safe securities, the biggest weekly drop this year. Meanwhile, in the vast market for repurchase agreements, in which many financial firms make short-term loans to one another, borrowers are beginning to demand higher yields.
 These moves underscore how companies and big financial institutions are beginning to rethink their traditional view that notes issued by the United States Treasury are indistinguishable from cash, even though many experts say they think it is unlikely that the government would miss payments on its obligations.
The $37.5 billion drop, reported Thursday in a weekly survey by the Investment Company Institute, echoed what other analysts were seeing.
In the first three days of this week, investors pulled $17 billion from funds that invested only in government securities, a reversal of the daily inflows of $280 million for much of July, said Peter Crane, the president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual funds.
"It's big, no doubt about it," he said. "Seventeen billion isn't a run, but it's definitely indicative that investors are shifting their assets. If this were to continue for another week or two, it would be very disturbing."
Though lawmakers have been clashing all week on proposals to cut the deficit and raise the debt limit ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline set by the Treasury Department, bond markets have largely shrugged off the risk of a default or a downgrade of the Washington's AAA credit rating.
Interest rates on longer-term Treasuries have held steady, but the yield on notes coming due next week, after the deadline, has moved sharply higher in recent days. The yield on Treasury bills coming due Aug. 4 jumped five basis points to 15 basis points, a significant move for a security that carried a yield close to zero earlier this month, said Jim Caron, head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley.
"It's a tell-tale sign of something that could reverberate if it spreads to other markets, and all the uncertainty with the debt ceiling is the functional equivalent of a tightening," Mr. Caron said. "I don't think there is a default risk at all but the market is saying it's not going to take any chances."
While money market fund managers say they are not seeing a sizable wave of redemptions yet, they are setting aside more cash, leaving it at custodial bank accounts in case investors demand their money back. At Fidelity, the Boston-based firm that has $442 billion in money market assets, managers are avoiding Treasury bills that come due on Aug. 4 and Aug. 11, however unlikely a technical default may be.
"We are positioning our portfolio to respond to a downgrade or a default and we are positioning the fund to respond to redemptions," said Robert Brown, president of money markets at Fidelity. Mr. Brown would not say how much cash was being kept at hand, but said "it's a higher balance than one would expect to see."
In the commercial paper market, where companies raise funds for their short-term borrowing needs, buyers are also seeking shorter-term paper.
In the last week, investors have shown signs of wanting quick access to their money, with financial borrowers raising on Wednesday only $1 million in notes that come due in 81 days or more, according to the Federal Reserve. That is down from $479 million on July 22.
At the same time, the amount of commercial paper issued with a duration of just one to four days rose to $920 million, from $771 million.
"Investors are scrambling to bolster their liquidity profile," said Chris Conetta, head of global commercial paper trading at Barclays Capital. "They understand that a default or downgrade could be a big, systemic event."
 In the repurchase market, known as the repo market, borrowers take loans and in exchange hand over a little more than the equivalent loan amount in securities. Because of their risk-free status, Treasuries are highly favored as collateral, estimated to account for about $4 trillion in the repo markets.
 The fear is that if the United States credit rating drops, the value of those treasuries could respond in kind. Borrowers would then have to post more collateral to obtain their loans, effectively raising the cost of borrowing. That could ripple into the broader market, raising interest rates on all types of loans, analysts warn.
"The repo market is a pressure point because it can have an impact on overall credit availability, which bleeds through to mortgage rates," said Robert Toomey, managing director at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. "Treasuries become a little less attractive if they are more expensive to finance."
The overnight repo rate, which started the week at about three basis points, was about 17 basis points Thursday evening, according to Credit Suisse. That means that to finance $100 million overnight in the repo market it would now cost about $472 per day, up from about $83 on Monday.
"It's a bigger deal than a lot of people recognize," said Howard Simons, a strategist at Bianco Research, a bond market specialist. "If you downgrade the securities you have to put more up for collateral and that affects pretty much everybody out there who has held these in reserve. I don't care if you're a bank, insurance company, exchange or clearinghouse."
To be sure, most observers say the ripples in the repo market will not be anything like those felt in the fall of 2008, when creditors lost faith in the ability of banks to pay back their short-term loans. That caused a problem for companies like General Electric, which struggled to finance its daily operations as a result. Back then, the sharp drop-off in repo lending helped bring the financial system to its knees. 
"I think people are looking at the U.S. as the cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry pile," said Jason New, a senior managing director at GSO Capital Partners.
"To me, the downgrade is not dropping a boulder in a still lake. This is dropping a pebble, but nevertheless there are still ripples."

HEADLINE: Treating the Cause, Not the Illness

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: A group is training young volunteers to treat the social factors, like poor nutrition and housing, that make patients sick. 

 BODY:
In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger co-founded the nation's first community health center. Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing "prescriptions" for food - stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be "filled" at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center's money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: "The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food." The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the "war on poverty." But in others, we're still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the "social determinants of health." In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick.
One of the most impressive organizations in the country that is developing an approach to do this is Health Leads, which mobilizes and trains about 1000 volunteers each year who staff resource desks located in the waiting rooms of 23 hospital clinics or health centers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Providence, R.I., and Washington. At these sites, doctors now regularly "prescribe" a wide range of basic resources - like food assistance, housing improvements, or heating fuel subsidies - which Health Leads' volunteers "fill" - applying their problem solving skills (and tenacity) to identify resources anywhere they may be available.
Health Leads was co-founded by Rebecca Onie in 1996, while she was an undergraduate student at Harvard University. Onie had first witnessed the intimate relationship between poverty and health while volunteering at Greater Boston Legal Services, where she assisted low-income clients who had housing problems. Many lived in dilapidated apartments with leaky pipes, broken windows, rooms full of mold, and walls infested with cockroaches and rats. Often families couldn't afford to pay for heat. Towards the end of the month, some ran out of food. Onie found herself interviewing mothers whose children came to the office wheezing and coughing from asthma and lung infections - health problems caused or triggered by bad housing. Often, the children had been in and out of hospitals for years; many had fallen far behind in school.
One day, she read a magazine story about Barry Zuckerman, chairman of pediatrics at Boston Medical Center (B.M.C.), who had established the Medical-Legal Partnership for Children, a program that connected doctors with lawyers to assist patients (it has since spread to more than 235 health institutions nationally). Close to 70 percent of the patients at B.M.C. are poor and Zuckerman, like Geiger, had grown tired of treating children, only to see them readmitted to the hospital because nothing was done to address the causes of their illnesses. In some cases - as when a child has chronic asthma attacks because the landlord refuses to clean up mold - a lawyer could be more effective than a doctor.
"I thought bringing lawyers into the hospital was brilliant," recalled Onie. She called Zuckerman to see how she could help and he invited her to spend six months talking to people in the unit. There Onie found doctors who were "smart, passionate and totally committed to their patients" and yet "stymied in terms of their ability to bring about the health outcomes they wanted." Some physicians told her they knew they should be asking more about food, housing or social issues, but they were afraid of opening a "pandora's box." "I have no idea where to begin to address the problems," one physician told Onie. "I have 13 minutes with each patient." (Studies reveal that doctors are reluctant to inquire about issues - domestic violence, for example - when they feel powerless to intervene.)
Onie thought that students could help. With Zuckerman, she founded Health Leads (formerly Project Health) to recruit and train students to provide patients with connections to resources deemed necessary by doctors and other health care providers. "What are college students built to do?" asks Onie. "Track down information!" She adds: "Say your client is a Latina mother working two jobs. She needs food supplements. She has no transportation. Your job is to locate a food pantry within walking distance of her home that's open after 8:00 p.m. and has a Spanish speaker on staff. That's a perfect problem for a college student. It's like a really fancy Google search."
From the outset, Onie made the decision to work only with students who demonstrated high levels of motivation and commitment. In some of Health Lead's sites today, as few as 10 percent of students who apply get selected. This has had the effect of attracting serious volunteers. In 2010, the organization reported that in 57 percent of cases its volunteers secured a needed resource within 90 days. This year, Health Leads will serve 9,300 patients and families - not a huge number given the scope of the problem it seeks to address - but the approach is gaining momentum.
One indication is that, where Health Leads works, doctors are changing their behavior. In the Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, for example, over the past year, there has been a 300 percent increase in doctors "prescribing" Health Leads through the hospital's Electronic Medical Record. The resources they request for patients include things like exercise or summer meal programs for children or subsidized child care for mothers, so they can find work and afford better food and housing.
Health Leads is also demonstrating that it can improve the efficiency of social workers. In some of the large urban hospitals where the program operates, the ratio of patient visits to social workers is close to 25,000 to 1. Because students can handle basic - but time consuming - cases, social workers can concentrate on what they're trained for. At The Dimock Center, in Roxbury, Mass., initial data suggests that the program has doubled the time social workers can devote to therapeutic work.
Health Leads is also preparing a pipeline of new health care leaders. Two thirds of its students are either in pre-med tracks or pursuing careers in health, and the exposures they are getting are likely to shape the way they think about health care. As one volunteer said: "When I'm a doctor, I will never prescribe antibiotics that say 'take with food' without making sure that the family actually has food in the house."
Many health care professionals know that social conditions impact health more than medical care. In a survey conducted by Health Leads at Bellevue Hospital in New York, almost every pediatric primary care provider said the failure to address social and psychological needs "impairs" their ability to treat patients effectively. The vast majority said that the hospital needed a standardized system to screen for these needs on routine well-child visits. But 80 percent said it lacked the capacity to do it.
There is very little money available for this work. Medicaid doesn't generally reimburse social workers for non-therapeutic tasks. Most of the time, this kind of assistance falls through the cracks. Society then spends oodles of money treating the crises that follow. "There is a tension between what we all know, and agree, needs to be done, and what we are doing," says Onie. "As a society, we haven't yet decided that we actually want less emergency room visits."
Just a year ago, Onie thought that Health Leads' biggest obstacle would be getting doctors to pay attention to patients' social needs - given all the demands on their time. Today, the organization is getting so many referrals from doctors, for the first time in its history it has long waiting lists. Five decades after the war on poverty, a work force that can systematically address the social causes of illness is still to be built. Health Leads offers a model of how it might work. A broader system could incorporate students, community health workers, and lay workers. It need not be a perfect solution, nor an expensive one. But something has to be done. And the big challenge is getting health care decision makers to prioritize and pay for it. As Onie says: "How would we ever think that we're going to secure a return on our health care dollar until we start dealing with these social factors?"

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse to Cut 2,000 Jobs After Earnings Fall

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Pretax profit at Credit Suisse's investment banking unit fell 71 percent as concerns about European sovereign debt led to a drop in bond trading. 

 BODY:
5:13 p.m. | Updated 
Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it planned to cut about 2,000 jobs after a "disappointing" second quarter that included a big drop in earnings in investment banking.
Net income fell to 768 million Swiss francs ($958 million) in the three months ended June 30, from 1.6 billion francs in the period a year earlier, the bank said. The earnings missed analysts' consensus forecast of 1 billion francs, according to Reuters.
The bank's shares fell 46 centimes, or 2 percent, to 28.80 francs ($35.92) in Zurich on Thursday. Its American depository receipts dropped 39 cents, or 1 percent, to $35.39.
Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, called the bank's results a "disappointing performance" and said that earnings at the investment banking unit were "below our expectations." Pretax profit at its investment banking unit fell 71 percent in the period as concern about European sovereign debt prompted a drop in bond trading.
"These were very poor results, although away from the very poor performance in trading they did hold up quite well in a difficult quarter," said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca in London. "However, the management changes and the cost-cutting program demonstrate management's concern about the business."
Credit Suisse, the second-largest bank in Switzerland after UBS, said it planned to cut 4 percent of the total work force of 50,700 by the end of 2012 to reduce costs by 1 billion francs. Credit Suisse had added 1,500 jobs over the last 12 months.
Return on equity, a measure of profitability, fell to 9.7 percent in the second quarter from 17.8 percent in the period a year earlier.
"In order to ensure attractive returns in the face of an uncertain and challenging economic and market environment, we continue to be proactive about seeking cost efficiencies across the bank," Mr. Dougan said.
The earnings come two days after UBS warned that it would miss its profit target for 2014, after earnings fell by half in the second quarter because of a similar drop in investment banking income.
Trading operations at the investment banks were hit hardest amid concerns that Greece's sovereign debt crisis could spread to more European economies. Credit Suisse also cited "deteriorating economic indicators, particularly in the U.S."
Earnings at Swiss banks were additionally burdened because the Swiss franc appreciated against major currencies as a result of debt troubles in Europe and the United States.
Pretax profit at Credit Suisse's investment banking operation fell to 231 million francs in the second quarter from 784 million francs in the period a year earlier. Revenue at the unit dropped to 2.8 billion francs from 4.1 billion francs.
To help add private banking clients, Credit Suisse said on Thursday that Walter Berchtold would become chairman of private banking and Hans-Ulrich Meister was to become chief executive of the business in addition to his role as head of the bank's Swiss operations. The changes will be effective at the beginning of August.
The bank's private banking business attracted 11.5 billion francs in net new assets in the quarter while its asset management arm had 4 billion francs in new money. Still, assets under management at its private bank fell 0.7 percent.

HIGHLIGHT: How many lawyers does it take to argue a case? For one class-action suit, 42. 

 BODY:
My column this week concerns a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors damaged by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The defendants include Lehman's former officers and directors, as well as its auditor and 51 investment banks that underwrote Lehman securities.
I don't know how much, if anything, the investors will eventually get, although the fact that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court refused to dismiss a large part of the case may make settlements more likely.
Nor do I know how much will be collected in legal fees. The plaintiffs' lawyers are typically paid only if they prevail, but the defense lawyers are presumably being paid by the hour.
I count 42 lawyers -- 12 for the plaintiffs and 30 for the defendants -- who have filed appearances in the case. There may, of course, be more lawyers working on the case back at the office. You can only imagine the fees being collected when the judge holds a hearing.
For the plaintiffs:
 Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann (six lawyers filed appearances with the court) 
Barroway Topaz Kessler Meltzer & Check. (six)
For various defendants:
 Allen & Overy (two) 
Boies, Schiller & Flexner (two)
Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson (two)
Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman (two)
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (four)
Cleary Gottleib Steen & Hamilton (three)

HEADLINE: The Hidden Costs of Medical Student Debt

BYLINE: PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: Just how much should students, and society, pay for the next generation of doctors? 

 BODY:
He was a senior surgeon many of us in training wanted to emulate -- smart, busy and beloved by patients and staff. But we loved him most because he could have been any one of us. He had slogged through the same training program some 15 years earlier, and he had survived.
I caught up with him one afternoon during my internship, hoping to glean some wisdom, but all he could talk about was how he was going to be seeing patients less and focusing on his dream of improving hospital quality and efficiency. "Don't get me wrong," he said. "I love caring for patients." But the stress of keeping a practice afloat was wearing him down.
"Plus the monkey is finally off my back now," he said with an enormous grin. "I paid off my last student loan."
My heart dropped. That the specter of student loan payments would loom over my life for at least another decade and a half was utterly disheartening.
But absolutely true. It wasn't until my early 40s that I paid off my last loan.
For almost three generations, debt has been a nearly inescapable part of becoming a doctor. Over 80 percent of each medical student class will graduate in debt; and while that percentage has remained unchanged for 25 years, the increase in the total amount owed has leapfrogged over all other economic reality checks, like inflation and the consumer price index. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, which has been trying to address the problem for nearly a decade, young doctors who graduated from medical school last year had an average debt of $158,000, or $2.3 billion for the group as a whole. Almost a third of students owed more than $200,000, a number that will only increase with the addition of interest over payback periods of 25 to 30 years.
The skyrocketing costs are primarily due to the expansion and increasing complexity of universities and academic medical centers, and to the trend among university administrators to use tuition to support institutional projects that may be only indirectly linked to medical student education.
But while upgraded clinical facilities and spectacular research programs are obvious reasons, another key factor has gone largely unnoticed. It is our society's assumption that individual indebtedness is required to obtain big-ticket items, whether they are cars, houses or higher education.
"It's become normal now to take out loans to get anything of value," said Dr. S. Ryan Greysen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of a fascinating study published this month on the historical and social factors that have contributed to rising medical student indebtedness. "Getting a medical education has become similar to getting a mortgage on your house."
The acceptance of student indebtedness as the "norm" of medical school has provided a kind of carte blanche for robust tuition increases. Median yearly tuition at public medical schools is $29,000, and at private institutions it is $47,000 -- increases from two decades earlier of over 312 percent and 165 percent, respectively. While some may counter that future doctors can well afford such increases and loans, the rising debt load has had and will have repercussions on patients, particularly those in greatest need.
Paying so much up front has transformed an education that was once a path to public service into a significant financial investment that needs to yield returns. "Because of all the debt, people stop thinking of medicine as an incredible opportunity to do good," Dr. Greysen said. For some young people, looming debts mean eschewing a calling to serve a particularly needy, less lucrative patient population or practice, and instead pursuing a well-compensated subspecialty that caters to the comfortably insured.
For others, such large debts mean forgoing a medical career altogether. Cost remains a key deterrent for pre-medical students and is an important reason there aren't more African-American, Hispanic and Native American doctors. Despite the well-documented benefits of a diverse physician work force, these economic pressures are transforming the socioeconomic makeup of medical school classes; medical students are increasingly from affluent backgrounds. In 1971, almost 30 percent of medical students came from households with incomes in the lowest 40th percentile, but only 10 percent of all medical students now do, and more than half come from families in the top quintile.
The acceptance of debt as a prerequisite of medical education has obscured even the most basic fact: It's unclear just how many dollars it takes to educate a medical student. Because we accept debt, few university administrators have ever been held accountable for the tuition charged. And costs vary wildly among medical schools even within the same state, with one institution charging as much as three times what another charges for tuition and fees.
But medical students and the general public are not the only ones who are in the dark. Medical student dollars have become so enmeshed in supporting the diverse endeavors of a university or academic medical center that it's become difficult even for those who set the prices to know what exactly they are charging for.
Over the last few years, some medical schools and educators have tried to address the problem. A few have tried to elicit alumni donations to support medical students, freeze costs or even do away with tuition altogether. Others have suggested highly innovative solutions that would strategically leverage the debt so that those medical students who went into high-need, less remunerative specialties would have less (or nothing) to pay.
But few of those changes will have any significant or long-lasting effect until we disengage ourselves from the notion that debt is a necessary part of medical education. As long as indebtedness is viewed as a normal part of becoming a doctor, tuition will continue to surge unchecked, and the implications for patients will only multiply. And we will be no closer to an answer for the most important question of all: Just how much should students, and society, pay for the next generation of doctors?

An I.P.O. Built on the Basics: Sugar and Coffee | Dunkin' Brands had a debut worthy of a sizzling Internet company, as the fast-food chain's shares surged 46.6 percent on Wednesday.
The initial public offering was wildly oversubscribed, and served as a lesson that for all the attention heaped on Facebook, Groupon, Zynga and other technology start-ups developing the next new thing, demand has been just as strong for some basic businesses that sell food, clothes and other consumer goods.
"People love brands, and we have two iconic brands with real history," said Nigel Travis, the company's chief executive.DealBook
Credit Suisse to Cut 2,000 Jobs After Earnings Fall | Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it planned to cut about 2,000 jobs after a "disappointing" second quarter in which its investment banking earnings dropped sharply.
Net income fell to 768 million Swiss francs ($958 million) in the three months ended June 30, from 1.6 billion francs in the period a year earlier, the bank said in a statement. The earnings missed analysts' consensus forecast of 1 billion francs, according to Reuters.
Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, called the bank's results a "disappointing performance."DealBook

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Polarity

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The partisan momentum building in Congress behind separate plans to avert a debt crisis seems to be pushing Republicans and Democrats further apart from an ultimate compromise, writes Jennifer Steinhauer. With less than six days remaining until an Aug. 2 deadline to approve an increase in the federal debt ceiling, lawmakers, she writes, appear to see divergent realities: "Republicans in the House sharing near universal belief that the Senate will eventually cave and accept their plan, and Senate Democrats assured that they will have the last word over the weekend and ultimately force the hand of the House."
The House is expected to vote Thursday on a revised plan offered by Speaker John A. Boehner to raise the debt ceiling and cut federal spending. Carl Hulse writes that Mr. Boehner took a tougher-than-usual approach to muster support for his plan, even as Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, made it clear the House legislation was dead on arrival in his chamber.
At one of the most crucial moments in his presidency, President Obamafinds himself sidelined in the debt fight after deploying his heavy weaponry Monday night in the form of a national address, Jackie Calmes writes. She explains, "His challenge now is twofold: to reassert himself and shape the outcome in substantive terms, and to come out ahead politically - or at least unharmed - heading into his re-election campaign."
The president of the credit rating agencyStandard & Poor's, Deven Sharma, told lawmakers on Wednesday that default was unlikely, Ed Wyatt writes. However, Mr. Sharma added that the federal government's credit rating could still be lowered if Congress doesn't come up with an adequate plan to address spending and the soaring budget deficit.
As the Aug. 2 deadline approaches, the Treasury Department is developing a priority plan for how to handle the millions of checks it sends out each month if Congress does not raise the federal debt ceiling.
Michael Cooper and Louise Story drew up this primer on the debt ceiling crisis to explain how a failure to raise the ceiling might affect the federal government, state governments and individual citizens. They look at things that are known and things that remain unclear.
The battle over President Obama's overhaul of the health care system has reached the Supreme Court, Adam Liptak writes. On Wednesday, a conservative group asked the court to overturn the law on the grounds that Congress overstepped its constitutional authority, an argument that was rejected by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati. If the court decides to hear the appeal, the justices could rule by next summer. In the near term, federal appeals courts in Atlanta and Richmond, Va., are expected to rule on challenges to the law.
As Gov. Rick Perry of Texas gallops down the campaign trail building momentum and a donor base for a potential run for the Republican presidential nomination, his back problems, described as minor by aides, are drawing greater scrutiny, Manny Fernandez writes.
Around the Web:Lawmakers' "fans" on Facebook have taken to the site in droves to vent or ask questions about the debt ceiling debate, The Washington Post reports.
Happening in Washington:
-President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner at 3 p.m., then with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at 3:30.
-Mr. Geithner testifies at 9:30 a.m. before the House Financial Services Committee on the international financial system.
-Sometime today, Mrs. Clinton will meet with the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak.
-Progressive groups will rally on Capitol Hill at noon to demand that Congress not gut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, or push America into default.

HEADLINE: Surveying the Electoral Damage of the Debt Debate

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There aren't any winners here, but you can argue that Republicans have sustained more damage. 

 BODY:
Republicans may not have scored a knockout blow on the policy elements of the debt ceiling debate. But since the remaining proposals consist entirely of spending cuts while still reducing the debt significantly, the judges ought to award them a unanimous decision unless something changes in the last round.
Our focus, however, is on electoral politics, and there we see more of a mixed bag. There aren't any winners here, but you can argue that Republicans have sustained more damage.
The chart below tracks the change in approval ratings for President Obama and the Congress since the start of the year, with the latter category broken down into approval ratings for Congressional Republicans, Congressional Democrats, and for the Congress as a whole. (The lines in the chart represent smoothed trendlines; individual data points are omitted to reduce clutter.)
Mr. Obama's approval ratings have been on a downward trajectory for the past couple of months. They now stand at about 45 percent, down from around 50 percent for most of May after American special forces killed Osama bin Laden.
It's not clear, however, whether the debt ceiling debate is responsible for this. Mr. Obama has also had to contend with a sluggish economy, which voters are growing yet more pessimistic about. There may also be some reversion to the mean as the news about Bin Laden has faded from people's memory.
A 45 percent approval rating is tenuous. If that's the number Mr. Obama carries into next November, he'd be about a 2-to-1 underdog against an average Republican nominee. Nevertheless, Mr. Obama's approval rating has been at roughly 45 percent for most of the past year, excluding the bounces following the assassination attempt against Gabrielle Giffords and the news about Bin Laden. So this is a problem for Mr. Obama -- but not necessarily a new one. The economy remains the more significant threat -- and the risk to him from the debt debate is that it could contribute either directly or indirectly to the economic slump, whether by triggering a credit downgrade, undermining consumer and business confidence, or simply by taking money out of the economy, which could sap G.D.P. in future quarters.
Approval ratings for Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have declined slowly but more steadily -- and they had already been fairly low. They're down to 25 percent from a peak of 35 percent in late February, and from about 30 percent two months ago.
Since Congress's temperature is not taken as often by pollsters as Mr. Obama's, the margin of error on these numbers is higher. But there is a lot of supplementary data to support the case that the debt debate has had some impact upon them. Republicans in Congress receive poor marks from voters for their handling of the negotiations, and their positioning has been less in step with that of the typical voter.
But do approval ratings for the Congress matter? They are often fairly low; Republicans won a net of 63 seats in last year's elections even though their ratings weren't much better than they are now.
There is some evidence that the approval rating for the Congress (which has also declined somewhat) is a good predictor of the degree of anti-incumbent sentiment. Gallup data on Congressional approval, which dates back to 1974, correlates fairly strongly with the turnover in U.S. House seats. Specifically, every additional percentage point decline in Congress's approval rating has historically caused about 1.5 additional members of Congress to either lose their seats or concede them by retiring.
Since Congress's approval rating is now extremely low, 2012 could be another high-volatility cycle. There are 93 first-term members of the current House (78 of whom are Republicans). Next year could match or exceed that threshold, especially given redistricting, which could be responsible for another 20 or so incumbents either losing or retiring above and beyond the impact of the overall political climate.
What's less clear is how the losses might be distributed between the parties. An anti-Republican wave is plausible, but so is an anti-incumbent one. The election of 2012 could resemble that of another redistricting year, 1992, in which there were a remarkable 110 first-term members of Congress elected, but in which the losses were split fairly evenly between the parties. (Democrats lost a net of 9 seats in the House despite winning the presidency.)
The most tangible sign that Republicans had gotten themselves into irredeemable trouble would be a shift in the generic Congressional ballot. Those numbers have closed a bit since the start of the year, but it's not clear that there's been any impact from the recent events. (Although it's hard to say because only two polling firms -- Rasmussen Reports and Public Policy Polling -- have been surveying on the question with any frequency.)
So far, in other words, I think we're seeing a lot of caution lights for the Republicans -- but not yet any red flags. The nearest thing to an exception is probably this: the recent CNN poll that finds that 58 percent of voters think the policies proposed by Republicans in Congress would take the country in the wrong direction. Not only is that figure up significantly from where it was when CNN last polled it in January (when it stood at 50 percent). It's also by some margin the worst rating that CNN has found for either party since they began polling on the question in 1994.
The good news for Republicans: the ratings for Democrats in Congress are nearly as bad, with 53 percent of voters saying their policies would take the country in the wrong direction. That's the worst that Democrats have ever rated on the question. But I don't think Republicans have done themselves any favors in the debate; they have probably weakened their chances of retaining the House some.
The impact on the presidential race is less clear and do not necessarily work to Mr. Obama's advantage. Presidents do not ordinarily run against the Congress -- at least not if they want to win a second term (the clear exception to both rules being Harry Truman in 1948). And Mr. Obama's opponent is likely to be a governor rather than someone from Washington.
Still, the combination of the assertiveness of the Republican Congress and their lack of popularity is unusual -- when Republicans took over the Congress in 1995, and Democrats did in 2007, voters were more much more optimistic about them, at least at the outset. The risk for Republicans is that they exert so much influence on policy that the usual polarity of divided-government elections is reversed, and voters are as concerned about checking their influence as they are Mr. Obama's.

HEADLINE: Reid Promises to Kill Boehner's Bill Before Day's End

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Democratic Senate leader hopes to quickly dispatch the House G.O.P. bill so he can move toward consideration of his own approach to raising the debt ceiling. 

 BODY:
If John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, manages to pass his debt ceiling bill today, it may have a very short half life.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, announced Thursday afternoon that the Senate will take up Mr. Boehner's bill -- and kill it -- before the day's end.
"As soon as the House completes its vote tonight, the Senate will move to take up that bill. It will be defeated," Mr. Reid promised in brief remarks on the floor. "No Democrat will vote for a short-term Band-Aid that would put our economy at risk and put the nation back in this untenable situation a few short months from now."
The House is expected to vote on Mr. Boehner's legislation after the close of financial markets Thursday evening, perhaps as late as 6 p.m. The promise of a quick vote in the Senate is intended to complicate Mr. Boehner's last-minute efforts to round up votes for his legislation.
Mr. Reid is also hoping to quickly clear the decks of Mr. Boehner's bill so he can move toward consideration of his own approach to raising the debt ceiling. It remains unclear, however, whether he can get cooperation from Republican senators to do that.
With just five days left until the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the debt ceiling, the legislative calendar is getting short. Mr. Reid's decision to move quickly to dispatch the speaker's bill is an indication of just how short.
The move in the Senate is likely to lead to a long weekend of Congressional activity and debt ceiling debates as lawmakers struggle to reach some sort of compromise that can avoid a default.
"Our economy and the financial markets desperately need stability," Mr. Reid said. "Speaker Boehner's bill does not provide it. It is time for Tea Party Republicans to stop resisting compromise."

HIGHLIGHT: President Obama is expected to announce the next round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards on Friday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
Jay Carney, the press secretary for President Obama, told journalists on Wednesday at the White House that the President would announce the next round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards on Friday. The standards cover model years 2017 through 2025. As reported earlier by The Times, the president is expected to mandate corporate-fleet averages of 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025. (The White House)
 Powered by the brand's 2-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine, the 2012 Ford Explorer was certified by the E.P.A. with fuel-economy ratings of 20 m.p.g. in city and 28 m.p.g. in highway driving, Ford announced Thursday. The Explorer is the first vehicle to be equipped with the engine in North America. Pricing for the optional power plant, which is available on only the 2-wheel-drive Explorer, has not been announced. The vehicle's standard 3.5-liter V-6 is rated at 17 m.p.g. in city and 25 m.p.g. in highway driving. (Ford)
 Ferrari began Thursday to offer its Genuine Maintenance Program for buyers of the 458 Italia, California and FF in North America. The plan covers all scheduled maintenance for the first seven years of ownership and is transferable to subsequent owners of the cars within the seven-year window. Ferrari first made the program available to customers in Europe earlier this year. (Ferrari)
Renault, having reported depressed sales earlier this year after government-sponsored scrappage incentives were phased out, reported that its first-half profits for 2011 were down 19 percent relative to a year ago. Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Renault-Nissan, attributed the downturn to an aging model line and problems with suppliers. (Automotive News Europe)
 Responding officially to reports that have circulated since early June, Daniel F. Akerson, the General Motors chief executive, told reporters at a Detroit assembly plant Wednesday that the company's Opel division was not for sale. Earlier this month, G.M. issued a statement criticizing Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, for suggesting that a Chinese brand, and not VW, would be interested in buying Opel, G.M.'s primary brand in Europe.

HEADLINE: House Delays Budget Vote

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: House Speaker John A. Boehner delayed an expected vote on Republican debt ceiling legislation. 

 BODY:
5:47 p.m. | Updated House Speaker John A. Boehner delayed an expected vote on Republican debt ceiling legislation, abruptly shifting business on the House floor in the middle of the debt debate.
It was unclear immediately whether the debate and vote on the legislation was delayed because Republicans did not feel that they had the votes to ensure its passage.
The vote on Mr. Boehner's plan was expected to take place Thursday evening. But the chair on the House floor suddenly interrupted the debate on the debt ceiling legislation to announce that the House would shift gears.
Mr. Boehner had spent two days furiously lobbying freshman Republicans for his plan, which would cut federal spending by $917 billion and provide enough borrowing authority to keep the government solvent until January.
The decision to postpone the vote comes as the country moves closer to the Aug. 2 deadline when Treasury Department officials have said the country will run out of authority to borrow money.
In four hours of debate leading up to the expected vote, Republican lawmakers described the bill as the only legislative compromise that can keep the country from defaulting on its debt next week.
"We must act today, approve this bill, and balance the budget for future generations," said Representative Jeb Hernsarling of of Texas.
Democrats, though, called the bill an abdication of responsibility that would force a second gut-wrenching debate about the debt ceiling in an election year.
"It's high time that we stop playing Russian roulette with the American economy and with American jobs," said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.
Legislative maneuvering had become intense on Capitol Hill Thursday as lawmakers in both chambers and in both parties sought to game out a procedural advantage in the days left before the debt ceiling deadline.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, indicated earlier that the Senate will take up the House legislation Thursday night. Mr. Reid had indicated that he would come to the Senate floor again at 7 p.m. Thursday night.
It was unclear whether Mr. Boehner's delay might indicate more procedural moves to push a possible vote closer to the deadline, thereby increasing the pressure on the Senate to pass it.
There was no immediate reaction from the White House, where officials mindful of the countdown to Aug. 2 scrambled to find out when a House vote might be rescheduled. Though Mr. Obama had threatened to veto the House bill, officials were concerned about it being shelved again given that it would delay the effort to reach an ultimate compromise.

HEADLINE: Debt Fixes' Drag on the Economy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Austerity proposals from both parties are expected to slow economic growth for the next decade, but the drag from the Senate Democratic plan would be worse, a study finds. 

 BODY:
As we explained earlier this week, almost every possible outcome of the current debt talks debacle will most likely be bad for the fragile recovery. Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, has now estimated how the leading proposals for fiscal consolidation - from the House speaker, John Boehner, a Republican, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat - would affect the economy over the next decade.
As you can see in the chart below, both legislators' packages are expected to drag on economic growth, since cutting government spending has ripple effects throughout the economy.
The economic forecasts are based on the Congressional Budget Office's scoring of the two legislators' proposals, including two different versions of Mr. Boehner's plan. He recently amended his original proposal to front-load more of the spending cuts in order to appease some of his more conservative colleagues. 
Even so, Mr. Boehner's proposal still has smaller spending cuts than Mr. Reid's, and as a result, it hurts economic growth less.
The new Boehner plan would slow gross domestic product growth by an average of 0.1 percentage point per year for the fiscal years 2012 through 2015. By contrast, the Reid plan would slow growth by about 0.25 percentage point on average during the same period, with the biggest annual drag at nearly 0.5 percentage point in the 2013 fiscal year.
Those drags may sound minuscule, but given the depths of the recession and how far the American economy already is from its full potential, their effects will be painful. And should these austerity measures wreak so much havoc that they actually throw the economy back into recession, the country's debt problems would actually get much worse, since downturns mean smaller tax revenues.
One important caveat, however: A significant portion of the deficit savings in Mr. Reid's plan comes from scaling back war spending. It's not clear how easy this would be to execute, as such military spending cuts would very likely be fiercely opposed by Republicans.

HEADLINE: Capitol's Tremors Unsettle White House, Too


HIGHLIGHT: The difficulties House Republicans are having passing a bill the White House opposes caused more confusion than jubilation at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 

 BODY:
The White House was taken by surprise late on Thursday afternoon by the news that Speaker John A. Boehner, facing a Republican rebellion and scrambling for votes, had once again delayed House action on his proposal to increase the nation's debt limit in return for spending cuts. Like many in Washington, administration officials up to President Obama had expected that Mr. Boehner, a Republican of Ohio, would rally enough votes of his House majority to pass the measure after first postponing the floor debate on Tuesday to tweak the bill and lobby recalcitrant conservatives.
Administration officials had no immediate reaction. On just about any other issue they might have been openly cheered by the public show of Republican infighting over a bill that Mr. Obama had threatened to veto. But with the stakes so high given the looming deadline for raising the nation's borrowing ceiling to avert an economy-rattling default, satisfaction at Republicans' disarray was offset by concern that additional delays in the legislative process only raised the prospect of a crisis.
Also, the evidence of Mr. Boehner's shaky leadership unsettled administration officials. For all their differences, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama had developed a working relationship this year, only recently coming close to a compromise package of spending cuts and revenue increases that would do more to reduce the projected growth of the national debt than the fallback bills now before the House and Democratic-controlled Senate. If Mr. Boehner loses his leverage over the House majority, administration officials fear, the White House could be left without a negotiating partner in a chamber full of uncompromising conservatives, on the debt issue and others in coming months that ultimately will demand bipartisan action.
The White House remained on the sidelines, awaiting the legislative outcome in the House and the expected Senate vote to follow rejecting the Boehner bill. Until the votes occur the White House cannot easily engage Senate Republicans in talks toward a compromise that could pass in the Senate, in turn increasing pressure on House Republicans to go along lest they be blamed for any economic crisis. 
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who served nearly four decades in the Senate and acts as the administration point person for dealing with the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, was not in touch with Mr. McConnell on Thursday, aides to both men said; Mr. McConnell made clear to Mr. Biden in a conversation on Wednesday that he would not talk until after the House vote. 
Mr. Obama has said he wants an increase in the debt limit through 2012 to avoid a repeat months from now of "this kind of circus," as his press secretary, Jay Carney, said on Thursday. He echoed Mr. Obama's argument that such timing could result in making an essential extension of the government's borrowing authority hostage to election-year partisanship, and added, "Lift the cloud that's hanging over our economy."

'Master Class' As Maria Callas, Tyne Daly transforms Terrence McNally's pulpy, entertaining 1995 portrait of the twilight of the goddess of bel canto into a haunting study of life after stardom, and of the sort of diva-sized ego that never dies (2:00). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This newly retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'War Horse' This Tony-winning, imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'All New People' Zach Braff, the actor and filmmaker (''Scrubs,'' ''Garden State''), tries his hand at playwriting with this slight and contrived but undeniably lively comedy, featuring Justin Bartha as a would-be suicide and David Wilson Barnes, Anna Camp and Krysten Ritter as the madcap crew who try to cheer him up (1:30). Second Stage, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'As You Like It' Michael Boyd, the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, emphasizes the wintry winds blowing through Shakespeare's pastoral comedy in this cleanly acted production, starring Katy Stephens as a swaggering Rosalind-as-Ganymede and Jonjo O'Neill as Orlando. Spring -- and the satisfactions of this ebullient comedy -- are a little late in arriving (2:30). Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Death Takes a Holiday' Maury Yeston's melodious score and superior singing still can't quite spark this musical, based on an Italian play from the 1920s, into consistent life. Julian Ovenden plays the Grim Reaper on a weekend vacation, and Jill Paice is the aristocrat who falls under his spell (2:20). Laura Pels Theater in the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'En el Tiempo de las Mariposas' Caridad Svich's Spanish-language adaptation (''In the Time of the Butterflies,'' in English) of Julia Alvarez's novel about the Mirabal sisters, who opposed the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo and died as a result, is sentimental and sometimes dutiful. But the production from Repertorio Espanol, a recent Obie winner, is good-looking, and the tragic story is well worth telling. Saturday and Sunday only (2:00). (Anita Gates)
- 'The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom' The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons' worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late 1960s, the '80s and the early '90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'King Lear' This Royal Shakespeare Company production, with Greg Hicks in the title role, skims along the dark surfaces of the tragedy without digging into its existential depths. Charles Aitken's Edgar and Darrell D'Silva's Kent provide animating sparks in the director David Farr's often unmoving staging (3:15). Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, lincolncenter.org. (Isherwood)
'The Patsy' David Greenspan plays the whole cast of characters in this Transport Group revival of a forgotten 1925 comedy by Barry Conners. It's slight and sentimental, but as filtered through Mr. Greenspan's unique comic sensibility, more fun than you'd expect. Directed by Jack Cummings III (1:20). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org.

'Romeo and Juliet' Rupert Goold's flashy production depicts Shakespeare's Verona as a poisonous playground of vice and violence. Unfortunately, the star-crossed lovers never gain a purchase on our hearts (2:30). Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org. (Isherwood)
'The Shoemaker' Danny Aiello pulls out all the stops, even when a few stops would be best left in place, as an affable but tormented cobbler at the center of Susan Charlotte's potboiler. Just because a drama can fit both 9/11 and the Holocaust into its overstuffed plot doesn't mean it should (1:40). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Eric Grode)
'Silence! The Musical' An ''unauthorized parody'' of the grisly movie with Brent Barrett crooning noxious songs as Hannibal Lecter and Jenn Harris giving a hilarious sendup of Jodie Foster's intense Clarice Starling. Not as funny as it needs to be (1:50). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, between First and Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Isherwood)
- 'The Winter's Tale' A thrill of true feeling runs through virtually every scene in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Shakespeare's late romance. David Farr directs with insight and a sense of immediacy, and the production is flawlessly cast, with Greg Hicks as a fiercely chilly Leontes and Samantha Young a radiant Perdita (2:40).

Last Chance
'Home/Sick' (closes on Tuesday) The Assembly, a cutting-edge young theater collective, has painstakingly researched the Weather Underground, a violent and polyamorous Vietnam-era guerrilla group. Jess Chayes's intense and thoughtful direction guides us through two decades of the group's history, focusing on its infamous bombings of government buildings and banks (and once, by accident, itself). There's also a lot of sloganeering, pot-smoking, orgying and, inevitably, self-destruction. By the end we have witnessed a sort of sociological big bang, when this tight, angry ball of political energy suddenly bursts and disbands irreparably (1:20). The Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com.
(Catherine Rampell)
'Mama, I Want to Sing' (closes on Saturday) A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444; mamafoundation.org. (Grode)
- 'Measure for Measure' (closes on Saturday) Danai Gurira's intensely felt performance as Isabella, one of Shakespeare's tougher-to-love heroines, highlights David Esbjornson's gothic production of this late comedy for Shakespeare in the Park. Michael Hayden's anguished Angelo also finds plenty of nuance in his dark character, and the comedy is handled with aplomb, bringing sparks of light to a shadow-strewn play (2:45). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, near 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org; free. (Isherwood)
'The Parting Glass' (closes on Sunday) This one-man show, set in Ireland's devastating financial crisis, tells the story of perpetual underdogs and the blind optimism that keeps them alive. Eoin (Ray Yeates), an Irish expatriate in Germany, returns home before anyone realizes the Celtic Tiger is really a paper one. The most enchanting parts of the play deal with Eoin's torrid love affair with his country's soccer team, which, like its economy, seems constantly on the verge of victory. Mr. Yeates's histrionic soccer cheerleading is inspired and will make even the most devoted theater lovers wish they followed sports. The ending, unfortunately, is little more than a trite, manufactured motivational speech, and Eoin deserves a more winning send-off (1:30).

'Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles on Broadway' Closes on Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. See photo highlight.
'A Strange and Separate People' (closes on Saturday) In his 2009 docudrama, ''The Temperamentals,'' Jon Marans examined the stigma of being gay in pre-Stonewall America. ''A Strange and Separate People,'' an engrossing earlier work, is in many ways a contemporary companion piece, addressing the struggle for many men and women to accept their homosexuality while adhering to fundamentalist religious beliefs, in this case Orthodox Judaism. While Mr. Marans has a tendency toward didacticism and the one woman in the story's conflicted triangle is somewhat abrasively characterized, the drama explores stimulating territory in Jeff Calhoun's taut production (1:30). Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Unnatural Acts' (closes on Sunday) Inspired by events at Harvard University in 1920 -- in which a group of students were brought before a secret tribunal for engaging in homosexual activities -- this Plastic Theater Company production is steeped in an earnestness that can only be described as collegiate (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
'Victory: Choices in Reaction' (closes on Sunday) Every time you think the incomparable Jan Maxwell has just done the raw-emotional-peak scene of the evening in this long overdue American premiere from PTP/NYC, she tops it with the next one. David Barlow is a rock-star Charles II in this fireworks-thrilling tale of a Puritan widow, a Restoration king, politics, power and character from Howard Barker, a British playwright with a cult following well worth joining (2:45). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Gates)

HEADLINE: Veterans Sold Out Top Rookies In Labor Deal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The empty feeling some players may have in their hearts this week is a sense of guilt that comes from betrayal. To achieve a deal, top N.F.L. rookies were sacrificed. They will receive less so veteran players and retired players can receive more.
The N.F.L. players union gave owners the pound of flesh they wanted by effectively selling out their little brothers. And veterans must now look rookies in the eye in training camp and explain how they could do such a thing. 
Easy. There weren't many options. There was one seat left on the bus and the veterans snatched it.
The owners were out for bear. They were determined to get a significant economic concession from the players, and the most convenient place to get it was from the money previously reserved for high-priced rookies.
As a result, there will, among other things, be a drastic change in the compensation for the top 10 selections in this year's N.F.L. draft.
The package signed by the St. Louis Rams' Sam Bradford last season and the deal Cam Newton is expected to sign with the Carolina Panthers this year underline the shift.
Bradford signed a six-year contract that could be worth $78 million, $50 million of it guaranteed. The speculation is that Newton, who led Auburn to a national championship, could sign a four-year deal worth slightly more than $22 million. The unknown factor is how much will be guaranteed. But the numbers alone -- Bradford at $78 million over six years versus Newton at $22 million over four -- speak for themselves.
''If you're Cam Newton, you wish you would have been Sam Bradford,'' said one player agent who requested anonymity because he did not want to appear to be critical of the union.
The rationale for the reduced pay for rookies is that they should prove themselves before being showered with money.
But the unproven rookie argument is essentially nonsense. In fact, rookies are a cornerstone of the N.F.L.'s economic structure.
In the United States' system of intercollegiate athletics, where colleges serve as the de facto minor leagues for the N.F.L., rookies earn money for others before they put on an N.F.L. uniform.
College football has memorialized Saturday afternoon in America. We fawn over talented young players. Newton was one of the most talked-about players in the recent history of college football. College stars like Bradford, Matthew Stafford, Reggie Bush and Tim Tebow -- and, yes, JaMarcus Russell -- made their names in college while making enormous sums for their institutions.
In the process, college players create rabid fan interest. And if rookies aren't important, why is the N.F.L. draft packed every year with crazed fans?
Rookies matter. They have proved themselves on one stage and the public is eager to see how they will perform on the next. As college stars, they are not compensated (or at least they're not supposed to be), but they could look forward to cashing in as N.F.L. rookies. Now, not nearly as much, thanks to the agreement between the N.F.L. and the players union to slash rookie wages.
Which means that college stars who were exploited for two or three seasons as undergraduates are now taking it on the chin once more. (And heaven help parents who attempt to put a price tag on their son. The N.C.A.A. will come down on them like a ton of bricks because the N.C.A.A. and its partners are the only ones who will make money around these parts.)
Gene Upshaw , the former union chief, once famously said that he did not represent retired players. His successor, DeMaurice Smith, is all but saying he does not represent rookies. But hey, we have a deal and a season and no one misses any money -- except the rookies. This means more for owners, more for current players and more, presumably, for retired players.
We'll see.
But someone had to be sacrificed for this deal, and the veteran players sacrificed their younger brothers. That's life in the big city, but shame on you.

HEADLINE: A Blogosphere of Bigots

BYLINE: By JOSTEIN GAARDER and THOMAS HYLLAND ERIKSEN. 
Jostein Gaarder is the author of ''Sophie's World'' and many other books. Thomas Hylland Eriksen is a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oslo.

 BODY:
Oslo
IT is tempting to view Anders Behring Breivik, the self-described Christian crusader behind the July 22 massacre in Norway, as an isolated case of pure evil. Yet history has taught us that such acts of violence rarely occur independent of their social and cultural surroundings. The assassination of Sweden's prime minister, Olof Palme, on a Stockholm street in 1986, like the January shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords outside a shopping mall in Arizona, took place at a time when caustic antigovernment rhetoric was widespread.
Mr. Breivik managed to commit two terrorist attacks in a single afternoon. But the hatred and contempt from which he drew his deranged determination were shared with many others throughout the international right-wing blogosphere. 
The racism and bigotry that have simmered for years on anti-Islamic and anti-immigration Web sites in Norway and other European countries and in the United States made it possible for him to believe he was acting on behalf of a community that would thank him. As John Donne famously put it, ''No man is an island ... every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.''
Norway's security police had estimated that only a small number of Norwegians belonged to domestic right-wing extremist groups in 2010 and that they did not pose a security threat -- an estimate that clearly has turned out to be erroneous. There may be only a few known members of ragged and powerless white-power groups, but the thousands of right-wing extremists who don't belong to recognized groups are harder to pin down.
The global Islamophobic blogosphere consists of loosely connected networks of people -- including students, civil servants, capitalists, and neo-Nazis. Many do not even see themselves as ''right-wing,'' but as defenders of enlightened values, including feminism.
The Islamophobes of Norway have no manifesto, but they share three fundamental views: that Norway is in the hands of a treacherous, spineless, politically correct elite that has betrayed the pure spirit of Norwegian culture by permitting demographic contamination; that Muslims will never be truly integrated (even if they pretend to be); and that there is a Muslim conspiracy to gain political dominance across Europe.
Hatred of Muslims and resentment of the left -- one of us has repeatedly received resentful diatribes against the ''multiculturalist elite,'' and was mentioned in Mr. Breivik's own writings -- is not confined to Norway. Mr. Breivik has praised Gates of Vienna, a Web site that compares contemporary Europe to long-ago wars with the Ottomans. He has praised writers like Bruce Bawer, the American author of ''While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within,'' and Bat Ye'Or, the pseudonym for the British author of the conspiratorial ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis.'' He is an enthusiastic reader of the virulently anti-Islamic blog of Pamela Geller, an American who leads the group ''Stop Islamization of America'' and gained notoriety for her opposition to an Islamic center near ground zero in Manhattan.
Europe's new right is, in other words, not neo-Nazi; it has swapped anti-Semitism for Islamophobia. After a hiatus of several hundred years, fear of Islam reemerged around 1989, as the Cold War was ending and Iranian mullahs issued a fatwa against the British writer Salman Rushdie. It gained popularity as increasing numbers of Muslims entered Europe as immigrants in the 1990s, and became widespread in the aftermath of 9/11. Traditional racism may actually be waning in several European countries, but hostility toward Islam and animosity toward Muslim immigrants and their children is on the rise.
Norwegian society is changing, and rapid immigration has no doubt led to tensions. In a country of under 5 million people, the number of immigrants and their children has doubled to over 550,000 in the last 15 years. Many of them are Poles and Swedes seeking work, and their presence is uncontroversial. Others have arrived as refugees and asylum-seekers from countries like Somalia, Iraq and Bosnia. And a substantial number have come to Norway to join relatives or spouses already in the country. About 200,000 -- including more than 30,000 Pakistanis -- have roots in Muslim countries.
Because of our healthy economy, fueled by North Sea oil, controversies over immigration tend to concern culture rather than economics. The perception that immigrants are patriarchal and insular has sparked controversies over everything from school excursions to swimming lessons to disrespect for female teachers. Yet many ''new Norwegians'' fully participate in society. Indeed, some of them were at work in the government buildings destroyed last week; others were taking part in the Utoya summer camp.
Conceding that a culturally diverse society raises knotty and complex social and political questions is one thing. It is quite another to state that a multicultural society is impossible, or that Islam is incompatible with democracy. Yet the blogosphere to which Mr. Breivik belonged took these views as a basic premise.
It is too early to tell if anything positive can emerge from this tragedy. In the upcoming elections, Norway's Labor Party will likely receive many sympathy votes and the right could be adversely affected by its associations with Islamophobia. In the long run, the situation is less certain. In other Scandinavian countries, Social Democrats have been pushed to the right by anti-immigration parties. We hope that Norway's longstanding consensus about immigration and integration policies will not be eroded.
Until last week, Norwegian authorities did not see the far right as a security threat. Mr. Breivik has now shown that those who claim to protect the next generation of Norwegians against Islamist extremism are, in fact, the greater menace.

HEADLINE: Slower Racial Change Found in Census of City

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
New York City edged a baby step closer to racial equilibrium in the last decade, according to census results released this month. Compared with the 1990s, the numbers of Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers grew more slowly; blacks recorded their first population loss since the Civil War; and non-Hispanic whites, who registered their smallest population loss in decades, also logged the biggest gains of any group among young children.
As a result, according to the 2010 census, the city was 33 percent non-Hispanic white, 29 percent Hispanic, 23 percent black and 13 percent Asian. In 2000, the city's makeup was 35 percent non-Hispanic white, 27 percent Hispanic, 25 percent black and 10 percent Asian. 
While the number of black and Hispanic households headed by a woman with children remained about the same or fell slightly since 2000, the number of black and Hispanic married couples with children under 6 plunged by 52 percent and 17 percent, respectively -- suggesting that many were delaying parenthood or choosing to raise families elsewhere. During the same period, the number of white married couples with children younger than 6 increased by 11 percent, with the biggest increases found in gentrifying Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Over all, the number of children under 18 in the city shrank for the first time since the 1980s, which experts attributed in part to the recession and to less robust immigration. The 612,000 city residents under 6 represented a decrease among black and Hispanic youngsters of about 41,000 and 10,000, respectively, and an increase of nearly 12,000 whites and 9,000 Asians. Whites and Asians were the only groups to record increases in their share of the population for every age under 6.
''It's clear that New York continues to draw white young adults and increasingly those with children to its gentrifying neighborhoods,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. ''These white gains among the city's younger ranks along with its continued draw of immigrant minorities suggests that New York's long-term race-ethnic balance will not change appreciably.
''This race-ethnic balance parallels a geographic balance between the strong gentrifying boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn and other outer melting pot boroughs where the younger populations are increasingly made up of minorities,'' Dr. Frey added.
Detailed 2010 census figures released this month reveal that non-Hispanic whites now constitute a minority of New York State residents younger than 5 for the first time. But the mix of race and ethnicity by age varies widely depending on location.
In New York City, minorities made up a majority of the entire population under age 78 in 2010, up from 68 only 10 years earlier.
But while minorities accounted for most Bronx residents of every age below 96, non-Hispanic whites are a majority of Manhattanites in their 20s and 30s and also of the borough's residents 57 and older.
The wide variation by borough reflects several demographic trends, including an exodus of blacks to the suburbs and the South, and white gentrification in Harlem and other Upper Manhattan neighborhoods and in Central Brooklyn, where younger couples are gravitating to raise families.
In Brooklyn in 2000, minorities made up a majority of the population under 68. But 10 years later, they were a majority of all Brooklynites under 77.
''In New York like many other cities, blacks are leaving the city for the suburbs and elsewhere, leading to an increase in the white presence among younger segments of the city population,'' Dr. Frey said.
In Brooklyn and Manhattan, the white share of younger residents, while still a minority, has grown. In Manhattan, it is more than 40 percent among the youngest children, then plunges to 23 percent among 16-year-olds and roller coasters again to 57 percent among Manhattanites in their mid-20s.
''There is a noticeable upward shift in the white percent for children, especially in Manhattan, between 2000 and 2010, suggesting more parents are staying in the city longer,'' Dr. Frey said. ''This pattern is even more noticeable in Brooklyn, where, as well, there is a notable increased share of whites in the late 20s and 30s, indicating an even stronger 2000-2010 draw of white young adults and families.''
Manhattan and Brooklyn ''are the only two boroughs to show white gains in these younger child and young adult age groups,'' he said. ''Where white gains do occur elsewhere, they are occasionally in older age groups and can be attributed to 'aging in place.' ''
Staten Island was the only borough to register a gain in minority children, which was coupled with a decline in the number of white children. The borough was still majority white at every age, but appeared to be poised for a shift: The proportion of non-Hispanic white infants under the age of 1 had dipped to 50.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Facing Call for Concessions, Verizon Workers Vote to Authorize Strike

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Verizon Communications is seeking major concessions from 45,000 unionized workers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, as it copes with a long-term drop in revenue and profits in its old-fashioned telephone business and intense competition in television and Internet services.
But the union leaders are resisting any suggestion of givebacks, saying the overall company is making plenty of money. The company earned $6.9 billion in net income for the first six months of this year, amid strong growth in its majority-owned Verizon Wireless cellphone operation. And Verizon's hefty investment in its FiOS TV and Internet services is starting to pay off. 
The battle lines between the sides were drawn more sharply on Thursday, when the Communication Workers of America announced that in balloting by 35,000 of its members at Verizon, 91 percent had authorized their leaders to call a strike as soon as Aug. 7, after the contract expires.
Verizon officials were quick to note that such a vote did not necessarily mean a strike would occur. Such votes are routine in contentious contract discussions, and negotiators usually reach a settlement before the strike deadline.
However, Verizon and union officials agree that the company's demands are far more sweeping than in previous years. Verizon says it is pushing hard for flexibility and to hold down costs because its wireline business -- which, unlike its wireless operation, is heavily unionized -- faces such intense competition, much of it nonunion.
''We're looking to make meaningful changes in the contract, which reflect the state of the wireline business as well as the economy,'' said Lawrence Marcus, Verizon's senior vice president for labor relations. ''The wireline business is basically fighting to reverse a 10-year decline in our profitability.''
Verizon is pressing its unionized workers to begin contributing to their health care premiums, proposing that workers pay $1,300 to $3,000 for family coverage, depending on the plan. The company says the contributions are similar to those made by its 135,000 nonunion employees.
Verizon also wants to make it easier to lay off workers without having to buy them out and wants to tie raises more closely to job performance, denying annual raises to subpar performers.
The company also has called for freezing pensions for current employees and eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, while making its 401(k) plans somewhat more generous for both groups. It would also like to limit sick days to five a year, as opposed to the current policy, which company officials say sets no limit.
''Verizon has put on the table the most aggressive set of contract demands we've ever seen,'' said Robert Master, a spokesman for the communications workers. ''From our perspective, this hugely profitable company that made $20 billion over the last four years, despite the worst economy in 75 years, seems determined to turn tens of thousands of secure middle-class jobs into lower-wage, much less secure jobs.''
The union has sought to put Verizon on the defensive, repeatedly highlighting that its top five executives received a total of $258 million, including stock options, over the last four years. The union is planning a big protest Saturday outside Verizon's headquarters in Lower Manhattan.
''I'm not a financial wizard, but if you can afford to pay a C.E.O. millions a year, then how can you ask workers to slash their benefits?'' said Paula M. Vinciguerra, president of the communications' workers' local on Maryland's Eastern Shore. ''I was raised with the idea of shared sacrifice.''
Verizon said many field technicians earned $95,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. But union officials said the field technicians and call center workers generally earned $29 to $37 an hour, translating to $60,000 to $77,000 for a full-time worker, with benefits worth an additional $25,000 a year.
The Verizon contracts that expire at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 7 cover nearly 45,000 workers, from Massachusetts to Virginia, including thousands of Verizon employees in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. That union is holding a separate strike authorization vote.
Jim Spillane, a spokesman for the electrical workers, declined to comment on Verizon's proposals or the contract talks.
The crux of the clash is Verizon's financial health. The company says the wireline division is struggling, while the union says Verizon's overall business is thriving.
Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said: ''It's hard to argue with Verizon's basic premise that the wireline business is a troubled business. They are going to have to find ways to shrink that business to maintain any semblance of viability.''
Last year, Verizon's wireline division trimmed its work force by buying out 11,900 workers. Its wireline operations -- which include home phones and FiOS -- had revenues of $41.2 billion last year, down 2.9 percent from the previous year. At Verizon Wireless, a joint venture with Vodafone Group, a British company, revenue was $63.4 billion, a 5.1 percent increase over the previous year.
Verizon reported that its wireline operating income was $606 million for the first six months of this year, compared with $9.0 billion at Verizon Wireless.
Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research company in Atlanta, said Verizon's landline division had no competition until the last decade.
Verizon has lost business to wireless companies, to companies like Vonage and Skype and to cable television companies, many of them nonunion like Comcast and Time Warner, Mr. Kagan said. ''When you have competition with companies that are not unionized, it's a different world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Beijing Bohemian in the East Village

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
The Chinese government did what it set out do with the artist and gadfly Ai Weiwei: silenced him. Or did it? When he was released from detention in June, he was under orders not to discuss the experience, or human rights issues generally, with anyone. Talking about politics nonstop for years via blogs and tweets was what landed him in jail. No one expected to see him back on the Internet anytime soon.
But there he is, as of this week, with a new Google+ account. It comes with a bare-chested photographic self-portrait, a profile describing him as ''a suspected pornography enthusiast and tax evader'' (a reference to the charges leveled at him during his detention) and scanned lists of items removed from his home by the police.
Also on the site is a file of 227 black-and-white photographs that Mr. Ai took when he lived in New York City some 25 years ago. If the new Google account can be taken as evidence that he is still active as artist-provocateur, the photographs document how he became one. 
Online you can view them one by one. But in an exhibition at Asia Society called ''Ai Weiwei: New York Photographs 1983-1993'' you see them panoramically: hung salon style, edge to edge, in large-print format, in a wrap-around installation that puts you in the middle of the social and political action.
Politics was part of his life from the start. His father was a renowned poet who ran afoul of the Maoist government. In 1959, two years after Mr. Ai was born, the family left Beijing for the remote countryside, beginning a forced exile that would last until the end of the Cultural Revolution. In the mid-1970s Mr. Ai moved back to the capital with vague ambitions to be painter. There he became involved with some young avant-garde artists known as the Star Group, who painted in Western styles and railed against the Communist Party.
Inevitably, in 1982, the government cracked down. A year later Mr. Ai left for New York, ostensibly to study art but really to figure out who and what he was supposed to be. He did a desultory stint at Parsons and took odd jobs as a baby sitter, a sidewalk sketcher, an extra in the Metropolitan Opera's ''Turandot.''
Mostly, though, he hung out in the East Village, where his apartment became a crash pad for Chinese friends passing through. The composer Tan Dun stayed there, as did the filmmaker Chen Kaige and the artist Xu Bing (who has an exhibition at the Morgan Library this summer).
The one thing Mr. Ai did consistently, and daily, was to take photographs wherever he went, the way tourists do, as Andy Warhol and Allen Ginsberg (an East Village neighbor) did too. Mr. Ai's were just candid snapshots of this and that; nothing special. But he took thousands of them. The 227 examples in the Asia Society show -- which originated at Three Shadows Photography Art Center in Beijing -- represent a mere fraction of the total.
Still, arranged in chronological sequence, they give a vivid impression of his New York stay. They chart his gradual immersion into the city's life and his awakening to the idea of art as social action.
Among the early pictures are a few sleepy, sullen-looking self-portraits and shots of his bare-bones apartment packed with Chinese friends. We also see him visiting museums. At the Museum of Modern Art he poses with work by two artist-heroes, Warhol and Marcel Duchamp.
And he was making various kinds of art himself: conceptual, ephemeral, trying-out sorts of things. For one piece, photographed in 1983, he bent a metal coat hanger into the shape of Duchamp's profile, laid it down on his apartment floor and filled in its contours with sunflower seeds. In effect, he was creating a sketch, way in advance, for his 2010 Tate Modern installation, which consisted of thousands upon thousands of seeds cast in porcelain.
In the early photographs New York is mostly backdrop to images of young people having fun. But by 1987 the city starts to move into the foreground, with shots of homeless people and abandoned buildings. Mr. Ai had arrived near the peak of the East Village art boom. He stayed on as the economy tanked, and as a poor and working-class neighborhood gentrified. In 1988 warfare broke out.
The main battleground was Tompkins Square Park, where community activists, punk anarchists and the homeless repeatedly clashed with the police over use of the park. When a troop of park employees broke up a squatter encampment one day, the violence intensified. Mr. Ai was there in the middle of it, photographing everything. He sold some of the pictures to newspapers but gave most to the American Civil Liberties Union for use as evidence in their lawsuits against the police.
Just a few months later the pro-democracy movement in China was crushed. After the Tiananmen massacre Mr. Ai went on an eight-day hunger strike in protest. If his identity as an artist-activist didn't exactly originate at this time -- it was already there earlier in China -- it certainly crystallized and gained force. He became fully who and what he was supposed to be.
The final pictures in the show are subdued. By the 1990s his friends are no longer the harum-scarum newcomers of 10 years earlier, bopping around town or camped out on floors. Tompkins Square Park has changed. It's cleaned up and filled with elegant young summer picnickers. The show's final shot, from 1993, is of an all-but-empty apartment. Mr. Ai moved back to China that year to be with his ailing father. The New York sojourn was over.
But not forgotten. He took the essence of it with him. Back in China he found himself cast in the role of adviser and exemplar to a group of radically experimental younger artists who lived in a wasteland area of Beijing that they dubbed East Village.
His own field of activities expanded hugely. But whatever work he did as the years went on -- as an architect, a magazine publisher, an entrepreneur, an artist, a blogger -- was in some way collaborative, interactive, socially directed.
And he never stopped taking photographs. During the past several years he routinely uploaded hundreds a day onto his Web site. Many of the images, like the blog entries and tweets they illustrated, were blatantly, heedlessly critical of China's social realities and of its leaders. Outraged by the political negligence that resulted in the deaths of children in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Mr. Ai photographed shoddily built and flattened school buildings and interviewed distraught parents, posting everything on his Web site, which by then had an international following.
The earthquake was a public relations disaster for the Chinese government, which was doing everything possible to limit coverage in the news media. And here was this artist feeding on-the-ground truths out across the world.
Until that point Mr. Ai had operated within a kind bubble of protection, because of his father's illustrious reputation within China and his own fame as an artist abroad. But with his persistent antigovernment blogging and tweeting, he finally went too far. He was taken into custody in April, held for nearly three months and released only conditionally.
It would not be wrong to call his Internet activity his most important art so far, his magnum opus. And it appears that it will continue in some form, which means that government pressure on him will be unrelenting. So should the vigilance of his supporters. And it is not too much to say -- Mr. Ai has more or less said it -- that the seeds for an art of social change, if not planted in New York, certainly took roots there. You see those roots growing in these coming-of-age photographs.

HEADLINE: Rat Haven on Market May Be Nearing Oblivion at Last

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.; sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
As Twitter, one of the world's leading social media companies, prepares to move into its new headquarters in San Francisco's mid-Market district, it has some unsavory new neighbors: rats.
The company plans to relocate its offices into the historic San Francisco Mart building on Market between 9th and 10th Streets by next June. The highly publicized move has proven to be a magnet for other development to the downtrodden area. 
But at 1411 Market, right next to Twitter's new building, is a crater-sized rat hole that the city's health department has labeled a ''vector'' for vermin. Debris on the site -- crumbling concrete from a razed former structure -- has become an inviting habitat for the rodents.
Neighbors say they have complained about the infestation for years, to no avail. Now some want to enlist Twitter -- or leverage the attention surrounding the company's move -- to finally deal with the rats.
''It's a real problem,'' said Richard Lynch, a resident on nearby Natoma Street whose excitable three-legged Dalmatian Stormy discovered the rodents a couple of years ago. ''Dalmatians are bred to hunt vermin,'' he said.
Mr. Lynch has sent out alarms about the infestation since 2009 in a series of verbose e-mails to a long list of residents and city officials, often accompanied by videos and photos of the rats. (As a former Natoma Street neighbor, I was copied.)
The rats at the site are brazen. When I visited last week, two shoe-sized rats scurried from the crater up to the sidewalk, passing inches from my feet. Others frolicked and roughhoused in the pit. As I videotaped them, and my focus was trained on the camera's viewfinder, one rat quietly made its way up to the curb just two feet away from me. I looked down, we made eye contact and I decided one of us had to flee. (Hint: it was not the rat.)
''We've had several complaints,'' said Richard Lee, the city's director of Environmental Health Regulatory Programs. ''We don't allow conditions where rats are allowed to live.''
The empty lot, surrounded by a chain link fence, is owned by Crescent Heights, a developer based in Miami, which said it acquired the property about five years ago and planned to build a residential tower. The land is valued at nearly $27 million, according to assessor-recorder records.
Mr. Lee said earlier this month, after Mr. Lynch's latest complaint, that his office ordered Crescent Heights to bring in pest control. The debris is allowed to stay since it will be used as fill during construction, which might finally begin this fall.
Explaining why the site has been empty for the past few years, Brian Duchman, a spokesman for Crescent Heights, said a combination of the recession and the city's permit process had slowed plans to develop it.
But ''when we have a complaint we take it seriously,'' Mr. Duchman said. ''We have done everything we've been told to do.''
Indeed, in recent days, for the first time in years, there is activity at the crater: a backhoe has arrived, as well as what appears to be rat bait.
Jim Meko, chairman of the SoMa Leadership Council, a neighborhood group, said the city should not have allowed the lot to sit vacant for so long, leading to what he called blight.
''Eventually the whole neighborhood becomes demoralized by it,'' Mr. Meko said.
He would like the city to force owners to create temporary uses for empty lots to prevent problems like vermin.
Mr. Lynch would go even further -- he wants the city to revoke Crescent Heights's building permits and turn the land into a neighborhood park.
To gather support for this idea, Mr. Lynch recently started a Twitter group, @MidMarketGreen, which immediately tried to enlist the help of Dick Costolo, Twitter's chief executive.
''I'm hoping there's a lot of activity in the area resulting from the renovation of that historic building,'' Mr. Costolo tweeted back to a group member on July 17, referring to his company's plans, though not endorsing the park idea.
Sean Garrett, a spokesman for Twitter, would not address the rat issue specifically, but said in an e-mail that the company was ''very aware of the perennial issues'' in the area and planned ''to collaborate on improving the neighborhood for both new entrants and longtime residents.''
So, one way or another, it seems the rat hole is doomed. No one apparently wants to see #TwitterRats as the day's trending tweet topic.

HEADLINE: In Shortage, Japanese Willingly Ration the Watts

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- With Japan suffering from electricity shortages this summer, Michio Kuniyuki has stepped up his conservation patrols of Rikkyo University.
As he has done these past six summers, Mr. Kuniyuki spends his days making sure the lights and air-conditioning have not been left on in empty classrooms. Whenever he finds students in a classroom, he turns off the air-conditioning and inquires about the lights.
''Should I leave them on or can I turn them off?'' Mr. Kuniyuki asked one day.
''Uh,'' one young man hesitated, giving Mr. Kuniyuki the opening for his next move. 
Click. Off.
Now backed by a colleague newly assigned to the patrols, Mr. Kuniyuki has been able to strategically map out their routes throughout the campus and outwit students who used to switch the lights back on as soon as they saw his back. ''It's doubly effective,'' he said.
Already a leader in conservation, Japan consumes about half as much energy per capita as the United States, according to the United Nations Population Fund. But it has been pushed to even greater lengths since the nuclear disaster even as it tries to revive its economy. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and the resulting backlash against nuclear power have left only 17 out of Japan's 54 reactors online as the nation steels itself for August, the hottest month of the year.
Preliminary figures indicate that regions under conservation mandates have been able to meet reduction targets and even exceed them, providing a possible model of conservation's potential when concerns about global warming are mounting. In the Tokyo area, the government is pushing to cut electricity use by 15 percent between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays to prevent blackouts -- and on Thursday, for example, that target was met compared with last year.
Japanese are bringing to the conservation drive a characteristic combination of national fervor, endurance, sloganeering, technology and social coercion.
A ''Super Cool Biz'' campaign, which builds on the option of no-tie summer business attire begun in 2005, now encourages salarymen to dress down even further by wearing polo shirts or the traditional aloha-style shirts worn on the Japanese tropical islands of Okinawa.
To back up the call to conserve, electricity reports that forecast the day's power supply and track demand in real time have become as much a part of this summer as the scorching sun and humid air. They are delivered along with the weather on the morning news and announced along with the next stop aboard some trains.
Government alerts are also sent to subscribers' cellphones if overall demand nears capacity, prodding households to turn down the air-conditioner or, better yet, turn it off altogether.
The forecasts, available since the start of the month on the Web sites of power companies and in the news media, show the amount of electricity currently being used in a utility's service area, as well as the consumption for the same day last year.
In the Tokyo area, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, the operator of the Fukushima plant, issues a forecast in the evening for the next day, then refines the forecast the following morning depending on the changing weather. During the day, Tepco updates electricity use every five minutes, in a bar graph that predictably shows use rising steadily in the morning and peaking in the afternoon.
In the past week, forecasts and actual use have hovered around 75 percent of capacity, thanks to unseasonably cool weather brought on by a typhoon. Yukihiko Tayama, a Tepco manager specializing in demand and supply, said that so far this summer, overall demand had yet to come dangerously close to capacity, and so it was unclear whether the real-time reports would influence people's behavior in a crunch. The real test lies ahead in August, Mr. Tayama said.
Local governments are holding contests soliciting conservation ideas; households are cutting back beyond the hours during which conservation is in effect, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and companies have shifted days off to weekdays and undertaken other measures not only to avoid penalties -- maximum penalties are less than $13,000 -- but also to contribute to the national effort.
At Meiwa Rubber, a manufacturer of printing equipment with factories in Tokyo, lights were dimmed, the use of hot water was restricted, and the air-conditioning was curtailed. An employee tracked the factory's real-time power use, using software supplied by Tepco. If demand neared the company's maximum use for the year before, orange lights flashed on the factory and management floors; if demand threatened to outstrip maximum use, red lights flashed, leading employees to shut down three air-conditioning units.
''The government's figure is 15 percent, but we're aiming to cut by 25 percent,'' said Tatsuo Nakahara, 63, the company's administrative manager. He added that in the months after the March disaster, the company had already succeeded in conserving 20 percent.
Offices here, already balmy by American standards, have been directed to set the room temperature to 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit, though the real temperature, especially on hot days, has climbed above 86 degrees in many offices.
''We're doing this for Japan, so it can't be helped,'' said Jun Nakada, 36, a salaryman whose office lighting has been dimmed to two fluorescent tubes from eight.
Not cooperating is frowned upon. Some companies have forbidden employees to plug in desktop fans; in others with no such bans, doing so can be considered harmful to one's career.
Weekly magazines are making sure there are no cheaters. Several have sent reporters armed with thermometers to the offices of those popularly considered responsible for the nuclear disaster, particularly the triumvirate of Tepco, nuclear regulators and pro-nuclear politicians, widely seen as collusive. The nuclear establishment was also enduring a sweaty summer, the weeklies reported with great satisfaction.
But perhaps the checks were hardly necessary given the power of social disapproval here.
Mitsuharu Taniyama, 73, the owner of a small insurance business, has directed his staff to dim the lights at their office on the second floor of a small building in Yokohama.
''As you can see, our office is surrounded by windows, so after dark people walking outside would notice if it was all lit up inside here,'' Mr. Taniyama said. ''Now I would feel guilty.''
Like some Japanese of his generation, Mr. Taniyama said the current national campaign reminded him of restrictions on the use of lights during World War II. To avoid becoming the targets of nighttime air raids by American warplanes, families huddled around a single light bulb while making sure that no light was visible from the outside.
Behind the current enthusiasm for conservation, Mr. Taniyama also saw a rethinking of postwar Japan's single-minded focus on economic growth. Many, he believed, were ready to renounce nuclear power even if that meant ''time travel to the lifestyle that Japan had when it lost the war to America.''
Conservation has made Tokyo, a city famous for its neon lights and giant television screens, a little dimmer this summer. It has caused the Japanese to forgo, for now, the energy-hungry gadgets and appliances that provide life here with particular pleasures.
Sakuko Saeki, 75, said she had not only switched off but also unplugged her household appliances. She barely turned on the air-conditioning, instead using a fan in her living room. But there was one appliance she could not give up after all: an automatic toilet, called a washlet, the kind that flushes by itself, raises and lowers the lid on its own, and never ceases to amaze foreigners visiting Japan for the first time.
''I'd turned off my washlet,'' Ms. Saeki said, ''but I stopped doing that.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Claims Fall Under Key Level

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- First-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, dropping below the important 400,000 level for the first time since April, according to a government report on Thursday. 
At the same time, a private trade group said sales of existing homes rose unexpectedly in June, and both statistics gave investors a reason for optimism.
Jobless claims dropped 24,000, to a seasonally adjusted 398,000, the Labor Department said.
The drop below the 400,000 level that is normally associated with stable job growth will be welcome news for the economy after a recent string of weak data. Employment growth stumbled badly in May and June, with the increase in nonfarm payrolls totaling only 43,000.
Economists had forecast that claims would fall to 415,000. The previous week's figure was revised to 422,000 from 418,000.
The government was expected to report on Friday that the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to a Reuters survey, after a 1.9 percent pace in the first three months of the year.
Pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly rose in June from May and rose sharply from a year ago, data from a real estate trade group showed.
The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in June, was up 2.4 percent to 90.9 from 88.8 in May. The index was up 19.8 percent from a year ago.
Economists polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting pending home sales to fall 2.0 percent.
The association's senior economist, Lawrence Yun, said despite the uptick, the latest monthly reading showed that tight credit and economic uncertainty were still constricting the market.
''The best way to ensure a more solid recovery in housing is to simply return to normal, sound credit standards so more creditworthy home buyers can get a mortgage,'' he said.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell 8,500, to 413,750.
A total of 7.65 million people were claiming unemployment benefits in the week ended July 9 under all programs, up 320,152 from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Profit Down, Credit Suisse Will Trim 2,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
5:13 p.m. Updated
Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it planned to cut about 2,000 jobs after a ''disappointing'' second quarter that included a big drop in earnings in investment banking.
Net income fell to 768 million Swiss francs ($958 million) in the three months ended June 30, from 1.6 billion francs in the period a year earlier, the bank said. The earnings missed analysts' consensus forecast of 1 billion francs, according to Reuters.
The bank's shares fell 46 centimes, or 2 percent, to 28.80 francs ($35.92) in Zurich on Thursday. Its American depository receipts dropped 39 cents, or 1 percent, to $35.39. 
Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, called the bank's results a ''disappointing performance'' and said that earnings at the investment banking unit were ''below our expectations.'' Pretax profit at its investment banking unit fell 71 percent in the period as concern about European sovereign debt prompted a drop in bond trading.
''These were very poor results, although away from the very poor performance in trading they did hold up quite well in a difficult quarter,'' said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca in London. ''However, the management changes and the cost-cutting program demonstrate management's concern about the business.''
Credit Suisse, the second-largest bank in Switzerland after UBS, said it planned to cut 4 percent of the total work force of 50,700 by the end of 2012 to reduce costs by 1 billion francs. Credit Suisse had added 1,500 jobs over the last 12 months.
Return on equity, a measure of profitability, fell to 9.7 percent in the second quarter from 17.8 percent in the period a year earlier.
''In order to ensure attractive returns in the face of an uncertain and challenging economic and market environment, we continue to be proactive about seeking cost efficiencies across the bank,'' Mr. Dougan said.
The earnings come two days after UBS warned that it would miss its profit target for 2014, after earnings fell by half in the second quarter because of a similar drop in investment banking income.
Trading operations at the investment banks were hit hardest amid concerns that Greece's sovereign debt crisis could spread to more European economies. Credit Suisse also cited ''deteriorating economic indicators, particularly in the U.S.''
Earnings at Swiss banks were additionally burdened because the Swiss franc appreciated against major currencies as a result of debt troubles in Europe and the United States.
Pretax profit at Credit Suisse's investment banking operation fell to 231 million francs in the second quarter from 784 million francs in the period a year earlier. Revenue at the unit dropped to 2.8 billion francs from 4.1 billion francs.
To help add private banking clients, Credit Suisse said on Thursday that Walter Berchtold would become chairman of private banking and Hans-Ulrich Meister was to become chief executive of the business in addition to his role as head of the bank's Swiss operations. The changes will be effective at the beginning of August.
The bank's private banking business attracted 11.5 billion francs in net new assets in the quarter while its asset management arm had 4 billion francs in new money. Still, assets under management at its private bank fell 0.7 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Buoy Profits as Oil Companies Scramble for New Fields

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Julie Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported large increases in second-quarter profits on Thursday, benefiting from oil and gasoline prices that have been propelled upward by political turbulence in the Middle East and North Africa.
It was the strongest quarter for Exxon since it set a corporate quarterly earnings record in 2008, when crude oil prices approached $150 a barrel before collapsing as the world economy slowed. 
Exxon, the biggest American oil company, reported earnings of $10.7 billion for the quarter, up from $7.56 billion the year before, but a bit less than Wall Street had been expecting. Shell, the largest European oil company, posted profits of $8.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago.
The results of Exxon and Shell, as well as ConocoPhillips and BP earlier in the week, highlighted the oil majors' dependence on high oil prices for profit growth at a time when they are straining to pick up new reserves to increase or even sustain future production.
Major oil companies are finding it difficult to acquire new reserves because countries rich in oil and gas have become increasingly grudging in their dealings with foreign companies, striking production-sharing agreements that offer them a smaller share of the profits. That is prompting oil companies to drill deeper below the ocean's surface and explore in the Arctic for oil -- expensive propositions that put pressure on profits -- or drill for less profitable gas.
''We are going into a world where finding the oil and gas is going to be more complex,'' Shell's chief executive, Peter R. Voser, acknowledged as his company released its results. ''It needs more money.''
Smaller oil and gas companies like EOG Resources and Cabot Oil and Gas have proved to be more nimble than the giants in recent years, moving into shale oil and gas fields in the United States and booking new reserves at a far faster rate. The major companies have tried to follow suit over the last two years, but a glut of natural gas from rising production has weakened the profitability of some fields.
Growth in oil company profits for the rest of the year is uncertain, given that oil and gas prices are strongly tied to the health of the global economy. Demand in the United States for diesel, gasoline and other petroleum products has eased in recent months after starting the year strongly, and the growth in Chinese oil demand has slowed somewhat.
''If the economy does not grow faster, earnings growth in the energy sector is obviously going to be limited,'' said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''You can't grow energy demand in a flat economy.''
The Energy Department reported on Thursday that United States oil demand in May fell by nearly 2.5 percent from the same month the year before, representing a decline of 464,000 barrels a day. The department also reported that oil inventories last week were up by 2.3 million barrels from the week before, suggesting a less-than-robust summer driving season.
Oil prices have eased more than 10 percent since the spring, when crude prices peaked because of the loss of 1.3 million barrels of oil a day of production caused by the turmoil in Libya and fears that instability could spread to major producers like Saudi Arabia and Algeria. Since then, increased production in Saudi Arabia and the release of oil from strategic reserves in the United States and other industrialized countries have helped prevent shortages.
Even if oil demand and prices increase, large oil companies will strain to keep up production.
ConocoPhillips reported a 90,000-barrel-a-day decline in oil and gas production for the quarter on Wednesday, though earnings were higher anyway as a result of higher oil prices. Shell also reported a decline of 100,000 barrels of daily oil and gas production for the quarter, in part because of permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP accident last year.
Exxon's earnings were lower than analysts had expected despite strong revenue growth, reflecting a record $10.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in new oil and gas projects, up 58 percent from the second quarter of 2010.
Exxon's purchase of XTO Energy last year to become the nation's biggest natural gas producer has been questioned by some investors in light of low gas prices, but the acquisition helped Exxon's oil and gas production to increase by 10 percent from a year ago.
Exxon is continuing to invest heavily in natural gas, purchasing 317,000 acres for $1.7 billion in Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale field in June. It is also drilling deep in the Gulf of Mexico, and last month announced the discovery of a new deepwater field holding the equivalent of 700 million barrels of oil.
Edward Westlake, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Exxon profits were hurt by the shutdown in production in several oil fields and refineries around the world for maintenance reasons. He said he was optimistic about the company's prospects because of an increase of annual capital expenditures from $21 billion in 2007 to around $35 billion currently, along with its aggressive acquisition of oil and gas acreage.
''One day this will pay off,'' Mr. Westlake added.
While Exxon has tried to buy reserves, Shell has invested heavily over the last decade in complex projects, particularly in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. Its $20 billion Pearl project, which will produce liquid fuels out of natural gas on an enormous scale, has been going through final tests this year and should begin to produce profits in coming months.
For Shell, ''earnings and cash flow should greatly improve over the next few years,'' said Brian M. Youngberg, an oil analyst at Edward Jones.

HEADLINE: In Norway, Consensus Cuts 2 Ways

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
OSLO -- Nearly all Norwegians of a certain age know where they were when Oddvar Bra suddenly broke his ski pole in the final sprint of a championship ski race in 1982, and Norway had to settle for a tie with the Soviet Union. But the common expression, ''Where were you when Bra broke his pole?'' has suddenly given way to a darker question -- where were you when Anders Behring Breivik was killing Norway's children?
July 22, the day Mr. Breivik killed at least 76 people, shook a peaceful nation to the core. But for many Norwegians it is also an indelible mark of a country that has evolved away from the monoethnic, egalitarian culture that knew tragedy as a setback in Nordic competition.
Today, more than 11 percent of the population of some 4.9 million were born someplace else -- Pakistan, Sweden, Poland, Somalia, Eritrea, Iraq. And the cultural shock of diversity, especially incorporating the growing number of nonwhite Muslims, has already meant the rise of a moderate anti-immigrant party, the Progress Party, to become the second-largest in Norway. 
The young people Mr. Breivik shot at a summer camp on the island of Utoya were all Norwegians, but some were the children of immigrants, who have now been memorialized in the country's greatest modern disaster.
''When you are confronted with multicultural immigration, something happens,'' said Grete Brochmann, a sociologist at the University of Oslo. ''That's the core of the matter right now, and it's a great challenge to the Norwegian model.''
Norway's leaders, from the royal family on down, have all praised the country's solidarity, democracy, equality and tolerance, and all vow that these values will not change. Virtuous, peaceful, generous, consensual -- this is the Norwegian self-image, aided by the oil wealth that props up one of the most comprehensive social welfare systems in the world.
Einar Forde, a former Labor Party politician, once said: ''We are all social democrats.'' And a former prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was a target of Mr. Breivik's terror, once remarked: ''It is typically Norwegian to be good.''
For all its virtues, the emphasis on consensus here can also promote small-mindedness, smugness and political correctness. That is especially true when newcomers have different notions on certain values, including gender equality and secularism, even in an officially Christian country, that Norwegians hold dear.
''We're a lucky society for many reasons, and not just oil,'' said Ms. Brochmann, citing Norway's distance from both the euro and the American financial crisis and its strong and transparent democracy.
''But many of these aspects of this consensus society have another side,'' she said. ''This is also a society of conformism,'' she said, citing the ''Janteloven,'' or Jante law, based on small-town Scandinavian norms that govern group behavior, promoting collectivism and discouraging individual initiative and ambition in a world where no one is anonymous.
Norway is also a strongly patriotic country, independent from Sweden only since 1905, and occupied by the Nazis from 1940 to 1945. So the sense of pride and nationalism here is fierce, and the model built since World War II is strongly defended.
In an interview, Dr. Brundtland noted that Norway had a strongly consensual, cross-party program for almost a decade after World War II before returning to more normal politics. Even then, she said, Norway has ''a tradition of trying to formulate and coordinate policies that are broader than what the political system itself would have. We try to have a base that's broader than the majority.''
Still, she insisted, ''it's not true to say that we have a consensus democracy where we don't have strong debates and political parties.''
Those debates have also become fiercer on the issue of immigration and integration, Dr. Brundtland conceded, especially with the growing popularity of the Progress Party, a now mainstream group that focuses on an anti-immigration stance. The Progress Party, she said with some distaste, has been pushing acceptable boundaries. ''To ask the questions without having any productive answers is not always helpful,'' Dr. Brundtland said.
The leader of the Progress Party, Siv Jensen, earned some notoriety in 2009 for using the phrase ''stealth Islamization'' in a speech, the same year the party became the second-largest in Parliament. Christian Tybring-Gjedde, the head of the party's Oslo branch, prompted howls of criticism in May when he suggested Muslims were by nature more aggressive than Norwegians.
Even so, such statements are no more provocative than those by right-leaning politicians in other Western European countries, and the party's stance has resonated with many. Morten Hoglund, a Progress legislator, said the party in recent years has been purging radicals and emphasizing better health care, though he conceded that Mr. Breivik might hurt the party in September's local elections.
''We have tried as best we can to make sure that we behave in a proper way,'' he said. ''We are not in the same political family you see with some of the political parties in Europe today.''
But others believe that Progress has helped create the atmosphere in which Mr. Breivik flourished, even if he quit the party because of what he perceived as its moderation.
''There is one political party in this country that has worked with the line of reasoning that the terrorist used to legitimize his atrocities,'' said Magnus Marsdal, an author and political analyst. ''Of course the Progress Party is not accountable for this guy's actions, but the sentiments that are spread through political propaganda are not innocent.''
The party plays on the immigrant challenge to religious and cultural uniformity. Some Muslim immigrants, not well-educated, restrict the activities of women, try to arrange marriages, may support genital mutilation and have a degree of homophobia, all of which are cited as adherence to religious or cultural values.
But these values present a direct challenge to the general consensus culture. It is in this area that Islamophobia has reached Norway, together with a more universal resentment of immigrant criminals and ''welfare scroungers'' of every religion and color.
Thomas Hylland Eriksen, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Oslo, has written extensively on the challenge of immigration to the overriding culture, which features a quiet nationalism. ''But there are some unexamined ugly features of Norwegian nationalism that have to do with ethnic nationalism, a feeling of specialness, an element of racism,'' Mr. Eriksen said. ''Non-ethnic Norwegians are visible and still seen as out of place.''
Minorities think that ''if they learn Norwegian, send their kids to school and stop at traffic lights they are 100 percent Norwegian,'' he said. But it's not really true, he said. He cited a prominent Norwegian, Dilek Ayhan, born here of Turkish parents, perfectly fluent, but who is often asked: ''Where are you really from?''
There is ''a prison of consensus,'' Mr. Eriksen said, but it should not be exaggerated and is slowly cracking under the pressure of change. ''There is a fairly open debate, but we should be more open and frank about our values,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Retreats for a Fifth Day as Debt Stances Feed Anxiety

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly lower on Thursday, failing to hold on to early gains as investors maneuvered into position ahead of an expected vote on a Republican proposal for the debt ceiling.
It was a disappointing, but perhaps not surprising, turnaround to the day's trading, in which the three main stock indexes posted slight gains most of the day before losing steam.
Stocks in the Dow retreated for a fifth consecutive trading day. The Dow closed down 62.44 points, or 0.51 percent, at 12,240.11. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.22 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,300.67. But the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.46 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,766.25. 
The declines on Thursday were not as steep as in previous days.
''The anxiety level is clearly rising, but I think there is a reluctance in the markets for investors to sell into that anxiety,'' said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial.
But he added: ''The closer we get to that 11th hour, the more questionable that becomes.''
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.96 percent, compared with 2.98 percent late Wednesday.
The Dow has declined more than 3 percent since last Thursday as Congress has failed to agree on plans to cut the government deficit and raise the debt ceiling; it is down about 1 percent for the month.
Other factors have compounded the markets' unease. In Europe, despite a recent deal to address fiscal problems in Greece, fresh nervousness bubbled up over other euro zone countries.
Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said investors saw a disappointing auction of Italy's 10-year bonds.
''Investors appear to have, temporarily at least, shifted their gaze away from the backs-and-forths in the debt ceiling debate and towards the economic challenges in the euro zone,'' Mr. Giddis said in a research note.
In the United States, investors had plenty of fresh economic and corporate information to pick through for clues to a recovery.
On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for jobless benefits last week dipped below the 400,000 level, a threshold some economists say indicates an improving jobs market. Total initial jobless claims fell to 398,000, below analysts' forecasts of 415,000, in the week ended July 23, which Goldman Sachs economists called a ''tentative positive.''
Such data is subject to seasonal adjustments and revisions, but the four-week moving average, considered a more reliable indicator, also declined.
''Unfortunately, we will need to see next week's claims figures to get more clarity on the true cause,'' Goldman Sachs said in a research note.
Pending home sales rose 2.4 percent in June, which could lead to a gain in completed sales in the coming months, another survey showed.
The debt-ceiling stalemate is affecting at least some economic activity, with some businesses delaying decisions, according to analysts and a recent Federal Reserve report. Estimates for growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter are scheduled to be released on Friday. Analysts predicted that G.D.P. growth would be slightly less than the first quarter's 1.9 percent annualized rate.
Shares of the LSI Corporation rose more than 14 percent to close at $7.35. LSI reported earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations for revenue, up 6 percent to $501 million, and the company forecast a strong outlook.
Exxon Mobil reported strong second-quarter earnings, but they were a bit lower than forecast. Its stock lost more than 2 percent to close at $81.46.

HEADLINE: Schools Turn To Fees After Drop In State Aid

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
As strapped public schools try to squeeze every possible dollar out of their budgets, an unpleasant reality awaits parents: They will most likely have to pay for programs and services that schools once provided free. 
Consider the Keller Independent School District just north of Fort Worth, where students who ride the bus will now pay $185 each per semester. Rather than scrap busing altogether after voters rejected a property tax increase in June to make up for lost state revenue, the district opted to institute fares.
The $4 billion cut in education financing at the state level for 2012-13 means these extra charges will become increasingly common.
''We're going to see districts charging fees for things that they have always been able to but just haven't chosen to in the past,'' said David Thompson, a former general counsel for the Texas Education Agency who now represents school districts.
Across the country, such fees also threaten to draw lawsuits -- affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union in California filed in September against what it called the state's ''pay to learn'' public schools -- about what it means to provide a ''free'' public education under state constitutions.
Texas law gives districts broad authority in deciding what fees to charge students. There is one firm boundary: If it is an expense related to an activity or item required for a course grade, like textbooks, districts cannot charge for it. Basics like pens, erasers and notebooks do not count, and any charges related to activities or services where participation is voluntary -- extracurricular activities, class trips and, yes, transportation -- are fair game. The district must also have a process to waive or reduce fees for students who cannot afford them. Keller I.S.D., for example, will charge $100 each for students who qualify for free and reduced-cost lunches.
Michael Griffith, a school finance expert with the Education Commission on the States, said that while fees for extracurricular activities had been on the rise even before the current economic downturn, more schools were now exploring ways to pass on basic costs to parents.
''We see a lot of evidence now that there are districts and schools pushing the line,'' Mr. Griffith said.
That can often happen in letters home, he said, with teachers implying that certain supplies are required and that students cannot show up without them.
Charging fees can hurt poor students, especially those whose families just miss qualifying for a waiver, said Caroline Holcombe, a research analyst at Children at Risk, an advocacy group based in Houston.
''It's likely money families just don't have,'' Ms. Holcombe said. ''And if they are choosing between the next meal they are going to put on the table, whether they are going to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, and whether they are going to allow their kids to spend time after school at an activity, that's a tough decision.''

HEADLINE: Sony Cuts Its Forecast For the Year After a Loss

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Sony slashed its annual profit forecast after sinking to a quarterly loss of 15.5 billion yen, or $199 million, on Thursday, as the lingering effects of the Japanese earthquake, a punishingly strong yen and lackluster TV sales affected its bottom line.
The electronics and entertainment company, which is based here, said in a statement that it now expected net income of 60 billion yen ($770 million) for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 2012, revising an 80 billion yen ($1 billion) projection it made just two months ago. 
Sony also cut projected sales for the year to 7.2 trillion yen ($92.4 billion) from a previous forecast of 7.5 trillion yen ($96.3 billion).
The company said that its net loss for the April through June period, the first quarter of its fiscal year, compared with a profit of 25.7 billion yen ($330 million) for the same quarter a year earlier. The slide was significantly higher than the loss of 2.5 billion yen ($32 million) estimated in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts.
Sony said that the quake and tsunami damage to factories in northeastern Japan came to about 5.3 billion yen ($68 million) for the quarter, though some of that cost would be offset by insurance. It also said the recovery from the March 11 quake was progressing ''faster than anticipated.''
Meanwhile, Sony has been battling weak demand for its high-end Bravia TVs amid growing global economic woes and heightened price competition.
Though Sony had brisk sales in Japan before the country's switch this month from analog to digital broadcasting, sales in the United States and Europe were sluggish, the company said.
Slower personal computer and video camera sales helped to bring sales of Sony's consumer products division to 732.3 billion yen ($9.4 billion), down 17.9 percent from the same period the previous year.
A strong yen -- about 13 percent stronger against the dollar in the latest quarter, compared with the previous year -- further hurt Sony's profit. A strong Japanese currency makes Sony products more expensive, and therefore less competitive, overseas. It also erodes the company's overseas earnings when they are repatriated.
Sony also suffered a series of hacker attacks on its Web sites and online services, including its popular PlayStation Network, which the company was forced to shut down in April. The network was fully restored this month, but not without damaging the reputation of Sony's online business.
The company said that user logins to the PlayStation Network in North America had returned ''to a similar level as before the cyberattacks.''
Sony Ericsson, Sony's long-suffering mobile phone joint venture with the Swedish telecommunications giant, posted a dismal quarter, with sales down 32.1 percent from the comparable period last year. Sony said the poor performance resulted from a lack of critical components in the wake of the earthquake and from a decline in shipments of cellphones as consumers shifted to more advanced smartphones.
Sony's movie division was a bright spot, with sales up 9.3 percent in the quarter from the previous year to 144.4 billion yen ($1.86 billion) on home entertainment releases of titles like ''The Green Hornet.''
Sales at Sony's music division fell 0.6 percent to 109.6 billion yen ($1.4 billion), however, despite a new release from Beyonce and albums tied to the hit TV show ''Glee.''
Still, Sony has two products in its pipeline that it hopes will lift sales. The company has said it will soon sell its first tablet computer, joining a flurry of companies trying to recreate the success of Apple's iPad. Sony is also set to introduce its next-generation portable video game player, the PlayStation Vita, later this year.
Shares in Sony on the New York Stock Exchange fell 52 cents, or 2 percent, to $25.08 on Thursday.
In Japan, Sony shares have fallen 30 percent this year, far underperforming Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average, which has slipped just over 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Short-Term Credit Markets Begin Feeling the Effects of Washington's Debt Ceiling Debate

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
The reverberations of Washington's impasse over a debt deal are already being felt in the short-term credit markets, a key artery of the economy that daily supplies trillions of dollars of credit.
Over the last week, big banks and companies have withdrawn $37.5 billion from money market funds that invest in Treasury debt and other ultra-safe securities, the biggest weekly drop this year. Meanwhile, in the vast market for repurchase agreements, in which many financial firms make short-term loans to one another, borrowers are beginning to demand higher yields.
These moves underscore how companies and big financial institutions are beginning to rethink their traditional view that notes issued by the United States Treasury are indistinguishable from cash, even though many experts say they think it is unlikely that the government would miss payments on its obligations. 
The $37.5 billion drop, reported Thursday in a weekly survey by the Investment Company Institute, echoed what other analysts were seeing.
In the first three days of this week, investors pulled $17 billion from funds that invested only in government securities, a reversal of the daily inflows of $280 million for much of July, said Peter Crane, the president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual funds.
''It's big, no doubt about it,'' he said. ''Seventeen billion isn't a run, but it's definitely indicative that investors are shifting their assets. If this were to continue for another week or two, it would be very disturbing.''
Though lawmakers have been clashing all week on proposals to cut the deficit and raise the debt limit ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline set by the Treasury Department, bond markets have largely shrugged off the risk of a default or a downgrade of the Washington's AAA credit rating.
Interest rates on longer-term Treasuries have held steady, but the yield on notes coming due next week, after the deadline, has moved sharply higher in recent days. The yield on Treasury bills coming due Aug. 4 jumped five basis points to 15 basis points, a significant move for a security that carried a yield close to zero earlier this month, said Jim Caron, head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley.
''It's a tell-tale sign of something that could reverberate if it spreads to other markets, and all the uncertainty with the debt ceiling is the functional equivalent of a tightening,'' Mr. Caron said. ''I don't think there is a default risk at all but the market is saying it's not going to take any chances.''
While money market fund managers say they are not seeing a sizable wave of redemptions yet, they are setting aside more cash, leaving it at custodial bank accounts in case investors demand their money back. At Fidelity, the Boston-based firm that has $442 billion in money market assets, managers are avoiding Treasury bills that come due on Aug. 4 and Aug. 11, however unlikely a technical default may be.
''We are positioning our portfolio to respond to a downgrade or a default and we are positioning the fund to respond to redemptions,'' said Robert Brown, president of money markets at Fidelity. Mr. Brown would not say how much cash was being kept at hand, but said ''it's a higher balance than one would expect to see.''
In the commercial paper market, where companies raise funds for their short-term borrowing needs, buyers are also seeking shorter-term paper.
In the last week, investors have shown signs of wanting quick access to their money, with financial borrowers raising on Wednesday only $1 million in notes that come due in 81 days or more, according to the Federal Reserve. That is down from $479 million on July 22.
At the same time, the amount of commercial paper issued with a duration of just one to four days rose to $920 million, from $771 million.
''Investors are scrambling to bolster their liquidity profile,'' said Chris Conetta, head of global commercial paper trading at Barclays Capital. ''They understand that a default or downgrade could be a big, systemic event.''
In the repurchase market, known as the repo market, borrowers take loans and in exchange hand over a little more than the equivalent loan amount in securities. Because of their risk-free status, Treasuries are highly favored as collateral, estimated to account for about $4 trillion in the repo markets.
The fear is that if the United States credit rating drops, the value of those treasuries could respond in kind. Borrowers would then have to post more collateral to obtain their loans, effectively raising the cost of borrowing. That could ripple into the broader market, raising interest rates on all types of loans, analysts warn.
''The repo market is a pressure point because it can have an impact on overall credit availability, which bleeds through to mortgage rates,'' said Robert Toomey, managing director at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. ''Treasuries become a little less attractive if they are more expensive to finance.''
The overnight repo rate, which started the week at about three basis points, was about 17 basis points Thursday evening, according to Credit Suisse. That means that to finance $100 million overnight in the repo market it would now cost about $472 per day, up from about $83 on Monday.
''It's a bigger deal than a lot of people recognize,'' said Howard Simons, a strategist at Bianco Research, a bond market specialist. ''If you downgrade the securities you have to put more up for collateral and that affects pretty much everybody out there who has held these in reserve. I don't care if you're a bank, insurance company, exchange or clearinghouse.''
To be sure, most observers say the ripples in the repo market will not be anything like those felt in the fall of 2008, when creditors lost faith in the ability of banks to pay back their short-term loans. That caused a problem for companies like General Electric, which struggled to finance its daily operations as a result. Back then, the sharp drop-off in repo lending helped bring the financial system to its knees.
''I think people are looking at the U.S. as the cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry pile,'' said Jason New, a senior managing director at GSO Capital Partners.
''To me, the downgrade is not dropping a boulder in a still lake. This is dropping a pebble, but nevertheless there are still ripples.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Stronghold Of Liberals, A Call to Levy More Taxes

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BROOKLINE, Mass. -- Arthur May, a laid-off computer programmer in this proudly liberal suburb of Boston, has been watching the showdown over the federal debt ceiling with growing revulsion -- aimed mostly at Republicans.
''I'm totally upset,'' said Mr. May, 51, sitting on a bench in Coolidge Corner, a bustling retail district here, on Wednesday evening. ''Both sides need to compromise, but the Democrats have already given a lot. Republicans are brutally tough.'' 
Brookline, part of the Fourth Congressional District, is represented by Barney Frank, a 16-term liberal firebrand who has described Republicans unwilling to raise the debt limit as ''invincibly ignorant.'' Nearly half of the town's roughly 41,000 voters are registered Democrats and about 8 percent are Republicans. Eighty percent voted for Barack Obama in 2008, though several of his supporters said Wednesday that they were deeply worried about his re-election prospects.
In Coolidge Corner, a neighborhood often frequented by Greenpeace volunteers, many of Mr. Frank's constituents voiced similar disdain for the Republicans as they shopped, strolled and lined up for movies on a sticky summer night. In particular, many scorned Republican resistance to tax increases as a means of paying off debt.
''My biggest feeling is that corporations and the very rich should be willing to be taxed more to help us out of this,'' said Sarah Leinbach, 73, a retired teacher who had just returned from a vacation on Cape Cod. ''I'm always angry at the greed of certain people who don't seem to care about the common good.''
Dorothy Boime, a 71-year-old acupuncturist, said Republicans shared blame for the deficit. ''They ran it up pretty well during the Iraq war and then cut the taxes,'' she said, ''which seems pretty unbelievable. I say, leave Medicare and Medicaid alone and spend less money on wars and military outposts for our empire and tax the wealthy more.''
Outside the Coolidge Corner Theater, Noam Shabani, 25, who grew up in neighboring Newton, agreed that raising taxes on the rich would be a reasonable way to help pay the nation's bills.
''I talk to a lot of people who tell me that they wouldn't mind if they got taxed more,'' said Mr. Shabani, who works at a local hospital. ''I grew up in a wonderful area with a lot of spending on education. I'm a firm believer that an investment in children and schools produces educated people and people who could do a lot of good things in the future.''
That said, Mr. Shabani acknowledged that he might be wrong. If the nation's debt rating were downgraded, he said, then perhaps it would be a necessary wakeup call.
''I'm not an economist,'' he said. ''I don't know. But if the credit rating that states get doesn't reflect accurately what we're about, then there's something to that. You don't want to be in denial.''
While there seemed to be no shortage of contempt for Republicans here, many of those interviewed said Democrats deserved some blame for the down-to-the-wire showdown, too.
''They're acting like 6-year-olds pretty much on both sides,'' said Carolyn Waite, an academic librarian from Dedham, another town in the Fourth District, who said she always voted Democrat.
Her solution to the crisis?
''We have to raise taxes,'' she said. ''I'm sorry. You can't solve this without doing both things: trying to eliminate costs and also raising taxes.''
Ms. Waite, 63, grew teary as she described how her sister had lost her job and her home during the economic downturn and moved in with her. Lately, the debt limit fight has made her so angry that she has stopped watching the news, she said.
''They don't care about what's happening out here to us,'' she said, referring to Republicans in Congress. ''The middle class, which would include me and my family and my friends, and not to mention the lower classes, are going to get'' hurt.
Howard Reef, a developer from Natick who described himself as a moderate Republican, said he was furious at both political parties for not solving the debt limit problem sooner. Mr. Reef called the nation's appetite for spending ''absurd,'' but he, like Democrats interviewed, said tax increases should be part of the solution.
''Everyone has to make a contribution,'' he said. ''We can't eliminate and hurt a lot of the poor and middle-class people without the wealthier people somehow assisting in an ultimate resolution.''

HEADLINE: Carmakers Back Strict New Rules For Gas Mileage

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Four years ago, the American auto industry was so opposed to higher fuel economy standards that executives of Detroit camped out in Washington in an unsuccessful bid to undercut them.
On Friday, when President Obama is scheduled to announce even stricter standards -- in fact, the largest increase in mileage requirements since the government began regulating consumption of gasoline by cars in the 1970s -- the chief executives of Detroit's Big Three are expected to be in Washington again.
But this time they will be standing in solidarity with the president, who will also be surrounded by some of Detroit's highest-tech -- and most fuel-efficient -- new vehicles.
While the American carmakers, as well as their Asian rivals, once argued against even minimal increases in government fuel rules, they are acquiescing without protest to an increase to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, from the current 27 miles per gallon. 
The new standards are seen by the Obama administration as critical to reducing oil consumption and cutting consumer expenses at the pump, and the White House made it clear to Detroit executives that the changes were coming and they needed to cooperate.
It is an extraordinary shift in the relationship between the companies and Washington. But a lot has happened in the last four years, notably the $80 billion federal bailout of General Motors, Chrysler and scores of their suppliers, which removed any itch for a politically charged battle from the carmakers.
And the auto companies have gotten a lot better at building popular small cars that are fuel efficient -- thanks to gas-electric hybrids and advances in battery technology -- and consumers are responding. Six of the 10 best-selling vehicles in America are small or midsize cars, and one of the most popular pickup models on the market is a Ford F-Series with a high-mileage, six-cylinder engine.
Still, the industry's meek acceptance of what are considered extremely challenging fuel-economy goals is a marked retreat from years past, when the companies argued that consumers would not be willing to pay for the technology needed to meet higher mileage requirements.
''The auto companies' level of vitriol and rhetoric has changed,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a group that works to mitigate global warming. ''We welcome all epiphanies.''
The new mind-set in Detroit has been helped by some give and take on the government's side. G.M., Ford and Chrysler pressed for less onerous mileage goals for their profitable pickup trucks and got them. And the administration agreed to revisit the new requirements halfway through their course, with the possibility of adjusting them.
In the end, though, Detroit was faced with an undeniable political reality: there was no graceful way to say no to an administration that just two years ago came to its aid financially.
''This was no time to fight these regulations,'' said one Detroit executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the closed-door negotiations. ''And you're starting to see these fundamental shifts in the market that play a huge role in this.''
Environmental groups find themselves in the unusual position of lauding the automakers for making fuel economy a priority in virtually all their newest products, from the tiniest subcompact to the heaviest pickup.
''These proposed standards can be met using well-known technologies such as better engines, lower-cost hybrids and electric cars,'' said Roland Hwang, transportation program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The proposal to be introduced by the president calls for a 5 percent annual increase in fuel economy for cars from 2017 to 2025. The gains are more modest for the light-truck category, which includes sport utility vehicles -- 3.5 percent a year through 2021, and then 5 percent annually in the next four years. The standards announced four years ago run through 2016, requiring a corporate average of 36 miles per gallon by then.
Over all, the new standards will require a 54.5 miles per gallon corporate average for 2025. That standard will be made more easily achievable by credits that automakers can earn by producing battery-powered vehicles, hybrids and alternative-fuel models. Details of how the credits will work have not yet been made public, but the intention is to encourage the development of cars with far lower emissions.
Initially, the White House floated a much more aggressive target of 62 miles per gallon by 2025. It reduced that twice before agreeing on the final number.
A crucial negotiator for the administration was Ron Bloom, one of the senior members of the president's automotive task force that shepherded G.M. and Chrysler through taxpayer-financed bankruptcy reorganizations in 2009.
Detroit executives said Mr. Bloom's relationships with the companies and his understanding of their current and future products were critical factors in bringing all the sides together. The parties included environmental and public health groups as well as the California Air Resources Board, which has historically set standards more aggressive than the federal ones.
''The really big part of this is the midpoint review,'' said David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, an auto industry research group in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''By then everybody will have a better understanding of the cost of the technology, particularly the batteries.''
The automakers are confident that they can achieve incremental goals each year, but the real test will be if costs can be lowered enough so consumers will want to buy more electric and hybrid models.
''The standards are going to be quite stringent and a challenge,'' said Scott Becker, a senior vice president in the United States for the Japanese automaker Nissan. ''But given the range of technologies that we either have currently or are developing, we will be in a position to meet them.''
Support for the new standards by the Detroit and Asian carmakers will allow the administration to formally set forth the plan by the end of September, which will then be followed by a public comment period.
The White House has said the regulations will save drivers money at the pump in addition to reducing emissions. In the past, Detroit might have challenged the thesis, or forecast a negative impact on job growth. This time, the automakers' trade group proposed radio ads that would have raised concerns about job losses, but the proposal was squelched by some of the companies, notably G.M. and Chrysler.
Instead, the automakers decided to sign on to the goal of 54.5 miles per gallon -- and wait and see if it can be achieved down the road.
''These targets are far out there, but the economics need to work,'' said Mr. Cole. ''This is also the most aggressive environmental administration the industry has seen for a long time, and the companies have to get through this with them.''

HEADLINE: The Centrist Cop-Out

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
The facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling aren't complicated. Republicans have, in effect, taken America hostage, threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the essential business of government unless they get policy concessions they would never have been able to enact through legislation. And Democrats -- who would have been justified in rejecting this extortion altogether -- have, in fact, gone a long way toward meeting those Republican demands.
As I said, it's not complicated. Yet many people in the news media apparently can't bring themselves to acknowledge this simple reality. News reports portray the parties as equally intransigent; pundits fantasize about some kind of ''centrist'' uprising, as if the problem was too much partisanship on both sides. 
Some of us have long complained about the cult of ''balance,'' the insistence on portraying both parties as equally wrong and equally at fault on any issue, never mind the facts. I joked long ago that if one party declared that the earth was flat, the headlines would read ''Views Differ on Shape of Planet.'' But would that cult still rule in a situation as stark as the one we now face, in which one party is clearly engaged in blackmail and the other is dickering over the size of the ransom?
The answer, it turns out, is yes. And this is no laughing matter: The cult of balance has played an important role in bringing us to the edge of disaster. For when reporting on political disputes always implies that both sides are to blame, there is no penalty for extremism. Voters won't punish you for outrageous behavior if all they ever hear is that both sides are at fault.
Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. As you may know, President Obama initially tried to strike a ''Grand Bargain'' with Republicans over taxes and spending. To do so, he not only chose not to make an issue of G.O.P. extortion, he offered extraordinary concessions on Democratic priorities: an increase in the age of Medicare eligibility, sharp spending cuts and only small revenue increases. As The Times's Nate Silver pointed out, Mr. Obama effectively staked out a position that was not only far to the right of the average voter's preferences, it was if anything a bit to the right of the average Republican voter's preferences.
But Republicans rejected the deal. So what was the headline on an Associated Press analysis of that breakdown in negotiations? ''Obama, Republicans Trapped by Inflexible Rhetoric.'' A Democratic president who bends over backward to accommodate the other side -- or, if you prefer, who leans so far to the right that he's in danger of falling over -- is treated as being just the same as his utterly intransigent opponents. Balance!
Which brings me to those ''centrist'' fantasies.
Many pundits view taking a position in the middle of the political spectrum as a virtue in itself. I don't. Wisdom doesn't necessarily reside in the middle of the road, and I want leaders who do the right thing, not the centrist thing.
But for those who insist that the center is always the place to be, I have an important piece of information: We already have a centrist president. Indeed, Bruce Bartlett, who served as a policy analyst in the Reagan administration, argues that Mr. Obama is in practice a moderate conservative.
Mr. Bartlett has a point. The president, as we've seen, was willing, even eager, to strike a budget deal that strongly favored conservative priorities. His health reform was very similar to the reform Mitt Romney installed in Massachusetts. Romneycare, in turn, closely followed the outlines of a plan originally proposed by the right-wing Heritage Foundation. And returning tax rates on high-income Americans to their level during the Roaring Nineties is hardly a socialist proposal.
True, Republicans insist that Mr. Obama is a leftist seeking a government takeover of the economy, but they would, wouldn't they? The facts, should anyone choose to report them, say otherwise.
So what's with the buzz about a centrist uprising? As I see it, it's coming from people who recognize the dysfunctional nature of modern American politics, but refuse, for whatever reason, to acknowledge the one-sided role of Republican extremists in making our system dysfunctional. And it's not hard to guess at their motivation. After all, pointing out the obvious truth gets you labeled as a shrill partisan, not just from the right, but from the ranks of self-proclaimed centrists.
But making nebulous calls for centrism, like writing news reports that always place equal blame on both parties, is a big cop-out -- a cop-out that only encourages more bad behavior. The problem with American politics right now is Republican extremism, and if you're not willing to say that, you're helping make that problem worse.

HEADLINE: A Recovery That Repeats Its Painful Precedents

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Earlier this year, as the economy began to sputter, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked about the historical evidence that recoveries from financial crises were always painfully slow.
Mr. Bernanke responded that the pattern was clear but the reasons were not. He suggested that a nation that made the right choices could do better. History is not destiny.
It seems increasingly unlikely that the United States will prove his point. The government is expected to report Friday that the economy expanded at a rate below 2 percent in the first half of the year -- well below the nation's long-term average and too slowly to recover the losses sustained during the recession. 
Twenty-five million Americans still could not find full-time jobs last month. And hopes for the second half of the year are under the cloud of a political crisis that has cast doubt on the government's willingness to pay its bills.
Roughly four years since the start of the financial crisis, and two years since the official end of the resulting recession, what has taken hold in their wake is a new kind of great moderation -- an era of slow growth.
''The problem is that some persistent and deep currents are restraining our progress,'' John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Thursday.
Perhaps the most important is the closely linked combination of housing and consumer spending. It is a longstanding pattern that the Americans recover from recessions by building more homes and filling them with things. But there is no need to build homes while millions sit empty.
The San Francisco Fed estimates that construction may not return to the average level of prebubble activity before 2016, sidelining a major industry.
The decline in housing prices has made people feel and act less wealthy. Broad measures of wealth have bounced back from the depths of the recession, but the gains are driven by the stock market, which means they are concentrated in a relatively small share of families. For the vast midsection of Americans who counted their home as their primary investment, there has been no comparable recovery.
Those without jobs are spending even less. The widely quoted unemployment rate of 9.2 percent is also one of the narrowest measures of the problem. The share of people who cannot find full-time work is almost twice as high. Job growth in May and June was basically flat, although there are some signs of increased hiring in July.
The result: The San Francisco Fed estimates that spending per person per month remains about $175 below its prerecession trend.
''We did a pretty good job of fixing bank balance sheets, but I think that household balance sheets are the ones that have suffered the most,'' said Mark Thoma, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon. ''We could have done much more to help households.''
The government, another engine of past recoveries, also is dragging on this one. Reductions in government spending reduced the pace of growth in the first quarter by more than one percentage point, and the cuts have continued.
Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration furloughed 4,000 employees and suspended construction projects employing thousands more because much of the agency's funding had been waylaid by a dispute between the House and Senate.
State and local governments cut workers during the first half of the year almost as fast as private businesses added them. Federal stimulus spending is largely complete. Tax breaks are scheduled to expire in December. And economists say the political battle over federal spending appears to be shaking corporate confidence and delaying hiring and investments. Banks and other corporations are hoarding cash as a reserve against market disruptions. Companies like automakers and mobile home manufacturers, whose customers finance their purchases, are fretting the consequences of an increase in interest rates.
''We'll only be able to discern the full impact in retrospect,'' said Louis Crandall, chief economist at the market research firm Wrightson ICAP. ''But there is real reason to worry that this is a distraction.''
Even a temporary disruption in the flow of federal payments could greatly magnify the impact. The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projects that a one-month standoff will tip the economy back into recession.
And if the government is forced to default on debt payments, Mr. Bernanke has warned of catastrophic consequences for financial markets and the broader economy.
''We already are in a situation where there is a lot of uncertainty about the outlook,'' said Antulio Bomfim, a managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers. ''Attitudes toward risk-taking, business investment, those things by nature, they are very sensitive. If you're adding uncertainty to an environment that already is uncertain, that doesn't help.''
For now, at least, the economy still is growing. Indeed, by historical standards, it's not even growing that slowly. David E. Altig, head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, notes that the economy has expanded by a little more than 5 percent since the end of the recession, compared with roughly 6 percent during the two years after the last two recessions, in the early 2000s and the early 1990s.
The difference is that this recession was much deeper.
''The current recovery seems so disappointing because we expect the pace of the recovery to bear some relationship to the depth of the downturn,'' Mr. Altig wrote.
The International Monetary Fund said in its annual evaluation of the American economy, published last week, that growth would not exceed 3 percent over the next five years, meaning that the losses would not be recovered in the foreseeable future.
Various arms of the American government have predicted that growth will accelerate, but their similar predictions for 2011 so far have proved overly optimistic.
Still economists note that some of the obstacles that have slowed growth this year were specific and temporary, including the spike in oil prices and the disruptions caused by the earthquake in Japan. Washington, too, could resolve its problems.
James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global, pointed to the seminal study of the economic impact of financial crises, the 2009 book ''This Time is Different,'' which compared the financial crisis in the United States with those in five other advanced economies: Spain, Japan and three Nordic countries, Norway, Finland and Sweden.
Four years after those crises began, he said, the study found that most of those countries were well on the road to recovery.
He paused. ''Except for Spain, of course.''
He paused again. ''And Japan.''
''Actually,'' he said, ''It's just the three Scandinavian countries.''

HEADLINE: On the Links, Taking Aim At Obama, And Politics

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Keith Tassio was steaming, and the fierce summer sun was only partly to blame. Golfers view their game as a respite from life's frustrations, and here he was, about to putt on the ninth hole of one of Scottsdale's many, many golf courses, being asked about Washington, of all things.
At first he waved away a question about the continuing debt ceiling debate, knowing there were golfers moving up behind him who would not appreciate having to wait. But Mr. Tassio, a financial analyst, reconsidered a moment later, clearly needing an opportunity to vent. 
''The president needs to get serious,'' he fumed as his two golfing buddies at the Starfire Golf Club nodded in agreement. ''He's just ruining this economy.''
Mr. Tassio, wearing shorts and a polo shirt, railed against the Obama administration's health care overhaul, its tax policies and a variety of other stances he said were spoiling a healthy recovery.
Joe Monte Carlo, a colleague, chimed in. ''We want this thing settled,'' he said of the deadlock between Democrats and Republicans. ''Both parties need to compromise. But it's the Democrats who have not been serious about their budget. The president is playing a dangerous game.''
It was on a golf course last month that President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner tried to bridge their differences in what became known as the ''golf summit.'' That was before the name-calling and walkouts of more recent days that have characterized efforts to work out a deficit reduction deal to pave the way for an extension of the country's $14.3 trillion debt limit.
People of all political stripes can be found on a golf course, even one in a conservative part of a conservative state, across the street from the offices of a conservative lawmaker, Representative David Schweikert, a freshman Republican who has vowed not to vote to increase the debt limit unless systemic changes, like a balanced budget amendment, are enacted. Mr. Schweikert's conservative Fifth District wraps around the eastern suburbs of Phoenix, through Tempe and Scottsdale and up into the desert hinterlands as far north as the Horseshoe Reservoir.
At the Starfire Golf Club, with its 27 holes designed by Arnold Palmer, there was plenty of bashing of Mr. Obama. But the wrath extended to Mr. Boehner, too, and to every last politician and bureaucrat in the nation's capital.
''Where are the people of integrity, the Washingtons and Lincolns?'' asked Phyllis Morton, retired real estate agent. ''We need people who aren't taking lobbyist money, who aren't making decisions to get re-elected. Where are those people?''
Carolyn Riley, another retiree, added: ''I think it's stunning that they can't just agree. I'm fed up with all of them. Our country's in terrible shape. Politics is in terrible shape.''
Earlier in the week, liberal activists had gathered outside Mr. Schweikert's office, across from the course, to lambaste his party's budget priorities. Tea Party members had held a counterprotest. Both gatherings were brief, given the heat, and golfing was not interrupted.
It is the job of Hugh Truesdale, 85, a retired engineer who works at the course as a golf ranger, to keep play flowing. A genial man, he jokes with lagging golfers, gently urging them to speed up. His ever-present smile fades, though, when he considers how to get politicians moving.
''I've worked on a budget all my life, and it shouldn't be too much to ask the government to do the same,'' said Mr. Truesdale, who said he had voted for candidates on both sides of the aisle. ''It's horrible what's going on here. I'm pretty sure before the deadline they're going to come to a deal. But that won't solve the problem. We have to control our spending.''
Edmund Bushman, a retiree who teaches business and computer science at a community college, took a breath when asked about the deadlock that has made a follow-up golf outing between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner seem unlikely anytime soon.
''I've been following it,'' Mr. Bushman said of the debt ceiling debate. ''I think both sides are wrong, and both sides need to look at themselves in the mirror. I think it's all about making the other side look bad. I consider myself an independent who votes for the person and not the party, and I have to tell you that I'm not happy with anybody right now.''
He stood alone on a practice green as he spoke, holding a putter. Finished talking politics, he turned his attention back to golf, hitting ball after ball after ball. Some came close to the hole. Others rolled up well short. Every once in a while he would sink one.
''There is one correlation between golf and politics,'' Mr. Bushman said a few minutes later. ''You have to learn from your mistakes. If you make the same mistakes over and over, if you don't adapt and you don't learn, you'll never make any progress.''

HEADLINE: Perry's Bank Account Fueled by Land Sales and Good Timing

BYLINE: By JAY ROOT. 
jroot@texastribune.org

 BODY:
One theme runs consistently throughout Gov. Rick Perry's political career: good timing.
The same might be said of his real estate deals.
Mr. Perry was not born into wealth, and while he has drawn relatively modest pay since 1985 as an elected official, he has made a small fortune on land transactions, some with the help of rich and politically connected friends. As the governor mulls a run for president, opponents and the news media are taking another look at his holdings and his tax returns.
Michael Dell, the computer magnate, once bought a piece of property from Mr. Perry -- for almost four times what Mr. Perry had paid two years earlier. In 2001, the governor bought a piece of lakefront property from a longtime friend, State Senator Troy Fraser, Republican of Horseshoe Bay. Mr. Perry sold it six years later for a profit of $823,766, his biggest real estate gain ever, according to available records. 
Over the years, both Republican and Democratic critics have used the land deals -- and at least one stock trade involving the company of a top donor -- to suggest that Mr. Perry has traded on his connections to make money. But no one has found any wrongdoing, and Mr. Perry has said that all of his deals were above board. In 1996, Mr. Perry put much of his wealth into blind trusts, making it almost impossible to tell what he owns now.
Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who analyzed Mr. Perry's tax returns going back to 1991 for The Texas Tribune, said Mr. Perry had fallen into a handful of deals producing some big paydays.
''Based on the information that we've been given,'' Mr. Martin said, ''it looked like Governor Perry's net worth did increase significantly while he's been in office. The market was going up; timing was very much in people's favor. So it might not be unusual, but because he is a political official, it is subject to more scrutiny.''
Perry aides have said the governor benefited only from good business sense and a once-red-hot real estate market, all the while meeting disclosure requirements.
The tax records are not subject to mandatory disclosure, but Mr. Perry has voluntarily released them for most of the time he has been in elected office. Mr. Perry, or at least his trust, has also lost some money along the way, most notably during the 2008 economic downturn.
When he was first elected to the Legislature, in 1984, Mr. Perry, from rural Haskell County, north of Abilene, was still farming cotton and ranching cattle. In 1987, he and his wife, Anita, reported an adjusted gross income of $45,000. As a state legislator, considered a part-time job, Mr. Perry was entitled to a salary of $7,200 a year plus expenses. He made about $85,000 annually as agriculture commissioner (1991-99) and now draws $150,000 a year as governor.
In his almost three decades in public office, Mr. Perry's biggest gains in income have come from buying and selling land. Since the early 1990s, when Mr. Perry began serving as a statewide elected official, the transactions have helped him earn about $2 million in pre-tax profits, according to interviews, public records and news accounts.
In 1995, Mr. Perry sold a 9.3-acre tract in Austin to Mr. Dell, with Mike Toomey, an influential Texas lobbyist and longtime confidant, representing him at the sale. Mr. Dell bought the property for $465,000 and got access to important municipal sewage infrastructure. Mr. Perry had bought the land for a reported $122,000 in 1993, giving him a $343,000 profit.
A little more than a year later, acting on a tip from Gary Bradley, the flashy Austin developer, Mr. Perry bought 60 acres southwest of Austin. He sold the tract less than three years later for a profit of $239,000. Mr. Bradley's real estate empire went into bankruptcy in 2002.
According to available records, Mr. Perry's most lucrative land deal was a 2007 transaction in which he sold a prime piece of real estate on the shores of Lake L.B.J. near Austin for $1.14 million at the height of the market. Records show he had bought the 0.68-acre tract for $314,770 in 2001 from Mr. Fraser, the state senator, who had acquired it and a nearby tract in the resort town of Horseshoe Bay. Mr. Perry's office has described the transaction as ''completely at arm's length.''
The lot Mr. Perry bought is in an area of Horseshoe Bay known as The Peninsula, the town's ''most prestigious and exclusive waterfront address,'' according to a description on the Horseshoe Bay Resort Realty Web site. Resort literature described the property, with 10-foot-high stone walls around it, as one of 10 lots taken from the estate of Horseshoe Bay's founder.
After selling the land in 2007, Mr. Perry reported adjusted gross income of $1,092,810, while paying $195,023 in taxes. It was the best year, in terms of income, that Mr. Perry has disclosed so far.
The governor's office did not respond to requests for the Perrys' 2010 income tax return and did not volunteer the market value of their blind trusts. In 2009, the governor's office pegged the value of the trust at $896,000. The Perrys reported income of $200,370 in 2009, which included the $65,000 from Ms. Perry's work as a consultant for the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault.
Apart from the money he made on land deals, Mr. Perry reported a profit of $38,000 in 1996 after selling shares of Kinetic Concepts Inc., a hospital equipment company founded by one of his most generous donors, James Leininger of San Antonio, the vocal proponent of school vouchers.
All of Mr. Perry's publicly traded stocks, and some other assets, have been transferred into his blind trust, records show. The trust has provided at least $600,000 in income to Mr. Perry since 1997.
It has not all been rosy. The blind trust Mr. Perry created in 1996 reported a half-million dollars in losses in 2008, in what Mr. Martin, the accountant, said was most likely caused by a sell-off during the market downturns that year.
''He's had good timing, and he's had bad timing,'' Mr. Martin said. ''When the stock market went down, it looks like he pulled out of the stock market, or at least his blind trust did, and he has a significant capital loss now.''
Mr. Perry's most recent personal financial statement, filed with the Texas Ethics Commission earlier this year and covering 2010, also reflects a loss, reported as less than $5,000, on the sale of a house the Perrys owned in College Station, where their daughter attended college.
One area that has grown on Mr. Perry's financial disclosures in recent years is gifts received by the couple. The latest disclosure included seven pages of them, up from three in each of the two previous years. They included a hat, transportation, lodging and hunting trips from various contributors and friends. Ms. Perry received a gift last year of ''hair products'' from Farouk Shami, maker of the popular CHI flat iron and at one point in 2010 a Democratic contender for Mr. Perry's job. Mr. Shami later dropped out and endorsed the governor.
Boots seemed to be the most popular gift. The records show that since 2007 Mr. Perry has received 10 pairs from a variety of donors, including several from the famed Houston boot maker Rocky Carroll.

HEADLINE: Rival Plans Put Off Difficult Decisions

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The two main deficit-reduction plans in the House and the Senate, which would tie cuts in federal spending to an increase in the debt limit, both defer tough decisions and rely heavily on procedural steps to impose fiscal discipline.
These devices include annual spending caps on selected government programs and a new Congressional panel to recommend additional savings -- with no guarantee that Congress would enact the proposals. 
At the center of the debate on Capitol Hill this week is the question of whether the cuts are deep enough and the savings are genuine. To get a deal, Congressional leaders may need to add new enforcement measures to ensure that the promised savings are achieved.
In a weak economy, many economists and Obama administration officials say, Congress should not make sharp, immediate cuts in federal spending. The leading deficit-reduction plans defer major decisions about exactly how and where to cut.
Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said the two plans were ''better than nothing.'' But he said, ''They are fixing a political problem, not the fiscal problem we have.''
Mr. Bixby said the plans did not address the ''underlying structural deficit in the budget, which results from the fact that revenues are not keeping up with the growth of entitlement programs.''
Representative David Dreier, Republican of California and chairman of the Rules Committee, said the House bill, promoted by Speaker John A. Boehner, ''makes immediate, enormous cuts in federal spending.'' The Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would save $22 billion next year and $42 billion in 2013 -- at a time when the government is spending $3.7 trillion a year.
One of the few areas in which Mr. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat and majority leader, agree is student aid. They both propose eliminating subsidized federal loans for students in graduate and professional schools -- about 1.5 million borrowers who do not pay interest on their loans while they are in school. Graduate students could still take out unsubsidized loans. But interest would accrue during that time, so they would owe more to the government.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that this change would save $18 billion over 10 years.
After intense lobbying by colleges and college students, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid have for now rejected proposals for deep cuts in the Pell grant program, which serves people from lower-income families. President Obama proposed such cuts in his budget this year, and they looked likely until last week, said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade group.
Mr. Reid would raise $13 billion over 10 years from the sale of radio spectrum licenses and would cut farm subsidy payments by $11 billion over the same period, two items not found in the Boehner plan. Mr. Boehner calls for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, a proposal that many Democrats say would deface the Constitution.
Savings in entitlement programs and other ''mandatory spending'' total $20 billion over 10 years under the House bill and about twice that amount under Mr. Reid's plan. Those sums are less than one-half of 1 percent of the mandatory spending anticipated by the budget office.
Both plans would trim mandatory spending by eliminating some overpayments and fraudulent payments in Social Security disability programs, Medicare and Medicaid.
The Boehner and Reid plans would both establish a bipartisan committee of House and Senate members to recommend additional deficit reduction measures, which could include changes in entitlement programs and tax laws. The bills establish elaborate procedures for Congress to consider the proposals and vote on them -- if all goes smoothly -- by Dec. 23.
However, the Boehner and Reid plans do not guarantee that there will be agreement in the 12-member committee, much less approval of its recommendations in the House or the Senate.
In their plans, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid prescribe the format of the final committee report: If there are any dissenting views, ''their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report.''
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid do not provide any guidance about savings that might be found in Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, which together account for more than 40 percent of all federal spending.
Under Mr. Reid's bill, the goal of the joint committee is to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic product, or one-third of what it was last year. Under Mr. Boehner's bill, the goal is to reduce deficits by a total of $1.8 trillion over 10 years.
Asked about cuts that might be required under this part of Mr. Boehner's bill, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said, ''I don't think they're specifically identified, because if they were, people would run screaming from the room.''
One of the most contentious issues is whether to count savings that result from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
More than half of the 10-year savings in Mr. Reid's bill -- roughly $1.3 trillion of the $2.2 trillion total -- is attributable to limits he would impose on war spending.
''These are real savings,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat. ''If conducting the wars adds to our debt, it's undeniable that winding down the wars delivers savings.''
But Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said these amounts should not be counted toward deficit reduction. Mr. Obama never intended to continue war spending at the current level of more than $150 billion a year, Mr. Sessions said.
The government typically borrows money to cover the difference between spending and revenues. With lower deficits, it would have less need for borrowing. The Boehner and Reid plans both take credit for substantial savings in interest on the public debt resulting from lower deficits.
However, the budget office does not ordinarily count such savings when it estimates the cost of legislation.

HEADLINE: Just Before Deadline, County in Alabama Delays Bankruptcy Move

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Mary Williams Walsh reported from New York, and Campbell Robertson from Birmingham.

 BODY:
There may still be a way out for Jefferson County, the Alabama county being crushed by its debt.
The governor of Alabama, who for months told the county to deal with its woes on its own, has been working behind the scenes in recent days on a state-brokered deal to avert what could be the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in United States history. On Wednesday evening, a proposal was aired to a small group of lawyers for the county in a private meeting, according to one official present.
Hours before a deadline Thursday, the commissioners agreed to delay the vote on a bankruptcy filing for seven more days, while they reviewed the new offer from the county's creditors. The proposal would reduce the total amount owed and use state backing to bring down the county's interest rate.
In some ways, the proposal is similar to what was done this month to help Greece, or to resolve New York City's financial crisis in 1975. Jefferson County would get debt relief through the creation of an independent borrowing authority, whose bonds Gov. Robert Bentley has agreed to guarantee. The authority would issue new bonds to replace the impaired ones that creditors now hold. 
''That was the game-changer,'' said John Young, a court-appointed receiver on the case, referring to the governor's willingness to put the state's own credit on the line. The state legislature would still have to approve the new authority. Municipal securities analysts said they welcomed the state's involvement, which could help ease market jitters.
Jefferson County's finances are in such disarray that it cannot currently borrow at any price. But the new borrowing authority would be independent of the county, and the state guarantee would strengthen the authority's rating even further, Mr. Young said. That would lower its borrowing cost. The reduced costs would benefit Jefferson County residents, whose fatigue and rage over the debt they have to pay reached a boiling point this summer.
Whether Jefferson County's commissioners will embrace the proposal is unclear. Rate increases are their foremost concern. They said one potential rate schedule being floated would lead to an annual increase of 8 percent in sewer rates for four years or more, an unacceptable level.
The governor's finance director, David Perry, said the plan included no specific rate schedules, but called for a reduction in debt that could be achieved several ways.
Commissioners also complained that they had been given nothing in writing on Thursday and could not yet properly evaluate the proposal. Commissioner T. Joe Knight said he had agreed to the seven-day standstill out of deference to the governor.
Jefferson County's debacle began years ago, when it was ordered by a federal court to rebuild its failing sewer system. It had to issue bonds to finance the huge construction costs, and followed consultants' advice that it lower its borrowing costs by issuing bonds linked to derivatives, which were supposed to protect the county if interest rates rose. The revenues from sewer ratepayers were pledged to pay back the debt.
But the revenue projections were too optimistic, the bond deals were plagued by pay-to-play and bid-rigging scandals, and the complex bond-derivative structures collapsed in the financial turmoil of 2008. The costs ballooned, and now the county owes about $3.2 billion. Some officials who helped with the bond deals have been convicted of corruption charges, and some of the banks have been forced to pay back some of their fees under regulatory pressure. In November 2009, J.P. Morgan made the county a $75 million payment as part of a settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With other federal investigations and prosecutions continuing, county residents are increasingly unwilling to help pay debts incurred amid so much impropriety.
This summer's flirtation with bankruptcy grew out of a sudden and steep shortfall in the county's general fund revenues, which are separate from the sewer revenues. In April, the State Supreme Court declared an important county tax unconstitutional on technical grounds, cutting off 44 percent of the county's discretionary revenues. Despite appeals to the state legislature for help, little was done, and the county had to lay off nearly 550 employees, around a quarter of the workforce, and make deep cuts in services.
As this was happening, Mr. Young, the court-appointed receiver for the sewer system, issued a report recommending a 25 percent immediate increase in the rates paid by households on the system to pay the outstanding bonds. Residents howled in protest, complaining of the previous rate increases and then the county service cuts.
With tensions high, Mr. Young then sent letters to the county, demanding that the $75 million payment from J.P. Morgan be diverted to help shore up the sewer system's finances.
But the money represented the county's only cash reserves, and officials saw no alternative but to declare bankruptcy. Just as they were about to file at the end of June, the governor intervened, convincing Mr. Young and the county to declare a standstill period for 30 days.
Frustrated by half-hearted legislative attempts at a solution, the governor had also been informed that the state and its taxpayers could be liable for part of the county's ballooning debt because the state had been named in the federal order to rebuild the sewer system.
Mr. Young said the governor also had been told by bankruptcy experts that a Chapter 9 filing by the state's most populous county would spook the municipal bond market, which is already jittery because of an analyst's prediction of big defaults across the country, and a possible downgrade of the United States' Treasury's debt. If the state showed it was unwilling to help Jefferson County, it might unnerve investors considering bonds issued by other Alabama towns and counties, and even the state itself.
''A bankruptcy in Jefferson County would have a negative impact across the whole state of Alabama, and potentially all across the country,'' Mr. Young said. The governor issued a statement saying he was ''supportive of the seven-day extension'' and looked forward to a thorough review of the creditors' latest offer.
It was not apparent that the new terms would appease county residents, many of whom have started to think, incorrectly, that Chapter 9 would be a good way to walk away from the debt completely. Commissioners said their constituents generally favor bankruptcy, and in interviews with residents around the county, many said bankruptcy should have been declared years ago.
Spotting a reporter leaving the county courthouse on Thursday, a man in a pickup truck yelled out the question on everyone's mind: ''Did they file yet?''
Upon hearing it would take a few more days, the man cursed and drove on.

HEADLINE: Surprise Ending to Day of Strong-Arming, Head Counts and Meetings

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After two hours of impassioned debate, the Capitol was braced for the grand finale of Speaker John A. Boehner's days of strong-arming members on the most important vote of his Congressional career. Suddenly, with no warning and just minutes from a vote Thursday evening, the conversation on the House floor turned to naming post offices.
Thus began the great pizza seduction. One after another, recalcitrant Republicans were marched into Mr. Boehner's office, where he begged, implored and, when that failed, berated them in a desperate effort to win support for his proposal to resolve the debt crisis. 
Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House whip, bought a pile of pizzas, and asked those members who were against the bill to come on over for a slice, and some haranguing.
The speaker was forced to delay the vote on Thursday on his debt ceiling bill, when it became clear that his Republican members were not going to put him over the top. Some of those who left Mr. Boehner's office looked stricken, but said they were unyielding. Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas emerged, saying he was ''a bloody, beaten-down no.''
Other Republicans who had agreed to vote yes went gallivanting through the Capitol -- in red spike heels in the case of Representative Nan Hayworth of New York -- to get before their colleagues or television cameras and help the speaker seal the deal.
The pulling of the bill was an unexpected twist in a chaotic day in which staff members for Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate slid from desk to desk around Capitol Hill asserting that the outcome of the debt debate would end in their party's favor.
Earlier Thursday, it seemed as though Mr. Boehner was indeed picking up support for his bill, which cuts spending, raises the debt ceiling and gives his members their coveted balanced-budget amendment. But in the waning hours of debate on the bill, the math appeared to turn against the speaker. Some key lawmakers, like Representative Tim Scott of South Carolina, a member of the freshman leadership team, said he would join the other freshmen from his state and vote no.
In the final minutes of the two-hour debate of the bill, right after Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, offered her closing remarks, Representative Steven C. LaTourette, an Ohio Republican who was serving as the presiding officer, announced that the House would turn to other business.
For more than an hour, lawmakers in a nearly empty chamber talked about naming post offices: one in Peoria, Ill., in honor of Charles Lawrence Chan, a Sept. 11 victim; one in Iuka, Miss., honoring Sgt. Jason W. Vaughn, who was killed in Iraq; even one in Guam, honoring John Pangelinan Gerber, a Vietnam veteran.
The whipping effort had begun early in the week, and included pizza parties and one-on-one meetings with freshmen, cellphone calls and text messages from Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, and nice dinners over wine.
On Thursday, Mr. Boehner and his leadership team continued to press their case long before the bill was pulled, Mr. Boehner emerged from his ceremonial office to a sea of reporters, whom he met with a mild curse, grabbed members from the floor and marched them through the speaker's lobby in full view of their colleagues for a talking-to back in his den.
When Representative Chuck Fleischmann, Republican of Tennessee, came out, he did not look as though he had been picnicking. This continued well into the night, after the bill was yanked. Mo Brooks of Alabama, Jeff Flake and Trent Franks of Arizona, and two freshmen from Illinois, Randy Hultgren and Joe Walsh all met with members of the leadership team. On Thursday night, Mr. Walsh said he was still a no vote.
After leaving Mr. Boehner's office, Mr. Gohmert told reporters his objections to the bill. ''Why are we compromising with ourselves?'' he asked. ''The Senate has passed nothing.''
The freshmen, many of them associated with the Tea Party before the Republican party, appeared to be putting up the highest walls, though some more senior members were also invited to see Mr. McCarthy and his plates of pizza. ''It is the most refreshing thing in the world to see what is going on in there,'' said Representative Jeff Flake of Arizona, an ardent foe of earmarks, the pet projects of lawmakers. ''This kind of negotiation a few years ago would have cost $20 billion'' in pork barrel projects. Mr. Flake would not say whether the quality of the pizza had moved his vote, as he continued to ponder his final move.
Members said they agonized. ''I am trying to find a way to vote for this bill,'' said Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan. ''This is a step in the right direction. I wish it were a bigger step.'' (At the last minute, Mr. Huizenga, who brought his 12-year-old son Garrett to the Capitol for inspiration, assured leaders that they had his vote.) Some men from the South Carolina freshman delegation, a tight-knit group of conservatives, repaired to the House chapel on Thursday to pray. ''I am a no at the end of the day,'' Mr. Scott said. ''I was leaning no. Now I am a no.''
In a parallel, reverse-whip universe on Twitter, Freedom Works, a Tea Party group, began at midday to send messages pressuring members who were on the fence, urging people at home to call the members and tell them to vote no. Former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska also got in the game, posting an ominous warning to freshmen about contested primaries on Facebook.
Amid the frenzy of arm-twisting, debate and reporters swarming like bees in a sunflower garden, Representative David Wu, the Oregon Democrat who resigned this week amid a sex scandal, sat peacefully on the balcony off the speaker's lobby, awaiting the last votes of his career and pulling on a stogie.

HEADLINE: House Puts Off Debt Vote As Press by Boehner Fails

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Robert Pear and Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Short of support from their conservative members, House Republican leaders on Thursday abruptly put off a vote on their proposal to raise the debt ceiling and cut government spending, throwing last-ditch efforts to avert a government default next week into disarray.
Just minutes from a roll call vote on the plan pushed by Speaker John A. Boehner, Republicans stunned the House by interrupting the debate and turning to routine matters while Mr. Boehner and his lieutenants tried to pressure reluctant conservatives into backing their plan. The House then went into a recess and shortly before 11 p.m., the leadership announced that no vote would be held Thursday. 
It was unclear if the leadership intended to reconfigure the measure and try again Friday, but senior lawmakers were taking procedural steps to do so.
The surprise postponement threw the endgame of the debt-limit clash into confusion and raised concerns among some on Capitol Hill that the government was lurching toward a default. The White House and Senate Democratic leaders had been waiting for the House to act before making their next move with an eye on the Tuesday deadline set by the Treasury Department for raising the debt ceiling or facing the possibility that the government would not be able to meet all its financial obligations.
Republicans had expressed confidence throughout the day that they would round up enough recalcitrant conservatives to pass their plan, but they obviously miscalculated.
Officials and aides said opponents had multiple misgivings about the measure, which Senate Democrats had already said they would reject as soon as it reached the Senate desk. The legislation would provide a $900 billion increase in the federal debt limit in exchange for slightly more than that in spending cuts. A second increase of $1.6 trillion in 2012 would be tied to the ability of a new special committee to produce a proposal to save an additional $1.8 trillion.
Failure to pass the measure would represent a significant defeat for Mr. Boehner, the first-year speaker who has invested significant political capital in trying to get his fractious majority behind the legislation, which had the strong support of the entire leadership team. It could also bolster Senate Democrats in their push to raise the debt ceiling by enough to take the Treasury Department through 2012.
Though they knew the vote was going to be close given the philosophical objections of many House Republicans to an increase in federal borrowing power, Republicans had made it clear earlier Thursday that they expected to pass the legislation in an effort to force the Democratic-led Senate into accepting it.
''When the House takes action today, the United States Senate will have no more excuses for inaction,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday afternoon, just before the debate began.
But shortly before 6 p.m., near the end of a two-hour debate on the plan, Republicans halted the proceedings, and Democrats claimed that Mr. Boehner was still short of the votes he needed.
At 6:50 p.m., the leaders stopped all business on the floor, where the House had worked through a list of post offices to be renamed, and called a recess. As the House remained dark, Republican leaders scurried from office to office, meeting with rebellious members and trying to find a way to press forward with the vote. They eventually surrendered and put off the vote for the night.
With House Democrats offering no votes, even from the party's fiscal conservatives, Republicans evidently remained shy of the total needed for passage, and Mr. Boehner engaged in some very public arm-twisting as he pulled members off the floor into a nearby office.
Republicans who met with the speaker, in his frantic search for votes, included Mo Brooks of Alabama, Jeff Flake and Trent Franks of Arizona, and two freshmen from Illinois, Randy Hultgren and Joe Walsh.
News of the prospect that the vote could be put off began circulating as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader and former House speaker, was making her party's closing argument against the plan on the floor. After the night of uncertainty, Ms. Pelosi said she hoped the struggle would make House Republicans more willing to give ground.
''Hopefully, now the Republicans will come back to the table to negotiate a bipartisan, balanced agreement that is overwhelmingly supported by the American people,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who added that ''Republicans have taken us to the brink of economic chaos.''
The delay caught Senate Democrats off guard. Harry Reid, the majority leader, had said earlier Thursday that once the House approved its plan, he intended to immediately set it aside and move ahead with his proposal for deeper spending cuts and a longer extension in the debt limit, which would ultimately be thrown back to the House.
The White House was taken by surprise by the postponement as well, having shared the expectation that Mr. Boehner had the Republican votes to pass his measure. Administration officials had no immediate reaction; any satisfaction at the public show of Republican disarray over a bill that Mr. Obama had threatened to veto was offset by concern that additional delays only raised the chances of missing the deadline to increase the debt limit.
All day, the White House was on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome of the expected House and Senate votes before it could engage Senate Republicans in talks on a compromise that could pass in the Senate and be sent to the House, upping the pressure on House Republicans to fall in line.
After earlier talks, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who served nearly four decades in the Senate and acts as the White House point person for dealing with the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, was not in touch with Mr. McConnell on Thursday, aides to both men said. They said Mr. McConnell had made it clear that he did not want to engage until the House had voted on Mr. Boehner's bill.
Mr. Obama has said he wants an increase in the debt limit through 2012 to avoid a repeat months from now of ''this kind of circus,'' as his press secretary, Jay Carney, said Thursday.
Mr. Carney echoed Mr. Obama's argument that such timing could make an essential extension of the government's borrowing authority hostage to election-year partisanship. He added, ''Lift the cloud that's hanging over our economy.''
Online Correction: July 28, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of cuts in the Republican plan. It is $900 billion, not million.

HEADLINE: Jobs Deficit, Investment Deficit, Fiscal Deficit

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The immediate crisis facing the United States economy is the jobs deficit, not the federal debt, and budget cuts may make matters worse. an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Like many economists, I believe that the immediate crisis facing the United States economy is the jobs deficit, not the budget deficit. The magnitude of the jobs crisis is clearly illustrated by the jobs gap - currently around 12.3 million jobs. 
That is how many jobs the economy must add to return to its peak employment level before the 2008-9 recession and to absorb the 125,000 people who enter the labor force each month. At the current pace of recovery, the gap will be not closed until 2020 or later. 
History suggests that recovery from a debt-fueled asset bubble and ensuing balance-sheet recession is long and painful, with significantly slower growth in gross domestic product and significantly higher unemployment for a least a decade. Right now it looks as though the United States is following this pattern. The jobs gap is primarily the result of the dramatic collapse in aggregate demand that began with the financial crisis of 2008. Even with unprecedented amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, the recovery that began in June 2009 has remained anemic, because consumers, the major driver of private demand, have curbed their spending, increased their saving and started to deleverage and reduce their debt -- and they still have a long way to go. 
As I asserted in my last post (and many other economists, including Lawrence Summers, Alan Blinder, Christina Romer, Peter Orzsag and Robert Shiller, have made this point, too), the jobs gap warrants additional fiscal measures to increase private-sector demand and promote job creation. 
Sadly, current signals from Washington indicate that such measures will not be taken. 
Instead, the risk grows that large, premature cuts in government spending will reduce aggregate demand, will tip the economy back into recession and drive the unemployment rate back into double digits. 
Even if no budget deal is reached and no major spending cuts are made in the near future, there is now a serious risk that the rating agencies will downgrade government debt because of the political stalemate over a long-run deficit reduction plan. That would almost surely produce higher interest rates that could sink the economy into recession again.
Although the jobs gap and the high unemployment rate are the immediate problems in the American labor market, they are not the only ones. And there is no sign that the budget negotiations in Washington are going to address these other problems, either. 
Even before the onslaught of the Great Recession, the labor market was in serious trouble. Job growth between 2000 and 2007 was only half what it had been in the preceding three decades. 
Productivity growth was strong, but far outpaced compensation growth. Between 2002 and 2007, productivity grew by 11 percent, but the hourly compensation of both the median high-school-educated worker and the median college-educated worker fell. 
During the same period, the real median income for working-age households declined by more than $2,000. The 2002-7 recovery was the only American recovery on record during which the income of the typical working family dropped. 
And despite the recovery, job opportunities continued to polarize. Employment grew in high-education, high-wage professional technical and managerial occupations and in low-education, low-wage food-service, personal-care and protective-service occupations; employment fell in middle-skill, white-collar and blue-collar occupations. The drop in middle-income manufacturing jobs was especially precipitous. 
To fashion the appropriate policy responses to these long-term structural problems in the labor market, it is first necessary to understand their causes. The key contributors are three: 
1. Skill-biased technological change that has automated routine work while increasing the demand for highly educated workers with at least a college education, preferably in science, engineering or math.
2. Globalization or the integration of labor markets through trade and more recently through outsourcing.
3. The declining competitiveness of the United States as a place to do business. 
Recent studies by Michael Spence and Sandile Hlatschwayo (discussed last week in Economix by Uwe Reinhardt) and by David Autor describe how technological change and globalization are hollowing out job opportunities and depressing wage growth in the middle of the skill and occupational distributions. 
A widely cited commentary by Andrew Grove, former chief executive of Intel, and a prize-winning article by Gary Pisano and Willy Shih make similar arguments. 
Many of the workers and jobs adversely affected by technological change and globalization are in the tradable goods sector, primarily in manufacturing. Nor is the United States labor market the only one to be affected by these forces: the polarization of employment opportunities is also occurring in the other advanced industrial countries. 
Many of them, like Germany, are doing something about it. The United States is not. According to a recent McKinsey study, the United States is becoming a less attractive place to locate production and employment compared with many other countries. 
A newly published study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation reaches a similar conclusion. The United States is underinvesting in three major areas that help a country create and retain high-wage jobs: skills and training of the work force, infrastructure, and research and development. 
Spending in these areas currently accounts for less than 10 percent of all federal government spending, and this share has been declining over time. And that's despite the fact that the borrowing costs of the federal government have been near historic lows and much lower than the returns on economically justifiable investments in these areas. 
Such investments fall into the "non-security discretionary spending" category of the federal budget, the category in line to be cut to historic lows to reduce the government deficit over the next decade. 
In my previous Economix post, I said a budget deal should pair fiscal measures aimed at job creation now with a credible plan to reduce the deficit gradually and that both should be passed at once as a package. I also urged that the plan include an unemployment rate target that would postpone serious deficit-reduction measures until the target had been achieved. 
I also think the plan should include a separate capital budget that distinguishes government spending on education, infrastructure and research as investments with committed revenues over several years. A capital budget would close the investment deficit in those areas that strengthen American competitiveness and promote high-wage job creation. None of the budget plans currently under debate include a separate capital budget. 
The labor market is suffering from two problems: an immediate jobs gap, primarily the result of inadequate demand, and a long-term shortfall in rewarding employment opportunities for American workers, primarily the result of structural forces. 
As a result of these forces, even when demand has recovered, many of the good jobs lost during the last decade will not be replaced by new good jobs without significant public investments to strengthen the attractiveness of the United States as a production location. 
So far, the deficit-reduction proposals attracting attention do not address the labor market's dual problems and leave many American workers and their families to face another lost decade.

HIGHLIGHT: Outrageous behavior demands extraordinary responses. 

 BODY:
So if something does pass the House, it will demand a constitutional balanced-budget amendment as the price of a second vote next year. I think we can safely say that the political process has failed. Now what?
Well, there do appear to be legal loopholes. Jack Balkin gives us the platinum coin option:
 Sovereign governments such as the United States can print new money. However, there's a statutory limit to the amount of paper currency that can be in circulation at any one time. 
Ironically, there's no similar limit on the amount of coinage. A little-known statute gives the secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue platinum coins in any denomination. So some commentators have suggested that the Treasury create two $1 trillion coins, deposit them in its account in the Federal Reserve and write checks on the proceeds.
And he also gives us the exploding-option option:
 The government can also raise money through sales: For example, it could sell the Federal Reserve an option to purchase government property for $2 trillion. The Fed would then credit the proceeds to the government's checking account. Once Congress lifts the debt ceiling, the president could buy back the option for a dollar, or the option could simply expire in 90 days. 
These things sound ridiculous -- but so is the behavior of Congressional Republicans. So why not fight back using legal tricks?
And there is the constitutional option. Ronald Dworkin says that it works -- or, at the very least, will put the issue into the courts for a while, which is better than destroying the economy next week.
Outrageous behavior demands extraordinary responses. Over to you, Mr. President.

HEADLINE: 'Wall Street Wives' Finds a Cast

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: A potential new reality show says it is making progress toward becoming, well, a reality. 

 BODY:
"Wall Street Wives" is one step closer to the small screen.
Auditioners for the upcoming reality show, or "docu-drama," have been streaming in fast and furious since DealBook broke news of the show several weeks ago. Devon Fleming, the show's creator, said on Thursday that she's had "hundreds of e-mails" expressing interest in the show, and that she had recently narrowed the cast to nine women.
The show will shoot initial segments beginning this Sunday, but although Ms. Fleming is currently in talks with two networks, she has still not signed a deal. On Thursday, she maintained that she would not let that stymie her quest to bring the show, which may be renamed "The Real Wives of Wall Street," to the air.
Ms. Fleming's cast list is tentative, she said, and the show's producers would still make room for a high-profile or otherwise irresistible finance spouse. But here are the leading contenders so far:
Devon Fleming: Ms. Fleming, 49, who is married to a Deutsche Bank wealth manager, will star in the show. During the financial crisis, she "made a fortune, lost a fortune, and learned valuable lessons through it all," and is now working as a lifestyle guru and living in what she describes as "a McMansion" in New Canaan, Conn.
Melissa Matthes: A professor of religion and politics at Yale Divinity School and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Ms. Matthes has been married for nearly 20 years to a hedge fund manager, with whom she has 4 children. She teaches about the relationship between theology and money, according to Ms. Fleming.
Lisa Najarian: Ms. Najarian is married to Peter Najarian, the former NFL player and current contributor to CNBC's "Fast Money." (Aside from Ms. Fleming and Ms. Najarian, the show's stars have requested that their husbands not be named in the show.) She has 2 children, and is the owner of Loopie Doop's, a cookie bakery.
Tamara Hunter: An executive representative at the Swedish bank Handelsbanken, Ms. Hunter is married to an unemployed Wall Street financier, whom Ms. Fleming described as a "Spanish playboy." Her family owns homes in New York City, New Jersey and Spain. Yvonne Evelyn: Ms. Evelyn is "married to a successful Wall Streeter and is among the few black power couples" in finance, according to Ms. Fleming. 
Liz Flavin: Ms. Flavin "lost everything in the crash - her marriage, money, large home and sanity (briefly)," according to Ms. Fleming. She now lives with her 4 children in Fairfield, Conn., and is the co-founder of It's A Bum Wrap, a line of form-fitting cover-ups designed for wearing over leggings or yoga pants.
Marea Dumbauld: Ms. Dumbauld is married to a hedge fund manager who formerly worked with Thierry de la Villehuchet, the French money manager who invested with Bernard L. Madoff and committed suicide after Mr. Madoff was discovered to be orchestrating a Ponzi scheme.
Jennifer Walsh: Ms. Walsh lives in Greenwich, works as a real estate agent at Engel & Volkers, and is her husband's third wife, according to Ms. Fleming. Her appearance on the show will add "visual interest," Ms. Fleming said, as her job entails visiting some of the largest mansions in Connecticut.
Monique Malone: Ms. Malone, who is Australian, is married to a successful young Wall Street financier. "They are new to New York and are just starting their lives," Ms. Fleming said.
In addition to "The Real Wives of Wall Street," Ms. Fleming said that she is also pitching two other shows, including a "Suze Orman-type talk show" in which she herself would star.
When asked if her husband supported her television career, Ms. Fleming said that she had used the example of Bethenny Frankel, the "The Real Housewives of New York City" star who recently sold her Skinnygirl cocktail line to Fortune Brands for a reported $120 million, to convince him of the genre's benefits. 
"That helped a little," she said.

HEADLINE: Wall St., Prepared for the Worst, in Wait-and-See Mode

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Contingency plans are in place, positions established and cash sidelined. Now it's a matter of wait and see. 

 BODY:
Wall Street executives and traders will spend the weekend holding their breath as the debt impasse continues to suck all the oxygen from the room.
Contingency plans are in place, positions established and cash sidelined. Now it's a matter of wait-and-see, along with collective annoyance that the confrontation has dragged on this long. While few think the United States will default on its debt obligations, if 2008 has taught investors anything, it's to prepare for the worst.
Bank of America, at least, weeks ago commissioned a team to study the impact a default might have on customers and the broader economy. Now, with little else to do in the way of preparation, some officials are cancelling vacations and clinging to their BlackBerrys.
Other banks have dispatched executives to Washington to meet with members of Congress and regulators. 
And in New York, some of the biggest dealers in Treasury debt -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, among others -- spent Friday morning with officials at the Federal Reserve of New York, a somewhat unnerving echo of 2008 when bankers huddled there to discuss preventing a financial collapse. In contrast, Friday's meeting is part of a regular event at the Fed, planned some time ago. 
Investors are similarly sanguine about what's to come, having already marked their escape hatches in the event of a default. Again, 2008 has proven a cautionary tale for hedge funds and others worried about unforeseen market calamity.
Some hedge funds are going to cash, parking money on the sidelines in case things go haywire. At least one hedge fund is stockpiling cash in a series of F.D.I.C.-insured accounts.
Others are keeping cash with their prime brokers or have chosen alternative vehicles -- typically ones that avoid Treasuries -- just in case equities tank. Some investors, meanwhile, are switching around their portfolios to bet against the market, according to industry investors. 
Arvind Sanger, managing partner at the hedge fund GeoSphere Capital Management, said he had reduced his exposure to stocks in the last two days, fearing the market could plummet all at once should the debt issue remain unresolved. "That's something that I haven't seen yet, but I have 2008 fresh enough in my mind that I'm taking it down anyways," he said.
Many are sitting still, thinking that a default is unlikely and a rating agency downgrade of the United States will have only a short-lived impact. Wall Street's ho-hum response reflects the general feeling that ultimately a deal will be reached in Washington.
John Brynjolfsson, managing director at hedge fund Armored Wolf, said he expected little impact from a downgrade of the nation's credit rating and believed a default was highly unlikely. 
"There is no scenario I envision where the secretary of the Treasury would elect to stop making principal and interest payments on Treasuries," he said.

HEADLINE: Merck Plans More Job Cuts

BYLINE: DUFF WILSON


HIGHLIGHT: The pharmaceutical company is cutting up to 13 percent of its work force, or as many as 13,000 jobs, by 2015. 

 BODY:
Updated: Merck will cut up to 13,000 more jobs by 2015, amounting to about 13 percent of its work force, the pharmaceutical company announced Friday in its quarterly earnings report.
The cuts continue a decade-long trend in the pharmaceutical industry of slashing employment to maintain profits in the face of increasing competition from low-price generics.
The American drug industry has cut 299,036 jobs from Jan. 1, 2000, through June of this year, according to the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
Two weeks ago, the industry trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, warned that proposed cuts by President Obama to drug reimbursements in Medicare Part D would have "a devastating effect on American jobs." And medical device makers say they'll lose jobs unless Congress reverses a new 2.3 percent device tax imposed by the health care overhaul that takes effect in 2013. 
Some of the drug industry cuts reflect more outsourcing of research. And the cutbacks were spurred by the recession and a wave of mergers in the pharmaceutical industry, where job cuts are termed "synergies." Merck, based in Whitehouse, N.J., said it was meeting its target of cutting 20,000 jobs by the end of this year following its $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough in November 2009.
Seamus Fernandez, analyst with the health care investment bank Leerink Swann, estimated Merck's next round of job cuts should save about $1.3 billion by 2015, adding up to $2 a share to the value of the company.
"Merck is taking these difficult actions so that we can grow profitably and continue to deliver on our mission well into the future," Kenneth C. Frazier, president and chief executive, said in a statement. "The environment we operate in is changing rapidly and dramatically, and these steps will help us more efficiently serve customers and patients around the world."
 Mr. Frazier, in an earnings call with analysts, said Merck would cut 13 percent of its employees. The company release had said it would cut 12 percent to 13 percent of its base, as measured Dec. 31, 2009. Merck employed 100,000 people at that time, according to its annual report.
Here is the Challenger, Gray & Christmas breakdown of announced pharmaceutical job cuts sent to us on Friday:

HEADLINE: Economic Growth: Worse Than We Thought

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Six months ago, new figures showed the United States economy was larger than it had been before the recession. Never mind. 

 BODY:
The good news six months ago was that the United States economy, as measured by gross domestic product, had completely recovered all the losses it suffered in the recession.
Never mind.
The revised G.D.P. numbers put out by the government today make the recent history, which we thought was pretty poor, even worse.
Even with a small gain in real G.D.P. in the second quarter, the total size of the economy, $13.27 trillion in 2005 dollars, is $55.9 billion, or 0.4 percent, smaller than the revised number for the fourth quarter of 2007. The revisions indicate the economy was larger before the downturn than we had thought and is smaller now. 
We are now told that during the recession, the economy shrank by 5.1 percent. That is a full percentage point more than the 4.1 percent the old numbers showed. The recovery has also been slower. 
The changes are pretty much across the board in the G.D.P. numbers. Personal consumption expenditures fell by a full percentage point more than previously thought. Gross private investment - on such things as buildings and planes and computers - declined by 34.2 percent during the recession, 2.6 percentage points more than previous estimates.
A note to those who are complaining the federal government is too big: we are now told that nonmilitary spending contributed less than thought to the G.D.P., both during the recession and the recovery. The same is true of state and local government spending.
There is one area where the changes make history look better - corporate profits. They were a little lower than we thought in 2008 and significantly higher in 2009 and 2010.
It is small comfort, but the United States still looks relatively good in G.D.P. recovery. Following is the change in real G.D.P. from the prerecession peak to the most recent numbers available. For the United States and Britain, that is the second quarter of this year. For the others it is the first quarter.

Germany, +0.1%

HEADLINE: The Role of Government Spending

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Dwindling government spending was one of the factors holding back growth in the second quarter. 

 BODY:
As Congress continues to wrangle over a debt reduction bill that will inevitably cut government spending, Friday's estimates of second-quarter gross domestic product provided a sobering look at how a decline in public spending and investment can restrain growth.
G.D.P. grew at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department, well below consensus forecasts. First-quarter growth was revised down sharply to just 0.4 percent from an earlier estimate of 1.9 percent. The astonishingly slow growth rate from April through June was due in large part to sluggish consumer spending and an increase in imports, which subtract from growth numbers. But dwindling government spending also held back growth.
While federal government spending increased by 2.2 percent in the second quarter, that was all because of a jump in military spending. Excluding military, federal government spending and investment fell by 7.3 percent, a much larger fall than in the previous quarter. State and local government spending, which has been a crimp on growth throughout most of the official recovery, fell by 3.4 percent.
The figures will inevitably put further pressure on Congress as it tries to come up with a plan and figure out just how many billions of dollars can be shaved out of the government's budget.
"A weak economy will only make the tough decisions on the budget even more difficult," Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note Friday, "and the case for fiscal austerity in the near-term even weaker."
On the other hand, said Steve Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, policy makers have to decide whether to continue to pump up the economy through government spending or figure out a way to spur the private sector.
"We are probably at as important an intersection of policy and the economy as we were in late 2008 and early 2009 when the economy was collapsing," Mr. Blitz said.
Mr. Blitz favors reforming tax policy and aggressively pursuing foreign markets for American goods. But, he said, the only real prescription is to wait. With so many households still working off the debt accumulated during the boom years, he said, "that's just going to take time to work out, and you can't cheat the process."

HEADLINE: Grow Local and Eat Local, City Council Says

BYLINE: SYDNEY EMBER


HIGHLIGHT: The Council on Thursday passed a series of bills that would make it easier to build greenhouses and locate unused city land for gardens, as well as encouraging city facilities to use local food. 

 BODY:
In an effort to ramp up support for the consumption and production of local food, the City Council passed a package of bills on Thursday to facilitate the building of rooftop greenhouses and free up land for urban gardens. 
Under the legislation, a building's rooftop greenhouse would not be considered an additional story by the Department of Buildings, and would be exempt from height limits, if it occupies less than one-third of the rooftop. The city would also begin compiling a database of property that it owns or leases so that it can better identify unused spaces to be turned into urban gardens.
In addition, one of the bills would encourage city facilities like senior centers, jails and shelters to purchase more local food by requiring them to monitor where their food comes from. 
The bills now go to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's desk, where similar food initiatives have found success in the past. 
Councilwoman Gale Brewer, who sponsored the greenhouse bill, said that she hoped that having access to more greenhouses would promote healthier eating and spur economic development. She said she was impressed with the greenhouses that have cropped up on school rooftops across the city. "All that lettuce is eaten by the school kids; the actual cafeteria uses it," she said. "It's a very healthy thing to do, and good for the environment."
There are currently between 40 and 100 rooftop structures -- including solariums and sheds -- in the five boroughs, according to an estimate by Laurie Schoeman, the director of New York Sun Works, a nonprofit organization that promotes building greenhouses on school rooftops. 
With the bill's passage, she said she hopes that greenhouses will become a more regular part of the city's skyline -- and not just atop schools. "It's been a really touchstone moment for much of the green community," she said, "where can you go but up?
But not all the legislators -- even those eager for more local agriculture -- were warm to the idea of making it easier to build rooftop greenhouses.
Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn, who sponsored the bill to catalog city properties, voted against the bill encouraging rooftop greenhouses. He said that homeowners in his Brooklyn district often submit applications for greenhouses but instead use the rooftop area to construct extra bedrooms or other non-glass-walled additions, a trend that he fears will be encouraged by the new legislation. 
The Buildings Department in his borough, Mr. Fidler said, has trouble regulating these ersatz greenhouses and may have trouble controlling the new structures sprouting up as a result of the legislation.
"I love the idea of greenhouses," Mr. Fidler said. "I think that they would make a very interesting addition to the urban landscape." But, he added, "These folks are probably snickering as they continue to use their bedroom."

HEADLINE: UBS Hires Bank of America Executive

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Mike Stewart will be co-heard of global securities and head of securities in the Americas for UBS. 

 BODY:
UBS has recruited Mike Stewart, co-head of global equities at Bank of America, to become co-heard of global securities and head of securities in the Americas.
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, was hit hard during the financial crisis. Since then, it has been trying to build back its investment banking business amid an increased regulatory burden and a push to hold down compensation costs. A number of bankers and traders have left the bank for richer deals with rival banks. Still, UBS has made some prominent hires of its own.
Mr. Stewart, 42, joined Merrill Lynch from Charles Schwab in 2003. After the takeover of Merrill by Bank of America, he was named co-head of global equities.
At UBS, Mr. Stewart will be global equities co-head along with Francois Gouws, Yassine Bouhara, who was in that job, will become chief executive of emerging markets for the investment bank. Mr. Stewart will be based in New York and Stamford, Conn., and report to Carsten Kengeter, the chief of the investment bank.
In a memo to staff on Thursday night, Mr. Kengeter wrote, "Mike will join Francois in driving our growth strategy for Equities globally, and will lead our securities businesses in the Americas, in close collaboration with the respective management teams."

HEADLINE: Old Lesson for New, Tough-Talking Governors: 'It's the Economy ...'

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo and Chris Christie have lately been dominating their states' political cultures, but the economic struggles of New York and New Jersey won't yield to tough talk alone. 

 BODY:
To read their press clippings, Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo and Chris Christie appear headstrong brothers on a roll, dominating their political cultures and even blowing a tough-guy kiss or two at each other.
The press, so eager, yammers about Christie for President 2012 and Cuomo for President 2016. O.K., maybe, perhaps. But skepticism yaps like a barking dog in my ear, not the least because electoral prospects tend to rise and fall on economic performance.
And right now New York and New Jersey look sicklier than the Gubernatorial Bruise Brothers let on. The federal government released state unemployment rates this week and Governor Christie characteristically boasted that private-sector jobs had grown a smidgen. He was correct.
But New Jersey unemployment rate also grew, edging upward to 9.5 percent in June from 9.1 percent in January. That's exactly where the unemployment rate stood a year ago. And that perhaps understates the state's problems. 
New Jersey's civilian workforce shrank in the past six months, during which time more than 20,000 residents simply gave up looking for work.
In New York, the unemployment rate rose to 8 percent in June, from 7.8 in May. 
But since Mr. Cuomo took office in January, about 25,000 people have given up their job searches and left the labor force.
In New York City, many wealthy and upper-middle-class residents tend to congratulate themselves about the resilience of the high-end real estate market, not to mention the Provencal quality of the light on the Gowanus Canal at sunset.
But the remainder of the city, which is to say most of the population, sits on an isle of despond. The overall unemployment rate nicked upward last month to 8.8 percent from 8.6. The rate in the Bronx stands at 12 percent (the highest rate in the state) and Brooklyn at 9.5 percent. That is markedly worse than Buffalo and Rochester, two cities perennially seen as among the most battered corners in the state.
Governor Christie and, to a lesser extent, Governor Cuomo are converts to the Church of Smaller Government. They embrace the view that when public spending is restrained, jobs will flower. They have cut or capped taxes with zest. In New Jersey, the public payroll fell by 34,000 jobs since last year. Unfortunately, weekly earnings fell too. (Don't take my word for it; go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site.)
Mr. Cuomo has gone about trimming in a different fashion from Mr. Christie. He has negotiated tough, sensible deals with labor, instead of trying to revoke bargaining rights.
Still, their shared faith in the restorative power of public sector slashing could prove precarious. Goldman Sachs released an intriguing analysis this week. It concluded that "a significant part of the weakness in economic activity in 2011 is due to fiscal retrenchment."
Goldman suggests that layoffs and deep cuts in public services will grow more severe as the year goes along. (Its analysis did not take into account the militant, near nihilistic cuts being bandied about by Republicans in Washington.) And an even weaker public sector could act like a millstone tied to the leg of an already wounded economy.
"New Jersey is beginning to turn the corner," Mr. Christie said at a town hall meeting in Red Bank last month. "I hope you can feel it."
Hope is a wonderful emotion. But reality can prove a harsh mistress.

HEADLINE: Cars and Fuel: What Constructive Compromise Looks Like

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Obama unveils deal on vehicles, fuel and CO2. 

 BODY:
Environmentalists, politicians, corporate and union lobbyists and the auto industry have been embroiled for months in hashing out the details for cutting the fuel use and emissions of American cars and light trucks through 2025, and the result was on display in Washington today.
The new fuel economy standard will increase to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 (for fleets of cars and light trucks together), from the current 27.3 miles per gallon. Here's a White House report on the economic impact, and there's plenty of excellent coverage of the negotiations and the details of the plan by Jim Motavalli, The Times and many others. Ezra Klein has a particularly useful assessment of how this plan might work where rubber meets the road.
Advocates of all stripes are weighing in, of course. While the auto companies themselves have signed on, anti-regulatory groups foresee more death and costs on the highways.
Stephen Lacey of the Center for American Progress posted on the "technology re-opener" clause that could allow auto makers to challenge the standards after 2021, saying this could act as a disincentive to pushing technology hard now in hopes that a more sympathetic administration will cave later.
I see the overall merits of the deal far outweighing that potential downside. The administration's plan basically establishes that improving vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions is the new normal.
As with other important long-term issues, including boosting America's investment in basic research and incentives for energy innovation, it is trajectories that matter far more than specific targets.
This is particularly true in areas like transportation and energy where near-term actions focused on efficiency are implicitly just step one, and must be linked to a sustained, aggressive and motivated effort to pursue, and then exploit, scientific and technical breakthroughs.
In the climate debate, that's why persistent calls for those who care about stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases to pick a number, whether 350.org's favorite or Joe Romm's, are in my view a waste of time.
In the fight over climate legislation, environmentalists' early rejection of a "safety valve" looks kind of lamentable in retrospect.
President Obama chalks up a substantial victory with this accomplishment on vehicles, fuel and pollution.
Now if only he can find a way to do that with the parties endangering America's economy with debt-ceiling brinkmanship.
Unfortunately, sidelining an ideology-driven minority was a lot easier in transportation negotiations than it will be in the fight over the budget in the run-up to a presidential election.

HEADLINE: Automakers React to 54.5 M.P.G.

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Brands issued statements shortly after President Obama announced the next round of fuel economy standards on Friday. 

 BODY:
After months of hand-wringing by industry lobbies and environmental groups, President Obama announced the new round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, known as CAFE, on Friday in Washington. The standards call for a 5 percent annual increase in fuel economy for passenger cars from 2017 to 2025, culminating in a mandated 54.5 miles per gallon.
Creating the new CAFE round involved the participation of major car manufacturers in the United States, a process that, while fraught at times, ended with a near-unanimous, if somewhat meek, embrace of the tough new standards.
As Bill Vlasic noted in The Times on Thursday, when the 54.5 m.p.g. standard first was confirmed:While the American carmakers, as well as their Asian rivals, once argued against even minimal increases in government fuel rules, they are acquiescing without protest to an increase to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, from the current 27 miles per gallon.Toyota was one of the first brands out of the gates Friday morning with an official statement, in which James Lentz, the president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, called the standards "very ambitious," but that the brand would work "with the administration and other stakeholders to ensure that we realize our shared environmental goals in the most economically-effective and consumer-friendly ways possible."
Mr. Lentz attended Friday's announcement, as did other executives of major brands, including Daniel F. Akerson of General Motors, Alan Mulally of Ford, Sergio Marchionne of Chrysler and Fiat, and John Krafcik of Hyundai Motor America.
According to David Shepardson at The Detroit News, Mr. Krafcik said that his brand's fleet could have met a much tougher standard.
Hyundai US chief John Krafcik tells @detnews it could face a fleetwide CAFE requirement of 60 mpg because of its mostly passenger car fleetFri Jul 29 14:23:31 via webDavid Shepardsondavidshepardson
General Motors qualified that it agreed "in principle" with the new standards, but at least formally expressed no reservations about the regulatory measure.
Not in attendance was Jonathan Browning, the president and chief executive of Volkswagen of America, and a statement released by the brand did much to explain his absence:Volkswagen does not endorse the proposal under discussion. It places an unfairly high burden on passenger cars, while allowing special compliance flexibility for heavier light trucks.Volkswagen argued that the standards did not explicitly address the efficiency benefits of clean-diesel technology, in which the brand is heavily invested.
Though the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobby group representing the 12 largest automakers operating in the United States, had yet to issue a statement on behalf of its somewhat fractious membership, the Union of Concerned Scientistspraised the measure, saying that it would "unleash innovation" in the auto industry.
But the organization's praise carried qualifications. Both it and many environmental groups warn that loopholes in the completed rule could be exploited to undermine the standards' efficacy.

HEADLINE: Ranking the Presidents by G.D.P.

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: George W. Bush and Barack Obama have seen the slowest economic growth rates of any post-Truman presidency, and today's G.D.P. data makes the figures for their terms even lower. 

 BODY:
The revised G.D.P. numbers damage the economic growth numbers for Obama and the George W. Bush administrations. 
There is an element of unfairness in attributing economic growth to a president, of course. The government has limited influence on the economy, and the president can have limited influence on government policy, as anyone watching the current debate in Washington has surely noticed. Normal economic cycles mean that growth is likely to be less impressive for a president who enters office at the end of a boom, as George W. Bush did, and better for one who enters when growth is weak, as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan did. If normal cyclical factors return, and President Obama has a second term, his record should end up much better than it currently appears. If he loses, he could be like Gerald Ford, who also took office during a deep recession. 
With all those caveats, here are the annualized growth rates for real G.D.P. for every president who took office after the end of World War II.
Each president is given credit for growth through the quarter before he left office. For those who left at the end of their terms, that would be the fourth quarter of the election year. For Richard M. Nixon, who resigned during the third quarter of 1974, it is through the second quarter of that year.
Also shown are the figures for Presidents Bush and Obama that would have appeared had the numbers been calculated before today's announcement of second quarter data and revisions to earlier numbers. 
They are listed in reverse order of growth.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls for Bipartisan Solution on Debt

BYLINE: MICHAEL D.SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama urged lawmakers to find a way to resolve their differences and compromise as the clock ticks toward the possibility of a default if the nation's debt ceiling is not raised by Tuesday. 

 BODY:
President Obama urged deadlocked lawmakers on Friday morning to find a way to resolve their differences and compromise as the clock ticks toward the possibility of a default if the nation's debt ceiling is not raised by Tuesday.
"What's clear now is that any solution to avoid default must be bipartisan," Mr. Obama said. "It must have the support of both parties that were sent here to represent the American people, not just one faction."
"I urge Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to find common ground," he added in brief remarks in the Diplomatic Reception Room.
Mr. Obama has been mostly on the sidelines for days as John A. Boehner, the House speaker, has been engaged in a battle with conservative freshmen in his own party. House Republicans were meeting even as Mr. Obama began his remarks.
But the White House is eager to get action moving in some way on Capitol Hill as the dangers of missing the debt ceiling deadline are increasingly clear. The government reported that the economy's growth had slowed considerably in the second quarter, increasing at a rate of only 1.3 percent.
Mr. Obama urged Republicans in the House and Senate to abandon a bill that "does not solve the problem" and has no chance of passage in the Senate.
"There are a lot of crises in the world that we can't always predict or avoid," he said. "This isn't one of those crises."
Mr. Obama said that his request to the American people on Monday to call their members of Congress had helped, and he urged them to "keep it up."
"If you want to see a bipartisan compromise," he said, "make a phone call, send an e-mail, tweet. Keep the pressure on Washington, and we can get past this."
He also said that his administration would work with members of Congress to find a solution. He said that he had confidence that a solution would be found despite "all the intrigue and all the drama that's taking place on Capitol Hill right now."
But, he added, "we are now running out of time."

HEADLINE: Reid Says He Will Move Ahead With His Bill

BYLINE: MICHAEL D.SHEAR and ROBERT PEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said he would move ahead today with a Democratic plan to increase the debt limit. 

 BODY:
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said he would move ahead today with a Democratic plan to increase the debt limit, saying he could no longer wait for the House Republicans to complete their version.
But Mr. Reid warned that even by starting the process today, there is not enough time to complete his legislation before the debt-ceiling deadline on Tuesday without getting support from Republican senators.
"Will Republicans break away from the shrill voice of the Tea Party and return to the party of Ronald Reagan?" Mr. Reid said during remarks from the floor of the Senate on Friday morning.
"The last train is leaving the station,'' Mr. Reid said, adding, "We cannot wait for the House any longer. We have hours to act. That's why by the end of today I must take action on the Senate compromise legislation.''
Mr. Reid said that his legislation is not the preferred option for Democrats, but he urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to work with him on Friday to find ways to modify the bill in order to be able to support it.
"I hope my friend, Sen. McConnell, will come to me by the end of the day and indicate what constructive ideas he has to move the process along," Mr. Reid said. "My door is open. I will listen to any idea to get this done in a way that prevents a default and a dangerous downgrade to America's credit rating."
In remarks immediately after Mr. Reid spoke, Mr. McConnell blamed Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid for sitting on the sidelines as House Republicans worked toward a solution to the debt crisis.
"I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they take their responsibilities for governing a little bit more seriously," Mr. McConnell said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Dangle Saturday Night Debt Fever

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Senate Democrats threatened an all-night battle on the Senate floor that could go through the wee hours of Sunday morning unless Republicans begin negotiating on a bipartisan plan to raise the debt ceiling. 

 BODY:
Get ready for Mr. Smith meets the debt ceiling.
Senate Democrats said Friday that they are prepared for an all-night battle on the Senate floor that could go through the wee hours of Sunday morning unless Republicans begin negotiating on a bipartisan plan to raise the debt ceiling.
With action still uncertain in the House, Senate leaders described a bare-knuckled plan that would culminate in a post-midnight Saturday vote on the debt ceiling plan developed by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. 
"That would be the vote to avoid default," Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York declared to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill Friday morning.
If Republicans filibuster that vote, Democrats say they are prepared to repeatedly require Republicans to object to the bill's passage, keeping them in their seats for hours and creating a middle-of-the-night legislative spectacle for the cameras.
"It's hard to imagine the Senate Republicans would actually filibuster the nation into default," Mr. Schumer said.
The last-ditch strategy is designed to increase pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to reach a deal with Democrats by the end of the day on Friday to avoid the political danger of being seen as blocking the only remaining solution to the debt crisis.
It's unclear whether the strategy will work. In remarks from the Senate floor Friday morning, Mr. McConnell seemed defiant, blaming Democrats for inaction while the House Republicans worked this week toward their plan.
"Rather than working these last few days towards a solution to this crisis the way the Republican majority in the House has, the Democratic majority here in the Senate has been wasting precious time rounding up 'no' votes to keep this crisis alive," Mr. McConnell said. "Rather than being responsible and doing their duty and come up with a bill that can pass, they've been busy signing people up for the 'not good enough' caucus and ginning up opposition to everything else. "

HEADLINE: House Passes Short-Term Debt Ceiling Increase

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The vote was 218-210, leaving House Speaker John A. Boehner with 22 Republicans who were unwilling to support his efforts to get a bill approved. 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives on Friday approved a plan for a short-term increase in the debt ceiling and cuts in spending, ending a week of intense fighting among Republicans and shifting the end game of the debate to the Senate.
The vote was 218-210, leaving House Speaker John A. Boehner with 22 Republicans who were unwilling to support his efforts to get a bill approved.
Urging passage for the bill, an emotional Mr. Boehner angrily accused President Obama and his Democratic allies of negotiating in bad faith for weeks and called the bill the only way to "end this crisis now."
"All they would do was criticize what I put out there," Mr. Boehner said, his voice rising during a rare appearance on the floor. "I stuck my neck out a mile to get an agreement with the president of the United States. I stuck my neck out a mile. I put revenues on the table."
He added: "A lot of people in this town can never say yes."
Democrats in the House sought to embarrass the Republican majority by amending Mr. Boehner's legislation to require that any deficit reduction be done first by closing tax subsidies for oil companies and corporate jet owners. The amendment was quickly rejected by the Republican majority.
"We face a self-inflicted crisis and the majority's solution is no solution at all," Representative Louise Slaughter of New York said during debate before the bill passed.
Even as it passed, the Democrat-controlled Senate prepared to kill the legislation within hours. Earlier on Friday, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called Mr. Boehner's legislation an "absurd, absurd proposition."
Mr. Boehner earned raucous applause from his Republican conference despite days of resistance from some of his most conservative members tied his legislative strategy in knots. Mr. Boehner won over enough opponents by amending his legislation to require passage of a balanced budget amendment before the debt ceiling could be increased next year.
In his remarks, Mr. Boehner called the measure imperfect, but accused Mr. Obama and the Democrats in the Senate of failing to produce a competing plan to address the debt crisis.
"To the American people, I would say: we tried our level best," Mr. Boehner said. "We have tried to do our best for our country, but some people still say no."
An earlier version of this post misstated the number of Republicans who voted against Mr. Boehner's bill. The total number of Republican dissenters was 22, not 20.

HEADLINE: Boehner's Last Word as Debate Crosses Capitol

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In an op-ed published moments after the House approved his debt ceiling bill, the speaker argued that the measure is a rare exception to the "arrogance of Washington." 

 BODY:
Just moments after House Speaker John A. Boehner secured passage of his modified debt ceiling legislation, an op-ed he penned appeared on the website of the conservative National Review Online.
Titled "End This Crisis," Mr. Boehner argued in the article that approval of the bill by the House is a rare exception to what he called the "arrogance of Washington."
"At moments like this, the arrogance of Washington is most evident not in its actions, but in its inaction," he writes. "In the face of a debt explosion that threatens the future of our country, the Senate has not passed a budget in more than 800 days."
Mr. Boehner has commanded center stage in the debt ceiling drama for the past week as he struggled to put down what amounted to a rebellion among his most conservative members, especially those who were just elected in 2010.
But now, as the debate shifts to the Senate this weekend, Mr. Boehner is left to argue from the sidelines that the Senate should abandon its efforts to craft its own bill and just pass what the House has given them.
"The quickest way for Congress to eliminate the possibility of default and ease the growing turmoil in our economy is for the Senate to take up the House-passed bill and send it to the president today," he wrote.
That is almost certain not to happen. Democrats have already promised a quick death for the legislation that Mr. Boehner labored on all week.
And the speaker still faces the likelihood of further complications ahead. If the Senate passes debt ceiling legislation with Republican support, it will come back to Mr. Boehner, who will have to decide whether -- and how -- to try and pass it.
One likely possibility is that Mr. Boehner would need to assemble a coalition of Democrats and Republicans in the House to pass whatever compromise is reached in the Senate.
That would mean another wrenching vote that could place the Speaker at odds once again with the most conservative elements of his conference. After the week he's been through, he probably doesn't relish that idea.
"For the sake of our country, and the sake of our economy, the House has passed a responsible bill that can pass the Senate," he wrote. "Now it's time for our colleagues in the Senate to pass it, send it to the president, and bring this crisis to an end."

HEADLINE: Merck Says It Will Cut An Additional 13,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Merck will cut about 13,000 jobs by the end of 2015, in addition to the 20,000 jobs it has shed since a merger in 2009, the pharmaceutical company announced Friday in its quarterly earnings report.
The cutbacks continue a decade-long trend in the pharmaceutical industry of cutting employment to maintain profits in the face of increasing competition from low-price generics.
''The pharma industry is starting look a lot like the auto industry,'' said Erik Gordon, a pharmaceutical analyst and clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. 
About 35 to 40 percent of Merck's job reductions will be made in the United States, said David Caouette, a company spokesman. At the same time, some jobs will be added in emerging markets like China.
The American drug industry has trimmed 299,036 jobs from Jan. 1, 2000 through June of this year, according to the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
The last two years showed the most job losses on record, with announced cuts of 53,636 in 2010 and 61,109 in 2009, the firm reported. That made pharmaceutical companies one of the biggest contributors to unemployment during the recession. This year, American drug makers have reported plans to cut 4,771 jobs.
The budget arguments in Washington are raising concern about future industry shifts, too, as lawmakers try to squeeze savings and revenue from the drug companies.
Two weeks ago, the industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America warned that proposed cuts by President Obama to drug reimbursements in Medicare Part D would have ''a devastating effect on American jobs.''
And medical device makers say they will cut jobs unless Congress reverses a new 2.3 percent device tax imposed by the health care overhaul that takes effect in 2013.
The employment reductions have followed a wave of company mergers producing overlapping responsibilities, as well as more outsourcing of research and trimming of sales forces.
Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said it was meeting its target of cutting 20,000 jobs by the end of this year after its $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough in November 2009. From that merger through 2015, the company said, restructuring will save more than $4 billion a year in combined operational costs.
''The environment we operate in is changing rapidly and dramatically, and these steps will help us more efficiently serve customers and patients around the world,'' Kenneth C. Frazier, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Mr. Frazier, in an earnings call with analysts, said Merck would cut 13 percent of its employees, the top end of an estimate in the statement saying 12 to 13 percent. The jobs are cut from a base as measured Dec. 31, 2009, the statement said, a time that Merck employed 100,000 people, according to its annual report. The company now employs 91,000.
The new round of cuts, Mr. Frazier said in the analyst call, would ''come disproportionately from the elimination of nonrevenue-generating positions such as administrative and headquarters personnel, consolidation of office facilities and ongoing sale or closure of manufacturing sites, including Animal Health facilities.''
Jami Rubin, analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the cuts were ''very good news'' for investors. Merck announced second-quarter sales of $12.1 billion, up 7 percent over last year's quarter, and profits of $2.9 billion, up 9 percent, largely in line with estimates. Merck stock fell by more than 2 percent on Friday, closing at $34.13 amid a market sell-off caused by disappointing economic and political news from Washington.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Enjoy Park Greenery, City Says, but Not as Salad

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Maybe it is the spiraling cost of food in a tough economy or the logical next step in the movement to eat locally. Whatever the reason, New Yorkers are increasingly fanning out across the city's parks to hunt and gather edible wild plants, like mushrooms, American ginger and elderberries.
Now parks officials want them to stop. New York's public lands are not a communal pantry, they say. In recent months, the city has stepped up training of park rangers and enforcement-patrol officers, directing them to keep an eye out for foragers and chase them off.
''If people decide that they want to make their salads out of our plants, then we're not going to have any chipmunks,'' said Maria Hernandez, director of horticulture for the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit group that manages Central Park. 
Plants are not the only things people are taking. In Prospect Park in Brooklyn last week, park rangers issued four summonses to two people for illegal fishing. Although officials say such poaching is not widespread, park advocates say taking fish and turtles for food is not uncommon, and some have reported evidence of traps designed to snare wildfowl.
Foraging used to be a quirky niche, filled most notably by ''Wildman'' Steve Brill, who for years has led foraging tours in the Northeast, including in Central Park. (He now sells a foraging app, too.) But foragers today are an eclectic bunch, including downtown hipsters, recent immigrants, vegans and people who do not believe in paying for food.
Even those who would never dream of plucking sassafras during a walk in the park can read about it. The magazine Edible Manhattan has an ''Urban Forager'' column (as does The New York Times's City Room blog). And the current issue of Martha Stewart Living features a colorful spread about foraging on Ms. Stewart's property in Maine -- but at least all those plants belong to her.
While it has long been against the rules to collect or destroy plants in the city's parks, with potential fines of $250, the city has preferred education to enforcement. ''It's listed in the prohibited uses of the parks, and the simple reason is that if everyone went out and collected whatever it is -- a blackberry or wildflower -- the parks couldn't sustain that,'' said Sarah Aucoin, director of urban park rangers for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Officials have not gone as far as posting signs in Central Park that foraging is prohibited, for fear they would serve as arrows pointing to the most delectable areas. Ms. Hernandez of the park conservancy would take a reporter on a tour of edible plants only on the condition that their locations not be revealed.
For their part, regular foragers -- especially those who write and teach about the practice -- say that they are sensitive to the environment and that they focus on renewable items like leaves and berries. Besides, they say, much of their quarry comes from invasive species that squeeze out native plants.
''You're almost doing the ecosystem in the park a favor by harvesting them,'' said Leda Meredith, who wrote ''The Locavore's Handbook: The Busy Person's Guide to Eating Local on a Budget,'' which includes a chapter on foraging. Ms. Meredith, who leads tours in Prospect Park, says 70 percent of the plants she collects are nonnative and invasive.
''Japanese knotweed is very invasive, and it's in season in April,'' she said. It can be used like rhubarb, she added.
Marie Viljoen, a garden designer who writes the foraging column for Edible Manhattan, argued that parks officials were overstating the problem. ''It's a little alarmist to think that a park is going to be mowed down like a herd of deer went through,'' she said.
Parks officials counter that they are more worried about the novices and say that certain plants, like American ginger and ramps, are especially vulnerable since they are yanked out, root and all. Park managers point out, too, that there are programs to weed out invasive plants.
Then there is the danger of poisonous and toxic plants. ''Not everyone knows how to use these herbs and spices,'' Ms. Hernandez said.
Some natural areas outside New York City accommodate foragers. Sandy Hook in New Jersey, which is part of the federal Gateway National Recreation Area, limits the harvesting of beach plum fruit, berries and mushrooms to ''one quart container per person, per day,'' said John Harlan Warren, a spokesman for the recreation area.
In New York's state parks, the attitude seems more relaxed as well. ''It's illegal, but the occasional blueberry picker is not hauled away in handcuffs,'' said Tom Alworth, deputy commissioner for natural resources for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
Aside from issuing summonses, the city has not taken any recent legal action. It did go after Mr. Brill for foraging in Central Park once before: he was arrested in the mid-1980s, and it turned into a public relations debacle for the parks department. The charges were later dropped.
After appearing on television talk shows and receiving sympathetic news coverage, Mr. Brill was actually hired by the department as a naturalist and led foraging tours for a few years. He has since continued his tours privately, and says he is tolerated by Central Park's rangers. ''They usually wave at me,'' he said.
Even some fellow foragers look askance at Mr. Brill. One of his tours in 2009 attracted 78 people, an all-time high. ''I see him as the vaudeville showman of foraging,'' Ms. Viljoen said. ''I get nervous when I see that many people storming the park.''
Just what gets taken can vary from park to park, often depending on the ethnic makeup of the surrounding neighborhood.
''There are groups going around and collecting things that they recognize from their home countries,'' said Gary Lincoff, an instructor at the New York Botanical Garden, who admitted foraging in the parks for juneberries. ''The Chinese gather gingko, and I've talked to Koreans who are gathering white wood aster.''
Beverly McDermott, director of Friends of Kissena Park in Flushing, Queens, has confronted foragers directly when she has seen them hauling away everything from plants to top soil to turtles. A garden in the 242-acre park that Mrs. McDermott helped revive a decade ago has been repeatedly pillaged, with herbs, flowers and a whole weeping cherry tree disappearing.
''I have caught them leaving the park with coolers full of fish and turtles,'' she said. ''You need signs throughout the park. I find the rangers to be totally useless. They're walking around like Boy Scouts.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Is Said To Have Irked Exiting Leader Of the M.T.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Jay H. Walder, chairman of the embattled Metropolitan Transportation Authority, traveled to Albany earlier this year seeking help for a transit system in peril. Mr. Walder, a kid from Queens who rose to the top of his field and harbored big ambitions for his state, was not unlike the man he had hoped to see: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
And he did see him. For a moment.
Mr. Walder was meeting the governor's staff at the Capitol when Mr. Cuomo walked in. The governor greeted Mr. Walder, then promptly turned his attention to his director of state operations, Howard Glaser, with whom he spoke for several moments before departing, said two people familiar with the meeting. 
Mr. Cuomo and the man in charge of the biggest mass transit system in the nation did not meet in person again, suggesting a lack of interest by Mr. Cuomo that irked and discouraged Mr. Walder, several officials said.
Mr. Walder announced last week that he would leave his $350,000-a-year post to take the helm of a transit firm in Hong Kong. He cited a ''compelling offer'' he could not turn down, but interviews with colleagues, friends and transportation observers point to a constellation of obstacles, the authority's money troubles and political frustrations that laid the groundwork for his decision to quit, less than two years into his six-year term.
Among those problems were indifferent politicians unwilling to help with budget difficulties; an unsympathetic public that expressed its vitriol in tart Facebook pages and screamed at meetings; and Mr. Walder's own unhappiness with a governor who paid the agency little mind, even as its finances significantly worsened.
Several sources interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid straining relationships with Mr. Cuomo or Mr. Walder.
The resignation caught the governor and his team by surprise, according to two people with close ties to the administration.
Mr. Cuomo had no plans to replace Mr. Walder, nor a list of candidates to do so, these people said. And the future of New York's cash-poor transit system, depended on by millions of riders a day, has now fallen directly to Mr. Cuomo, who must pick a successor.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Josh Vlasto, said that the governor was pleased with the chairman's efforts to trim the agency's budget and that Mr. Cuomo would seek out a successor to ''continue the reform and change started by Jay Walder.''
Those close to Mr. Walder, a man of enormous ambition and self-confidence who is credited with revolutionizing the London transit system, say the Hong Kong job was especially alluring: he will be paid a much higher salary and direct the fortunes of a multinational corporation that oversees rail, real estate and economic development interests all around the world.
In New York, he faced the opposite: a creaking system struggling to pay its bills, a capital investment program held together with the fiscal equivalent of spit and glue.
The payoff, if Mr. Walder were lucky, would be the installation of technology like computerized fare cards, a feature that has been commonplace in Hong Kong since 1997.
''He's a guy who wants to invest in the future, who wants to lead, and not backpedal,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, who has spoken frequently with Mr. Walder during his tenure.
''This was looking more and more like a job that was going to be very frustrating to somebody who wants to invest and build and create a state-of-the-art 21st-century transit system,'' she said.
Had Mr. Walder stuck it out, he would have faced tense negotiations with labor unions, members of which have been known to protest loudly outside his home. And he would have had to cope with a reluctant State Legislature, and the possibility of another anger-provoking fare increase, as he tried to secure $9 billion in financing for the repairs, maintenance and major projects like the Second Avenue subway.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on his Friday radio show, described Mr. Walder as ''just beside himself'' because of the state's unwillingness to provide more financial support.
For his part, Mr. Walder has not publicly delved into the reasons for his departure. ''I received a compelling offer, both in terms of professional responsibilities and challenges, and for my family,'' he wrote in an e-mail, declining to expand. ''I wouldn't read more into it than that.''
But in a news conference this week, he deflected questions on whether he had directly spoken to Mr. Cuomo about finding more financial support for the system.
Asked about his work with Mr. Cuomo, he talked about a trip he took to Washington with Lt. Gov. Robert J. Duffy, a collaboration he described as ''unprecedented.'' (Mr. Vlasto said the governor and chairman had spoken on the telephone several times.)
Asked this week if he believed his resignation was ill timed, Mr. Walder demurred. ''The timing is the timing,'' he said.
For Mr. Cuomo, however, the timing could not be worse. The governor began his term with this best-of-both-worlds situation: If Mr. Walder ran into problems, the governor could easily blame his predecessor for the appointment. And if the transportation authority thrived, Mr. Cuomo could take credit.
Now, Mr. Cuomo must find someone willing to take on the Sisyphean task of running a troubled agency at a troubled time. Transit experts say the number of qualified candidates is limited. Officials in the transportation industry said they did not fault Mr. Walder for making a reasoned decision, saying the outlook for transit and infrastructure in New York is far grimmer than its competitor cities around the world.
Lee Harris Pomeroy, an architect who frequently works in the New York subway, said he helped design an entire metro system in Kolkata, India, in less time than it has taken to complete renovations of the Bleecker Street subway station in Manhattan and the 180th Street station in the Bronx. In China, he said, these projects can move even faster.
''It is more exciting to design a whole new nine-mile long metro system that reaches below 14 million people who will embrace a whole new modern world through an underground railroad,'' Mr. Pomeroy said. ''We can't quite do this in New York.''
In London, Mr. Walder helped the city win the 2012 Summer Olympics, created a computerized fare card system and put into effect a plan to charge motorists to drive in parts of the city. But his innovation there was supported by a strong-willed mayor who did not have to answer to outside political groups.
''When Jay was working in London, Jay had the total confidence of the mayor,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, a longtime friend who studies transportation at the City University of New York.
In New York, Mr. Paaswell said, ''the mayor and the governor have a very complex platform, and transportation is just one of many issues; it doesn't really stand out.''
As for Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Paaswell said transportation ''hasn't been on his radar'' because of priorities like legislative fights over the budget and same-sex marriage.
Mr. Cuomo may have gotten what he wished for. At the sole debate in the governor's race last fall, he teed off on the transportation authority, repeating a long-discredited canard about the agency's ''two sets of books'' and complaining that ''no one is in charge of the M.T.A.''
''Put the governor in charge,'' Mr. Cuomo said at the time. ''If it does not work, it should be up to the governor, and everyone should know.''

HEADLINE: On the Party Circuit, And Upsetting the Party

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON

 BODY:
BEIJING
IN the midst of an unusually sweeping government campaign against artistic dissent, he has published a novel that predicts an Orwellian future for China in just two years. The novel, needless to say, has been banned. Imported copies have been seized at the border. Booksellers who manage to secure some copies for sale have been shut down.
And yet Chan Koonchung is not packing his bags to return to his native Hong Kong. Instead, he is hunkered down for the long haul, convinced that Beijing is the only place in China worth living.
''You never use the word 'lovely' to describe Beijing,'' Mr. Chan said in an upscale restaurant not far from his high-end apartment. ''But I need to be in Beijing because of the people.'' 
For much of his career, that would have meant the beautiful people.
The 59-year-old Mr. Chan is best known for founding a lifestyle magazine in Hong Kong, City Magazine, and starting up a ''lite fare'' cable television station in Taiwan, Super TV, which he sold to Sony Entertainment in the 1990s. More recently, he has made a name for himself writing cultural essays on Chinese cities.
''He's very much circulating on the party circuit,'' said Huang Hung, a Beijing publisher and social commentator. ''That's why this work comes as a little bit of a surprise, but it's a terribly nice surprise.''
The work is a dystopian novel of China in the near future. After the world's second financial crisis in 2013, the government clings to power only after it sends troops into the streets for a month of bloody killing. Finally, the government laces the water with a chemical that makes people feel happy and eager to spend money.
With China's consumers finally unleashed from their age-old habit of saving, the country's economy booms and it leaps past the United States and other Western countries. A golden age dawns.
Mostly, though, it is a book about living in an authoritarian state. In what is probably the most damning part of the novel, the month of killing is forgotten, not through drugs but an act of collective amnesia. The book's nominal heroes, the country's Westernized elite, finally figure out what has happened (by kidnapping a Politburo member and forcing him to tell all). But they end up agreeing with the government's measures.
''This is one of the major untalked-about issues,'' said Ms. Hung, who has championed the book on her popular microblog. ''They want to drink the Chinese government's Kool-Aid.''
The book is known in Chinese as ''Shengshi Zhongguo 2013,'' which can be translated as ''China's Golden Age 2013.'' It has just been published in the United Kingdom as ''The Fat Years'' and is due out in the United States early next year.
Mr. Chan says forgetfulness is a fact of life in China; the government pushes certain historical memories to legitimize its rule, but quashes other traumas. ''We're still talking about the Opium War, but we forgot about the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution,'' he said.
He decided to write the novel in 2008, when he noticed a shift among the elite. China's rise seemed to be crowned by Beijing hosting the Olympics, while the West's problems, which many in China now view as a permanent decline, were highlighted by the financial crisis. ''A lot of people realized that China did something right and they want to express it,'' Mr. Chan said.
He wrote the book in 2009 and it was published in Hong Kong and Taiwan at the end of that year. Chinese publishers declined to publish it. ''Some were interested and I told them to read it first. They did and never came back,'' he said.
But by 2010 it was circulating on the Internet, something like the old samizdat system of passing along bootleg copies in the Soviet Union. China uses a simplified writing system compared to the traditional system used in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but some people retyped the book in simplified form.
Mr. Chan said he noticed that these copies had many errors. So he fixed them and made his version available online, essentially pirating his own book. Over the past year, it has become a sensation, probably the most widely discussed book in China's big cities.
BUT it is very much an underground phenomenon. After banning its import and taking steps to punish book dealers who try to sell it, the authorities have now blocked all sites that offer free downloads of the book, including Mr. Chan's authorized site.
Mr. Chan, however, remains a convinced Beijingophile, a rarity for people from Hong Kong, the Cantonese-speaking former British colony that remains wealthier and freer than the mainland. ''Coming from Hong Kong, I had a Shanghai complex: Shanghai movies, Shanghai fashion,'' he said. He also loved living in Taipei.
He quickly realized, however, that if he wanted to be in touch with what was going on in China he had to be in Beijing. ''At dinner people talk about serious things,'' Mr. Chan said. ''They want to make sense of China.''
Mr. Chan has become a fixture of Beijing's social scene. He is tall and thin, his shoulder-length hair and chic rectangular glasses making him look younger than his 59 years. He dresses ascetically but with flair: tight trousers, a dress shirt buttoned up and a narrow-lapelled jacket. The look is almost designed to say: I am not from here.
But he does fit into the city rather well. By Hong Kong standards, Mr. Chan's Mandarin Chinese is remarkably good, something he attributes to having been born in the coastal city of Ningbo, even if he did move to Hong Kong when he was just 4 years old.
He still travels widely abroad, but is intensely interested in the thick political gossip that swirls through China. ''I like to know what's going on, or at least what people think is going on,'' he said.
That led him to start an e-mail discussion group on civil society in China that helps him stay in touch with people involved in the law and protecting the environment, among other fields that often attract scrutiny from the authorities. All this means he wants to stay in the capital, despite the risks.
OVER the past few months, the artist Ai Weiwei has been silenced after being arrested and then placed under house arrest. The author Liao Yiwu has fled into exile, declaring it too risky to continue publishing his books on society's marginal figures.
Mr. Chan, however, says he does not feel at risk. He has a Hong Kong passport, which he thinks might help. Against many predictions, China has treated Hong Kong leniently since taking it over in 1997 and tolerates dissent there that never would be allowed in the rest of the country. Or it could be that he simply has not yet gotten on a blacklist. Once on, he says, and every crackdown results in harassment or detention.
''In China, whether you're a dissident or not is up to the state,'' he said. ''You are on the receiving end; it is imposed on you. But I've never been labeled a dissident.''
In any case, he says being a dissident does not mean being the outlier of times past. ''Their values are shared by many people now. More people now will say 'I have rights.' That wouldn't have happened 30 years ago.''
Mr. Chan is somewhat fatalistic about the prospects for trouble. ''It is like playing with a cat. You never know when its claws will come out.''
So for now, he says, he remains committed to Beijing and writing a new novel. The source of his material? ''I go to a lot of dinners.''

HEADLINE: New York Judges Deserve a Raise

 BODY:
New York State's 1,300 judges have not had a raise or even a cost-of-living adjustment for a dozen years. Their salaries now lag behind the pay of federal judges, senior assistant district attorneys and Legal Aid lawyers in New York City. In many instances, judges even earn less than their own law clerks whose salaries are set by union collective bargaining. Judges on the State Supreme Court, New York's main trial court, earn $136,700 -- $37,300 less than comparable federal judges. 
When a state commission charged with setting judges' pay heard testimony last week, a procession of lawyers and judges warned that the low salaries were making it harder to persuade highly qualified lawyers to seek judgeships and to stay on the bench. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's budget director, Robert Megna, insisted that New York couldn't afford a large catch-up raise and that any increase would require cuts elsewhere.
These are undeniably tough times. But a well-functioning court system is essential for ensuring justice and protecting the state's business climate. Because of recent budget cuts, there are already increased delays in trying civil cases and arraigning criminal defendants.
The commission will report its recommendations by the end of August and they will become law unless the Legislature votes to amend or overturn them and the governor signs the bill.
The salaries for New York's judges must be raised. But given the current economy, the $190,000-to-$220,000 range proposed by court administrators seems too high. Restoring parity with federal judges, with regular cost-of-living increases, is reasonable. That would cost the state an additional $49 million next year. That is not a small sum, but it is a sound investment in the justice system.

HEADLINE: No Little League World Series for Ugandan Team

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
For nearly two weeks, the players of the Rev. John Foundation Little League team from Kampala, Uganda, believed they were headed to Williamsport, Pa., for the Little League World Series. The team of 11- to 13-year-olds, which plays with donated equipment, was the first African team to advance that far.
But their fairy tale story ran smack into United States immigration red tape. The players and their coaches learned this week that at least some of the team's visa applications were denied by the State Department. The Little League World Series, which begins Aug. 19, will proceed without them.
''It is unfortunate, as we were very much looking forward to welcoming the first African team to the Little League Baseball World Series,'' Stephen Keener, president of Little League Baseball and Softball, said in a statement. 
The Ugandans were tripped up by their country's inconsistent infrastructure and the United States' strict requirements for travel visas. The State Department did not give specific reasons for the denial, but it told Little League officials that there were discrepancies in the players' documentation. In Uganda, birth certificates are far from the norm, and establishing someone's age and identity is complicated because parents and guardians are often illiterate.
''It is a difficult situation, I won't deny that,'' the State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner said Friday at a news briefing. ''But you know, these cases are adjudicated by consular officials who look very closely at all the appropriate data, and they make their decisions based on that.''
The Ugandan children play baseball because an American -- Richard Stanley, a part owner of the Trenton Thunder, the Yankees' Class AA affiliate -- introduced the sport to the country eight years ago.
''This would have been huge for kids all over Africa,'' Stanley said Friday. ''This is a great opportunity to expand the sport. All these kids want is an opportunity to go out and play. They have the talent. They don't have the facilities.''
Jay Shapiro, who has been following the team for two and a half years while filming a documentary, ''Opposite Field,'' said in a telephone interview from Kampala that the players were crushed when they heard the news and that the embassy employee who told them on Wednesday was so upset ''she had tears in her eyes.''
The team had come agonizingly close to qualifying a year ago, beating Saudi Arabia in a qualifying tournament in Kutno, Poland, but Shapiro said they lost the next day to Kuwait because of a tiebreaker rule. This year, it beat Saudi Arabia on July 16 and returned to Kampala full of hope about a trip to the United States.
Shapiro said the State Department was right to question the players' documentation, which he called incomplete. Documenting birth is not a simple process in Uganda, Shapiro said. Birth certificates are scarce, especially in the countryside. Many children are not born in hospitals. Some of their parents are illiterate, and in many cases the people raising the children are not their birth parents. A year ago, Little League officials asked Shapiro to gather the necessary documentation and oversee the process when the team qualified for the tournament in Poland.
This summer, Shapiro was not in Uganda. He had wrapped up the film after last season, but he and his crew flew back to Kampala after the team qualified for the World Series to add to the film. He said after the visas were denied, he looked at the players' documentation and found it incomplete.
''Last year's team, I'm 100 percent convinced of the legitimacy of that team,'' Shapiro said. ''This one, I couldn't say I was 100 percent convinced. The paperwork was sloppy. In reality, they shouldn't have even been allowed to go to Poland in the first place. This should have been caught earlier.''
Before granting a visa to travel to the United States, the American Embassy requires interviews with each child and his parents. If any of their answers differ from what is on the paperwork, it is considered a discrepancy.
''I don't think any of them were deliberately trying to give false information,'' Shapiro said. ''They were just mistakes. But the result is the same. And I don't disagree with their decision.''
Toner, the State Department spokesman, said he did not know how many of the players were denied visas.
''It's unclear to me whether it was a preponderance of the kids, so that the team was no longer viable, if you will, or whether every individual on the team was denied,'' he said.
Stanley said he hoped Little League officials would appeal to the State Department, but Pat Wilson, the vice president for operations for the Little League, said that would not happen.
''We are going to respect their decision,'' he said. ''We don't think it would be appropriate for us to call into question their determination.''
Wilson said there was no precedent for a team's qualifying for the Little League World Series but failing to gain entry into the United States. He said a few teams have had last-minute hitches in the process, but all were worked out.
Stanley said he considered it a major setback to his efforts in Uganda. He became involved eight years ago after visiting the country for a United Nations economic development program and said he had spent more than $1.5 million building facilities and setting up a program. He said he paid for the team to travel to Poland for the qualifying tournament in 2008, in 2010 and again this year. He said each trip cost about $35,000.
He said his goal was to build sports schools that emphasize academics and athletics.
''When I talked to the minister of sports, he asked me, 'Can we win at this sport?' '' Stanley said. ''That's what they care about, because they can't win at anything. They have great talent there, but I told them: 'You have to teach the kids. And those kids will play all day long if you give them the opportunity.' ''
Shapiro said Little League should require teams attempting to qualify for the World Series to go through a preliminary visa approval process so that there are no last-minute disappointments.
''It's a shame,'' Shapiro said. ''Their country isn't ready for this. The schools aren't ready. The parents aren't ready. The only thing that's ready are the kids and their talent. They will make it one day, and if there is anything positive out of this, it's for people to realize what wonderful things are happening with these kids. They've got their own little world growing here.''

HEADLINE: Muddying The Budget Waters

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
All the political wrangling over the budget in Washington has been focused on one theme: how much the government should cut and when those cuts should take effect.
But for all of the difficulty lawmakers are having now, their hardest decisions may come this fall when they do battle over which government programs to cut back. And one program that has already been put on the table for discussion is Social Security, even though it has not contributed to the budget deficit.
There is no question the program needs to be tweaked so it can remain solvent for decades to come. And experts say the problem is not that difficult to solve, as long as it is dealt with relatively soon.
The proposed changes would have tinkered with one of the most beloved features of Social Security: the cost of living adjustment, which helps benefits keep pace with inflation so the elderly maintain their purchasing power. The proposed changes would link benefits to a new measure of inflation -- one that is projected to rise more slowly than the current index. 
''It amounts to a benefit cut,'' Alicia H. Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said.
The proposal, which emerged as a potential bargaining chip earlier in the budget debate, caused Social Security preservationists to cringe. And that is a big reason they argue that any changes should not be fast-tracked as part of the broader deficit debate.
If no changes are made, the program's reserves are now projected to be exhausted in 2036, a year earlier than last year's projection. Then the taxes collected would be enough to pay only about 75 percent of benefits through 2085, according to the latest annual report from the agency's trustees.
The shortfall can largely be attributed to demographic shifts. The coming wave of baby boomers will strain the system, while the number of workers paying into the system is declining. On top of that, people are living longer, and the weak economy is not helping matters.
Changing the cost of living adjustment is just one of several ways to bolster Social Security's finances. Suggestions have included gradually increasing the retirement age or raising the amount of income subject to Social Security payroll taxes.
The Obama administration's deficit-reduction commission proposed switching to the new type of index because, members said, it would be more accurate. Unlike the current measure, it takes into account that people tend to change their buying habits when prices rise, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones. If, for instance, the price of apples goes up, people may instead buy pears, if they are cheaper. The current index assumes that if the price of apples go up, people will just buy fewer apples.
But there is a question of whether the elderly and disabled can make the same substitutions as working people. ''If you are down to paying your rent and your food, and the price of your food goes up, you probably just eat less,'' Ms. Munnell said.
In addition, the slower rise in benefits would compound over time. That means the older that retirees grew, the bigger the pinch they would feel, especially people who depended heavily on the program. About 43 percent of single people and 22 percent of married couples rely on the benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, the Social Security Administration says. More than half of couples and 73 percent of singles draw more than half their income from the program.
So how much would this cost? Over the last decade or so, the ''chained CPI-U'' -- that is the name of the new proposed index -- has risen 0.3 percentage points a year less than the measure used now, according to Stephen Goss, the chief actuary at Social Security. And he expects that would continue in the future.
Consider a worker who retired at 65. After 10 years, the worker would receive 3.7 percent less in benefits than he would receive under the current system; after 20 years, 6.5 percent; and 9.2 percent after 30 years, according to Mr. Goss's calculations. (He ran the numbers in response to a request by Representative Xavier Becerra, a Democrat from California who is the ranking member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security).
Let's assume the retiree had a monthly benefit of $1,261, or $15,132 annually. But as he aged, his benefits would not rise as quickly as they would have under the current system. At 75, he would receive $560 less a year under the new system compared with the current one. At 85, he would receive $984 less, and, at 95, he would receive $1,394 a year less. These changes would resolve about 23 percent of the program's current shortfall, according to Social Security's actuaries.
But what is most irksome to some critics is that the proposed index has been called ''more accurate.'' It may be more accurate for the broader population, they say, but that doesn't necessarily hold for retirees. (It would, however, save $112 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office).
If accuracy, and not cost savings, is the goal, they suggest further analysis of an experimental ''elderly'' index that accounts for the fact that older people spend a greater share of their budget on medical care. That index is estimated to increase about 0.2 percentage point more each year than the broader indexes. In fact, Ms. Munnell said that moving to the elderly index -- and adding the mechanism to account for substituting cheaper items when prices rise -- might make more sense.
Referring to the chained CPI-U index, Ms. Munnell said, ''It's not the worst proposal that could be put in place,'' especially when considering that other ideas, like providing an increase in benefits at age 85, could offset some of the reduction. ''It's just that people aren't candid when they talk about it. That's the real problem.''
And that is the issue hanging like a dark cloud over the broader discussion to bolster Social Security, especially in such a politically charged atmosphere.
Many people misunderstand how the program operates. Payroll taxes stream into the trust fund that is used to pay current retirees' benefits. When there is a surplus, that money is invested in a special type of Treasury bond that pays interest to the trust fund. At the end of last year, the trust fund had about $2.6 trillion. And though last year was the first year since 1983 that the fund paid out more than it received in tax revenue, it still continued to grow because of the interest accrued -- and it is estimated to continue to grow through 2022.
Since the money in the trust fund is held in Treasury securities, taxes collected are essentially being lent to the federal government to pay for whatever it wants (and this allows the government to borrow less from the public). That is where some of the confusion comes into play about how Social Security is used to pay for things that are unrelated to the program. But it is really no different from China lending the government money by investing in Treasuries.
''Social Security does not, and cannot by law, add a penny to the federal debt,'' said Nancy Altman, co-director of Social Security Works, an advocacy organization that promotes the preservation of the program. ''It, by law, cannot pay benefits unless it has sufficient income to cover the cost, and it has no borrowing authority to make up any shortfall.''
And, she added, it is not in crisis. ''Its long-range funding shortfall should be dealt with on its own legislative vehicle, separate from deficit-reduction talks and after those talks are concluded,'' she added.
The budget proposal from the bipartisan group of Congressmen known as the Gang of Six and the president's deficit-cutting commission did state that Social Security should be reformed for its own sake -- and that any savings must go toward solvency. There are many ideas on how to achieve that balance. Here's hoping our leaders will evaluate them on their own merit.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY DANIEL ROSENBAUM FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B2) CHART: Using the Inflation Rate to Tweak Social Security: A proposal to change Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment surfaced as part of the budget debate. Currently, benefits are pegged to a variant of the Consumer Price Index, the CPI-W, which was the only index that existed when benefits were first adjusted for inflation. Lawmakers have proposed switching to the chained CPI-U, which is projected to rise more slowly. Some advocates say a variation of the CPI-E (an experimental index that tracks the spending habits of those 62 and older) would be a better measure, since it reflects that older people spend more on health care.

HEADLINE: New Data Shows Sharp Slowdown In Growth Rate

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The economy slowed to a snail's pace in the first half of 2011, underscoring a growing risk that the recovery itself may hang in the balance with budget and debt decisions in Washington.
The broadest measure of the economy, known as the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of 2011, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The figures for the first quarter and the second quarter, 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent respectively, were well below what economists were expecting, and signified a sharp slowdown from the early months of the recovery.
The government also revised data going all the way back to 2003 that showed the recession was deeper, and the recovery weaker, than initially believed.
''There's nothing that you can look at here that is signaling some revival in growth in the second half of the year, and in fact we may see another catastrophically weak quarter next quarter if things go wrong next week,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, referring to the debt ceiling talks. 
With so little growth, the economy can hardly withstand further shocks from home or abroad, and worrisome signals continue to emanate from heavily indebted European countries.
If the domestic economy were to contract, any new recession would originate on President Obama's watch -- unlike the last one, which began a year before he was elected.
If Congress leaves existing budget plans intact, some of the government's economic assistance, like the payroll tax cut, will phase out and thereby act as a drag on growth.
And by many economists' thinking, whatever additional budget cuts Congress eventually agrees to (or does not) will weaken the economy even further.
On the one hand, if legislators cannot come to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by Tuesday, the United States may be unable to pay all its bills. Borrowing costs across the economy could then surge, because so many interest rates are pegged to how much it costs the federal government to borrow. The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers has predicted that the resulting financial mayhem would most likely plunge the economy back into recession.
On the other hand, if legislators do reach an agreement, it will probably include austerity measures that could chip away at the already fragile recovery. Spending cuts -- particularly if they take effect sooner rather than later, as some of the House's more conservative members want -- will weaken the economy, since so many industries and workers are directly or indirectly dependent on government activity.
Macroeconomic Advisers has estimated that the plan of Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who serves as majority leader, for example, could shave a half a percentage point off growth as its spending cuts peak.
Citing the debt reductions that Congress undertook in 1937 and that ushered in the most severe phase of the Great Depression, some economists fear that imposing austerity measures too soon could likewise result in a recessionary relapse.
Simply prolonging the debt negotiations could also damage prospects for growth in the third quarter, as businesses and families wait to make big purchases until the threat of a federal default subsides.
''The business and consumer uncertainty over whether the government will be able to pay its bills is the biggest thing weighing around our neck right now,'' said Austan Goolsbee, the departing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The economy is smaller today than it was before the Great Recession began in 2007, though the country's labor force and production capacity have grown. The outlook for digging out of that hole is getting weaker by the day, and analysts across Wall Street have already begun slashing their forecasts for output and job growth for the rest of this year. Usually, a sharp recession is followed by a sharp recovery, meaning the recovery growth rate is far faster than the long-term average growth rate; last quarter, though, output grew at less than half of the average rate seen in the 60 years preceding the Great Recession.
Particularly distressing to economists is that consumer spending -- which, alongside housing, usually leads the way in a recovery -- has been extraordinarily weak in recent quarters. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the second quarter barely budged, increasing just 0.1 percent at an annual rate, the Commerce Department report showed.
''People are spending more, but that spending is being absorbed in higher prices, not in buying more stuff,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Even the brightest parts of the latest report were bittersweet. For example, motor vehicle output fell much less than was predicted after the natural disasters in Japan disrupted supply chains. But that means there will probably be a less buoyant bounce in coming months in autos, which economists were counting on to raise growth rates later this year.
Some economists cautioned not to read too much into this figure, though, or any individual quarterly number from the last report. The Commerce Department will probably make substantial revisions to the latest numbers, just as it did on Friday for the data released over the previous decade. Among the more jarring revisions in its latest report was the downgrade for growth in the first quarter of this year, from the original estimate of a 1.9 percent annual growth rate to a rate of just 0.4 percent.
''Sometimes it feels like I'm a physicist who's been flipped into a different universe trying to explain these revisions, rather than an economist tracking output growth,'' said Mr. Ryding. ''The economy is clearly performing poorly, though we don't know quite how poorly because these individual quarterly revisions can sometimes be something of a joke.''
The slow growth rate is largely responsible for stubbornly high joblessness across the country. Businesses are sitting on a lot of cash, but are still reluctant to hire because there is so much uncertainty about the future of the economy and whether they will continue to have a steady flow of customers. As of June, 14 million Americans were actively looking for work, and the average duration of unemployment has been climbing to record highs month after month.
Slow growth takes not only a human toll, but a fiscal one. Tax revenues do not expand enough to pay down the nation's debt.
Given some festering inflation concerns, it also seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will swoop in with another round of monetary easing to invigorate the economy.
''There's not going to be additional monetary stimulus, and it's hard to imagine any fiscal stimulus given the current discussion in Washington,'' Mr. Ryding said. ''So what's going to get us out of this? The inevitable conclusion is time, and that's not very satisfactory.''

HEADLINE: Usual Growth Leaders Absent From Recovery

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
WHY has the job picture been so bleak in the current recovery? A large part of the problem can be traced to unusual weakness in two categories: construction jobs and government jobs. 
Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, the number of government jobs has fallen 2.2 percent. In no other recovery since World War II has there been a decline over a similar period.
In recoveries before 1990, construction employment was always a contributor to economic growth, often a leading one. In part, that was because recessions were sometimes caused by the Federal Reserve pushing up interest rates. In an era when the rates that banks could pay on savings accounts were limited, that cut off the supply of mortgage credit. Fed easing meant that banks could lend again, and sometimes the results were explosive.
But in this recession the collapse in construction jobs came despite low interest rates. Easy credit had led to significant overbuilding, and the slump in construction employment, which began in mid-2006, has continued even after the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that the recession was over.
Overall construction employment is down 28 percent from the peak. Before this cycle, the largest postwar decline had been 18 percent in 1974-75. That decline did not begin until the 1973-75 recession was well under way, and ended only a few months after the recession did.
The number of jobs in state and local government has declined in 21 of the last 24 months, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many governments have been forced by declining tax revenue to seek savings. There was a brief blip in federal government employment because of temporary work for the 2010 census, but overall federal employment has grown at a very slow rate.
The recoveries that began in 1991 and 2001 came to be known as jobless recoveries, so being comparable to them is no great accomplishment. But over all, jobs growth during the first two years of recovery has been a little better than after the 2001 downturn, but a little worse than after the 1990-91 recession.
As can be seen from the accompanying charts, private sector employment, excluding construction jobs, has been a little better than after the two previous downturns.
To some economists, the high unemployment rate for construction workers creates an opportunity for badly needed spending on roads, bridges and schools. ''The need for infrastructure spending is as great as ever, if not greater, than in the entire postwar period,'' said Henry Kaufman, who runs his own advisory firm.
But that seems unlikely to happen, since current political pressure calls for reduced government spending. That pressure is also likely to lead to more layoffs in state and local governments, particularly when schools reopen in the fall. The targeted stimulus spending that might accelerate the recovery and prevent more layoffs is not on the Washington agenda.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Tale of Four Recoveries: Two years after the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, the recovery differs from prior ones in the depth of the decline in construction employment, and an unusual decline in government jobs. The increase in private sector employment, outside the construction industry, is slightly better than the 2001- 3 and 1991-93 recoveries, but far behind the 1982- 84 recovery.

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis? Bankruptcy Fears? See Jefferson County, Ala.

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Campbell Robertson reported from Birmingham, and Mary Williams Walsh from New York.

 BODY:
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- A few hundred miles north of here, politicians are fighting over debt. It is a spirited debate, full of discussions about what kind of country will be left for future generations and pledges not to kick the can down the road.
But one does not have to go far to see that possible future. Welcome to Jefferson County. This is the end of the road, where the can cannot be kicked any farther.
There are lessons for everyone here, and they are all painful: lessons for those who are not concerned about the prospect of mounting debt, for those who insist that steep cuts can be relatively painless, for those who think the bill for big spending can safely be put off into the future, for those who have blind faith in the market and for those who think the government can always be relied upon to protect the interests of the people.
All of these beliefs have led to a place where the government can no longer borrow and the little cash on hand is being demanded by creditors, where the Sheriff's Department cannot afford to respond to traffic accidents and hundreds of county workers are sitting at home, temporarily or possibly permanently out of work. They have also led to a widely held conclusion among residents that no one is on their side. 
''I get tired of them dumping on the little people,'' said Deb Passmore, 58, who had to shut down her Laundromat several years ago when the sewer and water bills reached $500 a month.
The prospect of county bankruptcy, which would be the largest of its kind in United States history, has gone from being an unwelcome mark of distinction to something that many residents insist should have happened a long time ago.
It still stings to think about how things got this way, how county residents are stuck with the tab from a reckless binge by Wall Street bankers, middlemen and crooked politicians, a greed-fueled spree that none of the voters actually wanted or even knew was happening. But residents know that complaints about fairness have not made that debt, all $3.2 billion of it, go away.
''What are you going to do?'' said Steve Mordecai, 50, who was eating lunch at Ted's, a meat-and-three place here that is somewhat less crowded than usual on Fridays, given that so many county employees are no longer working. ''The county created the mess,'' Mr. Mordecai said. ''Now we have to pay it back.''
The story that ends in overspending excess began in neglect: in 1996, the federal government accused Jefferson County of sending raw sewage into area rivers and demanded that it rebuild its dilapidated sewer system. Such a project would be costly, but officials hoped to avoid unpopular rate increases first by pushing that cost into the future, and then by adding a maze of derivatives that were supposed to shield the county from interest-rate increases.
But the bond deals were fraught with pay-to-play scandals. Four county commissioners were convicted of taking bond-related bribes. Two bankers are fighting federal accusations that they made secret payments, and in 2009 J.P. Morgan forfeited $752 million to settle a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The complicated bond-and-derivative structures failed during the financial turmoil of 2008, leaving the county with a $3.2 billion debt to pay, faster than planned. Sewer revenues that were pledged to pay the debt cannot keep up. The problems keep compounding: federal prosecutors have taken a derivatives consultant to court on bid-rigging charges. And the Internal Revenue Service is investigating whether the sewer bonds really should have been marketed as tax exempt.
But the fiscal crisis went from a simmer to a full boil in April, when the Alabama Supreme Court declared a major county tax unconstitutional. Shortly afterward, with the county reeling from the severe shortfall in general funds, a court-appointed receiver recommended a steep increase in county sewer rates, and also laid claim to the county's only cash reserves, saying they were needed to bolster the sewer system's finances.
At the end of June, Gov. Robert Bentley declared a shaky truce while negotiations took place. On Thursday, the County Commission announced that it was entering a seven-day standstill period to consider a settlement offer from the creditors, an announcement that was met with grumbles across most of the county.
''They should have filed for bankruptcy 10 years ago,'' said Howard Faulk, an owner of Sophie's Deli across the street from the county courthouse, where the lines for county business are hours long but the parking is free because the county cannot afford parking attendants. ''If you're standing in water this deep,'' Mr. Faulk asked, his hand at his neck, how much deeper can it get?
But any residents who think a bankruptcy will simply wipe the debt clean are probably in for a bleak surprise. Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, the one local governments use, does not work like Chapter 11, where corporations restructure and bondholders routinely suffer losses.
In fact, Chapter 9 was amended in 1988 with the specific goal of making clear that certain types of municipal bonds would keep on paying even in bankruptcy, said James E. Spiotto, a bankruptcy specialist with the firm of Chapman Cutler. The bonds issued to finance Jefferson County's giant sewer project are this type.
''The whole purpose is to assure the market that in times of distress, the bonds will be paid,'' Mr. Spiotto said in an interview.
Many citizens of the county speak bitterly of a perception that other parts of Alabama think of the county as unworthy of help. Even one of the county's own state senators blocked a plan to allow Jefferson to raise revenue to replace some of what was taken away by the April court decision, thus forcing layoffs.
''In Alabama, Jefferson County is Chinatown,'' said David Mowery, a Montgomery political consultant, using the metaphor for hopeless inscrutability from the Roman Polanski film of the same name. ''Forget it,'' he said, summing up the general attitude toward the county. ''There's nothing you can do about it.''
But as Alabama's own governor learned over the spring and summer, you cannot just forget Jefferson County, where Birmingham is the county seat. If it goes down, it takes the state -- and the state's credit -- with it. This realization prompted the governor to intervene when the county was near declaring bankruptcy at the end of June.
Still, little of this reassures the people slogging through here, who realize that life will get harder before it gets better. The only consolation is gallows humor and signs they might not be alone.
''I used to think what awful leadership we have in Jefferson County,'' said Phillip Winette, 58, who runs a printing company. ''But now I'm watching the debate on a national level. It's an epidemic.''

HEADLINE: What Would It Take To End Stalemate? Falling Markets Might Force Lawmakers to Finally Act

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Azam Ahmed, Eric Dash and Patrick Scott contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Politicians are loath to make painful decisions unless they are forced to. This week, as stocks kept sinking, the question was whether the markets would finally force their hand.
''Congress is often referred to as a reactive force rather than a proactive one,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. ''If we had a 500-point drop in the Dow, it would scare that reactive body.''
With House and Senate debt limit proposals set to collide on Capitol Hill, Wall Street was anxiously awaiting the opening of Asian markets on Sunday night in the absence of a compromise by lawmakers.
Investors expressed their displeasure Friday with both the political stalemate and new economic data that showed the economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, which has retreated for six consecutive trading days, was down 96.87 points, or 0.79 percent, to 12,143.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the market, lost 8.39 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,292.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.87 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,756.38.
The S.& P. was down 3.9 percent this week, the biggest weekly drop in more than a year. The last time the broader market closed lower for three consecutive months was in 2008, for the months of September, October and November. That was also the last time Washington surprised investors and failed to act.
On Sept. 29, 2008, lawmakers rejected the TARP legislation to bail out the banking system at the height of the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and investors sent the Dow plunging by 778 points.
Congress quickly reversed course, and by Oct. 3, both the Senate and the House had approved the legislation. But the damage had been done -- that 778-point drop wiped out $1 trillion in shareholder value. And with investors unnerved, the stage had been set for more big drops. The Dow fell 936 points on Oct. 13 and another 889 points on Oct. 28.
''In sum, Washington grumbles, Wall Street stumbles,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's equity research in New York. ''Once again, history repeats itself.''
So far, Wall Street isn't yet in panic mode over the wrangling in Congress over government spending and whether to lift the nation's borrowing limit of $14.3 trillion by a Tuesday deadline. Without the ability to sell more debt through United States Treasuries, administration officials have said the government will not be able to pay all of its obligations and risks a downgrade in its credit or even a default.
Mr. Levkovich said Friday that most investors were still counting on a resolution to the logjam, averting a default. But, he said, ''the level of complacency is eroding. I suspect there will be a lot of frantic calls going around this weekend.''
Though the bond markets have shown considerable nonchalance during the stalemate, signs of distress emerged this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell to 2.79 percent, its lowest level since November. Federal officials held an unusual meeting with senior traders at 20 major Wall Street firms to discuss the government's contingency plans to keep refinancing its debt.
Federal officials signaled a possible delay next week in the government debt auctions when they solicited feedback from the Wall Street firms that bid for allotments of Treasury securities. At Friday's meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, senior Treasury Department officials laid out three proposals that would allow the government to keep refinancing its existing obligations while keeping it under the $14.3 trillion cap, according to two dealers who were briefed on the meeting. The Treasury has about $90 billion of debt that comes due on Aug. 4, and another $410 billion or so in the next few weeks.
One plan calls for a delay in some debt sales until lawmakers reach an agreement on the debt ceiling. Another would reduce the size of the sales. The third option would be to shorten the timetable in which they refinance the debt by selling very short-term bills. The government took similar action in 1995 when Congress briefly ran close to the debt ceiling deadline. But it is the equivalent of living paycheck-to-paycheck.
''There was a general consensus among all participants that Congress should act as quickly as possible to raise the debt ceiling for as long a period as possible to lift the cloud of uncertainty from the economy,'' the Treasury Department said in a statement.
Many in the business community are concerned that Congress will not be able to act before the Tuesday deadline, said Robert Nichols, chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group in Washington that represents many of the biggest commercial and investment banks. ''We have strongly urged policy makers to reach an agreement this week so we don't have to learn the grave consequences of inaction.''
David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said on Thursday that he still thought a deal would get done by Tuesday. ''If we don't, I would expect there to be an immediate adverse reaction in capital markets, similar perhaps to what happened in TARP.''
The steeper the move, he said, the stronger the message, suggesting that a 5 percent drop -- about 600 points on the Dow -- would be a wake-up call for Washington.
Arvind Sanger, managing partner at the hedge fund GeoSphere Capital Management, said he had reduced his exposure to stocks in the last two days, fearing that the market could plunge if the debt issue remained unresolved.
''That's something that I haven't seen yet, but I have 2008 fresh enough in my mind that I'm taking it down anyways,'' he said.
While finishing the week on such a precipitous note reminded some people on Wall Street of the weekend before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 or the days before the Black Monday crash of 1987, two veterans said there were important differences this time around.
Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners and a 46-year veteran of Wall Street, said that in October 1987, ''you didn't know what you could do to avert it and nothing was going to happen over the weekend to change it.'' Similarly, in 2008, ''even if Lehman were saved, the problems were still severe.''
This time around, Mr. Wien said, ''you have problems in Washington complicated by a deteriorating economy but the difference is if they come to some kind of deal, that lifts the cloud.''
Barry Knapp, chief United States equity strategist at Barclays and a 19-year veteran of Lehman who was there the weekend before the collapse, added, the situation ''is not yet on the order of magnitude of Lehman. But even if we get an agreement, we're unlikely to have a significant relief rally because of the macroeconomic outlook.''
The wild card is if Congress remains deadlocked over the weekend. If that happens, Mr. Knapp said, ''Monday could definitely be rough.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall After G.D.P. Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Catherine Rampell contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
A disappointing report on the nation's second-quarter economic activity spurred a steep initial decline in stocks in the United States on Friday, adding to the malaise in the markets as investors wait for an outcome of the debt ceiling debate in Washington.
The three main indexes raced lower by about 1 percent shortly after the market opened, responding to the Commerce Department's report that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter, well below analysts' forecasts. The department also revised the first-quarter annual rate to 0.4 percent from earlier estimates of 1.7 percent. 
But through the course of the trading session, stocks retraced some ground, possibly in response to the prospect of a resolution related to the other main market factor on Friday: the debt ceiling impasse.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, retreating for the sixth consecutive trading day, was down 96.87 points, or 0.79 percent, to 12,143.24.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the market, lost 8.39 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,292.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.87 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,756.38.
The broader market as measured by the S.&P. ended the week down about 3.9 percent, its largest weekly loss in more than a year. It also recorded its third consecutive monthly loss. The last time the broader market closed lower for three straight months was in 2008, for the months of September, October and November.
Commerce Department revisions to earlier G.D.P. figures suggested that the recovery was weaker than initial estimates had let on. Consumer spending, accounting for about 70 percent of G.D.P., was virtually unchanged in the second quarter.
Stephen Wood, Russell Investments' chief market strategist, noted that many economists had expected a slow second quarter, for reasons including severe weather and the supply chain disruptions that followed the earthquake in Japan.
But changes to the G.D.P. estimates for the first quarter and the quarters before it weighed especially heavily on sentiment.
''We were clearly looking at a second-quarter slow patch,'' he said. ''The revision to Q1 caught the market by surprise.''
The lack of a strong recovery highlights the difficulties Congress is facing in its deadlocked deliberations to raise the debt ceiling for the American government because some businesses are delaying decisions amid the uncertainty. A recovery in the job market and consumer spending is seen as crucial in stimulating the pace of the economy.
While it was another day of selling, investors had few alternatives for their money.
''The debt ceiling debate, if you can call it that, is an ongoing drama,'' Mr. Wood said. ''Where do you go given that Treasuries are in the teeth of the debt ceiling negotiations? This is uncharted waters.''
Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, described the G.D.P. report as ''roundly disappointing.''
He also said that the stalemate in the debate in Congress was having an impact on the markets.
''The Treasury market is trading higher this morning as yet another day goes by without a viable plan for resolving the debt ceiling impasse,'' said Mr. Giddis in an early commentary, referring to prices.
As Treasury prices rose, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell sharply to 2.79 percent in late afternoon trading, compared with 2.96 percent late Thursday.
Lawmakers have to reach a deal by Aug. 2 or the government might face a shortfall and be unable to meet its financial obligations.
Declines in European markets steepened after the G.D.P. report was released in the United States. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.99 percent to 5,815.19, the DAX in Frankfurt was down 0.44 percent to 7,158.77 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.07 percent to 3,672.77. The euro rose to $1.439.
Online Correction: July 29, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the number of consecutive trading days the Dow Jones industrial average had declined. Friday was the sixth.

HEADLINE: What Would It Take To End Stalemate? In U.S. Impasse, Global Concern Over Possible Collateral Damage

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Contributing reporting were David Barboza from Shanghai, Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo, Sang-Hun Choe from Seoul, Jack Ewing from Frankfurt and Stephen Castle from London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- While the debt debacle in Washington preoccupies America, it is causing jitters in power corridors from Beijing to Brussels. The stewards of the world's largest economies are anxious for a compromise, to keep their own finances from suffering collateral damage.
Their worries stem from an inescapable reality: for other governments, there is still no good alternative to holding the almighty dollar, or American Treasury securities, even if the United States gets tarnished by a once-unthinkable credit downgrade. 
China, which has the most to lose because it holds the largest amount of Treasuries -- at least $1.16 trillion -- offered a blistering attack on Washington on Friday, calling for a show of responsibility and an end to the partisan bickering.
''The ugliest part of the saga is that the well-being of many other countries is also in the impact zone when the donkey and the elephant fight,'' the state-run news agency, Xinhua -- considered the propaganda arm of the Communist Party -- said in an opinion piece Friday, referring to the standoff between Democrats and Republicans.
Xinhua said the ''irresponsible'' brinksmanship in Washington risked ''strangling the still fragile economic recovery of not only the United States but also the world as a whole.''
Officials in Europe were more diplomatic, but archly recalled that American leaders had admonished them just a few weeks ago to straighten out the messy politics of the Continent's own debt crisis.
''One could now ask why is the U.S. debt treated any better than a country like Portugal, which has about the same levels of deficit and debt,'' said a senior European policymaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The main concern in Europe is that a Washington failure to lift the debt limit will cause the dollar to weaken further, pushing up the euro and making it harder for Europeans to work out their problems.
That is also among the worries for Japan, the second biggest among United States creditors, whose post-tsunami economic problems would only worsen if the yen rises further against the dollar.
Around the world, many leaders seem to expect the Washington showdown to somehow end in an uneasy truce, given the dire global and domestic political consequences of failing to do so.
But while no one seems to expect the United States to default on its debt, governments elsewhere are girding for the repercussions of the likely tarnishing of America's sparkling credit rating.
Analysts expect China to continue buying American debt, because China keeps producing big trade surpluses that bring in dollars, which must then be reinvested in a haven, like United States Treasuries.
Except that Treasuries may no longer seem as safe as they once did. And China knows it. The Xinhua article warned that China may be ''forced'' to reduce its purchases if the United States government were to lose its triple-A rating.
There are limits to cutting back because other large bond markets, in Europe and Japan, are not nearly as liquid. ''As long as the dollar remains the dominant currency there's little choice for many in the public sector but to hold U.S. debt,'' said the senior European policy maker.
That sentiment is widely shared.
''You still cannot find an asset as safe as U.S. government bonds, even if there is a credit downgrade,'' said Choi Jong-ku, South Korea's deputy minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.
And yet, that does not mean countries might not slightly reduce their purchases of long-term American debt, as China and some others have already shown signs of doing. Whether that is a temporary slowdown or will prove more lasting is a question that worries Washington.
Some experts say there is room for China to steer slightly more money toward Europe or Japan, and buy up more dollar-denominated stocks, rather than debt, while also pushing ahead with its own financial reforms to slow its accumulation of dollars.
Like China, Japan has several reasons to be jittery about America's debt crisis. There are concerns in Tokyo, for example, that a possible downgrade could shake investor confidence in Japan's own mushrooming debt, which is already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
''As the world's biggest economy, the U.S. has a big and immeasurable impact on global financial markets, and Japan would not escape the damage,'' Hidetoshi Kamezaki, a Bank of Japan board member, said this week, urging American officials to strike a deal on the matter.
In Europe, officials are just as concerned about the impact on their own problems. Stricken countries like Ireland and even healthy ones like Germany can hardly afford the trade impact if the euro gets much stronger against a weakening dollar. Worse, the Washington debt standoff has already made borrowing more expensive for big countries with high debt, like Italy and Spain, fanning fires that could imperil the euro zone.
When Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited the White House a few weeks ago, President Obama pressed her on the importance of Europe's politicians finding a solution to their debt crisis. On Friday, a spokesman said Mrs. Merkel continued to have faith that American leaders would reach a compromise -- but he declined to say whether Mrs. Merkel might have phoned Mr. Obama to ask him to heed his own advice.
Her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, had a sterner suggestion. ''The parties in the U.S. should be conscious of their responsibility to global financial markets,'' he said Friday.
In Brussels, seat of the European Union, one E.U. official said, ''Of course we are concerned because this fuels global uncertainty, which makes it harder to dampen down the European debt crisis.'' The official insisted on anonymity because of the international politics in play.
European banks are also big holders of American debt, and many of them have probably been planning how to protect themselves in case of a United States sovereign debt downgrade, including hedges against sharp movements in the dollar, said Stefan Schneider, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
Businesses are also bracing for a rough ride. Friedrich Eichiner, chief financial officer of the German automaker BMW, paused at a company event in Frankfurt on Friday to reflect on what would happen if no compromise were reached, or the United States got a credit downgrade.
''It could naturally lead to grave turmoil on the financial markets with unpredictable consequences,'' Mr. Eichiner said. ''The governments of this world, especially in the West, are not prepared for a second financial crisis.''

HEADLINE: A Thick Resume for a Tough Job

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Now that Jurgen Klinsmann is the new American soccer coach, who plays Joachim Low in this performance?
Low was the assistant who was known as the tactician behind the new-wave, camp-leader energy of Klinsi in Germany's spirited third-place finish during the 2006 World Cup. As head coach, Low led Germany to another third place in the 2010 World Cup.
Klinsmann is the change that has probably been inevitable since the United States' disappointing loss to Ghana last summer and surely since its collapse against Mexico in the Gold Cup final a month ago. 
Bob Bradley was a fine coach for the United States right up to the moment when results said his time might be over. That is the best and pragmatic way to explain his departure. Bradley had the reputation for being somewhat hard-shelled and also for playing favorites, whatever that means. What coach does not play favorites?
Bradley was a far more complex person up close, inner-directed and surely no cheerleader, but smart and decent and sometimes even humorous. Also, he did not have the credentials of having been a spectacular scorer all over Europe, as Klinsmann does. Klinsmann has the aura of the international soccer celebrity -- ''sexy,'' one soccer insider said, meaning attractive, in the public relations sense. But it would have been instructive, in a purely laboratory experiment, to give Bruce Arena or Bradley the German squad of 2006 and see if they could achieve third place. Either one just might have done it.
Now it is the time for the mysterious gentleman caller from the world where coaches really understand the sport, or so the theory goes. The opposite theory (to which I have adhered) is that the national team has needed a home-grown coach who understands the mentality of the American player.
What does that mean? American athletes ask questions -- these days, maybe even in that most authoritarian, brute sport known as American football. They ask: Why, Coach? Coaches like Arena and Bradley understood the quirkiness of Landon Donovan and the independence of Clint Dempsey. I'm not sure a Fabio Capello or a Marcello Lippi -- my way or the autostrada -- would work in the United States. Then again, top European coaches often have room for a resident madman on the field, a Gennaro Gattuso in Italy or a Wayne Rooney in England, and the United States has lacked a lunatic since Frankie Hejduk wore his body down during the last qualifying round.
Any way you look at it, it's a new age. World soccer celebrities love coming to the United States because they can move around with more freedom than in Europe. Jose Mourinho has said he wants his children to attend college in America in a few years while he lives in Southern California (which Bradley has been doing, and enjoying). No doubt Mourinho will be watching Klinsmann's experience with considerable interest.
Klinsi, after all, got here first. He lives in Southern California not just for the beaches but for the relative normal life his family can pursue. He is also a linguist of sorts, not as good as Mourinho, but close, and speaks English colloquially.
It is conceivable that Klinsmann will elicit some looseness among the American players, even the vast majority that respects Bradley.
It was not hard to figure out that Bradley has been on wobbly ground since the loss to Ghana in the World Cup in South Africa. Some of us were second-guessing his lineup well before Ricardo Clark's double gaffes in the early minutes. But when Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, once again could not sign Klinsmann during his summer search, Bradley was retained for a full four-year term. Then came the disaster against Mexico in the final of the Gold Cup.
It is strange but true that the end of Bradley's tenure happened because an overeager German import, Jermaine Jones, barreled into Steve Cherundolo, the stable right back, sending him out of the final. Bradley sent in Jonathan Bornstein, often labeled as a Bradley favorite, but the reality is that Bornstein might never have gotten onto the field that day if Jones had not creamed Cherundolo.
The United States took a surprising 2-0 lead, but never looked secure, and the Mexican majority in the stands celebrated the 4-2 thumping, some of them raucously. When a nation comes up with a Chicharito, it has the freedom to celebrate.
In the humane world of Gulati and the federation, the coaching announcement was delayed because Michael Bradley was marrying back home in New Jersey, and the family deserved plenty of space for this happy event. One quick word about Michael Bradley: there was not the slightest bit of nepotism involved in his playing central midfield for his father. Michael can be crude and unimaginative with the ball but is fearless about tracking down attackers on defense and poaching a big goal on offense.
The big question remains about American soccer: Where are the players? In the ever-growing and knowledgeable and passionate soccer-blog world, there is an alligator-in-the-sewer theory that great prospects are waiting to be discovered, except that Gulati, that stick-in-the-mud economics professor, and Bradley, that nepotistic coach, ignore dozens of Chicharitos in all corners of this great land.
Reality: Chicharito plays for the Red Sox. Chicharito plays defensive back for a junior college in Texas. Chicharito is a point guard in high school in California. In the next few years we will find out if Klinsi possesses the magic decoder ring with all the secrets hitherto denied the poor neglected Yanks.

HEADLINE: Resolving the Stalemate Over the Debt Ceiling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''House Puts Off Debt Vote as Press by Boehner Fails'' (front page, July 29):
The time has come for President Obama to act. The Constitution neither grants nor denies to the president the power to raise the so-called debt ceiling in order to borrow funds needed for timely payment of debts lawfully incurred by the United States. 
Considering that willful failure to pay such debts threatens the fundamentals of democracy, the economy of America and the world, and the full faith and credit of the United States, the president must authorize the Treasury to borrow money needed to pay existing debt.
These are not new debt obligations. Existing debts were created when Congress adopted and the president approved needed government expenditures. These lawful debts must now be paid. If Congress will not act, the president must do so.
Otherwise, America is threatened with economic instability equivalent to an attack on the full faith and credit of the United States.
DAN PARTAN Brookline, Mass., July 29, 2011
The writer is a professor of law at Boston University.
To the Editor:
George Washington, if he were alive today, would be appalled by the political antics of Congressional Republicans on the debt limit.
In 1783, Washington called upon the nation to pay its debts as a matter of justice and honor. In a letter written two years later, Washington said, ''We have it in our power to be one of the most respectable Nations on Earth.'' But if we fail to honor our debts, he warned, ''we give the vital stab to public credit, and must sink into contempt in the eyes of Europe.''
It is a tragic irony that the self-styled patriots in Congress should follow the very path condemned by one of America's greatest patriots.

HEADLINE: Salvation At Chrysler, In the Form Of Fiat

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
A little more than two years ago, the White House's auto industry task force concluded flatly that Chrysler was ''not viable as a stand-alone company.''
That may have been an understatement. America's third-largest automaker was too dependent on gas-guzzling trucks and S.U.V.'s, too concentrated in recession-wracked North America, too small to compete globally and too cash-starved to invest in new technologies. Quality was abysmal. Every model in the company's Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands ranked in the bottom 25 percent in the J. D. Power & Associates survey of customer satisfaction. From 2006-8, Chrysler lost $30 billion.
David Kelleher, 44, president of David Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Glen Mills, Pa., thought Chrysler -- and his dealership -- were ''close to death.'' After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and forgoing law school to sell cars, Mr. Kelleher had worked his way through the ranks at a Chrysler Plymouth dealership in the Philadelphia area before buying his own franchise and opening David's in 2005. Chrysler was already in steep decline under its German owner, Daimler-Benz, which in turn sold the company to the private equity concern Cerberus Capital Management in 2007. 
''We were lucky to survive those barracudas,'' Mr. Kelleher recalled. ''They were systematically devaluing the company. They just wanted to squeeze money out of it.''
As for quality, he mentioned the midsize Sebring. ''That was a flagship piece of junk. I buried it on the back lot. I sold maybe one a month, if that.'' When Chrysler's owners on Wall Street demanded higher sales numbers, Mr. Kelleher and his fellow dealers responded with steep discounts and lower credit standards. ''We were just trying to get the numbers up and we built a bubble,'' he said. When gas prices soared above $4 a gallon in 2008, he pleaded with Cerberus officials for models with better gas mileage, long a sore spot for Chrysler. ''They looked at me like I was speaking French.''
After President Bush bailed out General Motors and Chrysler in his administration's waning days, there was sentiment inside the Obama White House and among some in Congress to sell off Jeep and a few other valuable Chrysler assets, possibly to G.M., and cut the government's losses by liquidating the rest. Dealers like Mr. Kelleher would be reduced to selling used cars and surviving on repairs to defunct models.
He recalled meeting at the Capitol with Arlen Specter, then the Republican senator from Pennsylvania. ''David, why would I save this company?'' he recalled Senator Specter asking. ''It makes bad cars. It's destined to fail.'' Mr. Kelleher said he replied: ''I'm going to be bankrupt in a matter of weeks. I can't support my debt service selling used cars. Millions of jobs are going to be lost.'' By the end of the meeting, Mr. Specter seemed to be reconsidering. ''If I vote for this, my party is going to turn against me,'' he said to Mr. Kelleher. ''I hope you remember this.'' (Mr. Specter said he didn't remember the conversation, but ''it sounds like one of many that I had with constituents where I voted on what was good public policy even though it was politically risky because the Republican Party didn't like it.'') Mr. Specter was one of only two Republican senators to support the auto bailout. He subsequently switched parties and was defeated in the Democratic primary.
Not even Mr. Kelleher could be sure the proposed rescue plan -- a government-backed partnership with Fiat of Italy in which Fiat would pay no money for a controlling stake and an option to buy more -- would work. If a vaunted carmaker like Mercedes-Benz couldn't save Chrysler, who could?
In what surely ranks as one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the annals of American business history, this week Chrysler reported adjusted net income of $181 million and a 30 percent rise in revenue, to $13.7 billion, even in a still-soft global car market. Its June sales jumped 30 percent from the previous year, its 15th consecutive month of increases. Its market share has grown to 10.6 percent, from under 6 percent. Chrysler repaid its outstanding government loans in May, six years ahead of schedule, and last week Fiat paid $500 million for the Treasury's remaining 6 percent stake in the company. The American government has recouped $11.2 billion of its $12.5 billion investment in Chrysler, and would probably have made a profit had it held the debt to maturity. Meanwhile, Chrysler employs 56,000 people and has added 9,000 jobs since the bailout.
''This is an amazing success story,'' the assistant secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Massad, told me this week. ''We've fully exited Chrysler at a very small loss. When you look at the options we had, they were very stark: provide assistance or face the immediate liquidation of the company. That would have been disastrous in the context of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.''
How did Fiat do it after so many had failed? Mr. Kelleher said the first months were frightening. Fiat and Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, ''stopped the rebates, stopped the bad loans. We felt the change immediately.'' Chrysler's market share plunged. But Mr. Kelleher said he felt better after he met the new chief executive at Mr. Marchionne's first dealer meeting in Orlando, Fla., in early 2010. A native of Abruzzo, Italy, whose family moved to Canada when he was 14, Mr. Marchionne speaks fluent English and Italian. ''He has a presence. He looks like a kindly grandfather, but he has a grip that will take your hand off,'' Mr. Kelleher said.
Mr. Marchionne immediately put his stamp on new models. At the Orlando meeting, he reviewed plans for a revamped Sebring. ''I'm not going to allow you to sell this,'' he bluntly told the dealers, according to Mr. Kelleher. The Jeep Grand Cherokee ''was on the drawing board, but Marchionne changed the car dramatically. He knew it was a good product, but it wasn't up to his standards,'' especially the plastic-laden interior, Mr. Kelleher said. At its debut last fall, the revamped model drew strong reviews and was an immediate hit. New quality controls cut customer complaints in half from the previous model. ''We started to take off right then,'' Mr. Kelleher said.
After the meeting, the Sebring got a new engine, a new suspension, a new transmission and a new interior. About the only thing that survived was the chassis. It also got a new name, the Chrysler 200, and Mr. Marchionne made the bold but controversial decision, criticized by some Republicans in Congress, to spend $2 million for a commercial in January's Super Bowl.
The day of the game, Mr. Kelleher was attending a dealer convention in St. Louis, where dealers were clamoring for a glimpse of the ad. Chrysler leadership finally agreed on condition of confidentiality. A few hours before kickoff, the dealers watched as a camera panned through the industrial ruins of Detroit to the ominous pulse of ''Lose Yourself'' by the rapper and native son, Eminem.
''What does this city know about luxury?'' a narrator asked. ''What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life? Well, I'll tell you: More than most.'' The images shifted to a statue of the boxer, Joe Louis, Diego Rivera's lush Detroit Industry mural, mansions from Detroit's heyday. ''It's the hottest fires that make the hardest steel,'' the narrator continued. ''Add hard work and conviction and the know-how that runs generations deep in every last one of us. That's who we are. That's our story.'' Images flashed by celebrating Detroit and its people, with barely a glimpse of the new 200. Finally Eminem emerged from behind the wheel and walked into the beautifully renovated Fox Theater to the uplifting strains of a gospel choir onstage. At the end, letters appeared over the dark screen: ''The Chrysler 200 has arrived. Imported from Detroit.''
''I was stunned,'' Mr. Kelleher recalled. ''I looked around. The room was silent. Some people were crying. Then the applause started and just rolled through the auditorium and kept on going. We felt a rebirth.'' Mr. Kelleher immediately e-mailed his chief salesman. ''Get on the computer right now and order 40 200s.''
At Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., lights in the executive offices were routinely burning far into the night. ''I'd get e-mails at 4 a.m.,'' said another Treasury official. Mr. Kelleher said Mr. Marchionne's team ''has an undying loyalty to him. I've never seen this at this level. These guys came in, they actually did what they said they would do, which is so refreshing.''
Mr. Marchionne brought Fiat technology into 16 new models, saving Chrysler billions of dollars in research and development costs while sharply raising mileage standards. ''The Fiat power train policy has changed my entire line,'' Mr. Kelleher said. ''I'm looking at a Chrysler 300. The one on my floor has average m.p.g. of 27. The new one will have 30 m.p.g. in a luxury sedan.'' Mr. Marchionne has brought a rejuvenated Fiat lineup back into American showrooms, starting with the tiny but stylish 500, with rumors of Fiat-owned Alfa-Romeos to follow. A Dodge version of the 500 is scheduled for this spring.
No one is pretending that all Chrysler's problems are behind it. American auto sales are still far below their precrisis peak, and the latest deadlocks in Washington haven't done anything for consumer confidence. Over all, Chrysler quality still trailed in Consumer Reports influential auto survey in 2010, although the magazine subsequently called Chrysler's pace of change under Fiat leadership ''blistering'' and its progress ''laudable.'' This week three Dodge models earned top scores in J. D. Powers's annual appeal survey to tie with BMW for the most awards.
In Glen Mills, David's re-energized workers are wearing navy T-shirts with the slogan ''Imported from Detroit.'' Mr. Kelleher sold all the 200s he ordered the day of the Super Bowl, plus another 60. ''We're doing terrific,'' Mr. Kelleher told me this week. ''Our dealerships are approaching the profitability of Toyota.'' Last year, fellow Chrysler dealers elected him secretary of the dealers' council, and he's in line to be chairman next year. ''It's exciting to be part of this.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Fervor Cuts 2 Ways for Boehner

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There is an old Texas saying often applied to politics that you need to ''dance with the one that brung you.'' But many of the Tea Party-infused freshmen who helped the Republican Party take control of the House last November are here to polka while their leadership is begging them to waltz.
No matter the outcome of the effort by the House speaker, John A. Boehner, to jam his debt ceiling bill through the House over the opposition of a band of freshmen and other conservatives, it is increasingly clear that the same political insurgency that put Republicans into power also has the potential to leave the party so divided that it struggles to govern. 
It was a mere eight months ago that Mr. Boehner and his leadership team welcomed the new Republicans -- many of whom had never held public office -- into the fold of his conference, assuring them that they were the future of the party.
''I think it's going to reinvigorate our democracy,'' Mr. Boehner said then of the Tea Party, ''and be a really good thing for the country.''
But the qualities that helped the majority of the 87 freshman Republicans cruise to victory in 2010 -- their promises to challenge the orthodoxy of their own party and offer fealty to no one -- are in this case an impediment to Mr. Boehner as he tries to negotiate a deal with Democrats to prevent a financial crisis and possible deep damage to an already weak economy. While most have come his way, many were brought kicking and screaming, and enough continue to resist to keep his victory at bay.
Of the roughly 25 Republican House members who on Thursday night refused to budge on the plan, the vast majority are freshmen, joined by some more senior members who have largely aligned themselves with the conservative deficit hawks.
In the broadest terms, the Tea Party freshmen have been victorious in changing the national conversation into an almost singular discussion of debt, and creating a consensus that America must do more to live within its means. They have changed the climate sufficiently that President Obama has moved substantially in their direction, and even stalwart liberals like Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader, are talking in terms of fiscal austerity.
But it is still not clear whether they will translate their passion into accomplishment -- or overreach and undercut their credibility and influence.
''Zealots are great on the campaign trail,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, ''but a huge problem when it comes to governance. They often don't believe in the art of a deal even with their allies. If they are not tamed, they can eat their own party alive.''
Mr. Boehner has been steadfast in his belief that by letting the freshmen have their say, he will earn enough good will to help him lurch forward toward ultimate legislation that would be a compromise with Senate Democrats and the White House.
In many ways, that was the rough dynamic of a fight this year over a short-term spending agreement to avert a government shutdown. But the fight over the debt ceiling -- one many freshmen have been spoiling for since the day they took office --is different because the stakes are much higher, economically and politically. And while many of the freshmen have pledged to do what they believe is right no matter the consequences for their careers, their decisions are playing out against the backdrop of an incipient Republican primary in which they face the prospect of challenges from the right if they agree to a deal.
''The bitter irony of wave elections is that they can broaden your coalition and sweep you into control of the legislature, but they make your coalition more diverse and harder to control,'' said Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. '' What is unusual is that normally members added in this way are more centrist than the base, because they have to be in order to win in districts that were formerly held by the other party,'' Mr. Cain added. ''But this time, the rejection was national and based mainly on bad economic conditions and to some degree on a rejection of Obama's policies, and the Republicans won with candidates who were from the base and beyond of the Republican party.''
For their part, freshmen are being counterwhipped, as it were, by Tea Party activists. One of their most influential groups, Freedom Works, was sending out posts on Twitter on Thursday night with the names of on-the-fence members, urging them to reject the bill.
On Thursday night, Mr. Boehner, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House whip, and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, tried their best to appeal to the freshmen and other holdouts, appealing to their sense of good will, party loyalty and the bigger fights ahead.
They appeared to be refraining from the old-school tricks of promising earmarks and other goodies that are anathema to the anti-Washington new members. The vast majority of freshmen indeed got on board.
But the holdouts are enough to tank this bill, which is what forced Mr. Boehner to pull it from the floor Thursday night.
The current impasse in Congress has often been compared with 1995, when a Republican revolution in the House led by Speaker Newt Gingrich ultimately brought about a leadership coup attempt and eventually Mr. Gingrich's resignation. In this case, at least so far, there is great sympathy for Mr. Boehner among even his most intransigent members, who say that it is the system they are fighting against far more than the leadership of the House.
''There is a desire to support him,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, whose entire delegation -- four of the five of them freshmen -- were, as of late Thursday night, standing in opposition to the bill.
''There is a desire to act before Aug. 2, and a desire to move on to other legislative priorities,'' Mr. Gowdy said. But, he added, echoing many of his classmates, without higher cuts up front and perhaps a balanced budget act as part of the legislation, the bill would look like too many compromises of the past.
''There has been a sense that the 75th raising of the debt ceiling would provide a metaphor for the larger conversation about the size and scope of government,'' he said.

HEADLINE: It's Up to the Senate: The House has made itself irrelevant on the debt limit, but the Senate can still avert a crisis

 BODY:
It was hard to imagine that the House bill to raise the debt limit, and slash and burn the economy, could get any worse. But on Friday it did.
The bill, which narrowly passed the House with 218 Republican votes and none from Democrats, would allow the government to keep borrowing only until November or December and then require both the Senate and the House to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution before the limit could be raised again.
That's right, in a bid to win over his recalcitrant caucus, Speaker John Boehner agreed to go through all of this again in just a few months -- and then hold the country hostage to passing an amendment that will never get the two-thirds of each chamber that it would need. The bill was, as it should have been, promptly dismissed by the Senate. 
Now the only hope left for avoiding default on Tuesday is for the Senate to piece together a compromise that can pass with bipartisan majorities in both chambers. It will undoubtedly cut far too much, at a time when the economy can't afford it. It will contain no needed revenue increases and could still trigger a downgrade. But it would eliminate the imminent threat of financial chaos.
For six months, House leaders catered to their Tea Party members, perhaps hoping that they could turn them to a reasonable path, or at least count on their votes in a clinch. That wish crumbled on Thursday night. At least two dozen Republicans, mostly freshmen, adamantly refused Mr. Boehner's pleas to support his bill -- his last shot at keeping the House's positions relevant.
Instead of worsening the bill, Mr. Boehner could have negotiated with Democrats to construct one with a chance of resolving the standoff and passing in the Senate. But concerned largely with preserving his position, he gave in to the very lawmakers who have been insisting for weeks that the Obama administration is lying about the coming default. That argument alone should have given him pause about giving in to their demands.
The Senate quickly tabled the revised House bill. The legislation being prepared by Harry Reid, the majority leader, would raise the debt ceiling through March 2013. That avoids another showdown, and potential meltdown, in the middle of the crucial retail shopping period and at the start of the presidential campaign cycle, when Washington will be even less open to rational compromise.
The bill would cut the deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Unlike the House bill, it spares Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security from benefit cuts, and counts the drawdown of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan as part of its savings, easing the burden on domestic programs. Unfortunately, it surrenders to the unrealistic Republican demand of no new revenues, cutting too much spending at a time when the economy is still in serious need of government help.
Mr. Reid is negotiating with Republicans on their demands for an enforcement mechanism to make sure the deficit cuts take place in the later years of the deal. Both parties envision a bipartisan panel that could recommend cuts; if those are not adopted, some kind of automatic cuts would go into effect. This automatic knife can be dangerous, arbitrarily cutting without regard to economic circumstances. Democrats should insist that taxes and revenues are not ruled out as a way to lower the deficit.
The House planned a deliberately obstructionist vote on Saturday against the Reid bill, but some Senate Republicans are signaling they are willing to agree to this more reasonable framework. If enough of them can join the Democrats and ignore the bleats of the Tea Party, it may still be possible to avert calamity.

HEADLINE: For Republican Freshmen, the Power of No

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama knew his own power when he stood face to face with Speaker John A. Boehner in the cloakroom off the House floor.
But Mr. Brooks, one of the freshman Republicans who blazed their way into Congress on the promise to tame the national deficit, did not have good news for his leader, who needed his vote to pass debt limit legislation. He stood fast, as well, when other senior lawmakers implored him to get on board with the bill.
On Friday morning, Mr. Brooks got the call that changed his mind; his demands had been met, the House whip told him. Off he went to high-five his chief of staff, who preferred, he said, to shake hands. 
There is an old Texas saying, often applied to politics, of the need to ''dance with the one that brung ya.'' But many of the Tea Party-leaning freshmen who helped the Republican Party take control of the House last November are here to polka while their leadership is begging them to waltz.
The Republican freshmen of the 112th Congress may never see the legislation of their dreams become law, but the scope of their victory in reshaping the debt ceiling bill to reflect the fiscal hawkishness of the most conservative House members cannot be understated.
This victory was presaged by a fight over a short-term spending plan earlier this year in which the freshmen demanded far larger spending cuts than the Republican leaders would have imagined. The power of the 87 freshmen appears sealed, at least for now.
''Certainly there's satisfaction in it,'' Mr. Brooks said of his legislative victory. ''That's why I ran for office. You want to help your country.''
It was a mere eight months ago that Mr. Boehner and his leadership team welcomed the new Republicans -- many of whom had never held public office -- into the fold of his conference, assuring them that they were the future of the party. ''I think it's going to reinvigorate our democracy,'' Mr. Boehner said then of the Tea Party, ''and be a really good thing for the country.''
But the qualities that helped the majority of the freshman Republicans cruise to victory in 2010 -- their promises to challenge the orthodoxy of their own party and offer fealty to no one -- have been an impediment to Mr. Boehner as he tries to negotiate a deal with Democrats to prevent a financial crisis and possible deep damage to an already weak economy.
When the debt fight arrived, ''It was a huge opportunity,'' Mr. Brooks said, to make a significant change to the nation's fiscal policy.
Mr. Brooks read the bill and immediately found it distasteful, because there was not a balanced budget component. So did a lot of his colleagues, a great many of them, though not all, freshmen.
The traditional methods of browbeating members -- offering them treats for their districts -- is frowned upon in this new majority. But the new House members also have little truck with the other time-tested technique of persuasion, appealing to party loyalty.
Mr. Brooks recalled Friday how his senior House colleagues had announced at a meeting: ''This is a team sport. Get on the team.
''Sure,'' he said. ''I'm a member of the Republican team. But the more important team is the American team. Never have I given my vote to somebody else just because they are somebody else.''
Late Thursday night, Mr. Brooks met with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House whip, with a group of other lawmakers, and told him bluntly that he needed a balanced budget amendment within the basic bill, rather than as part two of a two-step plan. Mr. McCarthy, he said, had to sleep on it, then called him Friday morning to say, '' 'If we do it are you still on board,' and I said, 'Absolutely.' ''
In the broadest terms, the Tea Party freshmen have been victorious in changing the national conversation into an almost singular discussion of debt, and creating a consensus that America must do more to live within its means. But it is still not clear whether they will translate their passion into long-term legislative and political accomplishments -- or overreach and undercut their credibility and influence.
''Zealots are great on the campaign trail,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, ''but a huge problem when it comes to governance. They often don't believe in the art of a deal, even with their allies. If they are not tamed, they can eat their own party alive.''
But the freshmen have more to consider than their own party. They also felt the heat from Tea Party activists, including FreedomWorks, which is considering its options for 2012.
''Six months from now, we might look at this vote and say, 'Wow, that was the vote,' '' said Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, who compared it to the vote on the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008.
The current impasse in Congress has often been compared to 1995, when a Republican revolution in the House led by Speaker Newt Gingrich ultimately brought about a coup attempt and eventually Mr. Gingrich's resignation. In this case, at least so far, there is great sympathy for Mr. Boehner among even his most intransigent members, who say that it is the system they are fighting against far more than the House leadership.
But this group of freshmen view the measure of success a bit differently than their predecessors: They are helpers to the speaker in their view, as long as he does things their way.
''The hardest moment was to look my leadership in the eye and tell them 'No sir,' '' said Representative Jeff Landry of Louisiana. ''They were pretty agitated. I'm beat up pretty bad.''
But, Mr. Landry said, the fact that he held out until the last minute served his leadership well.
''When their backs were up against a wall we said, 'Let's see if we can help get you off the wall,' '' he said. ''Leadership is not about getting what you want. It's about getting what you need. So, in the end leadership did its job.''

HEADLINE: That Aug. 2 Deadline? It May Be Impossible, Veteran Lawmakers Say

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Here is advice from veterans of past budget battles in Congress that went to the brink: This time, be afraid. Be very afraid.
The seemingly unbridgeable impasse between the two parties as the deadline for raising the nation's debt limit approaches has Tom Daschle losing sleep, as he never did when he was a Senate Democratic leader in the mid-1990s and Congressional Republicans forced government shutdowns rather than compromise on spending cuts.
''That was nothing compared to this. That was a shutdown of the government; this could be, really, a shutdown of the entire economy,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''You can't be too hyperbolic about the ramifications of all this.'' 
Democrats and Republicans with legislative experience agree that even if both sides decided Saturday to raise the $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling and to reduce future annual deficits, it would be extremely difficult for the compromise measure to wend its way through Congress before Tuesday's deadline, given Congressional legislative procedures.
But such a bipartisan deal seemed virtually impossible on Friday, as House Republicans approved their bill and dug in deeper against compromise with President Obama.
Any possibility of avoiding an economy-shaking default seemed to rest on hopes of a so-far nonexistent compromise in the Senate -- between the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and the Republican minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- that could pass by Tuesday and then be sent to the House.
That would force Speaker John A. Boehner to decide at the 11th hour whether to hold a House vote on a bill that would not get many Republican votes, forcing him to rely on Democrats and perhaps further weaken his leadership, or to risk blame for an economic crisis.
''He's going to have to pass it with Democratic votes. That's going to be a tough decision, but he doesn't have any choice at that point, particularly if the markets are reacting,'' said Tom Davis, a former House Republican leader from Virginia. ''That's the position they've got themselves in.''
But, he added: ''The stakes are much higher here. If interest rates start spiking up, it's going to cost us a lot more than anything you could save. They're playing brinkmanship with our credit rating. That's not very smart.''
Mr. Davis recalled his vote in late September 2008 for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that President George W. Bush sought to rescue a financial system near collapse. ''I hated TARP, but no one had a better alternative,'' he said.
But most of his Republican colleagues opposed the rescue measure and helped defeat it, sending the stock markets tumbling even as the vote was taking place. That reaction forced the Republicans to retreat, and days later a bailout bill carried on a second try.
Mr. Davis predicted that the current standoff over the debt limit could end similarly. ''When the markets react'' -- as early as Monday if there is no compromise in sight -- ''I think the politicians will act,'' he said.
Yet many of the Congressional Republicans who won office last November with the help of the antigovernment Tea Party movement, giving their party control of the House, campaigned on promises to resist any government bailouts and to oppose an increase in the debt limit. Some lawmakers have been quoted describing the debt-limit vote as a way to make up for Republicans' support of the bank rescue three years ago.
Against that backdrop, major business groups issued statements on Friday reiterating their calls for a deal, but with a heightened note of alarm.
The Business Roundtable, an association of executives of some of the country's largest corporations, sent a letter to the White House and Congress warning that ''inaction poses an unacceptable financial risk to the nation's economic growth and job creation'' -- this on a day when the latest economic data confirmed that growth slowed in the second quarter with the fallout of Japan's tsunami, Europe's debt crisis and upheaval in the Middle East.
''Failure to Raise Debt Ceiling Could Turn the Economy Back Into a Recession'' was the headline on a statement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
''I've never seen people genuinely worried like this,'' said Vin Weber, a former representative from Minnesota, now a Republican strategist who has been meeting with other Republicans, including lawmakers, this week. ''This time you have people who genuinely don't know what the outcome is going to be, and they're worried that the wrong outcome could genuinely be disastrous.''

HEADLINE: Obama Reveals Details of Gas Mileage Rules

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- President Obama announced new automobile fuel-efficiency standards on Friday that require an average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. But even if the auto industry manages to meet the new standards, it is unlikely car buyers will see many fuel-economy stickers with such high mileage.
Instead, the average new vehicle in 2025 will probably be closer to 43 miles per gallon, based on the typical 20-percent discount applied by federal officials when rating a car or truck in real-world driving conditions. 
That's one example of how new corporate average fuel economy rules, known as CAFE, will require considerable interpretation for the industry and consumers alike.
Administration officials said Friday that the new fuel rules also contained an intricate set of ''credits'' for auto companies to achieve the new target of 54.5 miles per gallon for their fleets in 14 years.
The system of credits has been devised to encourage new technology and better penetration of current fuel-saving equipment into the market.
Sales of vehicles that run on electric batteries or fuel cells, for example, will be given more weight in the fleet average than normal gas-powered vehicles, even those with particularly efficient engines.
And to give automakers incentives to reduce gas consumption by their biggest vehicles, the new program will give credits for pickup trucks outfitted with gas-electric hybrid technology.
''The incentive program is designed to encourage more supply and use of transformative technology,'' an administration official said Friday.
The president's announcement capped weeks of intensive negotiations between federal officials, carmakers, environmental groups and California regulators, who agreed to follow the new federal guidelines rather than impose their own, more stringent clean-air standards on new vehicles.
The new rules would extend and broaden the existing CAFE rules, which require new cars and trucks to achieve an average of 34 miles per gallon by 2016. Currently, vehicle fleets average 27 miles per gallon.
Under the new program, automakers need to increase the efficiency of cars by 5 percent annually from 2017 to 2025. Light trucks will have to become 3.5 percent more efficient for the first four years of the program, and then 5 percent annually for the remainder of the cycle.
Automakers received a crucial concession that allows for a midterm review of the standards in 2021.
Industry executives generally praised the length of the program because it allowed the companies to begin planning now for the costs of developing cars and trucks down the road.
''Fourteen years is really important to us,'' said Sue Cischke, the chief environmental and safety officer at Ford Motor Company. ''Knowing what's going to happen long term allows us to invest in technology.''
The president acknowledged that reaching the 54.5 standard would require improvements in existing engines and hybrid systems, as well as breakthroughs in other areas, like batteries and advanced alternative-fuel technology.
''There's no silver bullet here,'' the president said at his appearance at the Washington Convention Center, flanked by several fuel-efficient vehicles. ''But there are steps we can take now that will help us become more energy independent.''
The Obama administration estimated that the overall program would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs by the year 2025 and reduce oil consumption by 2.2 million barrels a day. But officials were not yet able to say how much more the cleaner car of the future would cost.
Calculations released by federal officials early in the negotiations estimated that a 56.2 mile-per-gallon standard would add up to $2,500 to the cost of a typical car.
Administration officials said the extra cost has yet to be calculated for the 54.5 miles-per-gallon target. Those numbers will be included in the formal proposal for new CAFE rules due to be filed by September.
Some industry research firms said consumers would expect any rise in the price of a car to be offset by savings at the pump.
''We have a hard time believing that the typical new-car customer will be happy about spending $2,000 more for his or her new car than they otherwise would for fuel economy benefits that may or may not be in their favor,'' said Jack R. Nerad, executive director of the car-buying guide Kelley Blue Book.

HEADLINE: Obama's Crucible Moment at Intersection of Politics and the Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was a day that brought fresh evidence of all the forces converging on President Obama in the latter half of his term: a weakened economy he cannot lift, a deeply divided Congress he cannot move and, as a result, a level of political risk he seems hard-pressed to control.
The report on Friday that the economy grew at an anemic 1.3 percent rate in the second quarter dimmed chances of the nation's 9.2 percent unemployment rate falling quickly as Mr. Obama heads into his re-election campaign. 
As Congressional leaders scrambled to find some path toward resolution of the fight over raising the government's debt ceiling, Mr. Obama remained largely a bystander, left to implore citizens to phone their lawmakers to press for a deal. The White House dismissed calls for the president to invoke an untested and much-debated constitutional provision to avert a financial crisis as the Treasury Department prepared for the possibility of a default whose implications seemed that much greater given the fragility of the economy.
Mr. Obama was hardly alone in facing potential political peril. Speaker John A. Boehner scrambled through the day to quell a Tea Party rebellion that called into question Republican priorities and the party's ability to govern. Polls have shown independent voters siding with Mr. Obama's approach to deficit reduction and crediting his party with greater willingness to compromise.
Yet the risks remain high for the incumbent president -- to his economic stewardship and his reputation for effectiveness. The former profoundly influences the latter, raising the stakes for his attempt to insist that Congress raise the debt limit enough to prevent a repeat of this battle in the middle of 2012.
Austan Goolsbee, the departing chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, pointed to weakening confidence by consumers and businesses as evidence that months of battles over government borrowing and finances had taken a toll.
''Uncertainty over the debt ceiling has been radioactive,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. ''You certainly don't want to give yourself multiple doses in a short period of time.''
Moreover, Mr. Obama has precious few remedies left to administer. Not only is there negligible political appetite for new stimulus spending, but administration officials fear that the near-term deficit-reduction measures Republicans have insisted on could further undermine the frail recovery.
In one way or another, every president faces crucible moments at the intersection between politics and the economy.
For President George W. Bush, it came in the fall of 2008 when he decided to ask Congress to support an unpopular $700 billion bailout of Wall Street as the only alternative to financial collapse. Fortunately for Mr. Bush, he had no need to court voters since his second term was nearly over, but members of his party in Congress later paid the price for their reluctant support when they were held to account by conservatives.
For President Bill Clinton, it came in the winter of 1995 when he faced off with a Republican Congress over a government shutdown. The electorate decided that Congress had overreached, and Mr. Clinton cruised to re-election.
For President George Bush, it came in the fall of 1990, when he negotiated with a Democratic Congress over deficit reduction. Their first bargain fell to a rebellion by Mr. Bush's fellow Republicans; a second deal more favorable to Democrats passed, but those political wounds, the lingering effects of a recession and fallout from breaking his read-my-lips tax pledge denied him a second term.
Mr. Obama's moment blends strains of each of those crises.
Unlike the younger Mr. Bush, who left office a few months after the bailout, Mr. Obama is just beginning his re-election campaign. Mr. Clinton ran in 1996 against one of the Republican leaders he had bested in the government shutdown fight, Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader; prominent Republican prospects for 2012 like former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas are well-positioned to run as anti-Washington outsiders.
Mr. Clinton approached his re-election with unemployment in July 1995 at 5.7 percent, which was significantly lower than when he took office. Because of today's weak economy, Mr. Obama ''doesn't have a lot of domestic accomplishments'' to point to, said Mark Penn, an adviser to Mr. Clinton in 1996 and to Hillary Rodham Clinton when she opposed Mr. Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination.
Mr. Penn said fumbles by Congressional Republicans in recent days had provided an opportunity for the White House to win the debt-ceiling endgame. But he said that Mr. Obama's job-approval ratings had declined lately amid the stalemate; Gallup's daily tracking poll on Friday showed the president at a new low of 40 percent.
If anything positive for Mr. Obama has emerged from this week's debt and deficit turbulence, it may be that Republicans are acquiring a measure of responsibility for the nation's economic woes, a consequence that Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, has publicly fretted about. Their stake increases in tandem with any tangible economic damage that would result from a potential government default or credit-rating downgrade.
''They have jumped into the co-pilot seat,'' said Geoff Garin, a pollster for Democratic candidates. ''There's no version of a good economy a year from now, but we'll have a big debate about who owns the bad economy.''
Yet an incumbent president is always the most conspicuous representative of Washington and the nation's economic performance. Even if he emerges from the final debt limit maneuvering as a voice of reason and compromise who withstood what Democrats will cast as Republican extremism, he remains vulnerable to an overwhelmingly gloomy public mood.
''You can't assess the battle until the battle is over -- much less the war,'' said Andrew Card, who served on the White House staffs of both George Bushes. ''Right now I think it's a lose-lose.''

HIGHLIGHT: With a deadline looming on Tuesday to raise the debt ceiling, the specter of default dominates the Sunday talk shows.

 BODY:
With an ominous deadline to raise the debt ceiling looming on Tuesday, the White House and Congressional lawmakers are still far from reaching a deal. The impasse raises the central question of this Sunday's talk shows: Will America default?
Key players in the negotiations appear on the talk show circuit. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, appear on CBS's "Face the Nation" and CNN's "State of the Union." On "Fox News Sunday," the Senate whips -- Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona -- have their say.
After a near-miss attempt this week to pass House Republicans' debt proposal, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip, also appears on Fox News.
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who sits on the Appropriations and Budget committees, weighs in on ABC's "This Week" on whether the current proposals -- one from House Republicans, the other from Senate Democrats -- go far enough to rein in federal spending and long-term budget deficits. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, a Tea Party-backed Republican freshman, who voted against his party's plan, offers the conservative take on CNN.
For its part, the White House dispatches Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, to CNN and Fox News; David Plouffe, a senior adviser to President Obama, appears on ABC and NBC's "Meet the Press."
Also on NBC, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, and John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, discuss the negotiations in the upper chamber.
With the United States' debt rating hanging in limbo, executives from Wall Street step in to discuss the consequences of a possible default and its impact on the rest of the world. CNN has Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics. Dr. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of PIMCO, a major investment management firm, appears on ABC.
Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, and Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, another Tea Party Republican, take part in NBC's round table discussion.
And after a deadly domestic attack stunned Norway, Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City police commissioner, discusses whether law enforcement agencies in the United States are prepared for potential threats at home. He appears on ABC.

HEADLINE: The Corrosion of the Conservative Economic Mind

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Reagan delusions. 

 BODY:
First Michael Boskin, now John Taylor: there seems be an epidemic of politically conservative economists who used to be technically competent repeating the obviously wrong falsehood that Reagan ushered in an era of "unprecedented" growth.
No matter what measure you use, it just ain't so -- and I thought every macroeconomist in America knew it wasn't so. Here's one measure that the BLS happens to have put in a convenient chart, so that I'm not choosing the dates, they are:
This shows what everyone was supposed to know: we had an awesome performance in the generation following the war (despite very high tax rates on the rich and a very strong union movement); we had a long period of poor productivity performance that spanned the Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush I administrations; we then had a revival during the Clinton administration, but even so not up to postwar standards. By the way, I don't give Clinton credit for that revival; it was about learning to use technology. But in any case, there is no hint of a Reagan miracle in the data.
So what on earth is going on with people like Boskin and Taylor? It's not hard to guess; but as Dan Quayle said, a mind is a terrible thing to lose.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Rejection

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
House Republicans passed a fiscal plan that Senate Democrats quickly rejected on Friday in a standoff over the federal debt ceiling. The two parties made no progress toward finding common ground just days before the nation risks defaulting on its loans, leaving Washington, Wall Street and much of the country watching the clock move toward a deadline of midnight Tuesday, Carl Hulse and Robert Pear report.
 

        
The report on Friday that the economy grew 1.3 percent in the second quarter dimmed chances of the nation's 9.1 percent unemployment rate falling quickly, John Harwood reports. It was a day that brought fresh evidence of all the forces converging on President Obama in the latter half of his term: a weakened economy, a deeply divided Congress and as a result, a political outlook he cannot predict.


        
The Republican freshmen of the 112th Congress may never see the legislation of their dreams become law, but their victory in reshaping the debt ceiling bill to reflect the fiscal hawkishness of the most conservative House members cannot be understated, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. The legislative demands of first-term Republicans in the House have been met, much to the chagrin of party leadership who has been forced to cave under the power wielded by their rookie colleagues.


        
Tom Daschle, a former Senate leader from South Dakota, looked to the past and found did little to sooth fears about where the debt-ceiling debate was heading, saying it is worse than the government shutdowns of the mid-1990s because this could be "a shutdown of the entire economy." Members from both sides of the aisle agree: Even if party leaders work out a deal on Saturday to raise the borrowing ceiling, it would be virtually impossible for the compromise measure to clear Congressional legislative procedures before Tuesday's deadline, Jackie Calmes reports.

Weekly Address

        
President Obama cautioned against losing the nation's Triple A credit rating in his weekly address, "not because we didn't have the capacity to pay our bills - we do - but because we didn't have a Triple A political system to match it." He went on to condemn House Republicans for spending "precious days" trying to pass a plan that they knew would not survive in the Senate. "The power to solve this is in our hands," he said. "There are plenty of ways out of this mess. But there is very little time."

HEADLINE: Coming Together to Pray, and Also to Find Reduced-Rate Energy Deals

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Like manna from heaven, thousands of dollars in new revenue is raining on a group of congregations here from the unlikeliest of sources: the utility bill.
The windfall arose after 11 churches and a nonprofit youth group got together to solicit reduced-rate bids for electricity -- most of it from renewable energy sources -- from local suppliers. In the first year of its contract, which ends in May, the group expects combined savings of nearly $100,000.
As the good word has spread, and it gears up to negotiate a second contract, the original group has swelled to 40 members. The bigger alliance plans to exercise even more leverage in the next round of negotiations by requiring bidders to extend the same discounted rate to individual parishioners and members.
And more revenue is on the way: the group is planning to take a cut of those residential savings as a kind of eco-tithe. 
''These are not the kinds of things that are taught at seminary,'' said the Rev. Dr. Donna Claycomb Sokol, pastor of Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church, which is joining the bulk purchasing this year. ''How to save money with our energy -- it's innovative and exciting.''
With their cavernous sanctuaries, large meeting spaces and multi-use buildings often open day and night, churches, synagogues and other religious spaces are particularly clobbered by utility bills that can run into the thousands of dollars each month. Beyond dollars and cents, many congregations also consider environmental measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of their duty to care for God's creation.
The Energy Star program, which created a certification system for houses of worship a year and a half ago, calculates that by cutting energy use by at least 10 percent, the nation's estimated 370,000 religious buildings could save a combined $315 million a year and reduce emissions by the equivalent of taking 240,000 cars off the road.
''That $315 million would be available for their missions helping the poor and the needy,'' said Maura Beard, a spokeswoman for Energy Star.
Many congregations already treat the environment as a fundamental part of their mission. Officials with Interfaith Power & Light, a network of religious institutions with affiliates in 38 states, said members are installing solar panels, undertaking energy-saving retrofits, buying green power, instilling a love for the earth in sermons and lobbying elected officials for clean energy alternatives.
''It's about values and moral responsibility,'' said the Rev. Canon Sally G. Bingham, the Episcopalian minister who founded the network in San Francisco in 2000 and has seen it grow to 14,000 members, with nearly half of them signing on in the last four years.
''Some are doing it for financial reasons, but most do it because of the devastating effects of pollution on poor people,'' she said. ''Every mainstream religion has a mandate to serve each other, especially the poor.''
The churches in Washington forged their alliance with help from the Washington Interfaith Network, which does community organizing for member congregations and is now receiving a 10 percent cut of the overall electricity savings. The other group that helped bring the churches together, the DC Project, is a nonprofit that promotes weatherization and green energy jobs.
Felipe Witchger, the lead organizer with the DC Project, said that the next contract will require participants, which now also include synagogues and affiliates like unions and advocacy groups, to either buy renewable energy or commit to energy-efficiency upgrades. For the upgrades, he said, workers from neighborhoods with high unemployment and poverty rates would be hired.
At St. Columba's Episcopal Church in northwest Washington, an environmental committee was created from the congregation of 3,800 several years ago to come up with energy-saving measures like installing motion sensor lights and purchasing wind power through the local utility.
Still, said Paul J. Barkett, the church's chief operating officer, St. Columba's faced monthly energy bills that averaged $8,000, mostly to heat and cool two buildings housing the church, which opens its showers, washers and dryers to about 35 of the community's homeless people.
St. Columba's now expects to save up to $12,000 a year after joining the purchasing group. The church operates on an annual budget of $2.4 million that is mostly drawn from parishioners' contributions, he said.
''Every dollar we're not giving to Pepco for electricity,'' Mr. Barkett said, referring to the local utility, ''it's a dollar we can put into our mission and ministry and furthering our presence.''
It is not unusual for businesses, municipalities, schools and other institutions to come together to buy electric power in bulk for a discounted price, said the Retail Energy Supply Association, a trade group. But congregations banding together across denominations -- and working into their contract energy efficiency improvements and residential discounts for members -- are fairly new, some energy companies said. This is possible in markets like Washington and 16 other states where multiple power suppliers compete for business.
In its first year, this approach will result in electric bills that are 15 to 20 percent lower and annual savings that range from a few thousand dollars to $33,000 per institution, according to the DC Project.
Some companies are particularly excited about the potential to add thousands of residential customers through the religious group.
''We're now getting new customers in the D.C. marketplace in a very innovative way,'' said Nelson Reyneri, vice president for national accounts at Liberty Power, the national retail energy company based in Florida that won the group's first contracts and plans to bid again. But not all congregations are buying green power, which sells for about $1 more per megawatt hour than conventional energy.
''I'm not sure that I understand the whole green thing,'' said the Rev. Al Hammer, an associate pastor at Foundry United Methodist Church.
''You're not really buying green power,'' he said. ''You're basically buying credits, and it gets really confusing. I'd rather move away from that until they get it clear.''
So for now, he said, he will stick with conventional power and use the savings to fix the church's drafty windows.
The Rev. Thomas J. Knoll of First Trinity Lutheran Church said he worries that energy savings may not be sustainable themselves if electricity prices fluctuate too much and an increase shrinks the pot of money his church is relying on.
Though cautious in his enthusiasm, Mr. Knoll said the expected discounts, in particular for individual members of his 140-member congregation, would come in handy as a recruiting pitch.
''I'd say to people: if you join this church, you can also apply for a lower electric rate,'' he said. ''Why wouldn't I do that? It's the truth.''

HEADLINE: Some Bankers Never Learn

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
YOU'D think the mortgage bust would qualify as a teachable moment.
But some people refuse to learn from mistakes -- a list that apparently includes certain mortgage bankers. Their industry is fighting a new rule that might prevent a repeat of the lending binge that helped drive our economy off a cliff.
In case you just arrived from another planet: America's mortgage mania was fueled by home loans with poisonous features that made them virtually impossible to repay. It was fun while it lasted, at least for the financial types who profited by making dubious loans and selling them to investors. 
But the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul last year barred lenders from making home loans before determining that people could probably repay them.
(It's depressing that we have to legislate common sense, but, hey, that's the world we live in.)
Dodd-Frank also required regulators to define the characteristics of loans that would most likely be repaid. The idea was to ensure that banks had skin in the game when they bundled risky mortgages into securities.
The proposal was this: If a mortgage security contains only high-quality loans, the banks can sell the entire offering. If the investments included riskier mortgages, the underwriters must keep 5 percent of the issue on their own books.
Basically, Wall Street would have to eat a bit of its own cooking.
Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the comptroller of the currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development all agreed on what makes a mortgage most likely to perform well. They examined how different types of loans defaulted, and the attributes of the borrowers in question. Then they invited the public to comment on their proposal; that comment period ends tomorrow.
One attribute of safer loans, the regulators found, was that homeowners had made a down payment of at least 20 percent. Another was that their monthly housing debt payments did not exceed 28 percent of their monthly income, and that their total monthly debt payments did not exceed 36 percent.
In other words, regulators said, a relatively low-risk mortgage should look an awful lot like the ones that local banks made before the days of securitization on steroids. Regulators also said that the origination costs on low-risk mortgages should no more than 3 percent of the amount borrowed.
THE mortgage industry squawked. It would prefer that we return to the days of high-fee, anything-goes lending. That is not surprising. But what is surprising is that mortgage bankers are leaning on the same tired argument -- that saner lending requirements will undermine the goal of expanding homeownership.
In a comment letter filed with regulators last week, David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, warned that the requirements on down payments and debt-to-income ratios were ''unnecessary and not worth the societal costs of excluding far too many qualified borrowers from the most affordable mortgage loans to achieve homeownership.''
Mr. Stevens, who last March left his job as federal housing commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, didn't mention the enormous costs associated with reckless lending. We are still tallying the bills, but to date, taxpayers have funneled $154 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Investors have suffered even greater damage.
While we are discussing societal costs, let's not forget how minority borrowers and first-time homebuyers were the targets of predatory lenders who lured them into toxic loans loaded with fees.
A study issued last week on the widening wealth gap between minorities and white Americans points to the costs of predatory lending. Conducted by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, the study noted that housing woes were the principal cause of precipitous declines in household net worth among both Hispanics and blacks from 2005 through 2009. The organization found that, adjusted for inflation, the median wealth of Hispanic households fell by two-thirds during that period. The wealth of black households declined 53 percent. The net worth of white households fell only 16 percent.
And yet, Mr. Stevens noted in his letter that the mortgage bankers were ''working in harmony with a very wide coalition of consumer advocates, civil rights groups and other industry associations, to educate policy makers and legislators concerning this rule.''
One wonders how people who have lost their homes because of abusive lending practices feel about their ''advocates'' forming an alliance with mortgage lenders on this issue.
Mr. Stevens also argues that restricting mortgage fees to 3 percent, as proposed, would hurt borrowers by reducing their access to credit. Noting that his association opposes excessive fees, he wrote that his group ''knows of no data evidencing that points and fees have affected borrowers' ability to repay their loans.''
He told a different story when he was at HUD overseeing the portfolio of loans insured by the F.H.A.
Testifying before Congress in May 2010, Mr. Stevens cited five years of F.H.A. data showing that loans in which the seller of the property helped defray a borrower's origination costs by more than 3 percent, known as a sellers' concession, experienced significantly greater default rates.
In 2008, for example, F.H.A.'s insurance claims on loans where sellers covered 3 percent to 6 percent of buyers' costs were 50 percent higher than claims on loans where concessions from sellers fell below 3 percent.
The higher concessions created ''incentives to inflate appraised value,'' Mr. Stevens testified. In other words, high costs do have consequences.
Mr. Stevens, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
As the advocate of the mortgage banking industry, Mr. Stevens is entitled to express the industry's views. But it would be troubling if such arguments gained traction with regulators. In the years leading up to the crisis, the Mortgage Bankers Association and other financial trade groups persuaded regulators to postpone or water down rules that could have reined in subprime lending relatively early. We all know the consequences -- and surely do not need to repeat past mistakes.

 BODY:
Readers react to Wednesday's letter urging a more ambitious space program focusing on Mars.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''After the Space Shuttle'' (editorial, July 22): As one of the most enthusiastic supporters of human spaceflight for 60 years, I appreciate your support of a ''far more ambitious set of manned voyages'' to follow the end of the shuttle program (which did, indeed, fail to live up to its promise) and ''inspire a new generation.''
I believe that Apollo and the shuttle's Hubble telescope repair flights proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight. Apollo sent half a dozen manned expeditions to land on the moon in less than a dozen years from the program's conception. That's ''ambitious,'' and it certainly inspired my generation.
Unfortunately, I cannot characterize the Obama plan as either ambitious or inspiring. President Obama wants us to spend the next 25 years on scientifically useless stunts like sending manned expeditions to land on a small asteroid and to orbit Mars. 
The goal is to land on Mars and search for life. We should immediately start on the Mars Direct proposal of Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society. We could return to the moon before this decade is out, followed by the first human landing on Mars early in the next decade. We could have permanent bases on the moon and perhaps Mars by the end of the next decade.

Like Mr. Morris, I, too, was thrilled by the Apollo program and heartened by the Hubble telescope repair, but I do not believe that either really ''proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight.''
Yes, there is excitement associated with manned space ventures, but these programs have been exceptionally costly, often wasteful and, of course, risky. Much more can be learned (and I would argue has been learned) about our universe through unmanned programs at far lower costs and with far lower risks.
Unless we can invent an inexpensive and safe, reliable way of supporting human beings in space (something that would seem exceptionally unlikely), whatever the future of humankind will be, it will be on Earth, not on our Moon, not on Mars and, I would agree, certainly not on a small asteroid.
Yes, we could return to the Moon and try to stay there, and we might be able to land human beings on Mars and try to stay there as well. But we should have learned the lessons of the last five decades or so. Too much was promised and too little achieved in putting humans into space and sustaining them there. These would, indeed, be ''stunts'' with only marginal real benefits for their extraordinary costs.
There are any number of other worthy and inspiring things that can and should be done on Earth, including doing whatever we can to make sure that it remains safe and secure for human (and all other species') habitation. That should be our legacy to future generations.
RICHARD D. REDDY Fredonia, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The writer is a professor of sociology at SUNY Fredonia.
Those of us who grew up on Walt Disney's ''Man in Space'' TV shows in the 1950s, which were narrated by Wernher von Braun, eagerly swallowed the promise of bases on the Moon and Mars and who knew where else Out There in our lifetime.
But after cold-war-driven Apollo, the big money for human space exploration ran out and has never come back. Every president since John F. Kennedy has possessed a nice space program on paper, but no other president has had the cash to ''make it so.'' President Obama doesn't have it, that's for sure.
What never ran out, of course, was the dreaming of Mr. Morris and millions of other Americans of a certain age. No amount of reality -- technical and management weaknesses that led to either deadly catastrophes or astronomic costs -- ever came close to overcoming the dreaming (and old-fashioned politics) that carried the shuttle program forward from start to finish.
My old heart is with you, Dick, sort of, but the thrill is gone.
WAYNE BIDDLE Baltimore, July 27, 2011
The writer is a former science and technology reporter for The New York Times and the author of ''Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich and the Space Race.''
Mr. Morris's call for ''Mars Direct'' and human bases on Mars in 10 years is more ideological than practical. On the one hand, we have space enthusiasts who with unlimited enthusiasm and without political, economic, scientific or technological constraints advocate crash programs like Apollo.
On the other hand, we have politicians, most notably in Congress, designing human spaceflight simply to provide contracts to their constituents without regard for any real accomplishments or goals.
The latter group has made a mess of human spaceflight planning and may doom it to another 30 years of purposeless Earth-orbit flights. The former group, represented by Mr. Morris, has been totally marginalized in the political system.
We had a solution. The prestigious national commission led by a former aerospace executive, Norm Augustine, devised a flexible, sustainable ''pay as you go'' approach to exploring beyond Earth orbit. President Obama substantially adopted the plan.
Sadly, members of the space community didn't unite behind the president, instead preferring the Balkanized approach -- insisting that their favorite project, rocket contract or engineering approach was the only thing that they would support.
It appears that humans will dither on Earth rather than fly anywhere beyond it.
LOUIS FRIEDMAN Executive Director Emeritus The Planetary Society Pasadena, Calif., July 27, 2011
While I hesitate to call President Obama's plans for the next generation of American space exploration ''scientifically useless,'' I agree wholeheartedly that they fall far short of being ''ambitious'' and ''inspiring.''
In today's partisan political climate, our nation is in desperate need of a unifying endeavor, of an accomplishment that every American can point to and say, We did this. Not since we first landed on the Moon in 1969 has there been such a unifying factor in American life.
Americans are in search of something greater than themselves, a mission worthy of our nation. What better way to bring the country together than to look to the stars and launch ourselves into the heavens?
JUSTIN H. GRANSTEIN Scarsdale, N.Y., July 27, 2011
While I agree with Mr. Morris that the country should plan on a return to the Moon and ultimately send humans to Mars, I think we should focus on the process we use to get there. In the 1950s, Wernher von Braun (among others) advised that we develop rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages, build a permanent space station that incorporated artificial gravity (through rotation), use that station as a platform for staging lunar exploration, develop a permanent lunar colony, and finally, send humans to Mars.
Instead, at President John F. Kennedy's direction, we began a crash program to send men to the Moon. The result was a series of purpose-built rockets and spacecraft that left no successor hardware once the Apollo program ended. The space shuttle similarly represents a dead-end technology. And the multibillion-dollar space station is scheduled to be deorbited after 2020 , leaving nothing behind.
Part of the reason this keeps happening is fickle and insufficient financing by the government. But undoubtedly part of the problem lies with NASA's inability or unwillingness to outline a clear long-term development program that results in sustainable and evolving technology.
I support the current administration's decision to rely more on private industry to push new technologies and hardware programs forward. NASA can assist with grants for research and prototype development, but ultimately, it should be up to private industry to get us into space and keep us there.
As for the space station, I suggest that we auction it off to a consortium of private companies while it still has some economic value. Perhaps they can find a way to extend its useful life and use it as base for further development.
JAY EDELMAN Fremont, Calif., July 27, 2011
In decrying President Obama's rollback of the American space program, Mr. Morris reminds us that the exploration of the final frontier is far from a faded dream.
A manned mission to Mars within the next 20 years would bolster job creation and reclaim America's role as a pre-eminent spacefaring country. Moreover, the quest for life in other worlds would yield a mother lode of scientific knowledge.
Apollo 11 helped us shed the bonds of terra firma. When the Eagle lunar module alighted on the shores of an alien sea -- the moon's Mare Tranquillitatis -- it was the culmination of centuries of human progress. We had escaped low Earth orbit to soar the skyway of the gods.
We must not forsake our cosmic destiny. Though a journey to the stars is fraught with peril and hardship, it remains humanity's most noble imperative: Per ardua ad astra (through adversity to the stars).
ROSARIO A. IACONIS Mineola, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The last shuttle flight is not the end. Indeed, much of the excitement is still in space. Our bodies may go into space less often, or not at all, but the hummingbirds we send up continue to sing back to us.
Voyager I and II, launched nearly four years before the first shuttle, have left the solar system and to this day are talking to us about the edge of our sun's influence. The Spirit rover, intended to tweet to us from Mars for three months, sang loud for six years. Its brother, Opportunity, still sings, and successors are planned.
Cassini has been joyously celebrating its vacation in orbit around Saturn since 2004 and has made plans to stay until 2017.
Many more of our little birds are talking to us, including Messenger, which entered orbit around Mercury just four months ago.
What's not to be excited about?
EDWARD REID Tallahassee, Fla., July 27, 2011
President Obama's manned spaceflight plans, while far from audacious, reflect an unfortunate reality: There is little political will in Congress to adequately finance a return to the Moon in 10 years and land on Mars shortly thereafter. The commercial crew program, which relies on private companies to build and operate orbital spacecraft, and the plans for a rendezvous with an asteroid by 2025 are more within the realm of possibility given current budget constraints.
The 2025 asteroid mission is hardly useless scientifically. It will be the first test of our ability to send astronauts far beyond the Earth-Moon system -- critical to a Mars mission. And if we ever have to deflect a space object from a collision course with Earth, understanding how to interact with asteroids is crucial.
Landing on Mars will be an extraordinarily hazardous and costly enterprise. We should be realistic about the timeline for manned space exploration, particularly in the face of deep cuts to NASA's budget.
ALEX TEACHEY Brooklyn, July 27, 2011
I agree with Mr. Morris's comments about pursuing deeper missions in space: a Moon space station, a manned mission to Mars! Instead, what appears to be happening is an entrepreneurial ''gold rush'' to the moon for the Google LunarX Prize, and an emphasis on the moon as the next big ''market'' ( ''In a Private Race to the Moon, Flights of Fancy Are in the Air,'' front page, July 22).
Let us go to the moon, but as a public-private, scientifically viable expedition that is in the interest of all mankind. Let us be guided by, and expand, both the Outer Space Treaty (1967) and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979).
These United Nations agreements emphasize that the moon (and other celestial bodies) should be explored for the benefit of all mankind; that its exploration should prevent disruption of its environment; and that its resources are the common heritage of all mankind.

The Writer Responds
Like Mr. Granstein, I hesitated to characterize the planned precursor missions to an asteroid or Mars orbit as ''scientifically useless,'' but did so because I have not seen a credible explanation of what scientific, or other, benefits will result from them. For example, we do not need a manned expedition to return samples from an asteroid. Indeed, we already have tens, if not hundreds, of tons of asteroid samples in museums and private collections. They're called ''meteorites.'' We know what asteroids are made of in great detail. Nor do we need to know the composition of a particular asteroid before deflecting it from a potential collision course with Earth.
The proposed precursor missions amount to little more than test flights of some of the systems that we will use to return to the Moon and go on to Mars. But there are other ways to accomplish that, and more, such as by landing the initial elements of a lunar base on the Moon, over a period of about a year, followed by a manned lunar landing, using the same hardware that will be used for Mars flights.
I agree with Professor Reddy that we need much greater efforts to control costs and improve reliability, and that unmanned spacecraft have returned a great deal of useful information. Unmanned spacecraft do an excellent job of taking photographs and measuring particles and fields under remote control, but I think a case can be made that, based on the amount of information returned, the Apollo landings were more cost-effective than the unmanned precursors.
As for Mars, the Spirit rover was a wonderful little machine and Opportunity rover continues to be, but a manned expedition could have accomplished as much exploration in a few weeks and returned actual samples as well.
Contrary to the claim by Mr. Friedman, I do not advocate a ''crash program'' but a properly paced one: stretching programs out, such as by developing program elements in series that are designed to work together, greatly increases their total costs. A first Mars landing is doable in 10 to 12 years, but a permanent base will take more like 20 to 25 years.
I am acutely aware of the political constraints that have confined us to low Earth orbit for nearly 40 years, but the technological constraints have been overblown: We have had virtually all the technology required for manned expeditions to Mars for decades. There were serious and credible plans for manned Mars expeditions to follow up on the Apollo program.
If the manned space program had been competently managed from the early 1970s through the early 1990s, we would have bases on the Moon and Mars today, and it all could have cost less than we have actually spent in the interim.
The cost of everything we do in space is largely a function of the cost of getting there. Low-cost Earth-to-orbit transportation requires that we build reliable, fully reusable launch vehicles, and we have had the technology to do that for more than 40 years. A two-stage, fully reusable, vertical-takeoff-and-landing launcher could have been developed for about what we spent on the shuttle, and would have cost far less to operate.
Such a vehicle would have many other uses besides human lunar and Mars exploration, thus immunizing those programs from cancellation, as happened with Apollo.
This country needs, and deserves, a more aggressive human spaceflight program, and it needs it now. The capabilities of thousands of engineers and technicians will be difficult to recreate later once they have been lost. And we are at great risk of losing what remains of our lead in space technology and development.

HEADLINE: Owners Abandoning Ill and Aging Pets in Hard Times

BYLINE: By JAMIE HANSEN. 
jhansen@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A Pit Bull puppy with Parvovirus and a Shih Tzu that had been hit by a car are just two examples of pets that have been abandoned by their owners at East Bay animal shelters in recent months. 
To the operators of the shelters, the growing number of sick animals arriving at their doors is a disturbing sign of the economic times: pet owners are surrendering their sick or old animals because they cannot afford to pay the medical bills.
''People seem to be dropping them off rather than treating them,'' said Allison Lindquist, executive director of the East Bay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ''When it comes down to feeding your family or helping your pet, that's a hard decision to make.''
Ms. Lindquist recalled that when a Pekingese, who was 12, was down to a single tooth, her owner simply handed her across the counter.
''I just can't handle it,'' the owner said.
Pet surrenders were already high as the recession led people to downsize or to lose their homes. Now, having an animal that needs expensive medical attention is becoming yet another breaking point for strapped pet owners.
Afflictions that lead to a pet's being surrendered run the gamut from broken legs to flea infestations -- even the cost of grooming for dogs that require frequent care can be the last straw, Ms. Lindquist said.
Most shelters have not consistently kept track of the number of sick animals being turned in over the years, but shelter providers gave anecdotal evidence of the rise in sick animals being dropped off.
Kate O'Connor, manager of Animal Care Services in Berkeley, said she has seen more sick pets -- including dying puppies and a one-eyed Chihuahua -- left at the night drop box, where anyone can leave an animal after hours.
Megan Webb, director of Oakland Animal Services, said she had noticed more people asking to have sick pets euthanized -- something many cannot afford to have done on their own, even if the animal is suffering. Sometimes pets that have been dropped off to be euthanized turn out to be healthy enough to live.
The problem is worse in places still dealing with high rates of unemployment and foreclosures. Alameda and Contra Costa Counties have two of the highest unemployment rates in the nine-county Bay Area, and shelter operators in both report a rise in the number of abandoned sick animals.
In contrast, areas with stronger economies report fewer sick animals arriving at their doors or no increase at all.
Marin County has a relatively low unemployment rate, 7.4 percent. Its animal service provider, the Marin Humane Society, initially saw a spike in animal drop-offs when the recession hit, but last year the number began to return to normal.
Sandra Stadler, superintendent of Palo Alto Animal Services, said the city had seen a small increase in the number of animals coming in as families were forced to downsize, but no noticeable rise in the number of animals with medical problems.
''But,'' Ms. Stadler said, ''that could be because of our demographic.''

HEADLINE: Farmers Oppose G.O.P. Bill to Require Verification of Workers' Immigration Status

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and JULIA PRESTON; Jesse McKinley reported from Patterson, Calif., and Julia Preston from New York.

 BODY:
PATTERSON, Calif. -- Farmers across the country are rallying to fight a Republican-sponsored bill that would force them and all other employers to verify the legal immigration status of their workers, a move some say could imperil not only future harvests but also the agricultural community's traditional support for conservative candidates.
The bill was proposed by Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. It would require farmers -- who have long relied on a labor force of immigrants, a majority here without legal documents -- to check all new hires through E-Verify, a federal database run by the Department of Homeland Security devised to ferret out illegal immigrants.
Farm laborers, required like other workers to show that they are authorized to take jobs in the United States, often present Social Security numbers and some form of picture ID. Employers, many of them labor contractors providing crews to farms, have not been required to check the information and are discouraged by antidiscrimination laws from looking at it too closely. But it is an open secret that many farmworkers' documents are false. 
Supporters of E-Verify, an electronic system that is currently mandatory for most federal contractors but voluntary for other employers, argue that it would eliminate any doubt about workers' legal status. But farmers say it could cripple a $390 billion industry that relies on hundreds of thousands of willing, low-wage immigrant workers to pick, sort and package everything from avocados to zucchini.
''This would be an emergency, a dire, dire situation,'' said Nancy Foster, president of the U.S. Apple Association, adding that the prospect of an E-Verify check would most likely mean that many immigrant workers would simply not show up. ''We will end up closing down.''
That sentiment is echoed by growers like George Bonacich, an 81-year-old apricot farmer who has been working the same patch of land in Patterson, 80 miles east of San Francisco, since 1969.
This year, Mr. Bonacich employed up to 100 farmhands to pick a total of 50 to 100 tons each day, often in triple-digit heat. He speaks passionately about his employees -- ''They're good people, hard-working,'' he said -- and plainly about what would happen if E-Verify were to become the law of the farmland.
''If we don't have enough labor at peak time, the fruit goes on the ground,'' he said. ''The fruit will only stay on the tree so long.''
While Mr. Smith's bill seems to have a good chance of passing the House, the Senate, controlled by Democrats, appears more skeptical. Democrats have said they will point to a Congressional Budget Office report on a similar bill that concluded it would cost the federal government $22 billion over a decade, from lost tax revenues now collected from the paychecks of illegal immigrants ineligible for services.
In a May letter to the members of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Stallman, the president of the American Farm Bureau, cited a Labor Department survey placing the percentage of illegal workers in the fields at more than 50 percent. Other groups say the figure is closer to 70 percent. Denying farmers that labor supply, Mr. Stallman wrote, would cost them $5 billion to $9 billion annually.
Mr. Smith's bill has attracted more solid support from nonagricultural business leaders, opening a divide between them and agricultural interests. Many nonfarm businesses have concluded that some form of employee verification is inevitable.
National organizations of restaurant owners and home builders gave their backing. The San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which unites Latino businesses in Mr. Smith's district that have often been at odds with him, is leaning toward endorsing the bill, said Ramiro A. Cavazos, the president of the chamber.
Still, Mr. Smith, whose district includes parts of suburban San Antonio and Austin as well as a large part of the nearby Hill Country, recently acknowledged the surge of worry in rural areas. He said he would soon introduce a separate bill to ''address the needs of the agriculture industry,'' either proposing changes to the current federal temporary farm worker program, known as H-2A, or offering a new guest worker program.
Mr. Smith's E-Verify bill also includes a three-year grace period before growers would have to comply. But such caveats have done little to quell opposition from farm groups, who have been pleading for years for an overhaul to allow a legal immigrant work force.
And that discontent could manifest itself in elections, farm representatives warn.
''Most of our folks are Republicans,'' said Paul Wenger, the president of the California Farm Bureau. ''But if the Republicans do this to them without a workable worker program, it will change their voting patterns or at very least their involvement in politics.''
Mr. Smith said requiring employers to determine that new hires were eligible to work would prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs at a time of high joblessness for Americans. ''We could open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans and legal workers,'' he said.
But farmers and their advocates scoff at that notion, saying that regardless of high unemployment, few American workers are willing to sign up for what are often hard, hot and long hours in the fields.
''People just don't want to do farm work,'' Mr. Wenger said. ''They don't want to pick berries. They don't want to pick lettuce. And the pay is just as good as working at the hamburger shop or making up hotel rooms, but they just don't want to do the work.''
Mike Carlton, director of labor relations for the Florida Fruit and Vegetables Association, agreed. He said his group monitored hiring by citrus growers, who are required to offer jobs to Americans before they can turn to the H-2A program for temporary foreign laborers.
In one sample, Mr. Carlton said, 344 Americans came forward to fill 1,800 pickers' jobs; only eight were still working at the end of the two-month season.
Mr. Carlton said Florida growers had flocked to Washington, telling lawmakers they had glimpsed the possible impact of Mr. Smith's proposal after a verification mandate narrowly failed in the Florida Legislature this spring. ''Just the prospect of it, and some of our workers left the state,'' Mr. Carlton said.
Labor shortages were also reported by Georgia growers, said Charles Hall, the executive director of the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, after lawmakers there imposed a state mandate to use E-Verify this spring.
Some of the most forceful feedback has come from Mr. Smith's home state, where farmers have the backing of the larger Texas Business Association. The group used its clout recently to kill an immigration crackdown law in the State Legislature, even though it was supported by Gov. Rick Perry, a possible Republican presidential contender.
''I think Mr. Smith realizes what his legislation would do to agriculture,'' said Steve Pringle, the legislative director for the Texas Farm Bureau, which claims some 400,000 members. ''I think that's been made very clear to him.''
Most growers oppose efforts to expand the H-2A program, which they say is hopelessly bureaucratic and too slow for fast-moving harvests. They favor measures that would grant legal status, at least temporarily, to illegal immigrant farm workers already in the country. But that idea is anathema to Mr. Smith.
Mr. Bonacich, the apricot farmer, said that worries about finding legal workers would just add another variable to the delicate equation of a farmer's bottom line.
''Out here, we count the money by the minute,'' Mr. Bonacich said. ''And if we don't have the labor and we don't have people in the fields, a couple of days can make all the difference.''

HEADLINE: A Plug-and-Play Plan for E.V. Batteries

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
Gladsaxe, Denmark
THERE may be fewer than 500 electric cars on Danish roads, but signs of progress in building an infrastructure to support a larger population of E.V.'s. are already evident.
The first electric car battery swapping station in Europe opened here last month, the initial site in a network of 24/7 fully automated drive-through stations. There, the lithium-ion battery packs, which weigh about 600 pounds, will be removed from specially designed cars and replaced with a fully charged pack. The swap takes five minutes.
Is this plan -- a solution that could make E.V's practical for long trips -- some sort of utopian E.V. fantasy? I thought so until I experienced the process myself. 
I was in the second car to do a battery swap after the ribbon was cut on June 28. Passengers in the first car included Lykke Friis, Denmark's minister of climate and energy, and Johnny Hansen, chief executive of Better Place Denmark, the local branch of the Silicon Valley company. It is building the swap stations and related businesses in Australia, China, Denmark, Israel (where the world's first swap station is) and eventually, the United States.
Better Place has 19 more battery swap stations in the works for Denmark. ''By the first of April, we will cover the whole country,'' Mr. Hansen said, referring to 2012, with stations no more than 40 miles apart.
At this point, only Renault is making cars designed for quick battery swaps. The company stretched the gasoline-powered version of its Fluence, a Corolla-like sedan, by five inches to accommodate the suitcase-size 24-kilowatt-hour battery pack. The resulting Fluence Z.E., for zero emissions, goes into full production later this year, available in either swappable or fixed-battery versions.
My 20-minute drive in the Fluence Z.E. from the Better Place offices in Copenhagen to the swap station in the suburb of Gladsaxe, was pleasingly uneventful. The swap station adjoins a filling station, where a gallon of gasoline was priced at the equivalent of $9.15 and diesel was $8.40.
The battery swap was also uneventful. Swipe a membership card at the entrance and the garage door to the battery-change track, similar to a carwash tunnel, opens. Pull forward and the robot takes over -- the driver simply shifts into neutral and lets go.
As the car is guided forward, it's lifted a few inches. Inside the car, you hear buzzes and hums and feel vibrations, but there's no view of what is happening below. About a minute into the experience, the dashboard message indicates empty battery -- meaning it's gone -- after which there's no air-conditioning, although music and other functions continue. During most of Denmark's year, the brief lack of climate control would not be a problem, but during my trip, on a hot summer day, the sealed cabin quickly became steamy.
That small discomfort did not mar the significance of the occasion: four and a half minutes after entering the station, the car had a fresh battery. The sedan was lowered and we pulled out of the tunnel ready to drive another 100 miles or so, according to Renault's range estimate. The Better Place robot worked.
Better Place subscribers purchase their cars, but not the expensive battery packs. For a fixed fee of about $350 a month, they will lease access to the batteries, swap stations and charge points.
Renault says it intends to produce more than 100,000 Fluence Z.E. sedans through 2015, although availability in Denmark will be limited. Another battery-swappable model from Renault, the Zoe Z.E. -- a smaller hatchback more suited to Danish tastes -- is expected next year. But it could be a number of years before other carmakers produce models that work with the Better Place stations.
The economics are challenging. Each station costs ''a couple of million Euros'' -- about $3 million -- to build, Mr. Hansen said. That is a big investment for stations that might barely be used in the next couple of years.
The Better Place business model is a top-down, central-office approach to electric car charging infrastructure. Whether that plan will work may be uncertain, but its Danish swap station does deliver as promised.
When E.V.'s finally arrive here, Denmark could be one of a few places in the world to have eliminated limited driving range and insufficient charging spots as potential obstacles to the adoption of electric cars.

 FRESHEN UP: Europe's first battery change station is near Copenhagen. (AU5) GRAPHICS: 5 Minutes to a Full Charge, No Plugging In Needed: Electric cars continue to face the challenges of limited driving range and long recharging times. One alternative plan, championed by Better Place, calls for battery swapping stations that would change the entire battery pack in five minutes. The first station is operating in Israel and another opened near Copenhagen last month. The swap, which for now works only on specially adapted Renault models, is fully automated and requires no mechanic to do the removal and installation. (Source: Better Place) (AU5)

HEADLINE: Museum Shows History and Power of Wind Energy

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
LUBBOCK -- A century ago, Texas was covered with windmills, which pumped water from aquifers so cattle could drink and gardens could grow. Thousands of these old-style models still exist in remote pastures, but in recent years far taller and more powerful turbines have sprouted atop western mesas, transforming this oil and gas state into the national leader in wind-generated electrical power.
This evolution is on display at the American Wind Power Center in Lubbock, which bills itself as the world's largest windmill museum. Dozens of old, clanking windmills occupy the grounds of a small, breezy hilltop, irrigating the grass, while a 165-foot-tall modern turbine, made by the Danish company Vestas, towers in the background and supplies the museum's electricity. Long, sleek blades from another monster turbine, the first manufactured by General Electric, lie along the edge of the parking lot, awaiting the construction of a new wing the proprietors hope to build, finances permitting. 
The museum is the culmination of more than 30 years of work by Billie Wolfe. Ms. Wolfe, who taught at the College of Home Economics at Texas Tech University, got interested in old windmills in the 1960s, and much later she teamed with Coy Harris, chief executive of the Wind Engineering Corporation, to create the museum, which was established in 1997. (Ms. Wolfe died earlier that year.)
Mr. Harris, who is now the museum's executive director, continues to expand the collection and plans to add 10 to 15 smaller electric turbines -- the size people could put on their ranches -- on an unused section of the property. ''We're going to put in a mini wind farm,'' he said.
The Lubbock windmill collection is not Texas' only one. Two-hundred-plus miles north, several dozen windmills are clustered in a roadside park in Spearman, just past the Hungry Cowboy restaurant upon entering the town from the south on Route 207. (It's only fitting that the Panhandle, the state's windiest region, boasts a wind-power display.) These are from the collection of a legendary local and windmill lover, J. B. Buchanan, and the names on the tails include some of the most storied windmill companies in history, like Eclipse, Aermotor and Axtell.
But the American Wind Power Center has a more established collection of the antique machines. It even includes a nearly completed mural, called Legacy of the Wind, which is 34 feet high and 200 feet long and takes up two walls of the museum's covered patio, which is often used for weddings and other events. The mural depicts several dozen windmills, ranging from the ancient grain grinders to the modern electrical giants, situated within scenes from rural life. There are railroads, too, because windmills used to be planted beside the tracks so engineers could get fresh water to generate steam.
The mural's artist, La Gina Fairbetter of Lubbock, has been working on the project for three years and is about to apply the finishing varnish, which must be done in the mornings before the heat arrives. Windmills are ''part of the landscape,'' she said. ''It's part of sustainability. It's part of being alive.''
Ms. Fairbetter, who also has a bit of a specialty painting dinosaurs, has sometimes added unusual touches when the whim strikes her, including -- as of this month, in response to visitor demands -- a horned toad. ''People are like, 'Where's the horned toad? Where's the horned toad? I want to see a horned toad!' '' she said. ''So we sneaked one in.''
Last year the museum acquired one of the few windmills in the United States that actually grinds grain. Built in the 1970s, the Flowerdew Hundred post mill was modeled on windmills that existed centuries earlier. It uses canvas sails and moveable, hinged shutters to capture the wind. It rotates around a central shaft as the wind changes direction, and looks more like a two-story hut than most people's notion of a windmill. On the second floor, two giant millstones, each more than a century old, can grind grain when the wind blows.
When the mill is operating, ''it's a wonderful place to be for the smell and the noise,'' Mr. Harris said. ''The building is popping and creaking.'' He plans to sell windmill-ground cornmeal in the museum shop.
Inside the museum are dozens more water windmills, including one that a rancher carved by hand and another that tips over, which allowed cowboys to fix it without climbing the tower. Also of note are the large glass batteries that go with a ''windcharger,'' a type of early electrical wind machine that was widely used on remote farms and ranches before rural electrification supplanted windmills in the late 1930s.
And then there is one of the quirkier displays: colorful hanging tapestries made from T-shirts collected from wind-energy conferences over the decades. Vaughn Nelson, a retired West Texas A&M University professor who helped pioneer the state's wind power movement, began quilting the shirts together because, he said, ''I had a whole bunch of them.''

HEADLINE: Home Cure

BYLINE: By DAVID BORNSTEIN

 BODY:
In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger helped found one of the nation's first community health centers. Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing ''prescriptions'' for food - stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be ''filled'' at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center's money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: ''The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.'' The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the ''war on poverty.'' But in others, we're still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the ''social determinants of health.'' In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. 
If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick.
One of the most impressive organizations in the country that is developing an approach to do this is Health Leads, which mobilizes and trains about 1000 volunteers each year who staff resource desks located in the waiting rooms of 23 hospital clinics or health centers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Providence, R.I., and Washington. At these sites, doctors now regularly ''prescribe'' a wide range of basic resources - like food assistance, housing improvements, or heating fuel subsidies - which Health Leads' volunteers ''fill'' - applying their problem solving skills (and tenacity) to identify resources anywhere they may be available.
Health Leads was co-founded by Rebecca Onie in 1996, while she was an undergraduate student at Harvard University. Onie had first witnessed the intimate relationship between poverty and health while volunteering at Greater Boston Legal Services, where she assisted low-income clients who had housing problems. Many lived in dilapidated apartments with leaky pipes, broken windows, rooms full of mold, and walls infested with cockroaches and rats. Often families couldn't afford to pay for heat. Towards the end of the month, some ran out of food. Onie found herself interviewing mothers whose children came to the office wheezing and coughing from asthma and lung infections - health problems caused or triggered by bad housing. Often, the children had been in and out of hospitals for years; many had fallen far behind in school.
One day, she read a magazine story about Barry Zuckerman, chairman of pediatrics at Boston Medical Center (B.M.C.), who had established the Medical-Legal Partnership for Children, a program that connected doctors with lawyers to assist patients (it has since spread to more than 235 health institutions nationally). Close to 70 percent of the patients at B.M.C. are poor and Zuckerman, like Geiger, had grown tired of treating children, only to see them readmitted to the hospital because nothing was done to address the causes of their illnesses. In some cases - as when a child has chronic asthma attacks because the landlord refuses to clean up mold - a lawyer could be more effective than a doctor.
''I thought bringing lawyers into the hospital was brilliant,'' recalled Onie. She called Zuckerman to see how she could help and he invited her to spend six months talking to people in the unit. There Onie found doctors who were ''smart, passionate and totally committed to their patients'' and yet ''stymied in terms of their ability to bring about the health outcomes they wanted.'' Some physicians told her they knew they should be asking more about food, housing or social issues, but they were afraid of opening a ''pandora's box.'' ''I have no idea where to begin to address the problems,'' one physician told Onie. ''I have 13 minutes with each patient.'' (Studies reveal that doctors are reluctant to inquire about issues - domestic violence, for example - when they feel powerless to intervene.)
Onie thought that students could help. With Zuckerman, she founded Health Leads (formerly Project Health) to recruit and train students to provide patients with connections to resources deemed necessary by doctors and other health care providers. ''What are college students built to do?'' asks Onie. ''Track down information!'' She adds: ''Say your client is a Latina mother working two jobs. She needs food supplements. She has no transportation. Your job is to locate a food pantry within walking distance of her home that's open after 8:00 p.m. and has a Spanish speaker on staff. That's a perfect problem for a college student. It's like a really fancy Google search.''
From the outset, Onie made the decision to work only with students who demonstrated high levels of motivation and commitment. In some of Health Lead's sites today, as few as 10 percent of students who apply get selected. This has had the effect of attracting serious volunteers. In 2010, the organization reported that in 57 percent of cases its volunteers secured a needed resource within 90 days. This year, Health Leads will serve 9,300 patients and families - not a huge number given the scope of the problem it seeks to address - but the approach is gaining momentum.
One indication is that, where Health Leads works, doctors are changing their behavior. In the Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, for example, over the past year, there has been a 300 percent increase in doctors ''prescribing'' Health Leads through the hospital's Electronic Medical Record. The resources they request for patients include things like exercise or summer meal programs for children or subsidized child care for mothers, so they can find work and afford better food and housing.
Health Leads is also demonstrating that it can improve the efficiency of social workers. In some of the large urban hospitals where the program operates, the ratio of patient visits to social workers is close to 25,000 to 1. Because students can handle basic - but time consuming - cases, social workers can concentrate on what they're trained for. At The Dimock Center, in Roxbury, Mass., initial data suggests that the program has doubled the time social workers can devote to therapeutic work.
Health Leads is also preparing a pipeline of new health care leaders. Two thirds of its students are either in pre-med tracks or pursuing careers in health, and the exposures they are getting are likely to shape the way they think about health care. As one volunteer said: ''When I'm a doctor, I will never prescribe antibiotics that say 'take with food' without making sure that the family actually has food in the house.''
Many health care professionals know that social conditions impact health more than medical care. In a survey conducted by Health Leads at Bellevue Hospital in New York, almost every pediatric primary care provider said the failure to address social and psychological needs ''impairs'' their ability to treat patients effectively. The vast majority said that the hospital needed a standardized system to screen for these needs on routine well-child visits. But 80 percent said it lacked the capacity to do it.
There is very little money available for this work. Medicaid doesn't generally reimburse social workers for non-therapeutic tasks. Most of the time, this kind of assistance falls through the cracks. Society then spends oodles of money treating the crises that follow. ''There is a tension between what we all know, and agree, needs to be done, and what we are doing,'' says Onie. ''As a society, we haven't yet decided that we actually want less emergency room visits.''
Just a year ago, Onie thought that Health Leads' biggest obstacle would be getting doctors to pay attention to patients' social needs - given all the demands on their time. Today, the organization is getting so many referrals from doctors, for the first time in its history it has long waiting lists. Five decades after the war on poverty, a work force that can systematically address the social causes of illness is still to be built. Health Leads offers a model of how it might work. A broader system could incorporate students, community health workers, and lay workers. It need not be a perfect solution, nor an expensive one. But something has to be done. And the big challenge is getting health care decision makers to prioritize and pay for it. As Onie says: ''How would we ever think that we're going to secure a return on our health care dollar until we start dealing with these social factors?''

HEADLINE: A Sure but Elusive Cure: Economic Growth

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, the National Debt Clock, perched above the Avenue of the Americas, a block east of Times Square, was running backward.
It seems remarkable now, with all the End Times talk of debt ceilings and default, but it was only 11 years ago that the owners of that electronic totem, the Durst family, simply pulled the plug. The clock, a fixture since 1989, went dark after the federal government ended its 2000 fiscal year with a record $236.4 billion budget surplus.
Today, well -- you know. We face the largest budget deficit the nation has ever known: $1.6 trillion, the equivalent of about 11 percent of our economy. And, whatever Washington does, many economists say the situation will grow only worse, particularly as Americans age and Medicare costs spiral higher.
But there is, in theory, a happy solution to our debt troubles. It's called economic growth. No need to raise taxes or cut programs. Just get the economy growing the way it used to. 
Good luck with that. Growth is in short supply these days, as new, dismal numbers underscored on Friday. Revised data showed that the recession took an even bigger bite of the economy than we thought. And economists are sizing up the risks of another recession.
''The basic issue is that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal track,'' says Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. ''From that point, none of the choices are fun.'' The most obvious choices, Mr. Maki says, are to reduce spending (ouch), raise taxes (yuck), let inflation run (gasp) or default (thud).
We wouldn't need any of that if we could restore economic growth. If that happened, Americans would become richer and pay more taxes. Et voila! -- we'd pay down the debt painlessly.
Crazy as that might sound, particularly given Friday's figures, the possibility isn't some economic equivalent of that nice big farm where your childhood dog Skip was sent to run free. There are precedents.
Before its economy crashed, Ireland was a star of this sort of debt reduction. In the 1980s, Ireland's debt dwarfed its economy. Over the next two decades, though, that debt shrank to about a quarter of gross domestic product, largely because the economy went gangbusters.
''Ireland went from being, you know, the emerging market in a European context, to a very dynamic economy,'' says Carmen Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of debt crises.
The United States has done the same in the past, too. After World War II, gross federal debt reached 122 percent of G.D.P., the highest ratio on record. But over the next 40 years, it fell to about 33 percent. That wasn't because some blue-ribbon panel prescribed austerity; it was because the American economy became much, much richer.
The same happened during the prosperous 1990s, which began with deficits and ended with surpluses. Former President Bill Clinton is often credited for that turnabout, as he engineered higher tax rates. But most economists attribute the surplus years primarily to extraordinarily rapid growth.
It would be lovely to repeat that experience today, and send our federal debt off to that farm with Skip.
But the structure of America's federal spending is different now than it was in, say, the immediate postwar decades. Back then, growth helped to erase the debt. But remember that in the 1950s, the United States didn't have Medicare. The population was younger, and Americans didn't live as long.
Given the health spending obligations we face, and the debt overhang we're already dealing with, growth rates would have to acquire something like Ludicrous Speed, as in the movie ''Spaceballs,'' to keep up. And, near term, even modest speed is unlikely.
Usually after a recession, growth snaps back quickly and the economy makes up for ground lost -- and then some. That's not the case this time, at least so far. In the 60 years before the Great Recession, the economy expanded at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent. In the second quarter of this year, it grew at less than half of that pace, putting us further and further behind where we would be if the economy were functioning normally.
These doldrums won't last forever, but many predict that economic growth to come will be somewhat slower than it was before the recession, for many of the same reasons that our debt is growing so quickly -- the aging of the population, for instance.
While it may be difficult or impossible to grow our way out of debt, the G.D.P. figures announced on Friday suggest that we could quite possibly shrink our way into bankruptcy. The austerity measures that Congress is debating would almost certainly slow growth further. That, in turn, might actually worsen the debt problem -- the exact opposite of what their proponents suggest.
Economists agree that in the long run, fiscal discipline is good for growth. When the budget is in order, the country isn't weighed down by the burden of paying down burgeoning entitlements. Companies can worry less about being surprised by, say, higher taxes, and proceed to hire new workers. More manageable federal debt also helps to keep interest rates low, which is generally good for growth. And, again, what's good for growth is generally good for the debt.
The problem is that reducing spending or raising taxes just now would hurt the already fragile economy. Another recession would not only be painful for ordinary Americans but would actually worsen the debt problem by reducing tax revenue.
Don't believe it? Consider this: Of the $12.7 trillion in additional federal debt that was accumulated over the last decade, about a third came from the souring economy.
Back in the Great Depression, Washington tightened its belt with disastrous results. Congress severely reduced spending in 1937, plunging the economy back into the hole. Ultimately, that meant even more federal borrowing.
Today, Wall Street is worried that the United States will lose its AAA rating, whatever happens in Washington. Last week's sign of the apocalypse: While we were moping about the debt mess in Washington, Uruguay -- Uruguay! -- was putting its fiscal house in order. Standard & Poor's, which has been threatening to cut the United States' credit rating, raised its assessment of Uruguay.
Granted, it's still a junkyard BB+. But it makes you wonder: If Montevideo can gets its act together, why can't Washington?
In a perfect world, Washington might lay out plans to reduce spending or cut taxes in the future, giving us a collective heads-up, and then phase in those measures a few years from now -- when, hopefully, the economy is on a firmer footing.
The problem, of course, is credibility, which the ratings agencies have demanded. Would Washington follow through? Congress has promised fiscal discipline for decades, only to undo its promises before the reckoning. Fiscal discipline is painful, unpopular and, in today's Washington, as elusive as the prosperity we once had.
William Easterly, a development economist at New York University, notes that countries that undertake fiscal consolidation in the midst of a crisis -- like the one Washington is in right now -- tend to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.
For example, during the debt crises of the 1980s in Latin America, many countries in that region cut back on easy targets, like telecommunications and transportation. Those decisions later impeded those countries' ability to function and to collect the tax revenue they needed to keep current with their creditors. Britain likewise axed spending on transportation maintenance and operations in the 1980s, which led to much more expensive repairs to roadways and other infrastructure later.
ON the other hand, the paragon of thoughtful, growth-minded fiscal consolidation is Canada, according to Paolo Mauro, a division chief at the International Monetary Fund and editor of ''Chipping Away at Public Debt: Sources of Failure and Keys to Success in Fiscal Adjustment.''
Rather than making decisions under the gun, Canada in 1994 undertook a comprehensive, McKinsey-style review of all of its federal spending over the course of a year to determine ''where they were getting value for their money, rather than just doing across-the-board cuts,'' Mr. Mauro says.
Policy makers telegraphed their conclusions and medium-term plans for reform, and subsequently pared down Canada's debt level from one of the highest in the Group of Seven to the lowest. Since Canada cut federal fat judiciously, it reduced its debt without much harm to growth.
American policy makers might learn a thing or two from Canada's patient, hysteria-free pruning, at least once another clock -- the counting down to an American downgrade or default -- stops ticking.

HEADLINE: Trade in Pork Bellies Comes to an End, but the Lore Lives

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- This city's market for the pork belly, a commodity nearly everyone seemed to have heard of but only a small, close-knit fraternity truly understood, is no more.
When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced the other day that pork belly futures would no longer be traded, it was hardly a shock. Trades had shrunk to almost nothing. Volatility was too much. The frozen bellies, used to make bacon, were, in the view of some, losing relevance.
Still, the demise of the futures means something else is really gone now, too -- a unique belly culture and its hard-charging, daring cast of characters who, decades ago, made their fortunes in the high pressure of the belly pit. 
''It was a club,'' said Gary Wilhelmi, who arrived at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a markets reporter not long after pork bellies helped pioneer the exchange's livestock futures markets in 1961. ''If you were new, you could come to the trading floor, and you could come to the belly pit. But they wouldn't trade with you.''
There was the balding trader whose wig was seen as a gauge of the market's volatility; on the craziest days, the wig's part ran ear to ear, Mr. Wilhelmi recalled. There was the analyst who died right there. ''Bellies killed him,'' Mr. Wilhelmi said. And there was the veteran trader who once told Mr. Wilhelmi -- who was, at the time, trying to analyze a trading report on pork bellies -- not to bother. ''The bellies,'' the trader told him, ''are what we say they are.''
Pork bellies have long held a puzzling mystique to the public. Experts in the field offer a range of sometimes conflicting explanations: everybody likes bacon; the word ''belly'' sounds funny; no one actually knows what a pork belly is. Whatever the reason, pork bellies pop up in an inordinate number of references in magazines, popular culture and movies, like ''Trading Places,'' the 1983 film in which Eddie Murphy's character used pork bellies to explain, in unforgettably bare terms, how a market works.
To hear many who frequented the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the early 1960s tell it, the trading of pork belly futures seemed to open up a whole new set of possibilities -- other livestock, for instance -- for the exchange. ''The bellies are gone,'' said Gary Truitt, the president of Hoosier Ag Today. ''But they really did make a contribution.''
Way back, pork belly futures made sense. The bellies were frozen and set aside, then used to make bacon during the summers when the demand for it (think bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches) rose. But the pork belly landscape has shifted, said Shane Ellis, a livestock economist at Iowa State University. With bacon accompanying salads, hamburgers, even chocolate, it is on call all year now, removing some of the demand for frozen bellies.
For many here, the announcement by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in July that no further such trades would be made was merely acknowledging the inevitable. Some said it was high time. Past time, in the view of some, who had worried that the ups and downs of trading were too risky when almost no trades at all were being made. It was hard to imagine next to the memories of the old belly pit, where you had to really watch out, Mr. Truitt said, or you would ''get your clock cleaned.''

 BODY:
El Paso and Ciudad Juarez lie together uncomfortably like an estranged couple, surrounded on all sides by mountains and desert. The cities are separated by the thin trickle of the Rio Grande, which flows through concrete channels, built to put an end to the river's natural habit of changing course and muddying boundaries. One side is Texas; the other, Mexico. The border's way of life -- its business, legitimate and otherwise -- has always relied upon the circumvention of this dividing line. 
The cities are so close that you can sit on a park bench in El Paso and watch laundry wave behind a whitewashed house on a Juarez hillside. Thousands of commuters come across from Mexico every morning, waiting in a long line at the Paso del Norte bridge, snaking back up the seedy Avenida Juarez, past military checkpoints where hawkers wave tabloids full of tales of carnage. The recent war among various gangs and drug cartels has made Juarez one of the world's most dangerous cities, while across the way, El Paso remains calm, even eerily prosperous. It consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States. This grotesque disparity has, in some ways, torn the cities apart. Few El Pasoans venture across the bridge anymore, if they can help it, while much of Juarez's middle and upper class has decamped to the other side of the border, taking their money, businesses, even their private schools with them, forming an affluent community in exile.
I spent a lot of time in El Paso this winter and spring as the Mexican Army mounted a fragmentary campaign against the cartels and as American politicians of both parties exploited the spectacle for their own purposes. In Washington and Austin, the capital of Texas, in the faraway realm that borderland residents call the interior, conservatives were raising the specter of ''spillover violence,'' while President Obama was boasting of an unprecedented border fortification. In reality, spillover was notable for its scarcity -- when stray bullets from a Juarez gunfight improbably flew across the border and struck El Paso's City Hall last year, it made international news. But that's about the only physical damage the city has suffered. And the federal security buildup -- symbolized by an 18-foot, rust-colored fence that runs along city streets and through backyards, part of a 650-mile, $2.8 billion border wall -- was regarded around town as a threatening imposition. Some two million people are linked at this spot, by ties of blood and commerce, and its fluid social ecosystem still retains something unique and emblematic and perhaps worth saving. If scholars of globalization are right that we are moving toward a future in which all borders are profitably blurred, here is the starkest imaginable expression of that evolution, in all its heady promise and its perverse failings.
On a frigid morning in February, I met with Linda Arnold inside a small brick storefront in El Paso. ''Unless you are right here, I don't think you can get how intertwined this community is,'' Arnold told me. A midwife with frosted blond hair who favors jangly jewelry, Arnold was running a small business called the Casa de Nacimiento, catering to a specific subset of border-straddlers. At that moment, sweating through labor, were three women who had come over the bridges from Juarez with legal visas. The distance, about a mile and a half from the Rio Grande, was geographically negligible but enormously consequential. Giving birth here would deliver their children a precious advantage: it would make them Americans.
Arnold isn't an immigration zealot, or even an ideological liberal, despite the hippie-ish connotations of her profession. ''We're not going to sit around here and chant,'' she said as we spoke in her office, which contained a sculpture of a womb and a portrait of her own son, a soldier in uniform. ''This is a business, not a commune.'' What Arnold was offering for sale at Casa de Nacimiento, for $695, was a future untroubled by the border's impediments. Any child born at Arnold's birth center would possess American citizenship, courtesy of the 14th Amendment, and with it the ability to cross freely back and forth.
It is El Paso's way to make the most of the border's inequities. Arnold moved to town in 1985 with an impassioned commitment to natural childbirth and an entrepreneur's hunch about an untapped market. Mexican women had a long tradition of crossing the border to give birth, and Arnold soon made herself one of the busiest midwives in the state. Back when she started, getting over the border was as simple as wading across the Rio Grande or paying a ferryman a dollar for a tow on an inner tube. ''They would come in with their jeans still wet,'' she said.
Though Arnold's discipline is more popular than it used to be, it's still not fully accepted by the American medical establishment, and many midwives in training find it difficult to gain experience. ''The volume's not there,'' Arnold said. El Paso, with its large, willing, cash-paying clientele, made an ideal destination for students. Though heightened security has put an end to the days of wet jeans, it is relatively easy for a resident of Juarez to obtain a U.S. border-crossing card, which permits short trips for social visits or shopping, and there is nothing illegal about crossing while pregnant -- at least for now.
While American nationality has always been a desirable asset in Juarez, it has become much more valuable -- sometimes a matter of life and death -- since the drug violence erupted in earnest three years ago. The children delivered at Casa de Nacimiento on the day we met would eventually be able to attend better schools, find better jobs and, if necessary, seek haven. I met a couple named Graciela and Milo, who brought their 2-week-old daughter, Jennifer, to Arnold's birth center for a postpartum checkup. The parents were Mexican citizens. (For reasons of privacy, the center insisted that their last names not be used.) Their first two children were born in their home country, but when it came time to have this one, they decided to cross over.
Milo, a long-haul trucker who drives a route to Tijuana, said he just didn't feel safe anymore, as the conflict between the narcos degenerated into anarchy. Graciela, who was sitting with the infant wrapped in a blanket on her lap, said she wanted Jennifer to have better options when she got older. Left unsaid was the underlying assumption: that Mexico's crisis would stretch far into the future and that life for the vulnerable would become only more treacherous and exposed.
Young Pepe Yanar stood in the glow of neon at a bar, his hair stylishly mussed, a gold cross dangling in the crook of his V-neck. ''Everybody here is from Juarez,'' he said as he surveyed the place, one of many that have opened on the well-to-do west side of El Paso over the last year or so. The Texan side of the border has traditionally been considered dowdier and strait-laced; Juarez used to be where Mexicans and Americans alike went for rollicking nightlife. But now many of its restaurants and clubs are closed, emptied by the violence, burned down by extortionists or cleared away by a dubious downtown renewal project.
Pepe told me about the event that drove out his own family: in November 2009, his father, Jose Yanar, was kidnapped as he made his way home from work for a dinner celebrating his 52nd birthday with his family. The kidnappers called, threatening to return his father in pieces if they did not receive a ransom of several hundred thousand dollars. Miraculously, Jose escaped -- he still has a semicircular scar on his arm where the kidnapper he grappled with bit down hard -- and immediately the whole family piled into a car and raced over the Paso del Norte bridge, abruptly severing themselves from their previous lives.
The Yanar family is in the furniture business, and they had never considered themselves vulnerable to Mexico's violence. Pepe, his parents and his siblings were U.S. citizens, having been born in the United States, like the children of Casa de Nacimiento. Even though the family lived in Juarez, Pepe went to high school in America and then on to the University of Texas-El Paso, which offers in-state tuition to eligible Mexican residents. He and his friends spoke English and Spanish interchangeably, and they moved with assimilated ease on both sides of the border.
Juarez has always been fairly lawless -- the city's proximity to the border, its grounds for existence, also made it an ideal shipping point for drug cartels -- but until recently, it was possible for people like the Yanars to believe that the mounting trouble was just among the narcos. Something changed, though, in the last few years. The war began in Juarez around 2008, when the cartel based in Sinaloa, the marijuana- and opium-growing areas close to the Pacific Coast, moved in on the local organization, which controlled valuable smuggling routes. Since then, conflict has spread across much of Mexico's north, as various cartels, street gangs and crooked police units battle in a void of legitimate authority. Bolstered by American military and law-enforcement aid, amounting to $1.3 billion over the last three years, President Felipe Calderon has tried to smash the cartels by deploying the army, and he has sent thousands of soldiers into Juarez. The assault has eliminated some drug lords, but that has in turn encouraged turf and succession struggles, making for increasingly bloody upheaval.
The conflict has claimed some 40,000 lives in Mexico since it began, and Juarez has seen a tenfold increase in its murder rate, reaching more than 3,000 homicides last year. El Paso, by contrast, had only five murders. Why the violence hasn't spread remains a mystery. Tightened border security seems not to have interrupted the cartels' operations. Drugs still come over the bridges in huge quantities, hidden in some fraction of the tens of millions of cars and trucks that annually make the legal crossing. The traffickers know that the U.S. authorities can't search everyone without hindering legitimate trade between Juarez and El Paso, which amounted to $71 billion last year. Once the product reaches the American side, it is whisked off to stash houses and moved on to retail markets in the interior; in the other direction, shrink-wrapped packages of $50 and $100 bills make their way back to Mexico, along with weapons. (One in eight gun dealers in America is located along the border.) Many analysts believe that the absence of violence here is due to a rational choice by the cartels, which calculate that creating chaos in the United States would disrupt this fairly free flow of goods.
''The nature and the cause of violence in Mexico is driven in part by the border itself,'' says David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. ''They're fighting for control of access to the other side. So to me, violence stops at the border because the need to control territory stops at the border. It's about real estate, and it's about corruption networks.''
Although reliable figures are hard to come by, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that some 230,000 Mexicans have fled the violence, about half of them to the United States. While illegal immigration to the United States has dropped over all by about 80 percent from the mid-2000s because of tougher enforcement and the effects of the recession, border cities have seen a contrary phenomenon. Since 2009, according to the Census, the El Paso metropolitan area's population has grown to around 800,000 residents, up by 50,000, an undetermined but significant percentage of them coming from Juarez. Some have sneaked across the river and are thus difficult to count. Many others, however, have made the trip legally, at least initially, coming over the Rio Grande bridges on border-crossing cards -- the short-term visas are easy to overstay -- or via a program that offers green cards to foreign investors and their families, as long as they create at least 10 jobs.
Jose Yanar opened a furniture store called Designer World on Texas Avenue, just off Interstate 10. He and his son both work there, coordinating orders with the family's factory, six miles away in Juarez, which they hadn't visited in 18 months. I visited Designer World one day and found the elder Yanar -- a bluff, barrel-chested boss nicknamed Pelon (Baldy) by his employees -- in an office next to the showroom, where he was keeping watch over the factory on a large flat-screen television that was divided into 16 quadrants, each of which was streaming a jerky feed from a closed-circuit camera. Periodically one of his several phones would screech, and Jose would carry on his daily business in Spanish with the walkie-talkie voice of a factory manager.
''The people that I have there working for me, they're very loyal, and of course I pay them a little bit more,'' Jose said. Still, running a business from afar involves all sorts of annoying inefficiencies. He was afraid to set foot in Juarez, but not all of his managers had U.S. visas. So when he had to see them in person, he sometimes conducted meetings at the center of a border bridge, in the buffer zone beneath the Mexican and American flags.
After Jose escaped his kidnappers, the whole family crowded in with a sister-in-law who already lived in El Paso, and they put their place in Juarez on the market. ''I still hope I can sell it,'' he said. ''But every single house in Juarez is for sale.'' Compared with what others were going through, though, these were minor hardships. Yanar purchased a house in El Paso, and soon he found his neighborhood was full of people he knew from the other side. His social life picked up. He didn't have to worry about his kids sneaking back into Juarez, because most of their friends had moved, too.
''In the beginning, it was very hard,'' Yanar said. ''Now I'm getting used to it.'' One evening, Jose and his wife, Clarissa, had me over for dinner. Pepe was there, along with his two younger sisters and his girlfriend, Ana, another Juarez transplant, who moved over after her uncle was killed. Their new place is a classic Texas ranch house, with exposed wood beams and a pool out back. Clarissa, who wears fashionable glasses and speaks English without a trace of an accent, spent part of her childhood in El Paso, where her family ran a Spanish-language movie house. The Yanars told me they always considered themselves proud citizens of Juarez. ''The Mexicans that have a lot of time in the U.S. . . . they think they're gringos,'' Jose said dismissively. But now they are trying to figure out where they fit.
From the kitchen, someone piped up with the day's news: the political authorities had proposed to change the name of their hometown to Heroica Ciudad Juarez -- adding the word ''heroic,'' as if the appellation could make it true. There was a chorus of scoffing.
''Never mind,'' Ana said. ''We're not from Juarez anymore.''
Sometimes I wonder what El Paso lives off of,'' says Tony Payan, a professor of political science at UTEP. To a large extent, the answer is that it subsists off of Juarez. There's no real agriculture in its arid climate, and much of the city's once-significant industrial sector has closed down or moved away. El Paso's income and education levels have long been far below the national average. For the last few decades, the city's prosperity has been tied to production in the maquiladoras, the outsourced manufacturing industry across the border, and to public-sector employment in border security, law enforcement and at the fast-growing Army base at Fort Bliss -- institutions that are all there, to one degree or another, because of the city's proximity to Mexico. Then, of course, there's the hidden economy of the narcotics trade, which generates anywhere between $6 billion and $36 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you credit.
Howard Campbell, an anthropologist who studies drug trafficking, told me that the relationship between the two cities ''is both symbiotic and parasitic.'' When I asked him who was the parasite, he gave me an amused look -- silly outsider -- and said, ''The U.S.''
Local lore holds that one city was built on the other's misfortune. Major battles of the Mexican Revolution were plotted in El Paso and fought in Juarez. When warfare broke out in the streets of the Mexican city in 1911, a newspaperman later recalled, ''El Paso was delighted and moved en masse down to the riverbank to watch the scrap.'' El Paso's bank deposits increased by 88 percent in just a few years, as merchants made fortunes supplying all the warring parties. One hardware store sold barbed wire to the Mexican government and wire cutters to the rebels.
David Dorado Romo, a historian and the author of ''Ringside Seat to a Revolution,'' compares El Paso in that formative period to Berlin during the Cold War. One downtown building served as a revolutionary headquarters, while counterspies kept an office down the street. The rebel leader Pancho Villa, a teetotaler, held court over ice cream at the Elite Confectionery. Many noncombatants also took shelter on the American side of the river. By 1920, El Paso had doubled in size, to around 80,000 people. Displaced members of the Mexican elite drove a housing boom, opened stores and named a street for Porfirio Diaz, their deposed dictator. One revolutionary would later write that the border region was filled with ''men without a country . . . who are foreigners in both lands.''
Since Romo's book appeared in 2005, there has been a surge of local interest in this era, coinciding with the election of a generation of young reformist politicians who appreciate what came out of it: some architecturally significant buildings, a wise city plan and the dim memory of a moment when El Paso played a momentous role. This has a lot to do with why, when Juarez erupted, the mood in El Paso wasn't entirely mournful. ''We're stuck in this circular historical pattern,'' says Veronica Escobar, a 41-year-old New York University graduate who is El Paso County's judge, its highest elected official. ''Here we are 100 years later, and again there's this horrible, bloody war happening again across from us.'' And yet Escobar's sympathies, like those of many others, are tempered by a sense of recapitulated opportunity. ''We benefit,'' she says.
El Paso has been among the nation's best economic performers through the recession -- its gains coming, in part, because of Mexico's losses. ''In the short run, there has been a positive influx of capital, people and money into El Paso and, for that matter, other border cities,'' says Roberto Coronado, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ''That's driving business on this side of the border.'' Defying stereotypes, refugees like Jose Yanar have arrived with affluent appetites and expectations about their influence. (Even Juarez's recently departed mayor, everyone knows, kept a home on the north side of the border.) Yanar and some friends decided to band together to start a civic organization called La Red, or the Network. They began gathering every week for breakfast at Paco Wong's, a restaurant run by a prominent Chinese family from Juarez, quickly exciting the interest of politicians on both sides of the border. ''We're telling them that there's no need to build walls,'' says the group's president, a magazine publisher named Jose Luis Mauricio.
''It's exactly what happened 100 years ago,'' said Robert O'Rourke. A lanky Web developer, universally known as Beto, his childhood nickname, O'Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council six years ago, at age 31. He met me one Friday at a bar in Union Plaza, part of a warehouse-district redevelopment that was, until recently, considered a boondoggle. ''For 15 years, nothing happened -- until Juarez closed down,'' he said. But O'Rourke disagrees with those who foresee another profiteering golden era. A stable Mexico, he said, represents the ''source of the greatest opportunity and potential'' for El Paso. ''Some people have the impression that this is a boon,'' O'Rourke told me, ''but really it's a zero-sum game.''
Juarez's murders are terrifying in both their sheer numbers and their grisly impunity: beheaded bodies are left on busy streets, hit men open fire into crowds in broad daylight. ''The problem is that our crime is disorganized,'' one prominent Mexican lawyer told me. ''If it was organized crime, we wouldn't see it.'' Though the lawyer's family stays in El Paso, he is part of the dwindling population that still crosses to Juarez for work. Like many others, he takes steps to limit his exposure, traveling at irregular times, exchanging his BMW for a less conspicuous car. (For obvious reasons, he wouldn't allow his name in this article.) Everyone who spends time in Juarez seems to espouse a contradictory theory of risk management: I'm blond; they won't touch an American. . . . I look Mexican; I blend in. . . . I drive a very fast car. . . . I only take taxis. . . . I look harmless. . . . I look tough. . . . Don't worry, everyone knows who I am. . . . Don't worry, nobody knows who I am.
Over coffee, I asked the leaders of La Red what strategies they used to manage the threats. Yanar looked incredulously at Mauricio, who still keeps an office in Juarez, and joked, ''He likes the dangers.'' Mauricio lay a rosary on the table. ''This is my policy,'' he said.
I'm not a prayerful man, so the first time I crossed the border, I did it in what everyone said was the safest possible way. I went over with a maquiladora executive. Pancho Uranga is a voluble, buzz-cut man who works with Foxconn, a Taiwanese maker of electronic components, and helped establish its brand-new plant.
''Right now we're in the U.S.,'' Uranga said, striding over the invisible line. ''And right now, we're in Mexico. Nobody's gonna check your passport.''
And no one did. On the Mexican side of the Santa Teresa border crossing, just outside El Paso, we hopped into a white van that was waiting for us and drove right past a couple of disinterested border guards. Foxconn chose to build its facility out on the far western outskirts of Juarez. ''Initially it was hell,'' Uranga said. ''There was nothing out here but rabbits and snakes.'' The maquiladoras have been largely untouched by the violence, but isolation added an extra buffer. ''It gave us a clean piece of paper so we can design everything from scratch,'' he said. ''You feel secure here, versus driving through the city in today's environment.''
An Asian company opening a plant in North America marks a reversal, to say the least. The maquiladora industry grew in response to a United States government decision in the 1960s to drastically limit the number of Mexicans crossing the border for seasonal farm work. Mass unemployment followed, and Mexico enticed American manufacturers to new free-trade zones along the border, shielded from United States taxes, unions and wage requirements. The industry crested shortly after Nafta was ratified, and for the last decade it has been struggling to compete with the even less expensive factories in Asia. The financial crisis vaporized about a third of Juarez's 250,000 factory jobs in less than two years. But with costs and inflation rising in China, Mexico is once again able to market a comparative advantage. There is a catch, however. ''Putting plants into places where drug lords are fighting is not something that companies want to do,'' says Harold Sirkin, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group.
Foxconn's secure facility, which produces desktops and laptops for Dell, is like ''a prison with a campus,'' Uranga said. Its landscaped grounds are surrounded by walls and razor wire. Managers stay in adjacent dormitories while workers come in from surrounding areas on white school buses. Uranga said the pay at the plant was around the average for the maquiladora industry, about $80 a week.
Uranga offered to give me an impromptu lesson on the workings of the border economy by driving into the colonias on the margins of Juarez. ''This is Lomas de Poleo,'' he said. Pedestrians were filtering onto the highway from unpaved streets lined with cinder-block houses. The area had been the center of unrest over mass evictions by wealthy landowners. Just up the road was Anapra, a concrete jumble of hillside shanties. ''It's the poorest area in Juarez,'' Uranga said. ''And it's the easiest place to pull labor.''
We reached a military checkpoint, where soldiers carrying machine guns were waving cars to the side of the road. ''Little by little,'' Uranga said, ''if you bring development, you bring security.'' To illustrate, he pointed to some hills and said, ''That's where they used to dump the girls.'' A decade ago, hundreds of women, many from the factories, turned up murdered around Juarez. Uranga claimed that such things were not happening in this area anymore. ''Why?'' he said. ''We built the road.''
Some doubt Uranga's theory that the outsourcing industry benefits the poor. They suggest that it's hardly a coincidence that plants like his and the drug industry exist side by side. ''To what extent does the very nature of the industry contribute to the patterns of social anomie and violence that we see in Juarez and elsewhere along the border?'' asked David Shirk of the Trans-Border Institute. The maquiladoras provide low-skilled jobs, but their existence has made Juarez a destination for the rootless and the desperate. This population appears to have been susceptible to the richer promises of the drug trade, as well as to the lure of illegal immigration to the United States, with its comparatively well-paid opportunities.
The migration of the last three decades, primarily driven by economic disparity, has left a permanent mark on America -- and Southwestern states like Texas most of all. Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of Texas's substantial growth over the last decade, according to Census figures, and now make up 38 percent of the state's population.
''The Hispanic phenomenon in this country is totally underappreciated and underserved,'' Bill Sanders, an El Paso real estate investor, says. ''It's one of the main drivers for job and economic growth.'' An avuncular, white-haired grandee of the Texas borderland, Sanders is one of the most influential figures in a region ruled by mercantile interests. (He is, incidentally, also the father-in-law of Beto O'Rourke, the El Paso politician.) Among many holdings, Sanders is a founder of the Verde Group, which owns millions of square feet of industrial property in and around El Paso and Juarez, and 22,000 mostly undeveloped acres facing the Foxconn plant from the American side. Sanders is bullish on the border's potential. ''It's such a powerful generator of value,'' he says. ''The United States is the largest consumer market in the world, and the most efficient place in the world to produce those goods is on the U.S.-Mexican border.''
Sanders made his name in Chicago real estate before moving back to his hometown of El Paso a decade ago with a notion about remaking the city's identity. ''In 2001, a group asked me to meet the mayor, and he wanted me to redevelop downtown,'' he told me. Back in Chicago, Sanders had been a member of the Commercial Club, a private organization that quietly influences the city's urban planning. So Sanders helped put together a similar organization called the Paso del Norte Group, which embarked on a hushed process of drawing up a plan for restaurants, loft apartments and a shopping center. When Sanders went public with the idea, though, and formed a private investment vehicle to buy up property, local advocates accused the developer of trying to bulldoze the Segundo Barrio, El Paso's old immigrant neighborhood.
The controversy took on divisive overtones of race and class, especially after the Paso del Norte Group released its private membership list under pressure from activists and a news Web site. It included prominent family names from both El Paso and Juarez and was the clearest possible expression of the intermingled political and financial interests that have long dictated the course of development on the border. ''They marry each other, they socialize with each other,'' Tony Payan, of UTEP, says. ''For them, citizenship means nothing. The border does not exist.''
Sanders said his and his group's intentions were never nefarious. All he had wanted to create, he told me, was ''a civic system here that weaves together the whole city'' and that cultivated its high-level connections with Juarez. To show what he meant, he invited me into the desert with a group of four other businessmen, two Mexican and two American. Sanders set off behind the wheel of a pickup truck, while his Mexican friends -- a lawyer and the C.E.O. of a major food distributor -- trailed on A.T.V.'s.
We started near the Verde Group's industrial park in Santa Teresa and ended up at a ranch Sanders own in Columbus, N.M. In between was a flat, scrubby expanse of mostly public land, all cactuses and rocks, with little life in sight, other than jackrabbits. But Sanders had ambitious ideas. As we bounded down a dirt road that ran along the Union Pacific tracks, he talked up a new $400 million rail shipping facility that was opening next to Verde's property.
Suddenly, flashing lights appeared behind us. It was a Border Patrol agent in a truck, chasing behind the Mexican C.E.O. on his A.T.V., suspicious of our purposes.
After IDs and explanations were produced, we continued on our way westward, ending up at Sanders's ranch in Columbus, a grungy border outpost that's famous for two things: being attacked by Pancho Villa a century ago and, earlier this year, having its mayor and police chief arrested for gunrunning to the cartels. We returned home along a two-lane road that hugged a low, metal barricade marking the border. Every few miles, we passed another white S.U.V., and someone in the car would mutter, ''La Migra,'' the colloquial name for the Border Patrol. The force has doubled in size around El Paso over the last few years, at the same time as the number of Mexicans trying to cross has dropped, meaning limited stimulation for those on watch. As we turned off the road to take a closer look at the wall, we passed an agent sleeping soundly behind the wheel of his vehicle.
On our way back up from the borderline, the agent woke up, startled. He rolled down his window and asked, ''Where'd you guys come in through?''
El Paso's population is 80 percent Hispanic, but when the Juarez refugees began flooding in, the reaction from some quarters was far from brotherly. One day, Jose Yanar told me, a man came knocking on doors in his new neighborhood in El Paso. He presented a petition to one of Yanar's Mexican neighbors. ''He says: 'Can you sign this paper? These stupid Mexicans are coming here and buying houses.' '' Yanar was flabbergasted: in most of recessionary America, no one was buying houses, but in El Paso sales and prices have held fairly steady, in part because of people like him. He thought that would make Americans happy, but everywhere it seemed as if politicians were bent on driving Mexicans out.
Across the country, conservatives were using the spectacle of violence in Mexico to push draconian immigration and border-security measures. Last spring, as Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, began flirting with a run for the Republican presidential nomination, he took Fox News's Greta Van Susteren on a trip down to the Rio Grande. He told her there was ''great terror on our southern border'' and called the status of security an ''absolute national disgrace.'' At Perry's urging, the Texas Legislature spent much of the spring debating a proposal to push local police units to enforce federal immigration laws.
The measure eventually failed, but it dominated the political discussion in the borderland, where people saw it was just one facet in a larger surge of xenophobia. To most people who actually live in El Paso, Perry's assertion that they are undefended is a bit of a joke. If anything, the city has the feel of an armed camp. Helicopters hover low over the Rio Grande, surveillance drones circle high above and there's the hulking border fence. In May, President Obama stood a few hundred feet from the border in El Paso and declared that the nation has ''more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history.'' When he mentioned the fence, the audience booed.
Sitting in the audience that day, shaded by a straw hat, was the Rev. Arturo Banuelas, pastor of the St. Pius X parish on the east side of El Paso. ''I was one of the ones booing,'' Father Banuelas later told me. He was disappointed by what he saw as Obama's ineffectual advocacy of immigration reform and his comparatively vigorous approach to enforcement. Deportations have increased under Obama, even as the drug conflict has worsened. Of the thousands of asylum claims filed by Mexicans last year, only 49 were granted.
Banuelas, whose family goes back many generations in the United States, has a creased face and a playful, academic intelligence; he earned a doctorate in Rome, writing his dissertation on liberation theology. He often marches for immigrant rights, and his ministry extends to offering practical advice to people trying to flee Juarez. His own 11-year-old nephew was killed when carjackers attacked his family on a vacation in Mexico. One afternoon Banuelas led a singalong and prayers with a group of children between the ages of about 6 and 10. They were visiting his church from an immigration-detention center, where they were being held after being captured, unaccompanied by their parents, by the Border Patrol, often as smugglers led them through the desert. ''There was a baby, 2 years old, in this room -- her family was killed in Juarez,'' Banuelas told me. The child was found by herself, on a bus, and no one knows how she got there.
Banuelas told me that what the distant politicians don't understand is that the violence has already spilled over, in ways you can't seal off with a fence. Familial networks in his parish span the border; he has conducted many funerals for victims, including his nephew. But almost as troubling as Mexico's conflict was America's reaction. ''There is this way of talking about Mexicans coming over that promotes fear here,'' he said.
Nearly everyone I met in El Paso -- whether they spoke Spanish or English, were liberal or conservative, rich or poor -- told me the same thing: no one outside really understood this crisis they were living through. American politicians often talked about the evils of the cartels as if drugs were a purely Mexican business, instead of a thriving multibillion-dollar trade that involves two parties. A generation-long effort to stanch the flow of drugs and desperate people across the border had reached its logical endpoint, the approach favored by ancient empires: the raising of a wall. The barrier wasn't very likely to overturn the law of supply and demand, but it did serve as a useful symbol of the process of alienation, a closing-off of lives and minds, along the line it traces. The peculiar fluidity of the borderland was drying up as it was slowly sapped away by two unappeasable forces: the cartels on one side, the reactionaries on the other.
Still, the tattered ideal of a world without borders holds great power. One day in February at Casa de Nacimiento, a group of 10 pregnant women sat sprawled on the floor of a carpeted room, listening as a woman named Luz Chavez gave an introductory birthing class. Chavez is Linda Arnold's most trusted assistant and someone who understands the unique needs of the clientele. Though she was born in America -- her mother was a Casa de Nacimiento client -- she still commutes across from Juarez. In addition to the usual explanations about fetal development and diet, Chavez crisply covered the rules for navigating the law's gray areas: visas, how to respond to probing questions at the border, handling the application for a birth certificate. ''We try to teach them that they can have an American baby, but they have to pay for it,'' Chavez said afterward, adding with a nervous smile, ''we're not doing anything illegal -- so far.''
There were troubling rumblings, though, emanating from Washington and Austin. In one of the most extreme expressions of nativist fury, conservative talk-show hosts and Tea Party politicians had taken to fulminating against ''anchor babies,'' suggesting that a horde of devious Mexican mothers was slipping into the United States to give birth and cheat the system. In reality, having American offspring is not a shortcut to naturalization -- children cannot petition for their parents to become permanent residents until they turn 21 -- but the misinformed rhetoric proved powerful. ''They're talking about these anchor babies, illegal immigrants, but these are not illegal immigrants,'' Arnold said. ''They are legally doing what they can do.''
When I returned to Casa de Nacimiento in May, Arnold seemed weary of her newly controversial enterprise. In the months since my last visit, local authorities in San Gabriel, Calif., had closed down a maternity center catering to Chinese visitors, ostensibly for building-code violations, and Republicans in Congress and the Texas Legislature were proposing to curtail birthright citizenship, on constitutionally dubious grounds. Because they were not born in hospitals, some Casa de Nacimiento children were now finding their citizenship claims subjected to extreme scrutiny. And while Juarez's violence gave women every incentive to secure their children a U.S. passport, they still had to contend with the immediate obstacles of the border. Increased security meant long lines and uncomfortable waits for a woman in labor. ''It can be based on problems in Mexico with the narcos, it can be the U.S. Border Patrol, it can be both,'' Arnold said. The phenomenon that originally drew her to El Paso, the free flow of expectant mothers across the border, had given way to discouragement and ever-firmer demarcation.
Arnold said her client base had fallen about 50 percent from its peak a decade or so ago. The harshest blow was economic: Mexico's upheaval might be buoying El Paso's economy through the recession, but Juarez was suffering as manufacturing struggled and its population dispersed because of fear. ''People who were working at the maquilas for $50 or $70 a week are now part-timers at $30 a week,'' Arnold said. This illustrated something economists told me when they predicted that the stimulating jolt to El Paso was likely to be short-lived: the longer view of history suggests that the cities rise and fall together, if not always in perfect unison. Their fates can never be disentangled.
Earlier this month, after running her business for 26 years and training more than 800 midwives, Arnold decided with great sadness to close it. Over the course of its existence, she estimates, Casa de Nacimiento delivered some 13,400 new Americans. ''They now have the best of both worlds,'' Arnold said. In a metropolis divided by a river, and so much else, the midwife had bequeathed them a bridge to the other side.

HEADLINE: To Japan or Not? Travelers Weigh Risks

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
THE earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan on March 11, and the nuclear crisis that followed, have had an impact on nearly every corner of the economy, perhaps none more directly than the tourist industry. The number of foreign visitors has plunged 50 percent since the triple disasters, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.
But four months on, travelers are trickling back. Most are business travelers, adventure seekers and bargain hunters, a type of visitor not often associated with Japan, where a sushi dinner can wipe out a week's savings.
The view of Japan as a high-priced playground is what kept Erin Conroy and Jenny McMeans, friends from New York City, from visiting. But this spring, they found round-trip tickets to Tokyo on airfarewatchdog.com for just $600, about half what they normally cost, and booked a room in a hostel for 2,600 yen (about $33 at 79 yen to the dollar) a night. Suddenly, Japan was affordable, even with the yen near record highs against the dollar. 
''We felt like, in many ways, Tokyo was on our too-good-to-be-true list,'' said Ms. Conroy, who was walking with Ms. McMeans around Tsukiji, home to the world's biggest wholesale fish market, one recent Saturday.
And what about the danger of radiation? Ms. Conroy and Ms. McMeans said they perused travel advisories and were convinced that they would not be exposed to high levels of radiation. ''My parents were more worried than we were,'' Ms. Conroy said.
Travelers seem to be gauging the safety of visiting Japan in different ways. Some rely on blogs that have posts written by foreigners living in Japan or frequent travelers to the country. Many, like Ms. Conroy and Ms. McMeans, turn to government advisories. The State Department says that ''while the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains serious and dynamic, the health and safety risks to land areas which are outside a 50-mile radius of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are low.'' In Britain, the Foreign Office advises against travel to the parts of northeastern Japan hit by the earthquake and tsunami, and to within 37 miles of the reactors in Fukushima. But ''the situation in Japan outside of these specific areas has largely returned to normal and most visits are trouble free,'' the office said.
Some visitors said that if the risks were truly great, governments would advise against traveling to Japan, which has not been the case. ''I felt I had to do my own homework because the Japanese have a stiff upper lip about these things,'' said Jack Jaffe, who last month visited Tokyo on business from Los Angeles, where he works for a Japanese electronics company. ''But I checked the U.K. and U.S. Web sites and both essentially said the same thing: That outside the zone near the reactors, things are O.K.''
Still, skepticism remains about the Japanese government's handling of the crisis, including its ability to monitor radiation levels in the air, soil and water. The government has lifted many of the bans on the sale of milk and some vegetables, but abnormal levels of radiation have been found in green tea leaves grown in Shizuoka, and some contaminated beef recently found its way into restaurants and shops. But these are largely viewed as isolated instances. In its fact sheet on food and water safety in Japan, the American embassy in Tokyo states that ''the Government of Japan is taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the food and water supply.''
Given the doubts, the decision to visit has turned into a proxy of sorts on how the rest of the world views Japan. For some would-be visitors, no amount of reassurances or discount airfares could persuade them to visit now.
''We've had two aftershocks in the last couple of weeks, and I get e-mails from clients almost immediately asking if it's safe to visit,'' said Daniel Simon, the general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi, where bookings are down 50 percent. Mr. Simon said he tells customers that Tokyo has some of the most earthquake resistant buildings in the world and that the city is far from the reactors in Fukushima. But ''we don't really think the high-end leisure traveler will come back until Chinese New Year 2012 because there's still too much negative news in the media about Japan.''
Fears are so pervasive that arrivals at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, 360 miles from Fukushima, fell 47 percent in May. ''I've been asked half a dozen times whether I'm afraid of the radiation,'' said Ed Kornhauser, a pianist from San Diego who has traveled from Osaka to Okinawa since May. ''A lot of hostel owners tell me tourism is way down. They want to know why foreigners aren't coming.''
Mr. Kornhauser said he felt comfortable visiting Japan because he knew he would be far from Fukushima. Despite the fears expressed by his friends, he was reassured after reading the State Department's Web site. ''After the earthquake, I didn't think twice,'' he said. ''My friends blew it out of proportion. This is a fairly big country.''
But confidence can be fragile when it involves radiation. So hotels, including high-end places like the Okura and the Imperial in Tokyo, have tried to entice visitors with discounts of up to 50 percent. Deals also abound for tours, which has helped lure back visitors from Hong Kong and other places in Asia. ''It's less crowded now, and package tour prices are down 20 to 50 percent,'' said Masaki Hirata, the executive director of marketing and promotion at the Japan National Tourism Organization.
Some hoteliers are attempting to directly reassure customers that their inns are far from trouble. Kisaburo Minato, who runs the Kimi Ryokan in Tokyo, recently wrote on his inn's Web site that ''the emergency at Fukushima is being exaggerated in the foreign press'' and that except in the area near the reactors, ''life goes on as normal.''
Indeed, little has changed in Tokyo, except for the energy conservation measures that include turning up thermostats on air-conditioners. In Sendai, the closest big city to the earthquake's epicenter, restaurants, hotels and shops downtown are open for business. It is only when visitors go to the neighborhoods within a couple of miles of the Pacific Ocean that they see the impact of the tsunami.
Still, many tourists are erring on the side of caution, said Ellie Colin, who handles corporate and leisure travel at the Ovation Travel Group in New York. One client, she said, canceled a $62,000 trip.
''The headlines were really bleak and every single day they got more and more nervous,'' said Ms. Colin, who has not booked any leisure trips to Japan since. ''My feeling is that it's going to take until next year and some really good P.R. out of Japan before leisure travelers return.''

HEADLINE: A Hybrid That Hauls More Stuff

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
TESTED 2012 Prius V (though Toyota, which seems to have a shortage of capital letters, prefers ''v'').
WHAT IS IT? A stretched Prius with 58 percent more cargo capacity than the standard version.
HOW MUCH? Prices won't be released until closer to the car's showroom debut this fall.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A slightly tweaked version of the Prius's hybrid drivetrain, built around a 1.8-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine, with a 60-kilowatt motor generator and a nickel-metal-hydride battery pack. 
IS IT QUICK? Not exactly, with 0-to-60 m.p.h. acceleration in 10.4 seconds.
IS IT THIRSTY? Quite the contrary: it carries a federal rating of 44 m.p.g. in the city and 40 on the highway (42 combined).
ALTERNATIVES? There's nothing directly comparable, but hybrid versions of the Ford Escape and Toyota Highlander crossovers offer at least as much utility. Honda plans to bring out a hybrid version of the Fit Shuttle that it will sell overseas, but has not confirmed that it will come to America.
GIVEN that the Prius V, a wagonlike variant of the world's most popular hybrid car, is meant to add a shopping-friendly face to the brand, it was appropriate that I had a chance to drive a preproduction model in the high-consumption suburbs north of New York City.
The commodious, but far less fuel-efficient, Ford Country Squire once ruled the roads around the affluent hamlet of Chappaqua, but these days a huge wagon like that wouldn't do. At the train station, preferential parking for environmentally friendly vehicles revealed a solid row of Priuses (with the exception of one Chevrolet Volt).
The stretched Prius is ungainly looking, especially from the side. But the tradeoff is a big gain in cargo space.
There is plenty of legroom for tall people in the back seat. But if you fold the seat flat, which is easy to do, you'll find a cavernous 67.3 cubic feet of usable luggage capacity, more than the Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen. The 3.3 inches of extra height, compared with the regular Prius, really helps when loading bulky items at the big-box store.
The V, which will be available in the fall, is part of a family that will expand again in the spring to include a plug-in hybrid and a production version of the smaller Prius C concept car.
Although there are some mechanical differences -- larger brakes and a redesigned suspension, among them -- the drivetrain is essentially the same as in the current Prius.
The new car is, however, bigger, 232 pounds heavier and slightly less aerodynamic, and that means its fuel economy is not quite as good as that of the 2011 Prius (with a combined city-highway rating of 50 m.p.g.).
Toyota's new, bigger Prius drives like, well, the old, smaller Prius. Enlarging the car didn't change its essential character, though the driver is conscious that the center of gravity has moved upward and that the body is 6.1 inches longer. With 134 net horsepower from the hybrid system, the Prius V isn't a rally car, but acceleration will be adequate for most of its economy-minded owners.
The V is even slower as an electric car. There is an EV button, one of four drive modes, that delivers about a mile of leisurely and very quiet driving on the battery alone. A Toyota spokesman, Wade Hoyt, described it as useful for ''sneaking home late at night.''
I drove the Prius V around Armonk and Chappaqua on smooth roads that didn't pose much challenge for the new ''pitch and bounce control,'' intended to dampen the thumps and bumps of uneven pavement.
Visibility is good all around. In panic stops, the car remained effectively anchored, but the regenerative braking effect, which the driver feels as some push-back from the pedal, is pronounced. Drivers are likely to get used to it, equating the sensation to the electric energy that is being deposited in the bank.
The V's interior offers many of the same storage and utility features prized by minivan owners. The familiar Prius controls are present, including the push-button ignition, but there is also an abundance of storage options, including two gloveboxes, five cup holders and a console that can handle 23 compact disk cases (still used, presumably, by those who don't dance to the MP3 beat). The SofTex seats are intended to resist a variety of spills from younger family members.
The V is one of the first Toyotas to host the new Entune multimedia system, which accesses owners' smartphones to enable popular apps, including the Pandora music service and MovieTickets.com. A drawback is that losing phone service also temporarily suspends the app, which happened for a few minutes on Route 120.
Despite such minor glitches, the V comes across as a worthy addition to the hybrid clan. Most people can use extra space, especially when it's as adaptable and easily reconfigured as it is in the Prius V. How the car is priced will determine if it's worth the extra cost.

HEADLINE: A Tax Policy With San Francisco Roots

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS. 
estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Elizabeth Lesly Stevens writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
Henry George, the 19th-century political economist, spent his seminal years in San Francisco. He is no longer a household name, and his ''land-value taxation'' theory is probably among the few radical ideas for government financial reform that haven't gotten a hearing in Washington in recent weeks.
But his ideas, in their way, are remarkably relevant now. 
George proposed a simple taxation system in which land, but not the value of any buildings or improvements, would be taxed at a rate so high that it would satisfy all of government's revenue needs. No complicated income tax code. No dog's breakfast of special fees and gimmicks to balance government budgets. Just a confiscatory tax on land. ''Georgism,'' as its single-tax principle is known, would be devastating for real estate speculators and large landowners, but proponents say it would be painless for most everyone else.
Here in California, a state that has bled itself dry by radically reducing property taxes, it's easy to forget that just a few decades ago Georgism had an avid following. None less than Willie L. Brown Jr., the former San Francisco mayor and State Assembly speaker, championed Georgist policies, sometimes with the support of John Burton, the longtime Democratic power broker.
Mr. Brown twice introduced state legislation to create a Georgist land-tax regime. ''I was badly defeated with that legislation both times,'' he wrote a fellow Georgist in 1973. ''But I am still convinced that land-value taxation should be given a try.''
A few years later, voters opted instead to slash property taxes via Proposition 13. Mr. Brown moved on, first to an enormously successful (and centrist) political career, and then to his current gig as a high-powered lawyer who counts major real estate developers and corporate landowners among his clients.
But Mr. Brown was certainly in good company as a Georgist. Devotees over the years have included Leo Tolstoy, Winston Churchill, Sun Yat-Sen, and the inventor of the board game that would become Monopoly.
''Henry George was called the Prophet of San Francisco,'' said Joshua Vincent, a Georgist and the executive director of the Center for the Study of Economics in Philadelphia. ''He led a mass movement, a pre-socialist labor movement.''
George later moved to New York City and was a candidate for mayor when he died of a stroke four days before the 1897 election.
It's easy to see why George's theories and his most-famous book, ''Progress and Poverty,'' published in 1879, appealed to the young Mr. Brown. The grandson of slaves, Mr. Brown grew up poor in segregated Mineola, Tex., and came to San Francisco in 1951 as a teenager with little education and less money. He is an entirely self-made man.
''Willie Brown was one of the few who had the courage to speak up for this reform and actually introduce land-value tax legislation,'' said Cathy Orloff, who in the 1970s ran the Henry George School in San Francisco, which offered classes in Georgism to hundreds of students. ''People in the school greatly admired him for that.''
Mr. Brown did not respond to inquiries about his Georgist past, and he's clearly not preparing to take up the flag again.
But Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning Columbia University economist, is stepping into the breach. In December, Mr. Stiglitz called for the adoption of ''Henry George Principles'' as part of his prescription to resuscitate the American economy. ''Land does not disappear when it is taxed,'' Mr. Stiglitz wrote in ''Principles and Guidelines for Deficit Reduction,'' a working paper for the progressive Roosevelt Institute. ''Henry George, a great progressive of the late nineteenth century, argued, partly on this basis, for a land tax.''
Would California have fared better if Mr. Brown's Georgist land-value tax had won widespread adoption? It's almost impossible to contemplate, given how the economic structure of the state has been determined by private land development. Instituting land-value taxation in one fell swoop would cause the value of real estate to plummet, an outcome few would applaud.
But governments at every level are being forced to get creative as they seek new ways to finance basic public services, and if anything good is to come of the current catfight in Washington, it may be a renewed openness to all manner of budget-cutting, tax-reforming ideas.
The Prophet of San Francisco could yet have his day.

HEADLINE: Don't Count on the Rich to Make Sacrifices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert J. Shiller makes a sound economic proposal to reduce unemployment: by increasing taxes over time by the same amount, dollar for dollar, as we increase spending on public goods (''Taxing and Spending, in Balance,'' Economic View, July 24). 
Presumably, however, much of that new tax revenue would have to come from the rich and from corporations. Yet these groups have historically resisted all such tax moves, beginning in the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Mr. Shiller wrote that ''Even those hurt by a tax increase may accept the sacrifice if they know it improves the chances that unemployed friends or relatives will find jobs.''
But the rich are a class apart: their relatives and their friends are also rich, and they (and others) say the unemployed are to blame for their own situation, attributing it to personal failure or lack of initiative.
While I applaud Professor Schiller's proposal, let's also remember that the rich and corporations will try to block it. John Reeder

HEADLINE: Finding Poetry in a Couple's Pain

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
ROME
FROM the golden age of neorealism to the firebrand provocations of Pier Paolo Pasolini, a wide swath of classic Italian cinema has concerned the plight of the downtrodden. This underdog empathy is the animating force behind the work of Pietro Marcello, one of the most striking new talents in contemporary Italian film. But while they continue a rich history, Mr. Marcello's documentaries -- made on shoestrings, attuned to working-class life, open to a wide array of storytelling forms -- are also a surprise and an anomaly, given the long dormancy of Italian film culture under the stranglehold of television broadcasters and the media empire of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Mr. Marcello's 2009 breakthrough film, ''The Mouth of the Wolf'' (''La Bocca del Lupo''), which won prizes at festivals in Turin, Italy, and Berlin, is a twofold lower-depths romance, entwining the story of a middle-aged couple who met years ago in prison and that of Genoa, a city that is long past its prime. (The documentary begins a run at the Museum of Modern Art on Thursday and will also be shown on Saturday as part of the Rooftop Films series at the Old American Can Factory in Gowanus, Brooklyn.) 
''The aesthetical way of the cinema for me is also the ethical way, especially when you are telling real stories,'' Mr. Marcello said in an interview this summer in his compact editing suite in a shared office space downtown here.
''The Mouth of the Wolf'' originated as a commission by the San Marcellino Foundation, a Jesuit group that works with the poor of Genoa; it invited Mr. Marcello to make a film about the city's disenfranchised. Some religious organizations might have balked at the movie that he ended up making, but the Jesuits' reputation as more liberal than other Roman Catholic orders was bolstered by foundation's embrace of ''The Mouth of the Wolf,'' which treats the love between a tough-guy ex-convict and a transgender former drug addict as the grandest of romances.
A native of Caserta, in southern Italy near Naples (where he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts), Mr. Marcello, 35, was unfamiliar with Genoa, in the northern region of Liguria. But he remembered stories he heard as a child from his father, a sailor, who called Genoa ''the ideal city.'' Tucked between the mountains and the sea, its maze of narrow streets etched into steep hillsides, Genoa was once a prosperous independent republic and global maritime capital, and it remains an active port. But during the past century it has endured wartime bombings and the decline of local industry. Parts of the seamy medieval quarter, historically a red-light district and now home to a sizable immigrant population, remain stubbornly resistant to gentrification.
To prepare, Mr. Marcello lived in Genoa for a year, in a rough-and-tumble seafront neighborhood, and researched the city's history and literature. (It has always made its mark on visitors: Henry James marveled at its ''topographic tangle'' and ''close crepuscular alleys''; Andre Frenaud's poem ''The Silence of Genoa,'' evoking the dreamlike disorientation of wandering its shadowy streets, made a particular impression on Mr. Marcello.)
In Genoa the layers of the past are everywhere visible, and Mr. Marcello said he relished the opportunity to make what he called ''a nostalgic film about lost places and memories.'' He added, motioning out the window of his editing suite at the busy thoroughfare Via Cavour: ''I have a big conflict with the present. I can find no harmony here.''
Outside a Genoa bakery one day he spotted a strapping, mustachioed man with craggy features and a piercing stare. ''His face expressed the film I wanted to make,'' Mr. Marcello said. Over a drink the man, Vincenzo Motta, who goes by Enzo and seemed to embody the noble dilapidation of the city, opened up to Mr. Marcello, showing him his bullet scars and recounting his checkered biography. He said he was in a shootout with the police as a teenager and had been in and out of jail since, and the love of his life was a transsexual woman named Mary Monaco, who was disowned by her bourgeois family. ''They had a very hard life, and they worked together to defend themselves from the pain of the world,'' Mr. Marcello said.
A documentary that retains an air of mystery and reaches into the realm of myth, ''The Mouth of the Wolf'' is a generous film in both spirit and form. Its shape shifting speaks to the possibilities of narrative, the various ways that a lived reality, or an emotional truth, can be represented. The film weaves the couple's history into a city symphony, scored to bursts of opera, that combines present-day images with stock footage and home movies, some nearly a century old. ''We called it an archaeology of memory,'' said Mr. Marcello, whose editor, Sara Fgaier, found these scenes of labor and leisure, of man and the sea, in film archives and in the troves of amateur filmmakers.
The lyrical narration framing the film alludes to Giuseppe Garibaldi's departure from Genoa on his unification campaign of 1860. ''The revolutionaries were motivated by adventure, hope, a utopian impulse,'' Mr. Marcello said. ''They didn't want to accept the society of that time.'' The fablelike opening and closing passages, of homeless ''cave dwellers'' on the shore, depicts these itinerant outcasts as figures of legend, literal castaways who ''come from the sea.''
The couple's story emerges gradually, in voice-overs and snippets of exchanged letters. Only toward the end are they seen together, in a long scene, facing the camera and revealing how they fell in love. ''Everybody calls it an interview, but it's more a confession,'' Mr. Marcello said. ''After six months they were ready to tell their story.''
Ms. Monaco's death last year makes for a sad postscript, but Mr. Marcello is glad she lived to witness the success of the film, which both she and Mr. Motta saw as ''a kind of redemption,'' he said.
Mr. Marcello's previous film, ''Crossing the Line'' (2007) -- shot entirely aboard trains, mostly at night, on a dozen routes that traverse the Italian peninsula -- was similarly attentive to those on the margins of society. A film of landscapes and faces, a portrait of a country and an economic system (many of the passengers are laborers seeking work), it views the railways as a symbol of both predestination and freedom. (The most memorable figure is an elderly former revolutionary who, in a bid for autonomy, makes his home on trains.)
Mr. Marcello is finishing a new film, about the Armenian-born, Moscow-based filmmaker Artavazd Peleshyan, who has been called one of the cinema's unheralded geniuses. (Jean-Luc Godard, among others, has championed his work.) Titled ''The Silence of Peleshyan'' (he proved a less than communicative subject), it is Mr. Marcello's first film shot outside Italy. It is also a concrete link to the Eastern European cinema that has influenced him profoundly and which has a tradition of filmmakers -- Mr. Peleshyan, Alexander Sokurov, Sergei Paradjanov -- whose nonfiction films are closer to poetry than documentary.
Mr. Marcello's work exhibits aesthetic ambition and a concern for social justice, but he said he remains motivated above all by uncertainty: ''Doubt is my religion.'' This constant questioning extends to the very practice of filmmaking. ''It may seem like the act of using a camera is an important one,'' he said. ''But to ignore that there are everyday concerns that are much more ennobling for the spirit is to be blind in front of the frame.''

EXORCISING HITLER
The Occupation and Denazification of Germany
By Frederick Taylor
Illustrated. 438 pp. Bloomsbury Press. $30
The story of the denazification of Germany after 1945 comes in two versions. The one we know best allows us to congratulate ourselves on a job well done. We turned the most powerful and frightening dictatorship in Europe into a stable, peaceable and functioning democracy for the first time in its history. This is the story we grew up with during the cold war, one that justified the partition and occupation of the country over many decades. And the invasion of Iraq in 2003 made it seem relevant in an entirely new way. It stood as a salutary contrast with the sheer superficiality and short-sightedness of the Bush administration's approach to military occupation.
But there is also a much less self-/congratulatory version of denazification. It dwells on the darker side by exposing once taboo subjects like the expulsion of millions of Germans from Eastern Europe and the apparently countless rapes carried out by the Red Army. This is a story of Allied acquiescence and even culpability in evil. Delicate subjects like the Allied treatment of German P.O.W.'s in 1945 -- in camps whose mortality rates were for a time extremely high -- were scarcely mentioned in polite company for much of the cold war. 
In two earlier works, Frederick Taylor honed an effective and fast-paced approach to the telling of modern German history. One of these, ''Dresden,'' on the Allied bombing in 1945, was a persuasive exercise in historical reassessment, arguing strongly that contrary to general impression, there was indeed a military rationale for the operation. The other, ''The Berlin Wall,'' also neatly separated myth from reality by looking behind the symbolism of the wall to the way it served both American and Soviet geopolitical interests. ''Exorcising Hitler'' has all the same ingredients -- colorful anecdotes and harrowing recollections, an omnivorous intelligence and wide reading in the scholarly literature -- but Taylor hasn't decided which version of the story of Germany's occupation he wants to tell, and the result is a little confusing.
That may be partly because Germany in 1945 was a confusing place. Hitler's influence lingered in unexpected ways. When an American intelligence officer interviewed a Social Democratic politician in one newly liberated town, he was shocked when his presumably anti-Nazi interlocutor started raising his arm in salute and then began ranting about the need to purge the country of its tainted blood -- by which he meant pro-Nazi blood.
Trying to foresee the task ahead, the Allies had prepared carefully for the moment when they entered the country. Teams of historians and social scientists had been hard at work writing manuals, potted histories and guides to German culture. Economists, nutritionists, urban planners and public health professionals had been calculating what the scale of the relief task ahead would be. This was one difference, right at the outset, with the Nazi approach to occupation, for Hitler and his entourage could scarcely have been less concerned with the needs of the defeated under their rule.
But there were then -- and remain to this day -- two mysteries in the conduct of the German people at the war's end, mysteries that go to the heart of Taylor's book. One was the question of why they continued to fight so resolutely, for so long, against obviously overwhelming odds, even after it must have been clear that the war was lost. Taylor stresses two completely counterproductive messages sent by the Allies: the policy of unconditional surrender, and especially the draconian Morgenthau Plan advanced by the American Treasury secretary, which called for the destruction of Germany's industrial base and the pastoralization of the country. He also highlights the Germans' sheer terror at the approaching Red Army, a terror that had been fanned, as he notes, by Goebbels's publicizing of an early Soviet atrocity in an East Prussian village. Finally, there was straightforward Nazi coercion as the regime rounded on its own people, killing more and more of them.
Even when taken together, however, these elements fail to cohere into a completely satisfying explanation. Apparently, there was something in the popular state of mind by the winter of 1944-45, some sense of being alone in the world, some intuitive understanding of what their own country had done, that led the Germans to fulfill the regime's ultimate goal -- producing a society capable of withstanding the shock of war far more effectively than the one that had collapsed so ignominiously in 1918. This was a country that would fight to the bitter end.
Which leads directly to the second mystery. Why was the end, when it came, so definitive, without any underground resistance to speak of? Was this simply a reminder that even during the war, armed resistance had flourished only in places that could count on moral and material help from abroad -- in the occupied Soviet territories for instance, or in the Balkans? Or was it a sign that Germans really had been following Hitler, and that once they learned of his death, it was all over? A few diehards did fight on; a few more dreamed momentarily of a revised National Socialism that they could sell to the British and the Americans. But it remains surprising how little resistance there was.
Because analysis is generally sacrificed to anecdote in Taylor's telling, we never really come to understand either of these two mysteries. ''Exorcising Hitler'' has some good stories about the anti-Allied guerrilla network the Nazis planned, and it vividly describes the most famous episode of German resistance -- the gunning down, by Nazi agents, of Aachen's first post-Nazi mayor. But the lack of resistance is really a tale of the dog that did not bark, and because that does not make for dramatic reading, the story gets lost.
Good stories lead us astray elsewhere too. Conditions in some of the Rhineland camps where American troops guarded hundreds of thousands of German P.O.W.'s were appalling, as Taylor shows. But even the worst-case estimates of German fatalities -- certainly too high -- reveal the difference with the Nazi treatment of Soviet P.O.W.'s, whose death toll was a good 10 times higher.
The truth is that we now know a great deal about German suffering at the war's end, and historians have been incorporating it into the larger picture of Europe's predicament for some time. We know that perpetrators can also be victims, and more important, that both Germany and Eastern Europe were transformed by the uprooting of populations throughout the 1940s, starting with the Jews and ending with the Germans. By 1950, Eastern Europeans enjoyed virtual national /homogeneity.
Taylor's conclusions are hesitant. But if Europe has a German problem today, it is not because of the country's ambitions abroad, but because it is turning ever more inward. That may cast a shadow over the future of European union, but in any evaluation of the achievements of the postwar occupation, it surely counts as a success.

HEADLINE: Jefferson's Tea Party Moment

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
Sam Tanenhaus is the editor of The New York Times Book Review.
WHATEVER the outcome of the debate on the debt ceiling, everyone seems to agree that it has been one of the most alienating spectacles in recent political history -- a peculiarly Beltway form of theater, with much of the public still confused about what exactly is at stake.
But here is a disquieting fact: In one version or another, this conflict, centered on protest against the federal debt, has been going on almost since the beginning of the Republic.
America's first elected opposition party, the Democratic-Republican Party formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the 1790s, promised a ''second revolution'' whose axioms included ''the general principle that payment of debt should take precedence of all other expenditure,'' as Henry Adams put it in ''History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson,'' his monumental study. 
The trouble, as Adams noted, was that this principle conflicted with another, ''reduction of taxes; and the revenue was not sufficient to satisfy both demands.''
The solution was to trim the size of government. The biggest departments were the Army and the Navy, which were duly cut back. It seemed a sensible solution since Jefferson, along with the public, wanted no more wars. But the Barbary pirates were attacking American merchant ships, and since taxes were needed to pay for a series of naval battles, Jefferson authorized a new federal fund, in violation of his anti-Federalist politics.
Demarches of this kind became the essence of Jefferson's two terms. He forswore ''entangling alliances'' with foreign powers, but when Napoleon offered to sell France's holdings in the Louisiana territory, Jefferson accepted. He raised the $15 million fee by issuing government bonds and taking over payment of the French debt to American citizens. Some objected to Jefferson's annexing ''a foreign people and a vast territory,'' Adams wrote. Others protested that Jefferson, the devout anti-monarchist, had recast himself as the virtual king of this new land acquisition.
Thus did Jefferson's mission to eliminate the debt and repeal taxes -- ''the foundation for his system of politics abroad and at home,'' as Adams described it -- yield to the practical demands of governing a young, ambitious nation.
For all this, Jefferson remains the originator of the anti-statist movement, with its aversion to debt and taxes, that is dominating the debt-ceiling impasse and has been a defining and recurrent strain of American politics. He has had many ideological successors, up through today's Tea Party movement.
In the past, conservatives attained office espousing small-government politics only to see those principles subverted by political realities that led them, time and again, to enlarge the government they fervently meant to starve. By this measurement, Jefferson and his heirs have been abject failures. But in other, more crucial ways, perhaps not.
THE anti-debt politicians of 2011 are in some respects the direct descendants of Robert A. Taft, the Ohio legislator who led the Republican insurgency in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when the party briefly held majorities in Congress and set in motion a rigorous plan to roll back the New Deal by scaling back federal government and advocating pro-business policies.
Taft wanted to slash taxes by 20 percent, skewed toward middle- and lower-income groups, and he opposed the billions spent on reconstructing European democracies via the Marshall Plan. In this instance his loathing of big spending combined with his Jeffersonian suspicion of ''entangling alliances'' with other countries, including corrupt ''socialist'' ones like Great Britain. (This isolationism also characterizes many Tea Partiers, who have been relatively quiet on foreign policy issues.)
Taft succeeded in getting a huge tax cut, though the battle with President Harry S. Truman, who insisted that revenue was needed to conduct the cold war, raged for 15 months and included two presidential vetoes.
At the same time, Taft drafted the Taft-Hartley Act, which repealed major labor initiatives enacted during the New Deal, including the closed union shop and industry-wide bargaining. This legislation prefigured the recent actions that have curbed the bargaining power of state employees in Wisconsin and New Jersey, and the protests were equally forceful. In New York City, as many as 100,000 union members gathered, demanding that Truman veto the bill. He did. But the veto was overturned, perhaps Taft's crowning legislative victory.
In both these cases, Taft and his ''Old Guard'' allies found a good deal of support from Congressional Democrats -- without them, Truman's vetoes would have held. And this suggests that the nation, or much of it, agreed that the New Deal had gone too far, but only in selected areas. Taft might have been convinced that ''hardship and poverty can be eliminated in America without extending government welfare services,'' as he declared in 1950, but the public liked Social Security. Taft deplored farm subsidies, but farmers didn't. Truman's policies might have posed ''a threat to the basic institutions of our modern civilization,'' including the family, religion and ''the character and the moral fiber of the people,'' but he had been elected nonetheless (thanks in part to heavy turnouts of union members).
It wasn't just Democrats who perpetuated ''big government.'' During the next 60 years, conservatives continued their crusade, only to be thwarted as one Republican leader after another fattened the federal leviathan -- whether through the interstate highway system built under Dwight D. Eisenhower, the new federal agencies established under Richard M. Nixon, the huge budget deficits incurred by Ronald Reagan, or the Medicare prescription drug bill passed by a Republican Congress and signed by George W. Bush.
There was the occasional insurgency, usually in Congress. In 1996, Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, had his own Tea Party moment, quite like the current one, when the danger of a credit default punctuated a long budget struggle with President Bill Clinton, who softened the Republicans' call to increase Medicare payments by the elderly. But Mr. Gingrich's strategy backfired. Public opinion turned against the Republicans, and Mr. Clinton sailed into a second term.
The current debt-ceiling crisis is more complex, partly because the government isn't so much divided -- as it was in the Clinton years -- as it is fractured, with Democrats in control of the Senate and a Republican majority in the House.
On the surface, the debate did not appear to be especially ideological. Until last week or so, Barack Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, had been bargaining amicably, both leaders suggesting that an accord was in sight. There was initially broad agreement as well between the two competing debt-reducing plans that inched their way through the House and the Senate. Neither called for tax increases, and both would save billions by nibbling at the edges of Medicare and Social Security.
The ideological battle -- between the sworn enemies of government and those who acknowledge its uses -- lies elsewhere, within the Republican Party, and, more narrowly still, within the Republican caucus of the House of Representatives. Before the House passed the bill on Friday, Mr. Boehner struggled to impose discipline on his own troops, in particular the 87 freshmen, many elected as tribunes of the Tea Party. According to some reports, he tried to educate them in the practicalities of governance, and in the dangers of default. But those lessons were not easy to sell to brash newcomers who arrived in Washington vowing to undo government and who, months later, felt no particular loyalty to seasoned party regulars. The bill they finally passed would raise the debt ceiling in two installments, contingent on Congressional approval of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. Democrats in the Senate instantly blocked the bill.
AND here is where these Republican insurgents differ from their forerunners. Old Guard Republicans were equally devoted to their principles. But they included the principle of traditional lawmaking achieved through compromise.
Taft's nickname, Mr. Republican, reflected his unquestioning allegiance to his party, even when it disappointed him -- as it did on each of the three occasions he was denied the presidential nomination, the last time after a bitter convention fight with Eisenhower that left many convinced the nomination had been stolen from him. Yet, in a remarkable instance of statesmanship, Taft made peace with Eisenhower and helped him advance policies, domestic and foreign, that Taft had sharply questioned but that kept the country on course in the early years of the cold war.
Taft managed this because his conservative credentials were impeccable. No one could reasonably accuse him of selling out. And he chose to do it because, while he might have been a radical, he was not an insurrectionist. He was the leader not of an outlying faction but of a well-established wing of the Republican Party.
For this reason, despite his misgivings, he helped originate the consensus era whose disappearance many now lament -- a time when, amid cold war exigencies, America enjoyed growing prosperity at home and exerted a steadying presence abroad. It was a time, too, when both parties shared responsibility for governance. Both understood that ''ideologically, the American public is conservative; in practice it is liberal,'' to quote Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who worked for four presidents -- two Democrats and two Republicans -- before he became a legislator himself.
Each Republican president in that era discovered that the rhetoric of small government often clashed with what the public wanted. This truth has resurfaced in the Obama years, even among some adamant dissenters in Mr. Boehner's caucus, through their actions if not their words. For instance, almost two dozen House Republicans have tried energetically to grab multimillion-dollar federal projects for their home districts.
Contradictory? Absolutely. Hypocritical? Possibly. But such reversals are inescapable in politics. Jefferson executed as many as any other president. At the end of his four volumes, published in the late 19th century, Henry Adams summarized the paradoxical results of the ''second revolution.''
Jefferson, he wrote, ''had undertaken to create a government which should interfere in no way with private action, and he had created one which interfered directly in the concerns of every private citizen in the land. He had come into power as the champion of States- rights, and had driven States to the verge of armed resistance. He had begun by claiming credit for stern economy, and ended by exceeding the expenditures of his predecessors. He had invented a policy of peace, and his invention resulted in the necessity of fighting at once the two greatest Powers in the world.''
These defeats, Adams suggested, added up to a victory. Jefferson transformed a young republic into a nation. Taft, for his part, believed ''a government's integrity and stability in domestic affairs should be its principal virtue'' -- the very qualities our latter-day insurgents seem to distrust.
Correction: August 7, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis on July 31 about conservatives' approach to debt incorrectly described Harry S. Truman's political career. As vice president, he succeeded to the presidency in 1945 on the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was elected president in 1948, not re-elected.

HEADLINE: Halted on the Way to South Williamsport

BYLINE: By PAUL POST; Tadej Znidarcic contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KAMPALA, Uganda -- Felix Barugahare has no idea what a sporting goods store is. He shares a glove and swings someone else's bat, and there is a good chance that his baseball cleats are the first pair of shoes he has worn.
Felix is a second baseman for the Rev. John Foundation Little League team, the first team from Africa to qualify for the Little League World Series. But the players' aspirations for international success were dashed Friday when they were denied visas to travel to the United States. The State Department said that some of the visa applications included birth records that ''several parents admitted had been altered to make some players appear younger than they actually are.''
It is a sad coda to an inspirational story of a fledgling program for poor children who hoped to test their skills against the best teams in the world. More frustrating for Uganda is that for the second year in a row, a seemingly open path to South Williamsport, Pa., where the tournament is held, has been blocked by adults behind closed doors rather than by children on the playing field. 
Many of the boys on the foundation team live in crowded homes with their extended families, subsisting on as little as $100 a month. Some have no parents. And when there are parents in the picture, they are often illiterate, making it difficult to verify the birth certificate information and complicating State Department interviews.
Saying that ''what happened shames our country,'' Godfrey Mabirizi, the vice chairman of Uganda's National Council of Sports, told The Associated Press on Saturday that in the future the council would verify players' ages and documents. He also said the council would investigate and punish those responsible if they were found to have lied about players' ages.
With the boys' bleak prospects, there is little mystery why they have embraced America's national pastime.
''Because there is a future in baseball,'' said Felix, who is called Abooki and who began playing four years ago after his uncle took him to a playground where children were playing the game.
Felix lives in a one-room house, divided by a curtain, in an area of Kampala called Nsambya. He shares it with five others, including his grandmother, who is ill. He has one set of clothes: jeans shorts, a blue T-shirt and a black baseball cap that he never parts with. To reach the playground, he walks a narrow path separating the rows of densely packed one-story houses, most made of brick, some of mud.
Like children and adolescents everywhere, Felix is motivated by a complicated mix of current emotional needs and future dreams.
''Many people know me now,'' he said. ''I want to continue playing and join the major leagues, but if I can't, I want to become an umpire. Through baseball, I have made many friends. Baseball is better for me than soccer. In baseball, I can be known in Uganda. In soccer, you just play.''
Uganda has had few international sports heroes, probably because resources for training are scarce. Soccer, boxing and distance running are major sports. Some Ugandans have gone to the Olympics, and one, Moses Kipsiro, won the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races at last year's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.
In a short time, however, baseball has begun to capture the imagination of the young, in part because of the incentive of being able to compete internationally.
The Little League World Series, the pinnacle of the organized youth game, started in 1947 with teams only from the United States. Teams from Mexico and Canada joined in the 1950s. During the '60s, the tournament grew to include Europe and Asia. The current 16-team format, which includes eight international teams, was adopted in 2001. This year's play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 18.
Ivan Matovu, a pitcher who is Uganda's top player, said he had been looking forward to visiting the United States.
''I want to see how American people live,'' he said.
For Ivan, baseball is a chance for a better life. His parents separated when he was 3. Then his father died and his mother remarried and left him with her parents. His grandfather, who died last year, was the groundskeeper of a rugby field where baseball practices took place.
''Boys played baseball in the field next to the house,'' Ivan said. ''I liked it and started to play.''
Now his grandmother, Deziranta Namigadde, who is about 50, is his sole provider. Together they and two teenage girls and a boy in primary school live in a round tin shed, about eight feet in diameter, that was previously used to store tools. The house is dark and cramped. There is no netting to protect against mosquitoes that might carry yellow fever or malaria.
The other children are relatives of Ivan's, although he calls them his brother and sisters. He is the only one who sleeps on his own mattress. Toilets are in a separate structure about 20 yards from the shed. The children fetch water from a well.
Ivan already has an idea about the doors baseball can open. At 6, he went to Japan with a group called JICA, Japan's equivalent of the Peace Corps, which provides baseball equipment to developing countries.
Where Felix is outgoing, Ivan is reserved -- until he steps on the diamond, where he immediately takes charge.
''I would like to be a major league baseball player,'' he said. ''I want to achieve it by practicing hard.''
Little League baseball was introduced to Uganda eight years ago by Richard Stanley of Staten Island, a part-owner of the Yankees' Class AA Trenton Thunder.
Stanley, 68, has spent more than $1.5 million of his own money carving emerald diamonds out of Uganda's rich red earth, including a 40-acre complex in Mpigi, 20 miles west of Kampala, the capital.
He first visited the country under a United Nations economic development program. He founded the first youth team in Kampala in 2005.
Though baseball has caught on quickly here, only 200 children in the country actually play in Little League. The main obstacles are the lack of equipment and coaches.
In contrast to the United States, parents here are simply not involved. Most coaches are young men in their 20s and 30s, like Kirya Aron Jacob.
''Kids here have to explain to their parents about the game,'' Jacob said. ''Hardly any support is given to the kids, and sometimes, the parents stop their kids from playing baseball. But these kids have developed vision and hope for their lives through baseball, and most of them dream of playing in the major leagues.''
For the last two years, coaches from Major League Baseball's Global Envoy Program have conducted two-week camps for players of all ages at the Mpigi complex, which is at the end of a long, rutted dirt road lined with small banana tree groves and windowless brick houses.
The children get up early, train all day and stick around for pickup games long after formal drills end. They all know English -- Uganda is a former British colony, which Winston Churchill called the Pearl of Africa because of its lush, green landscape.
''Good dashing!'' a player yelled out as his teammate hustled to first base.
''Boom!'' was an affirmation of anything good, a solid hit or a sparkling defensive play.
Stanley travels to Uganda several times a year to oversee games, build fields and meet with government officials, whose support is needed for the program's expansion.
Uganda, which was to play its first Little League World Series game against Canada on Aug. 19, qualified by winning the Middle East-Africa regional tournament last month against Saudi Arabia, which had won the zone for the last 11 years. The tournament was held in Kutno, Poland, to avoid the intense heat of the Middle East.
The victory seemed a vindication of sorts. A year earlier at the same tournament, Uganda defeated Saudi Arabia in a protest-marred game in pool play, but a loss to Kuwait and a tie-breaker rule that was first misinterpreted in Uganda's favor -- the criterion was fewest runs per inning allowed -- kept the team out of the regional final.
This year, Uganda took a 6-1 lead into the last inning in the championship game. The Saudis loaded the bases with two outs, and a weak pop-up that should have ended the game fell between the shortstop and the third baseman. After a series of wild throws, the three base runners scored, leaving the batter standing on third with the potential tying run at the plate. But the next hitter grounded out, giving Uganda a 6-4 victory and igniting a wild celebration on the field.
''I feel good that we beat the Saudis and are the first African team to go to the U.S.,'' Felix said.
Players chosen for the Ugandan team come from Little League programs in Kampala, Jinja, Mugazi and Soroti, about 100 miles to the north. In May, they were taken to Mpigi.
''The individual programs have no formal schedule of games,'' Stanley said. ''To qualify for tournaments, teams have to play at least 12 organized games. So we brought them here. They all played 14 to 15 games in the space of 10 days.''
The Little League World Series was to have been the first step toward his ultimate goal: sending players to the big leagues, just as in the Dominican Republic, South Korea and Japan.
''The world will come to know about baseball in Africa,'' Jacob said before the State Department announced its decision. ''This will put Uganda on the world baseball map.''
Unfortunately for the Ugandans, for this year at least, that talent will not be on display for the world to see.
''A kid may not know his birthday,'' Stanley said. ''They don't have cake and ice cream.''

HEADLINE: Behind an Anti-Shariah Push

BYLINE: By ANDREA ELLIOTT

 BODY:
NASHVILLE -- Tennessee's latest woes include high unemployment, continuing foreclosures and a battle over collective-bargaining rights for teachers. But when a Republican representative took the Statehouse floor during a recent hearing, he warned of a new threat to his constituents' way of life: Islamic law.
The representative, a former fighter pilot named Rick Womick, said he had been studying the Koran. He declared that Shariah, the Islamic code that guides Muslim beliefs and actions, is not just an expression of faith but a political and legal system that seeks world domination. ''Folks,'' Mr. Womick, 53, said with a sudden pause, ''this is not what I call 'Do unto others what you'd have them do unto you.' ''
Similar warnings are being issued across the country as Republican presidential candidates, elected officials and activists mobilize against what they describe as the menace of Islamic law in the United States. 
Since last year, more than two dozen states have considered measures to restrict judges from consulting Shariah, or foreign and religious laws more generally. The statutes have been enacted in three states so far.
Voters in Oklahoma overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment last November that bans the use of Islamic law in court. And in June, Tennessee passed an antiterrorism law that, in its original iteration, would have empowered the attorney general to designate Islamic groups suspected of terror activity as ''Shariah organizations.''
A confluence of factors has fueled the anti-Shariah movement, most notably the controversy over the proposed Islamic center near ground zero in New York, concerns about homegrown terrorism and the rise of the Tea Party. But the campaign's air of grass-roots spontaneity, which has been carefully promoted by advocates, shrouds its more deliberate origins.
In fact, it is the product of an orchestrated drive that began five years ago in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in the office of a little-known lawyer, David Yerushalmi, a 56-year-old Hasidic Jew with a history of controversial statements about race, immigration and Islam. Despite his lack of formal training in Islamic law, Mr. Yerushalmi has come to exercise a striking influence over American public discourse about Shariah.
Working with a cadre of conservative public-policy institutes and former military and intelligence officials, Mr. Yerushalmi has written privately financed reports, filed lawsuits against the government and drafted the model legislation that recently swept through the country -- all with the effect of casting Shariah as one of the greatest threats to American freedom since the cold war.
The message has caught on. Among those now echoing Mr. Yerushalmi's views are prominent Washington figures like R. James Woolsey, a former director of the C.I.A., and the Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann, who this month signed a pledge to reject Islamic law, likening it to ''totalitarian control.''
Yet, for all its fervor, the movement is arguably directed at a problem more imagined than real. Even its leaders concede that American Muslims are not coalescing en masse to advance Islamic law. Instead, they say, Muslims could eventually gain the kind of foothold seen in Europe, where multicultural policies have allowed for what critics contend is an overaccommodation of Islamic law.
''Before the train gets too far down the tracks, it's time to put up the block,'' said Guy Rodgers, the executive director of ACT for America, one of the leading organizations promoting the legislation drafted by Mr. Yerushalmi.
The more tangible effect of the movement, opponents say, is the spread of an alarmist message about Islam -- the same kind of rhetoric that appears to have influenced Anders Behring Breivik, the suspect in the deadly dual attacks in Norway on July 22. The anti-Shariah campaign, they say, appears to be an end in itself, aimed at keeping Muslims on the margins of American life.
''The fact is there is no Shariah takeover in America,'' said Salam Al-Marayati, the president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, one of several Muslim organizations that have begun a counteroffensive. ''It's purely a political wedge to create fear and hysteria.''
Anti-Shariah organizers are pressing ahead with plans to introduce versions of Mr. Yerushalmi's legislation in half a dozen new states, while reviving measures that were tabled in others.
The legal impact of the movement is unclear. A federal judge blocked the Oklahoma amendment after a representative of the Council on American- Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group, sued the state, claiming the law was an unconstitutional infringement on religious freedom.
The establishment clause of the Constitution forbids the government from favoring one religion over another or improperly entangling itself in religious matters. But many of the statutes are worded neutrally enough that they might withstand constitutional scrutiny while still limiting the way courts handle cases involving Muslims, other religious communities or foreign and international laws.
For Mr. Yerushalmi, the statutes themselves are a secondary concern. ''If this thing passed in every state without any friction, it would have not served its purpose,'' he said in one of several extensive interviews. ''The purpose was heuristic -- to get people asking this question, 'What is Shariah?' ''
The Road Map
Shariah means ''the way to the watering hole.'' It is Islam's road map for living morally and achieving salvation. Drawing on the Koran and the sunnah -- the sayings and traditions of the prophet Muhammad -- Islamic law reflects what scholars describe as the attempt, over centuries, to translate God's will into a system of required beliefs and actions.
In the United States, Shariah, like Jewish law, most commonly surfaces in court through divorce and custody proceedings or in commercial litigation. Often these cases involve contracts that failed to be resolved in a religious setting. Shariah can also figure in cases involving foreign laws, for example in tort claims against businesses in Muslim countries. It then falls to the American judge to examine the religious issues at hand before making a ruling based on federal or state law.
The frequency of such cases is unknown. A recent report by the Center for Security Policy, a research institute based in Washington for which Mr. Yerushalmi is general counsel, identified 50 state appellate cases, mostly over the last three decades. The report offers these cases as proof that the United States is vulnerable to the encroachment of Islamic law. But, as many of the cases demonstrate, judges tend to follow guidelines that give primacy to constitutional rights over foreign or religious laws.
The exceptions stand out. Critics most typically cite a New Jersey case last year in which a Moroccan woman sought a restraining order against her husband after he repeatedly assaulted and raped her. The judge denied the request, finding that the defendant lacked criminal intent because he believed that his wife must comply, under Islamic law, with his demand for sex.
The decision was reversed on appeal.
''It's wrong to just accept that the courts generally get it right, but sometimes get it wrong,'' said Stephen M. Gele, a Louisiana lawyer who represents a nonprofit organization that has promoted Mr. Yerushalmi's legislation. ''There is no reason to make a woman play a legal game of Russian roulette.''
While proponents of the legislation have seized on aspects of Shariah that are unfavorable to women, Mr. Yerushalmi's focus is broader. His interest in Islamic law began with the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, when he was living in Ma'ale Adumim, a large Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
At the time, Mr. Yerushalmi, a native of South Florida, divided his energies between a commercial litigation practice in the United States and a conservative research institute based in Jerusalem, where he worked to promote free-market reform in Israel.
After moving to Brooklyn the following year, Mr. Yerushalmi said he began studying Arabic and Shariah under two Islamic scholars, whom he declined to name. He said his research made clear that militants had not ''perverted'' Islamic law, but were following an authoritative doctrine that sought global hegemony -- a mission, he says, that is shared by Muslims around the world. To illustrate that point, Mr. Yerushalmi cites studies in which large percentages of Muslims overseas say they support Islamic rule.
In interviews, Islamic scholars disputed Mr. Yerushalmi's claims. Although Islam, like some other faiths, aspires to be the world's reigning religion, they said, the method for carrying out that goal, or even its relevance in everyday life, remains a far more complex subject than Mr. Yerushalmi suggests.
''Even in Muslim-majority countries, there is a huge debate about what it means to apply Islamic law in the modern world,'' said Andrew F. March, an associate professor specializing in Islamic law at Yale University. The deeper flaw in Mr. Yerushalmi's argument, Mr. March said, is that he characterizes the majority of Muslims who practice some version of Shariah -- whether through prayer, charitable giving or other common rituals -- as automatic adherents to Islam's medieval rules of war and political domination.
It is not the first time Mr. Yerushalmi has engaged in polemics. In a 2006 essay, he wrote that ''most of the fundamental differences between the races are genetic,'' and asked why ''people find it so difficult to confront the facts that some races perform better in sports, some better in mathematical problem-solving, some better in language, some better in Western societies and some better in tribal ones?'' He has also railed against what he sees as a politically correct culture that avoids open discussion of why ''the founding fathers did not give women or black slaves the right to vote.''
On its Web site, the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization, describes Mr. Yerushalmi as having a record of ''anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-black bigotry.'' His legal clients have also drawn notoriety, among them Pamela Geller, an incendiary blogger who helped drive the fight against the Islamic community center and mosque near ground zero.
A stout man who wears antique wire-rimmed glasses and a thick, white-streaked beard, Mr. Yerushalmi has a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for the arguments his work provokes. ''It's an absurdity to claim that I have ever uttered or taken a position on the side of racism or bigotry or misogyny,'' he said.
When pressed for evidence that American Muslims endorse the fundamentalist view of Shariah he warns against, Mr. Yerushalmi argues that the problem lies with America's Muslim institutions and their link to Islamist groups overseas. As a primary example, he and others cite a memorandum that surfaced in the federal prosecution of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, a Muslim charity based in Texas whose leaders were convicted in 2008 of sending funds to Hamas.
The 1991 document outlined a strategy for the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that involved ''eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within.'' Critics emphasize a page listing 29 Muslim American groups as ''our organizations and the organizations of our friends.'' Skeptics point out that on the same page, the author wrote, imagine if ''they all march according to one plan,'' which suggests they were not working in tandem.
Nevertheless, a study by the Abu Dhabi Gallup Center to be released next week found that only a minority of American Muslims say that domestic Islamic groups represent them. It also concludes that American Muslims have as much confidence in the judicial system as members of other faiths and are more likely than the other groups to say that elections in the United States are ''honest.''
''There's a conflation between the idea of Islam being a universalist, proselytizing religion and reducing it to a totalitarian movement,'' said Mohammad Fadel, an associate professor specializing in Islamic law at the University of Toronto. ''All good propaganda is based on half-truths.''
Reaching Out
The movement took root in January 2006 when Mr. Yerushalmi started the Society of Americans for National Existence, a nonprofit organization that became his vehicle for opposing Shariah. On the group's Web site, he proposed a law that would make observing Islamic law, which he likened to sedition, a felony punishable by 20 years in prison. He also began raising money to study whether there is a link between ''Shariah-adherent behavior'' in American mosques and support for violent jihad.
The project, Mapping Shariah, led Mr. Yerushalmi to Frank Gaffney, a hawkish policy analyst and commentator who is the president of the Center for Security Policy in Washington. Well connected in neoconservative circles, Mr. Gaffney has been known to take polarizing positions (he once argued that President Obama might secretly be Muslim). Mr. Gaffney would emerge as Mr. Yerushalmi's primary link to a network of former and current government officials, security analysts and grass-roots political organizations.
Together, they set out to ''engender a national debate about the nature of Shariah and the need to protect our Constitution and country from it,'' Mr. Gaffney wrote in an e-mail to The New York Times. The center contributed an unspecified amount to Mr. Yerushalmi's study, which cost roughly $400,000 and involved surreptitiously sending researchers into 100 mosques. The study, which said that 82 percent of the mosques' imams recommended texts that promote violence, has drawn sharp rebuke from Muslim leaders, who question its premise and findings.
Mr. Yerushalmi also took aim at the industry of Islamic finance -- specifically American banks offering funds that invest only in companies deemed permissible under Shariah, which would exclude, for example, those that deal in alcohol, pork or gambling.
In the spring of 2008, Mr. Gaffney arranged meetings with officials at the Treasury Department, including Robert M. Kimmitt, then the deputy secretary, and Stuart A. Levey, then the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. Mr. Yerushalmi warned them about what he characterized as the lack of transparency and other dangers of Shariah-compliant finance.
In an interview, Mr. Levey said he found Mr. Yerushalmi's presentation of Shariah ''sweeping and, ultimately, unconvincing.''
For Mr. Yerushalmi, the meetings led to a shift in strategy. ''If you can't move policy at the federal level, well, where do you go?'' he said. ''You go to the states.''
With the advent of the Tea Party, Mr. Yerushalmi saw an opening. In 2009, he and Mr. Gaffney laid the groundwork for a project aimed at state legislatures -- the same year that Mr. Yerushalmi received more than $153,000 in consulting fees from Mr. Gaffney's center, according to a tax form filed by the group.
That summer, Mr. Yerushalmi began writing ''American Laws for American Courts,'' a model statute that would prevent state judges from considering foreign laws or rulings that violate constitutional rights in the United States. The law was intended to appeal not just to the growing anti-Shariah movement, but also to a broader constituency that had long opposed the influence of foreign laws in the United States.
Mr. Gaffney swiftly drummed up interest in the law, holding conference calls with activists and tapping a network of Tea Party and Christian groups as well as ACT for America, which has 170,000 members and describes itself as ''opposed to the authoritarian values of radical Islam.'' The group emerged as a ''force multiplier,'' Mr. Gaffney said, fanning out across the country to promote the law. The American Public Policy Alliance, a nonprofit organization formed that year by a political consultant based in Michigan, began recruiting dozens of lawyers to act as legislative sponsors.
Early versions of the law, which passed in Tennessee and then Louisiana, made no mention of Shariah, which was necessary to pass constitutional muster, Mr. Yerushalmi said. But as the movement spread, state lawmakers began tweaking the legislation to refer to Shariah and other religious laws or systems -- including, in one ill-fated proposal in Arizona, ''karma.''
By last fall, the anti-Shariah movement had gained new prominence. ACT for America spent $60,000 promoting the Oklahoma initiative, a campaign that included 600,000 robocalls featuring Mr. Woolsey, the former C.I.A. director. Mr. Gingrich called for a federal law banning courts from using Shariah in place of American law, and Sarah Palin warned that if Shariah law ''were to be adopted, allowed to govern in our country, it will be the downfall of America.''
Also last fall, Mr. Gaffney's organization released ''Shariah: The Threat to America,'' a 172-page report whose lead author was Mr. Yerushalmi and whose signatories included Mr. Woolsey and other former intelligence officials.
Mr. Yerushalmi's legislation has drawn opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union as well as from Catholic bishops and Jewish groups. Mr. Yerushalmi said he did not believe that court cases involving Jewish or canon law would be affected by the statutes because they are unlikely to involve violations of constitutional rights.
Business lobbyists have also expressed concern about the possible effect of the statutes, as corporations often favor foreign laws in contracts or tort disputes. This is perhaps the only constituency that has had an influence. The three state statutes that have passed -- most recently in Arizona -- make corporations exempt.
''It is not preferable,'' Mr. Yerushalmi said. ''Is it an acceptable political compromise? Of course it is.''

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Back in the Economy: The debt limit fight has been a dangerous distraction from the clear and present problems

 BODY:
The economy is in trouble, and Washington -- fixated on budget slashing at a time when the economy needs more spending -- seems determined to make matters worse.
On Friday, in the midst of the debt limit battle, the government reported that economic growth nearly ground to a halt in the first quarter of 2011, a far worse performance than previously estimated. The second-quarter growth number, a feeble 1.3 percent annual rate, is not nearly enough to stop unemployment from rising even higher.
Nor are there persuasive signs that absent more government support, conditions will turn around anytime soon. Indeed, they are bound to worsen if Congress approves deep near-term spending cuts as part of a debt-limit deal while letting relief and recovery measures expire. 
We will leave it to the historians to figure out how both political parties, and many Americans, became convinced that austerity is the road to recovery. History provides evidence that it is not, including the premature budget tightening of 1937 that reignited the Depression.
For now, it is clear that the traditional drivers of recovery -- consumer spending and residential real estate -- have failed to rebound, with the latest report showing consumers extremely cautious about spending on anything and the housing market stuck at its post-bubble lows.
Weak demand leads to slow growth, and slow growth leads to high and rising unemployment, which then reinforces weak demand and slow growth, and so on, in a vicious cycle from which the economy, obviously, has found no escape.
It is a situation that cries out for help from the government, and yet the opposite is happening. As federal stimulus programs from 2009 have ended -- including aid to states and infrastructure projects -- state and local governments have also cut back, leading to layoffs and less spending on contractors and social programs. The fiscal drag will only intensify in the quarters to come if the near-term budget cuts being called for in the debt limit fight are enacted.
This is not an argument for spending without limits. Given exploding health care costs as the baby boomers retire, budget cuts are unavoidable -- but they are not urgent. With the economy weak and interest rates low, austerity makes no sense.
At this point, deep cuts are all but inevitable. But there are sensible things to be done to limit the harm. Budget cuts should be timed to begin as the economy recovers. Congress should vote to extend the federal unemployment benefits program and the payroll tax cut for employees. Republicans will likely oppose even those basic measures. So the White House and Congressional Democrats are going to have to do a better job of explaining economic reality than they have done so far.
Here is one point to start with: Allowing just those two programs to expire at the end of the year would needlessly shave nearly a full percentage point from growth in 2012.
Other measures should also be taken quickly. Lawmakers should pass a bill by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, that could delay and reduce taxes on businesses, by forgiving loans for states that rebuild their unemployment funds. They should also reauthorize the highway trust fund, a crucial measure to repair infrastructure and create jobs, as called for in the Senate version of the transportation bill.
The administration should work to ease the rules for refinancing mortgages that are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Easier refinancings would lower monthly payments for potentially hundreds of thousands of borrowers in good standing and, in the process, free up spending money to spur the economy, at little or no cost to taxpayers.
Those are admittedly piecemeal steps to ameliorate huge economic problems. If the steps are not taken, policy makers are risking more quarters of anemic growth or, worse, renewed recession.

HEADLINE: Coming: 'Invasion Of the Walking Debt'

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
AMERICA has always had an apocalyptic strain. Yet it also seems to believe that if, or when, The End comes, it will still come out on top.
During, say, zombie movies, we Americans identify with that tough guy on horseback -- the survivor with the Stetson and the rifle. It's always the other guy, that poor sap sitting next to us, we think, who would become the half-eaten corpse.
Which, weirdly, just might explain the recent fascination with how bad things could become for the economy if the United States lost its triple-A credit rating. 
Wall Street is worried that America's gilt-edged rating will slip away. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But a reckoning, many economists say, will come, given the nation's staggering debts and dysfunctional politics. The possible repercussions include an even bigger budget deficit and higher borrowing costs for the government, businesses and consumers.
Just how far the shockwaves might travel is uncertain. So speculating about what an economic apocalypse might look like has become fashionable in both financial and political circles. Of course, for the millions of Americans who are out of work -- some for years now -- Armageddon is already here. Maybe a little hellfire -- if homeowners' insurance will cover it -- is what we need to fix the mess.
But there is nothing so bad that it can't get worse. And so last year, to great fanfare, ''When Money Dies: Germany in the 1920s and the Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation and Hyperinflation,'' first published in 1975, was reissued and found a cult following inside the Beltway and among hedge funds.
In ''Zone One,'' a forthcoming novel by the Pulitzer Prize finalist Colson Whitehead, a virus turns most of humanity into flesh-eating crazies; the narrator hunts stragglers around Wall Street. In ''The Walking Dead,'' the hit television series set in a zombie-infested America, an image of Atlanta's abandoned financial district conjured an end-of-world vibe. Nothing says apocalypse, apparently, like a city without functioning A.T.M.'s.
But for all of our serious economic problems -- persistent high unemployment, spreading home foreclosures, the risks that bad policy, bad luck or both will send the economy back into recession -- the United States of 2011 is nowhere near as bad as, say, the Vienna of 1918.
''When Money Dies'' charts the travails of people like Anna Eisenmenger, who bartered her dead husband's gold watch for potatoes, watched her malnourished grandson develop scurvy and saw neighbors attack mounted policemen so they could slaughter and eat the horses. Next to the Weimar Republic, higher interest rates on credit cards -- a likely outcome of the current debt bickering -- seem tolerable.
Indeed, Raghuram G. Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago, argues that even if the United States were to default on its debt briefly, the world would mostly keep calm and carry on. Americans' lives probably wouldn't change markedly, he says. The more troubling and longer-lasting issue would be the United States' loss of credibility among investors and overseas sovereign wealth funds.
''A failure to compromise sends a signal to the world that U.S. politicians can't get their act together, and this nation might not be the best choice for guiding the international economy,'' Mr. Rajan says. ''The real risk is that investors will start looking for another country as the world's financial standard-bearer.''
Which raises the troubling possibility that what is happening now could stretch on for years. People could remain out of work, businesses could be starved of capital and politics could impede a lasting economic recovery.
At least killing zombies feels like a job.
Debt troubles have come and gone in this country, and not only on Capitol Hill. In the 1970s, New York City defaulted on its debt, and yes, the consequences were painful. Enrollment plummeted at City University campuses, which until then had offered free education. Seven thousand police officers were laid off. Crime skyrocketed. Services for the poor disappeared.
But in the wake of that crisis, the city started changing business regulations and tax structures, setting the stage for a building boom. As blue-collar manufacturing jobs evaporated, in came white-collar jobs in finance, real estate and so on.
Out of the ashes of default, the yuppies rose -- and, eventually, the banking and hedge fund classes that helped give us the late, great bubble.
On second thought, maybe we're better off with the undead.
