HEADLINE: Senate G.O.P. Leaders Urge Plan to Lift Taxes on Dividends 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the Senate, remaining loyal to President Bush, abandoned any hope of bipartisanship and offered a tax cut plan today that would temporarily suspend taxes on stock dividends and then reinstate those taxes in three years.
 But the leaders acknowledged it would be an uphill struggle to round up a majority of senators for the plan, which may not even make it out of the Senate Finance Committee. 
 In the House, the Ways and Means Committee approved along strict party lines a very different and more costly approach to tax reduction. This plan, which was drafted last week by the Republican chairman, Representative Bill Thomas of California, would reduce but not eliminate the tax on dividends and would lower it and the tax on capital gains to 15 percent. 
The House plan was approved in the committee by a vote of 24 to 15 and is scheduled to reach the House floor on Friday.
The maneuvers today were preliminary steps, but Mr. Bush claimed an early victory in having persuaded Congress of the need for tax reduction, even if he fails to get approval of his full proposal. Though he said he still preferred eliminating all taxes on dividends, he said the House plan had its good points.
"The House of Representatives is considering a proposal that would include all the elements of the growth plan," Mr. Bush told members of the United States Chamber of Commerce this morning. "It would also significantly reduce the double taxation on dividends. It's a positive step, and they're making progress. I'm going to continue to work with both the House and the Senate, with the goal of making sure as many people can find work as possible."
The president's proposal and the Senate and House bills have many elements in common. They would lower income tax rates for middle- and upper-income taxpayers, give a new tax break to married couples and raise the annual tax credit for each child to $1,000 from $600. They would also expand the write-off that small businesses can take for investment expenses.
Under all three versions, most families could expect to get a rebate check of $400 this year for each child, representing their tax credit for this year, a couple of months after the bill became law.
But the biggest point of contention has been over the main element of the president's $726 billion, 10-year proposal, the complete elimination of taxes on most dividends.
The Senate bill proposed today by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, would cut the tax on dividends by one-third this year and by two-thirds next year and eliminate it entirely in 2005. But in 2006, the tax would be fully imposed again. The temporary aspect was necessary to keep the bill within the $350 billion, 10-year ceiling the Senate adopted in its budget last month.
Democrats attacked the proposal as a cynical gimmick, and as of tonight, there did not appear to be enough votes for approval in the Finance Committee and probably not in the Senate.
The top Democrat on the panel, Max Baucus of Montana, said today that all the Democrats on the committee opposed the Grassley measure. If Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, joins them, the committee would reject the bill, and today she called the idea a gimmick that she could not support. 
Mr. Grassley said he might have to modify his plan before the bill goes before his committee for a vote on Thursday.
Mr. Grassley, who has insisted all year that only a bipartisan tax bill could win enough votes for passage, said today he had no alternative but to adopt the partisan approach, which he himself said was a gimmick. Almost all Republicans, he said, want to abolish the tax on dividends and want to lower the top tax rate to 35 percent from 38.6 percent. Almost all Democrats oppose those steps.
House leaders, having concluded that the full dividend tax cut cannot pass, have abandoned it and created a new plan that reduces taxes on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent for most taxpayers. Dividends are now taxed as ordinary income, and the current tax rate can be as high as 38.6 percent for high-income taxpayers. Capital gains, which are the profits when an investment is sold, are now taxed at 20 percent for most taxpayers.
But the House plan uses a few tactics criticized as gimmicks by Democrats that are similar to the Senate plan for squeezing a large tax cut into the $550 billion limit adopted by the House last month. The child tax credit would increase to $1,000 until 2005, when it would revert to the $700 in current law. Similarly, the elimination of the marriage tax penalty would expire that same year, as would tax reduction for low-income people.
Democrats said Republicans were well aware that a future Congress would be under extreme pressure to extend those tax breaks but had proposed the artificial cutoff tomake the entire package look smaller. But Republicans said they did what they had to do under the limits, and Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader, praised Mr. Thomas for his "creative" approach to the problem.
"Unfortunately, we are faced with a number that we have to deal with, and in order to fit within that number the policy has to be designed to be effective," Mr. DeLay said.
Senate Democrats also proposed their own tax reduction plan, and though it has no chance of being enacted, it provided a sharp contrast with the Republican approach. The proposal, outlined by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, would provide a $300 tax credit for every working adult and the first two children in a family, which would cost $72 billion over 10 years. The plan would also increase the child tax credit and the standard deduction, and would allow businesses to take a larger tax credit for health-care premiums. It would provide $40 billion in aid to struggling state governments, and $13 billion in extended unemployment benefits.
The overall plan would cost $152 billion over 10 years, considerably less than the $350 billion Republican plan in the Senate and the $550 billion plan in the House.
"Our plan puts America back on the path to fiscal responsibility," Mr. Daschle said. "It provides three times more economic boost this year, when we need it most, than the Republican plan, at a fraction of the cost. And it doesn't create huge, permanent new obligations that will worsen our long-term economic situation."

What Some Much-Noted Data Really Showed About Vouchers

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip; E-mail: edmike@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN August of 2000, in the midst of the Bush-Gore presidential race, a Harvard professor, Paul E. Peterson, released a study saying that school vouchers significantly improved test scores of black children. Professor Peterson had conducted the most ambitious randomized experiment on vouchers to date, and his results -- showing that blacks using vouchers to attend private schools had scored six percentile points higher than a control group of blacks in public schools -- became big news.
 The Harvard professor appeared on CNN and "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." Conservative editorial writers and columnists, including William Safire of The Times, cited the Peterson study as proof that vouchers were the answer for poor blacks, that Al Gore (a voucher opponent) was out of touch with his black Democratic constituency and that George W. Bush had it right. 
 "The facts are clear and persuasive: school vouchers work," The Boston Herald editorialized on Aug. 30, 2000. "If candidates looked at facts, this one would be a no-brainer for Gore."
Then, three weeks later, Professor Peterson's partner in the study, Mathematica, a Princeton-based research firm, issued a sharp dissent. Mathematica's report emphasized that all the gains in Professor Peterson's experiment, conducted in New York City, had come in just one of the five grades studied, the sixth, and that the rest of the black pupils, as well as Latinos and whites of all grades who used vouchers, had shown no gains. Since there was no logical explanation for this, Mathematica noted the chance of a statistical fluke. "Because gains are so concentrated in this single group, one needs to be very cautious," it said.
Several newspapers wrote about Mathematica's report, but, coming three weeks after the first round of articles, these did not have the same impact.
And Professor Peterson, a big voucher supporter, continued, undaunted. His 2002 book, "The Education Gap," largely ignored Mathematica's concerns and ballyhooed voucher gains for blacks. "The switch to a private school had significantly positive impacts on the test scores of African-American students," he wrote. 
While he still couldn't explain why only blacks had gained, he offered theories. Perhaps heavily black public schools were even worse than urban Latino or white schools. Or, since most vouchers in New York were used in Catholic schools, perhaps a religious "missionary commitment is required to create a positive educational environment" for blacks.
David Myers, the lead researcher for Mathematica, is hesitant to criticize Professor Peterson. ("I'm going to be purposely vague on that," he said in an interview.) But he did something much more decent and important. After many requests from skeptical academics, he agreed to make the entire database for the New York voucher study available to independent researchers.
A Princeton economist, Alan B. Krueger, took the offer, and after two years recently concluded that Professor Peterson had it all wrong -- that not even the black students using vouchers had made any test gains. And Mr. Myers, Professor Peterson's former research partner, agrees, calling Professor Krueger's work "a fine interpretation of the results."
What makes this a cautionary tale for political leaders seeking to draft public policy from supposedly scientific research is the mundane nature of the apparent miscalculations. Professor Krueger concluded that the original study had failed to count 292 black students whose test scores should have been included. And once they are added -- making the sample larger and statistically more reliable -- vouchers appear to have made no difference for any group.
Some background. In 1997, 20,000 New York City students each applied for a $1,400 voucher to private school through a project financed by several foundations. A total of 1,300 were selected by lottery to get a voucher, and 1,300 others -- the controls, who had wanted a voucher but were not selected -- were tracked in public schools. When the first test results came back, the vouchers made no difference in test scores for the 2,600 students as a whole. So the original researchers tried breaking the group down by ethnicity and race, and that's when they noted the sixth-grade test gains for the black voucher group.
But there was a problem. The original researchers had never planned to break out students by race. As a result, their definition of race was not well thought out: it depended solely on the mother. In their data, a child with a black mother and a white father was counted as black; a child with a white mother and a black father was counted as white.
When the father's race is considered, 78 more blacks are added to the sample. Professor Krueger also found that 214 blacks had been unnecessarily eliminated from the results because of incomplete background data. These corrections by Professor Krueger expanded the total number of blacks in the sample by 292, to 811 from 519. 
In recent weeks, Mr. Myers, of Mathematica, has reviewed Professor Krueger's critique and found it impressive. Mr. Myers has now concluded that Professor Krueger's adjustments mean that "the impact of a voucher offer is not statistically significant."
It is scary how many prominent thinkers in this nation of 290 million were ready to make new policy from a single study that appears to have gone from meaningful to meaningless based on whether 292 children's test scores are discounted or included. "It's not a study I'd want to use to make public policy," Mr. Myers said. "I see this and go 'whoa.' "
Professor Krueger of Princeton (who also writes a monthly business column in The Times) said, "This appeared to be high-quality work, but it teaches you not to believe anything until the data are made available."
As for Professor Peterson of Harvard, the star of newspapers and TV news in 2000 remains curiously mum these days. In a brief interview, he declined to comment on Professor Krueger's or Mathematica's criticisms. He said he stood by his conclusion that vouchers lifted black scores, and would "eventually" respond in a "technical paper." But he said he would not discuss these matters with a reporter.
"It's not appropriate," he said, "to talk about complex methodologies in the news media."

HEADLINE: Bush Signs Trade Pact With Singapore, aWartime Ally 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
President Bush signed a free trade agreement today with Singapore, his first since Congress granted him tradepromotion authority last summer and the largest since the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore joined the president for a signing ceremony at the White House in a display of what Franklin L. Lavin, the ambassador to Singapore, said was the administration's policy, after the war in Iraq, of "working with friends." 
 Indeed, Mr. Bush brought a sizable contingent of cabinet members and senior advisers to the ceremony, including Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state; Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser; Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary; and Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative. 
Unspoken was the second part of the policy -- to punish those nations that did not support the United States in the war. Chile had expected to be the first country to sign such an agreement after completing negotiations in December, a full month before Singapore completed its agreement. But Chile lost that honor by refusing to support the United States in its call for war at the United Nations Security Council, where Chile is a member, senior administration officials said.
"You know, people are disappointed," Mr. Zoellick said at an earlier news conference. "I'm disappointed. We worked very closely with our Chilean partners. We hoped for their support in a time that we felt was very important."
At the ceremony, the president did offer hope, promising, "We're finalizing our pact with Chile."
In several statements regarding trade pacts, administration officials made it clear there was nothing subtle about the policy.
When the president announced the signing ceremony, from Camp Lejeune, N.C., during the war, he praised Singapore not for its economic strength and global trading strategy but for being "a strong partner in the war on terrorism and a member of the coalition on Iraq."
At the ceremony, he praised Mr. Goh for "working together to meet the threats of a new era" and for offering to send police and health workers to aid in rebuilding Iraq. 
"I'm grateful, as well, for your commitment to a world that trades in freedom," he said. "We take great pride in the strong relationship between our countries."
The agreement is subject to approval by the Senate, although Mr. Bush's trade promotion authority means Congress can only approve or reject its language, not alter it.
For Singapore, the agreement helps secure its position as a leading financial and trading nation in the region, and it is especially welcome as Singapore and other nations battle the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Officials said they also believed the agreement represented an end to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, which had raised huge questions about the East Asian economic miracle and sent investors fleeing Southeast Asia.
Although a small city-state, Singapore is the 12th-largest trading partner of the United States, with trade volume of $33.4 billion last year.
Mr. Goh said today that the agreement was a "milestone in U.S.-Singapore relations." 
"The U.S.-Singapore F.T.A. is also the beginning of a trans-Pacific bridge between the U.S. and East Asia," he said. "I believe that it will catalyze greater trade liberalization in East Asia."
Described as the "gold standard" for free trade agreements, the pact guarantees that all American exports to Singapore will face zero tariffs immediately. Tariffs on imports from Singapore will largely disappear, with a small number being phased out within eight years. The agreement also provides protections for intellectual property, workers' rights and the environment.
The one complication in the agreement was controlling foreign currency flows, an issue that Singapore, like many other Asian nations, believed was critical to avoiding a repeat of the financial crisis. Singapore won a compromise that allows it to impose restrictions on foreign capital flows in a crisis.
Most important, said Nao Matsukata, the former director of policy and planning for Mr. Zoellick, the agreement gives the United States a "direct link to Southeast Asia, where we don't have the strongest economic ties."
But good news for Singapore is bad news for Chile.
Ambassador Andres Bianchi of Chile said that officially the delay resulted from problems translating the agreement into Spanish and that he was contacting members of Congress and visiting important districts around the country.
"We are doing quite a bit of work, believe me," Mr. Bianchi said.
But it is the president and his administration who need to be convinced, said Peter Hakim, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. He said the Chileans failed to understand the administration's anger that allies like Chile would fail to support a war the United States considered crucial to national security.
"It was very hard for Chile when every part of its society was against the war -- from the right all the way across to the left," Mr. Hakim said.
"The U.S. is exaggerating this 'you're for us or against us.' But in a real sense, the Latin Americans failed to understand the depth of the U.S. feeling on this."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Gates Introduces New PC Prototype 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, yesterday demonstrated a prototype for a new personal computer built with the Hewlett-Packard Company that will be used for handling phone calls and teleconferencing. The Athens prototype has a wide-screen display and a video camera and phone attached to the screen. 
Hewlett will add features from Athens to PC's next year, said Lewis Kim, marketing director for Hewlett's worldwide business desktop unit. Those advances "encourage people to jump in and get something new," Mr. Gates said in an interview. "Our innovations are why demand has gone up a little bit this year instead of going down, which, given the general economic conditions, you wouldn't expect." Microsoft is working with PC makers on new designs it hopes can increase computer sales, as many companies switch to replacing PC's every four to five years, rather than more frequently, said Tom Phillips, general manager of Microsoft's Windows Hardware Experience Group. Mr. Gates spoke in New Orleans at the Windows hardware engineering conference for companies that build computers and devices with Microsoft's Windows operating system. Microsoft shares rose $1.30, to $27.79.

Robinson Builds Legacy for All San Antonio

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
WHEN the time came last May to make the announcement of his impending retirement from the N.B.A., David Robinson chose a school library as the site and he invited a group of his biggest fans and friends, the student body.
 The grandiosity of such events has never been his style, so better in the company of children, who can't hear soon enough, as far as Robinson is concerned, that "life is not all about making as much money as you can and being as famous as you can; it's about service."
 Fame, they say, is fleeting. With any luck, a legacy lasts forever. Here on San Antonio's humble east side, Mr. Robinson's adopted neighborhood, the longtime linchpin of the Spurs is less the star attraction than the nice man who lies on the floor and lets his 7-foot-1 frame be traced for an Egyptian mummy project. 
 "What does David Robinson mean to me?" says Edwin Bates, a third grader in Linda Osborne's class. "He's very tall. He comes in and encourages us to pay attention to adults, at home and in school."
 These are the children, almost all African-American and Hispanic, Robinson set out to save from academic deprivation. Soon, and especially if the Spurs fail to dethrone the Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals that continue tonight with San Antonio leading, 1-0, these will also be the children who will become Robinson's postplaying salvation.
 It takes a former midshipman and possibly a future minister to know that the "next phase of life" isn't going to be uncomplicated, even as a calling. 
 "Believe me, I have those concerns," Robinson said yesterday, back in the library of the Carver Academy, the small private school serving the inner city that he and his wife, Valerie, helped finance and found. "It's intimidating when you step out of your comfort zone. People start businesses all the time and they flop. Building a school like this, it's scary."
 Certain as he was when he made the decision to walk away after this season, at 37, retirement for the athlete is typically the great unknown. It is that place where introspection is forced upon those who have lived by instinct. How many of the superstars delay and delay and never really move on from what they were? Michael Jordan, for all he accomplished on the basketball court, may never spiritually escape it.
 It was a few years ago, when the Spurs were playing at the Alamodome on the eastern edge of downtown, that Robinson said he looked across the interstate, to the blighted streets of low-slung buildings and crumbling services and envisioned what he could do when the game was done.
 They were a matchmaker's dream, Robinson and San Antonio, the Navy grad and Christian in a conservative city with a strong military presence. San Antonio, a surviving American Basketball Association outpost, needed a sturdy presence to establish the Spurs on the N.B.A. map. Robinson was that, and much more.
 He joined the team in 1989, with his chiseled body and southpaw jumper. By 1992, he was an original Dream Team Olympian, a league most valuable player in 1995, a champion in 1999 after Tim Duncan had joined a towering front line. While his three sons were born across the decade, Robinson played in 10 All-Star Games, made four all-defensive first teams. During these years, San Antonio became a convention city, a boomtown. 
 "I always say, 'Look, we've grown up as a franchise; we've grown up as a city,"' he said. "I've enjoyed that part of it as much as anything. This has become my family, and I've always loved the interaction, the fact that people here would come up and talk, and kids would hug me on the street, and to them I was just David."
 Around the N.B.A., it was an eye-opening development in 1997 when the Robinsons made a $5 million donation toward the development of an independent, faith-based school that would feature small, racially and economically diverse classes with a strong core curriculum and a concentration in foreign language and the arts.
 They would ultimately give another $4 million. In its second year of operation, the Carver Academy has 70 students from prekindergarten through third grade, on the way to a planned 300. Almost all the students are receiving part or full scholarships, though the goal is to have 40 percent of the students pay the full tuition, $8,500.
 Some here have asked why Robinson did not go to work for public schools. He said he wanted his academy to be linked to his faith and to others. Your cup of tea or not, this is who Robinson is. It is indisputable that he has been true to himself and to his home.
 The construction of the six-acre campus, once haunted by abandoned crack houses, has spurred development nearby. The school wants to share its athletic and technology facilities with the community. It is far from its endowment goal of $35 million, so Robinson, who has an office at the school, will become a full-time fund-raiser.
 He will shoot for the kids and they will hug him, as the kindergartners did en masse when he appeared yesterday, soon after practice, in the library he helped build. Who said fame must be fleeting?

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Proceeds, Modestly 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
When it was first announced in 1999, Lincoln Center's redevelopment was to cost $1.5 billion over 10 years and radically transform the campus. The architect Frank Gehry devised a glass atrium over the fountain plaza. There was talk of a new home for the New York City Opera in Damrosch Park.
 Now the City Opera has decided to move downtown. Avery Fisher Hall is likely to be renovated rather than rebuilt. New York City, in perilous fiscal straits, appears unlikely to be able to fulfill the $240 million pledge that Rudolph W. Giuliani made for the project when he was mayor. The private sector is feeling the economic pinch before fund-raising has even begun. 
 What's left of the redevelopment project? What part of it can Lincoln Center hope to accomplish? 
With the economic downturn, all the grand plans now seem like pipe dreams. The 11 private and public groups involved in the redevelopment have been forced to reassess. New management has come in at the top -- Bruce Crawford as chairman and Reynold Levy as president -- arriving in the wake of internecine tensions that had slowed the project.
The plan looks decidedly more modest today, and less glamorous. The center is taking the project step by step now, rather than attempting a transformation all at once. Mr. Crawford said he expected it to cost $500 million to $800 million, half of what was originally projected. Its most solid feature right now is turning West 65th Street into the main artery of the performing arts center, a project that together with Lincoln Center's other public spaces is expected to cost $150 million. It is to begin in June 2004.
Many of those involved in the project say that Peter M. Lehrer, the construction executive who became chairman of the redevelopment project in September, is unhappy in the job, finding himself a builder who has not been able to build anything.
Mr. Crawford said the diminished scope of the project merely reflected the economic climate, just as the original plans were a child of the flush late 90's. "It was really a time when grand plans were prevalent everywhere," Mr. Crawford said. "Wish lists were de rigueur."
But he and Mr. Levy said the reconstruction would proceed, because it was essential. 
"This is not what we would like to have; it is what is necessary," Mr. Crawford said. "These are not luxuries. We're looking at it today in that light." He continued: "Lincoln Center's theaters and public spaces have to be improved and maintained. You can't go decades without bringing them up to date." 
The redevelopment still amounts to significant changes, Mr. Levy said, not merely nips and tucks. The new 65th Street, for example, is being redesigned by Diller & Scofidio, the contemporary architecture team. "I don't think you retain Diller & Scofidio to simply spruce up the existing place," Mr. Levy said.
Mr. Crawford has assembled working committees for each aspect of the project, with members from the center's 13 various constituent groups, including the Metropolitan Opera, the Juilliard School and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, represented on each one. Several smaller infrastructure projects are already under way, like the upgrading of the Met's stage wagons, which move scenery. 
In February Lincoln Center created the post of executive director of the Campaign for Lincoln Center and gave it to Rosemarie Garipoli, who led similar drives for the New York Botanical Garden and the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Once design plans are established, Mr. Crawford said, he planned to look for donations of $5 million or more to kick off the fund-raising.
By all accounts the atmosphere at Lincoln Center is considerably less contentious since Mr. Crawford and Mr. Levy came on board, replacing Beverly Sills and Gordon Davis. Almost to a person executives of the constituent groups described the new management team as effective, with Mr. Levy as the upbeat optimist and Mr. Crawford as the levelheaded realist. 
That is not to say that Lincoln Center is free of internal politics. When a recent benefit was being planned to honor Beverly Sills's service as chairwoman of Lincoln Center, Ms. Sills insisted that $1 million of the money raised go toward the Metropolitan Opera, where she is now chairwoman. The move ruffled some feathers, given that the proceeds -- an impressive $4.5 million -- were originally intended for Lincoln Center Inc., the center's landlord, with some of the money earmarked for the redevelopment. 
Because of the city's budget cutbacks, Mr. Giuliani's pledge of $240 million no longer seems realistic. Lincoln Center received an initial payment from the city of $24 million in December 2001. About $14 million of that money remained, Mr. Crawford said. The city has asked that Lincoln Center spend the money on actual building rather than planning. "This is tax-levy money," said Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner. "Some portion needs to be spent on tangible assets."
Lincoln Center has agreed to assume all planning costs as well as staffing the redevelopment and fund-raising. Lincoln Center will match the fund-raising of each constituent group, Mr. Levy said: 20 percent of the first $25 million raised and 15 percent of anything above $25 million.
Mr. Crawford said the city had promised $5 million a year over the next three years, with the contribution jumping to a projected $96 million in 2006, an unlikely number in the present economy. 
Last summer Ms. Levin convened a Lincoln Center task force of the eight city agencies involved in the redevelopment, from the Department of City Planning to the Department of Transportation. The group meets regularly. "The city is enormously committed to it," Ms. Levin said. 
While Lincoln Center still wants to improve the acoustics at Avery Fisher Hall (home to the New York Philharmonic), the hall is likely to be refurbished rather than torn down and rebuilt, as initially planned. "That is the road we really favor here," Mr. Crawford said.
Originally Lincoln Center executives said it would cost the same to renovate as to rebuild. Now executives say that that is not the case, that leaving the shell intact will cost half as much ($200 million) and take half as long (two years). 
Keeping the hall's exterior will also avoid a showdown with the Fisher family, which has threatened legal action if the name of the hall is changed to accommodate a new donor.
Some Philharmonic executives may be skeptical of this approach, given that the hall's acoustics have been tinkered with in the past, without success. Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the Philharmonic, did not sound convinced that simply renovating would be sufficient. "If it costs too much, maybe we need to say, 'Listen, it's not just good enough doing the hall,' " Mr. Mehta said. "Maybe we have to wait for the economy to get a little better."
Mr. Mehta said the board had no choice but to question whether to move ahead with construction plans in the current economy. "Of course it was discussed," he said. "Can we raise this money at the same time as trying to exist and raising an endowment for ourselves?"
Lincoln Center has asked the design firm of Norman Foster -- who remodeled the Reichstag in Berlin and the Great Court at the British Museum -- to come up with initial designs for renovating Avery Fisher Hall. Mr. Crawford said he expected to see Lord Foster's recommendations in about 10 days and to bring them to the executive committee of the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center in mid-June. 
Across the plaza Lincoln Center has resigned itself to the idea of losing City Opera, which shares the New York State Theater with the New York City Ballet and considers it inadequate for singers. If the opera company moves -- most likely to the former World Trade Center site -- it is unclear whether it would remain connected to Lincoln Center.
For now Lincoln Center is staying out of City Opera's business. "They don't want to be in the New York State Theater for reasons they have clearly stated," Mr. Crawford said. "It's not up to me to quarrel with that. They make a very good case for that." 
City Opera will not be going anywhere anytime soon. With the Lower Manhattan redevelopment plans in the nascent stages, a move by City Opera there is considered at least five years off. And questions about how the opera company could afford to build and sustain a new $300 million theater remain unresolved.
As for Lincoln Center's internal politics, many of those involved say they have markedly improved. One remaining sticking point is Mr. Lehrer, the builder, who is said to be unhappy overseeing the redevelopment. He was out of the country this week and unavailable for comment. "I can't deny there have been frictions in the working relationships," Mr. Crawford said.
Despite the uncertainties about the future, Mr. Levy and Mr. Crawford say they are pleased with what they are seeing today. Programming has been strong, they say, mentioning the Berlioz and John Adams festivals; applications are up at the Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet; and the budget is balanced. "The campus is thriving," Mr. Levy said.

HEADLINE: A Shuffle in the British Water Industry 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 7 

 BODY:
Once again, Britain's 10 big water utilities are figuring in a flurry of deals and deal talk. Two of them have changed hands in the last year or so and three more are in play.
 But this time around, the speculators and the global conglomerates want out of the industry, and a new group of buyers -- banks and private equity firms -- want in. 
 The buyers are attracted by the same feature of the industry that has disappointed the sellers: modest but dependable profits. 
Before, companies like Suez of France or Enron of the United States drove the deal making for water assets in Britain because they thought they saw opportunities to reap scale economies and expand their geographic reach. 
But the heavy regulation of the industry -- rates are set by the government and mergers among the 10 big water companies are prohibited -- limited the payoff for such buyers. Now, it is the traditional strength of a utility, the steady streams of small cash payments from a large number of individual customers, come boom or recession, that attracts attention.
The companies now in play include Northumbrian, the third largest of the 10, which is now owned by Suez, and Anglian Water, the largest, which is public. 
Bidders for Northumbrian include at least two private investment groups with bank backing, as well as a consortium set up by Deutsche Bank that wants to resell 20 percent of the company to public investors in a stock offering.
WestLB has been doggedly pursuing AWG, the holding company that owns Anglian, for months, and in April offered to pay $:5.20 to $:5.45 ($8.40 to $8.80) a share for it. AWG's management rejected the offer as too low on April 17, and WestLB is now in talks with some major shareholders to find an acceptable price.
Complicating WestLB's bid for Anglian is its ownership of Mid Kent Holdings, another of the 10 major water utilities. AWG management cited the antitrust problems posed by the stake when it rejected WestLB's overture, and analysts believe that WestLB would sell Mid Kent to clear the way to acquire AWG.
Neither WestLB nor the banks involved in bids for Northumbrian would comment.
Other banks have already jumped in to the industry. The Royal Bank of Scotland has been involved in Southern Water since 1996 through its participation in an investment group called First Aqua Holdings; in February the bank agreed to become the utility's largest single shareholder in a complex transaction with Vivendi Environnement, the French water conglomerate. Vivendi Environnement was rebuffed by regulators last year in a plan to acquire all of Southern Water; it would get a 20 percent stake in the company in the new deal, with the Royal Bank controlling 49 percent.
Last year, Abbey National bought a one-third stake in Portsmouth Water. 
The other big recent buyer was YTL, a Malaysian conglomerate whose main businesses are building and operating power plants and transmission lines. YTL acquired Wessex Water, formerly owned by Enron, in March 2002, outbidding the Royal Bank of Scotland and others. 
YTL paid $777 million in cash for Wessex, but had to assume $991 million in debt, highlighting a common feature of the water companies -- heavy borrowing. British water companies have more than $4 billion in bonds outstanding. Banks and private equity firms are now working with several of the companies, notably Anglian, Sutton and East Surrey and Glas Cymru Cyfyngedig, to restructure their debts and increase leverage even more, to increase the companies' returns for equity investors. 
Credit analysts and regulators are wary of the trend. "There is no way that water would ever stop flowing" to customers in the event of a debt default, Daniela Katsiamakis of Standard & Poor's said. "But these structures expose the companies to the possibility of financial failure, because of their level of debt." 
The water industry in England and Wales is quite different from those on the Continent or in North America. The United States industry is fragmented, with thousands of local water suppliers, most of them public agencies or departments of municipal governments. There has been some consolidation among the minority of water systems run by for-profit companies, and foreign investors have begun to try to buy in. But foreign ownership has not always been welcomed: the purchase of American Water Works in February by RWE of Germany ignited protest rallies. 
Britons, in contrast, shrug off foreign ownership of water utilities, and RWE bought Thames Water in 2000 without incident. But the prospects for profits in Britain are narrower. "Returns are de minimus by U.S. standards," said Timothy Winter, a vice president at A. G. Edwards who follows the industry.
Analysts and bankers say the Office of Water Services, the main regulator of British water, has scared off some would-be buyers by taking too strict a line with the industry. The office reviews water prices every five years; in 2000 it forced the water companies to cut rates by 12 percent. The regulators "set challenging operating and financial standards for the 2000-2005 period, making it more difficult for water utilities to generate strong returns," a recent Standard & Poor's report said. 
Regulators say they are just doing their job. "These are monopoly companies, and the normal forces of competition aren't at work here," said Philip Fletcher, director of the water office. "There should be a regulator to ensure that customers that don't have a choice have price protection." 
Bankers say that the organizers of the Deutsche Bank consortium bidding for Northumbrian believe that their offer will appeal to regulators because it would leave the company with less debt than proposals from rival bidders would. "The central plank of this proposition is regulators' concern about utilities being delisted and highly geared," an executive close to the deal said.
Mr. Fletcher has not taken a side in the discussion. "It's not my job to tell the industry how it should be structured," he said. "But I have said that if leverage gets very high, I am concerned about risks associated with that."

HEADLINE: Sales Increase At Faster Rate Than Inventory 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
Sales at wholesalers increased twice as much as inventories in March, led by a rebound in imported automobiles, a government report showed today.
 Wholesale sales rose 1 percent, compared with the 0.5 percent increase in February, the Commerce Department said. Stocks of goods at distributors increased 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percent rise. Wholesalers have a record-low supply of goods in stock of 1.21 months at the current sales pace. 
 Any increase in consumer and corporate demand may prompt companies to place more orders with factories, increasing production and helping lift the economy. So far this year, companies are reluctant to stockpile more goods in case the rise in demand is not sustained.
"They're keeping their inventories lean because they are concerned about the demand outlook," said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that consumer borrowing slowed in March to $931 million from $1.3 billion in February. The increase, caused by an increase in credit card borrowing, was the smallest since a decrease last November. People worried about their jobs are less inclined to borrow for their purchases, economists said.
"Nobody spends without a job," said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York. The economy has lost 525,000 jobs in the last three months and the unemployment rate, at 6 percent, matches an eight-year high.
Analysts had expected that Americans took out $3.3 billion more in loans during March, after an originally reported increase of $1.5 billion during February. The central bank's credit statistics are often volatile and subject to revision.
Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain in March wholesale inventories. Wholesale inventories account for one-fourth of all business inventories. Stocks held by retailers and factories make up the rest.
Sales of durable goods, which include automobiles and metals, rose 2.1 percent, the most since February 1999, after declining 1.4 percent in January. Imported auto sales increased 6.3 percent, also the most in four years. They declined 5.2 percent in February. Sales of lumber, metals and machinery also increased in March.

PERSON: William J. Goode 

HEADLINE: William Goode, Scholar of Family Life and Divorce, Dies at 85 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
William J. Goode, a sociologist who did research on family life, marriage and divorce, died on Sunday in Washington. He was 85 and had homes in East Hampton, N.Y.; Cambridge, Mass.; and Fairfax, Va. 
 The cause was a blood clot, said his wife, Lenore J. Weitzman, a Clarence J. Robinson professor of sociology and law at George Mason University in Fairfax. 
 At his death, Dr. Goode -- who was known as Si and whose last name rhymes with food -- was a professor emeritus of sociology at Stanford and associated with George Mason University. 
Dr. Goode's books included comparative and cross-cultural studies of divorce patterns. One of his early works, "After Divorce" (Free Press, 1956), was a systematic investigation of the social and economic consequences of divorce for women. 
His early findings related especially to American conditions, but he did more universal studies like "World Changes in Divorce Patterns" (Yale University Press, 1993). It remains in print, as do several of his other works, including "Family" (Prentice Hall, 1982), and two articles in the American Sociological Review: "The Theoretical Importance of Love" (1959) and "The Protection of the Inept" (1967). 
He was a former president of the American Sociological Association, which in 1982 named its annual award for the best book in family sociology in his honor.
William Josiah Goode, who was born on Aug. 30, 1917, in Houston, received his bachelor's and master's degrees in sociology from the University of Texas at Austin. He received a Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University in 1946 after serving in the Navy as a radar operator on a transport vessel in the Pacific. 
His first academic appointment was as an assistant professor at Wayne State University. In 1950 he moved to Columbia University, taking part in sociological analyses of the professions in the United States, and in 1954 taught for a semester at the newly created Free University in Berlin. He was promoted to full professor in 1965, was chairman of sociology for several terms and became Giddings professor in 1975. 
Dr. Goode was a professor of sociology at Stanford from 1977 to 1986, and taught at Harvard from 1986 to 1992. He was also a visiting professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1991 and 1992. 
Marriages to Josephine Cannizzo of Silver Spring, Md., and Ruth Rosenbaum of Chapel Hill, N.C., ended in divorce. 
In addition to Dr. Weitzman, Dr. Goode is survived by two sons, Erich Goode of Silver Spring, and Andrew Josiah Goode of Shingle Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Barbara Goode Baldwin of Washington; a sister, Rosalie Grizzle of Magnolia, Tex.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Suit Says ChevronTexaco Dumped Poisons in Ecuador 

BYLINE:  BY ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
A group of American lawyers representing more than 30,000 indigenous people in Ecuador filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the ChevronTexaco Corporation yesterday. 
 The suit was filed in Ecuador on behalf of 88 plaintiffs in Lago Agrio, a small oil town in northern Ecuador, and asserts that during two decades of operation, from 1971 to 1992, ChevronTexaco dumped over four million gallons a day of toxic wastewater, contaminated with oil, heavy metals and carcinogens into open pits, estuaries and rivers. 
It also says the company left behind nearly 350 open waste pits that killed people and animals. 
"We believe that what ChevronTexaco did in the Ecuador rain forest was not only negligent but might rise to the level of reckless behavior," said Joseph Kohn, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs and a partner in Kohn, Swift & Graf in Philadelphia. 
ChevronTexaco denies any wrongdoing and maintains that its practice was consistent with the practices of Ecuador's national oil company, Petro Ecuador, as well as internationally recognized standards.
The case, in litigation for almost a decade, has been dismissed four times. In August 2002, the United States Court of Appeals in New York ruled that the case should be sent to Ecuador, as ChevronTexaco originally wanted. It also ruled that American courts could step back in if the plaintiffs were unable to bring their case or if ChevronTexaco did not adhere to the Ecuadorean court's final decision.
The suit filed in Ecuador yesterday is the first step in adhering to the appellate court's direction.
Typically, cases against multinational corporations tried in developing countries languish there, as most plaintiffs cannot afford to sue in third world countries or do not have proper legal representation. If a corporation does lose, it often contends that the case was unfair or that "the proceedings in the foreign county did not adhere to our notions of due process," said Michael P. Van Alstine, a professor of international commercial law at the University of Maryland.
This case is significant, legal experts say, because it could create a new way for multinational corporations to be held financially accountable for environmental abuses in foreign countries. 
Chris Jochnick, a lawyer and founder of the Center for Economic and Social Rights, a human rights organization with offices in New York and Ecuador, said: "The case has become something of a symbol for the abuses and lack of accountability of U.S. multinationals abroad, and of the efforts of local communities to organize and try to bring pressure to bear on those companies. You have both sides represented." 
Any financial penalty imposed on ChevronTexaco is enforceable in the United States, which "adds an additional layer of security for the plaintiffs," Mr. Jochnick added.
In 1993, ChevronTexaco hired environmental consulting firms to conduct audits and identify the need for any remediation, said Chris Gidez, a spokesman for ChevronTexaco in Fairfield, Conn. In 1995, ChevronTexaco began a $40 million cleanup of about 250 drilling sites, which the Ecuadorean government deemed complete in 1998, Mr. Gidez said.
Mr. Gidez added that the oil operations took place over about 6,400 acres, or less than 1 percent, of the Ecuadorean rain forest. "The Ecuadorean government," he said, "encouraged growth -- colonization, building of roads -- in that area. To ignore all that activity as having a contributing impact on the environment is like walking around with blinders on."
This weekend, Amazon Watch, a nonprofit environmental group in San Francisco, plans to bring a group of 13 indigenous leaders from Ecuador to San Ramon, Calif., the world headquarters of ChevronTexaco. The organization plans to stage protests and hold educational forums to "raise awareness with community members of what their neighbors are doing in the rain forest," said Leila Salazar, an organizer with Amazon Watch's ChevronTexaco campaign.
With 2.1 billion barrels of proven reserves, Ecuador is an important player in the Latin American oil business. "It's going to be interesting to see how a country that's so dependent on oil development is going to hold this corporation accountable," Ms. Salazar said.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Drops Age-Based Cost Studies 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, May 7 

 BODY:
A Bush administration policy to base some regulations on a calculation that the life of each person older than 70 should be valued less than the life of a younger person has antagonized older Americans and environmental groups, and it has stirred tensions among federal agencies.
 Instead of the traditional assumption that all lives saved from cleaner air are worth the same, administration officials in two environmental studies included an alternative method that used two values, $3.7 million for the life a person younger than 70 and $2.3 million for an older person, a 37 percent difference. 
 Critics call the policy the "senior death discount" and say the administration is turning on older Americans as a rationale to weaken environmental regulations.
Today, Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said her agency had never applied the policy in its decision making and never would.
"The senior discount factor has been stopped," Mrs. Whitman told reporters at a meeting here. "It has been discontinued. E.P.A. will not, I repeat, not, use an age-adjusted analysis in decision making." 
John D. Graham, the regulations administrator at the Office of Management and Budget who has been the champion of the policy, said the calculation would not be used because it was based on an old study. Dr. Graham insisted he was committed to the principle of analyzing how many years of life would be added by a particular measure, not simply the number of lives. 
He has proposed that all agencies' cost-benefit calculations include the "life expectancy" method and the simpler "statistical lives" approach.
"My instinct has always been to present policy makers and the public with both perspectives, so you can get a sense of the difference," he said. 
The life-expectancy approach could bolster the case for health measures that benefit children, Dr. Graham said, and in some cases it could help the elderly.
"It can distinguish a regulation that may extend senior citizens' life by 5 or 10 years, compared to a regulation that will extend their life by only one year," he said. 
A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, Trent Duffy, made clear that in considering the cost-benefit calculations the administration should not be seen as insensitive.
"The Bush administration's commitment to human life should not be questioned," Mr. Duffy said. "The Bush administration has been aggressive in protecting human life of all ages, from extending prenatal care benefits for pregnant women to filing a friend of the court brief against euthanasia in Oregon."
The life-expectancy analysis, intended to identify policies that would add the most years to people's lives, also accompanied two cost-benefit analyses at the E.P.A., as well as at other agencies in the Clinton administration. Critics say it has been used more aggressively under the leadership of Dr. Graham, a bete noire of environmentalists who has been urging rigorous cost-benefit analyses for all federal agencies.
For more than a month, the elderly and environmental groups have protested at hearings on the relatively arcane cost-benefit methodology. The "death discount" debate offers a window on tensions between Ms. Whitman's agency and Dr. Graham's, tensions worsened by Dr. Graham's broad power and authority. At stake are billions of dollars -- and thousands of lives -- as the government weighs the costs of regulating pollution against the benefits to health and the environment. 
Environmentalists say the problem with Dr. Graham's approach is that it inflates the costs of regulations and diminishes the perceived benefits, making it easier for the administration to propose a relaxation of rules.
Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator in the Clinton administration, said that under the traditional method a particular air pollution regulation was shown to have benefits of $77 billion but that the life-expectancy method, along with other more conservative assumptions, would lower the benefits, to $8 billion. 
"They are adjusting the calculations to say that the benefits of less pollution are much lower," Ms. Browner said.
Although similar analyses were conducted when she was administrator, she said, no decisions were based on them.
Dr. Graham, founder of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, said the life-expectancy analysis was being used merely to provide extra guidance, not set policy. He noted that the Food and Drug Administration had used it for nearly a decade. 
Other experts said that moral and practical reasons gave priority to policies to protect younger people because those policies add the most years of life, but that those arguments were not easy for politicians to make when confronting elderly voters.
In an interview, Dr. Graham said the $1.4 million difference was not longer considered valid because it was based on outdated studies in England and Canada that were not relevant here. He insisted that the overall approach was valid and would be a factor in decision making at the E.P.A. and elsewhere.
Asked outside the meeting whether it was the elderly and environmentalists' protests that had prompted her to change her mind about the policy, Mrs. Whitman said: "It was never a question of changing our minds. We weren't the ones who . . . " 
Mrs. Whitman said her agency's officials did not want to base any of their decisions on life-expectancy analysis.
"We are more comfortable with the traditional methodology we've been using because it has been peer reviewed, it's what we've been using right along, and a lot of environmental economists would say that is the more appropriate methodology to use," she said. "This life-span one is fine if you're talking about medical determinations. Does it make more sense to give scarce lung transplants to someone 75 or someone 17? That's when they use the life expectancy. But we don't think that that's as appropriate for the work that we do."
Representatives of environmental groups at the meeting today said Mrs. Whitman's announcement quelled critics who were going to speak against it. They were not impressed with her announcement, saying, as John Stanton, an air expert with the National Environmental Trust, put it, "She was as clear as mud."
Mrs. Whitman, however, acknowledged that Dr. Graham's method would still accompany her agency's studies, including those on President Bush's "Clear Skies" proposal. 
Those methods, with higher costs and lower benefits, would be available to members of Congress. 
Environmentalists said if the agency was not using the life-expectancy method, it should expunge it. Milton C. Weinstein, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and a pioneer of life-expectancy analysis, said it had become routine among medical researchers but still aroused controversy. 
"There's an equity argument that every citizen should be entitled to an equal claim on resources and shouldn't be penalized for the fact that they've lived a larger portion of their life span," Professor Weinstein said. "But you can never save a life. You can only prolong it. When you give medical treatment or make the environment safer, the relevant question is how much of a life you can save. Most people, if given the choice between applying resources to save a 10-year-old or a 70-year-old, would choose the 10-year-old." 
Many environmentalists have been skeptical of cost-benefit analyses and have accused Republicans of using them as an excuse not to regulate polluting industries and other environmental hazards. They spoke out against the appointment of Dr. Graham, one of the most prominent experts in regulatory cost-benefit analysis.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: POSTWAR AID; 
U.S. Drafts a Resolution On the Lifting of Sanctions

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER with DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 7 

 BODY:
The United States has begun circulating a draft resolution to lift sanctions in Iraq.
 The measure, which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he "expected" to be introduced this week, would make a few concessions to Russian and French interests but leave the major political and financial levers of the future Iraqi government in the hands of coalition forces and the interim authority being formed with their approval. 
 The resolution would allow for a partial payout of the existing $10 billion in approved contracts for food, medicine and industrial goods authorized by the United Nations before the war. It also would allow for a United Nations special representative who would act as a nominal partner in the political reconstruction of Iraq, Security Council diplomats said today. 
The two movesseem designed to solicit Russian and French support -- Russia's because of the roughly $1.5 billion in outstanding approved contracts Russian companies held with the Iraqi regime, and France's with the offer of a United Nations role that the Secretary of State Colin L. Powell continued to call "vital" today.
The resolution's language, which talks of a United Nations special coordinator working with coalition forces, gives this person some latitude to advise the parties and coordinate humanitarian activities. But it provides little or no explicit authority to control the formation of Iraqi political and civil institutions, the diplomats said. American officials suggested today that the coordinator would have some latitude to define his own role, based on his ability to work with the various parties. 
The draft resolution also envisions a role for multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on an international advisory board monitoring the use of Iraqi oil revenues. But, as in the political arena, the resolution cedes little if any explicit control to the multilateral institutions, whose membership includes countries that had bitterly opposed the U.S.-led war. 
As Mr. Powell was flying to New York to meet with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, the treasury secretary, Jack Snow, announced in Washington that the Bush administration was suspending many of the sanctions the United States had placed on Iraq in 1991, in the aftermath of the first Persian Gulf war. The move allows American companies to begin exporting many goods to Iraq, and it allows people who live in the United States to send up to $500 a month to each Iraqi household, Mr. Snow said.
The timing of Mr. Powell's trip and Mr. Snow's announcement suggested that the administration was sending a two-pronged message to its Security Council colleagues, showing it was willing to work with them but just as willing to act on its own. 
Security Council diplomats predicted that the unveiling of the draft resolution would begin a new round of tough negotiations. France and Russia will square off against the United States and Britain, they said, with the former seeking to use whatever leverage it has in existing Security Council resolutions to avoid being shut out of the politics and profits of the new Iraq. 
The most contentious issue in the upcoming negotiations, one diplomat predicted, would be control of future Iraqi oil revenues. "I think it will be long and hard," one Security Council diplomat said. "I think people will try and be a bit careful with the vitriol this time and try and make it constructive." 
For all the politics involved, part of the upcoming negotiations will be purely financial. Russian companies had approved contracts to supply as much as $1.5 billion worth of bulldozers, trucks, pipeline construction materials and other goods to Saddam Hussein's government before the war began. Currently authorized French contracts amount to about $300 million, according to United Nations documents.
On Monday, a senior state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that "there's no principle here that with the change of regime that valid contracts are suddenly invalid."
The financial implications of unraveling the seven-year-old oil-for-food program -- which had put much of Iraq's economic activity under United Nations oversight -- have helped make Russia the leading obstacle to the United States push for a quick decision to lift sanctions by June 3, when the current phase of the oil-for-food program runs out.
Russian diplomats have been insisting that the Council adhere to the letter of the existing resolutions that placed sanctions on the government of Iraq during the rule of Mr. Hussein. This would make international weapons inspections certifying Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction a prerequisite for any Council decision to lift sanctions.
British and American diplomats argue that it was just Mr. Hussein's regime that needed to be contained. When it fell, the need for the sanctions evaporated.
In the past month, the question of appointing a special United Nations representative became another source of friction. Mr. Powell, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, and others urged Mr. Annan to put a representative into the mix, but he resisted, saying that recruiting a top-flight person would be difficult without a precise job description.

HEADLINE: Schools Try Integration by Income, Not Race 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
This city has joined a small but growing movement to use income, not race, as a primary factor in assigning students to schools.
 For 4-year-old Noah Chisholm, that has meant attending kindergarten at the Fletcher-Maynard Academy this year, a school where most children are poor enough to receive free or discounted lunches. Noah, whose parents are both architects, is among a small group of middle-class children who school officials hope will have a powerful impact on improving achievement for all the school's children. 
Noah's assignment to Fletcher-Maynard was primarily driven by his family's income, but it also helped the district meet another goal for the school: greater racial balance. Noah is white. Fletcher-Maynard's 264 students are predominantly black or Hispanic. 
Cambridge's goal in turning to economic integration is twofold: raising the academic performance of students and achieving racial balance, without resorting to race-based formulas that are increasingly being rejected by federal courts. 
In addition to Cambridge, school districts in Wake County and Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C.; South Orange-Maplewood, N.J.; Manchester, Conn.; St. Lucie County, Fla.; and San Francisco have adopted economic integration plans in recent years.
In LaCrosse, Wis., the first district to endorse economic integration when it did so in the early 1990's, scores have risen, and the district has a very low dropout rate, despite a relatively high poverty rate.
Proponents of economic integration say there is ample evidence that all children learn better at schools where middle-class students are in the majority.
"While there are a handful of exceptions, in general high-poverty schools don't work," said Richard D. Kahlenberg, an educational researcher at the Century Foundation who is a leading advocate for economic integration as the way to raise achievement among poor children.
But critics say that the way to help low-income students make educational gains has to be more effective teaching -- not moving children around. "There's something wrong with the assumption that if you've got too many low-income kids in a classroom, you can't teach them," said Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has extensively researched race and education. "My response to that is: No excuses. Start to educate the kids."
Dr. Thernstrom and others also say that economic integration has no relevance for large, predominantly poor urban school districts like Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington. "What are you going to do -- helicopter the kids in?" Dr. Thernstrom said. Supporters of economic integration counter that children in poor urban areas should have the opportunity to cross district lines and attend middle-class schools.
Just as racial integration of schools was resisted by many whites, middle- and upper-income families may object to economic integration. Moreover, some civil rights advocates say that economic integration does not go far enough in achieving racial integration. 
In Cambridge, however, the idea gained momentum a few years ago. The belief here is that if any place can make economic integration work, it is this mixed city, with its ultraliberal reputation and its 7,000 public school students -- some the children of professors at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others born to single mothers receiving public assistance. 
Educators here point to the Morse School, where they said an influx of middle-income students in the mid-1990's helped turn around what had been a low-performing, unpopular school.
Cambridge has 15 elementary and middle schools and one high school. While the city spends $17,000 a year on each public-school student, the schools' quality is considered uneven. The student population, about 40 percent of whom qualify for a free or reduced-rate lunch, is 40 percent white, 23 percent African-American and 11 percent other black, 14 percent Hispanic, 11 percent Asian, and 1 percent American Indian.
For 20 years, Cambridge's voluntary approach to racial integration -- which relied not on forced busing but on giving parents considerable choice in schools -- was considered a model by educators. Many children did end up riding buses to schools, but with Cambridge only 6.2 square miles, no one had to travel very far.
Across the river in Boston and in Lynn, though, where parents were contesting race-based integration plans, Cambridge school officials became concerned that their own plan was vulnerable to legal challenges.
Officials were also worried about a handful of schools -- including the two that became Fletcher-Maynard -- that had high concentrations of impoverished students and low state achievement test scores. Schools in Cambridge were fairly racially diverse and, in theory, open to everyone, but middle- and upper-middle-income parents tended to choose certain schools, and poor parents others.
Two years ago, persuaded by the work of Mr. Kahlenberg and others that one way to help the low-performing, high-poverty schools was to raise the number of middle-class students attending them, the Cambridge school committee adopted a plan that emphasized socioeconomic integration in student assignments.
At the same time, it allocated extra resources to low-performing schools like Fletcher-Maynard; officials hoped not only to improve achievement, but also to attract more middle-class parents to those schools. The plan, which will be phased in over three years, began with this year's kindergarten class.
Economic integration is turning out to be controversial in a city where low-income and middle- and upper-income parents -- and white and minority parents -- often have very different ideas about what makes a good school. 
Noah Chisholm's parents, Scott Chisholm and Afshan Bokhari, were not happy when they learned that he had been assigned to Fletcher-Maynard. It was not one of the three schools they had listed as preferences. Only about 10 percent of parents in Cambridge do not get one of their three choices.
In assigning students, the district uses a complicated lottery that takes into account family income, siblings, proximity, and -- as a last resort if a school falls out of racial balance -- race. Under the new socioeconomic diversity, the district classifies low-income students as those who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch, while those who pay are considered middle-income.
Alex Ivan, whose father is a biotechnology scientist and whose mother is a neurologist, was also assigned to Fletcher-Maynard. Noah and Alex are among the 4 children of the class of 13 who do not qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. They are also the class's only two white children.
"First we were, sort of, 'Hey, how do we get out of here?' " Ms. Bokhari recalled. She added that the school's racial or economic makeup did not concern her but that she had known nothing about the school when Noah was assigned there. 
Still, Noah and Alex's parents were won over by their sons' teacher, Ali Barr, and her assistant, Betty Snell. They were also impressed by the other kindergartners, and by the principal, Robin Harris.
Ms. Bokhari said she had tried to convince a friend to send her two children to the school. But she said the friend, a computer programmer, preferred a school with a lot of demanding upper-income parents. "She says, 'I want the rich moms to help me bring up my children,' " Ms. Bokhari said.
Her friend has a point. Middle- and upper-middle-income parents tend to be more aggressive about making sure their schools have everything, from top teachers to special arts programs, experts said. "Middle-class parents provide quality control," said Nancy Walser, a member of the Cambridge school committee and the author of a guide to the Cambridge public schools. "They're like canaries in a mine."
Some people fear that under the plan middle- and upper-income parents will flee the Cambridge system if they must contend with unqualified teachers and inadequate resources.
Ms. Bokhari, who has degrees from Wellesley and Harvard and is pursuing a Ph.D. in art history at Boston University, said that when it came to her three children's education, what mattered most was achievement. She said Noah would probably return to Fletcher-Maynard next year. After that, she is not sure. Her oldest son, Essah, a second grader at another public school where, Ms. Bokhari said, he was not sufficiently challenged, would be attending Shady Hill, a high-achieving, $14,000-a-year priate school. Noah may eventually follow, she said. Her third child, who is 2, is not yet in the school system.
One of Noah's best friends is his polite, serious classmate, 6-year-old Omar Maxwell. Omar's family lives in public housing two blocks from Fletcher-Maynard. In contrast to Noah's parents, Omar's mother, Keyonna Maxwell, said that the school's proximity to her home was one of its most important attributes. She is attending nursing school, and likes the convenience -- and safety -- of having Omar close by.
Ms. Maxwell said she did not believe her son needed middle-income classmates to succeed. "It all depends on the teachers," she said.
With all its benefits -- classes capped at 17 students, experienced teachers, the district's only full-time art teacher for kindergarten through eighth grade, computers for all fifth graders and above -- Fletcher-Maynard still has 47 vacancies. There is a waiting list of low-income children from the neighborhood. But under the plan the available slots must be held for middle-class families.
"The only way they're going to come is if we increase the test scores," Ms. Harris said, adding that she was not waiting for middle-class students.
"If we had 100 percent children of color and poor, we'd still get the job done," she said. "You set the bar high, and they excel."

HEADLINE: Asbestos Verdict In California Case Worries Insurers In Other Lawsuits 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
A jury verdict in California may lead to a wave of new asbestos litigation that would greatly increase costs for insurance companies, industry experts and plaintiffs' lawyers said yesterday. 
 On Monday, a jury in a civil trial in Los Angeles concluded that a group of London insurance companies and two American insurers must immediately pay nearly $200 million for claims already filed against the bankrupt Fuller-Austin Insulation Company, as well as those expected to be filed against a trust created by the company. 
 Typically, insurers pay claims only after they are filed -- a process that can stretch over decades, particularly when dealing with health damage caused by asbestos. In the meantime, the insurance companies have the use of the money they were paid for the coverage for investment and other business purposes. 
If the decision in the California Superior Court were widely adopted, insurance companies would have to suddenly pay tens of millions of dollars that they had expected to pay over decades. 
Small insurers could be driven out of business, experts said, and others might be forced to limit their coverage in other areas.
"This is very significant," said Philip C. Stahl, a specialist in defending insurance companies at Grippo & Elden, a law firm in Chicago.
Several insurance experts said the California verdict underscored the need for a broad solution that is now being negotiated by Congress, the Bush administration, insurers, lawyers and corporations that would create a national trust to deal with asbestos claims and remove the issue from the courts. People close to the talks say the trust would provide for payment of more than $100 billion to hundreds of thousands of asbestos victims.
"Congress is moving toward some sort of global solution, something rational," said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, "yet you have the courts continuing to move in a direction that is increasingly irrational." 
In the California case, Fuller-Austin, a company in Houston that installed asbestos products in gas and oil refineries and had been a subsidiary of a Virginia defense contractor, sued its insurers. 
Facing more than 11,000 claims from refinery workers and their families for illnesses attributed to asbestos, the company filed for bankruptcy in September 1998. 
In doing so, it became the first company to use the new provision in the federal bankruptcy code designed by Congress in 1994 to help industrial companies cope with large asbestos claims without being driven out of business. Companies that agreed to place a substantial amount of their assets in a trust to pay asbestos claims could then start anew, free of further asbestos liability worries. Fuller-Austin, however, had stopped doing business in the mid-80's. 
On the basis of those provisions and a 1991 federal appeals court decision, Judge Judith C. Chirlin of the California Superior Court in Los Angles ruled in August 2002 that Fuller-Austin's insurers were required to pay the trust for present and future claims, provided a jury could determine the total cost. The insurers refused to pay and the original suit was expanded. 
After a nine-week trial, the jury upheld the original decision. Robert M. Horkovich of the New York firm of Anderson Kill & Olick, argued successfully that the insurers were required to pay. Using insurance company methods for calculating future claims costs, he persuaded the 12-member jury to conclude Monday that the trust faced a total of more than $966 million in claims.
Altogether, the insurers, about 40 British companies, including units of Lloyd's of London and the two American companies, the Stonewall Insurance Company in Cincinnati and the Highlands Insurance Group in Lawrenceville, N.J., had provided $190 million in coverage. The jury directed that they pay the trust all but $5 million of that. About a dozen other insurers had settled earlier with the trust for $190 million.
Patrick Cathcart, a California lawyer defending the British insurers, said the verdict would be appealed. Other lawyers said that, in any event, it would not be binding outside the state. Still, the legal strategy in the case is expected to be employed in new cases across the country. Scott Gilbert, a Washington lawyer who specializes in suing insurance companies, said that his firm, Gilbert, Heintz & Randolph, planned to use it in at least half a dozen cases in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and other states.
Huge amounts of money are at issue. The Rand Institute for Civil Justice, a California research organization, estimates that total claims for asbestos damages could rise to as much as $250 billion. And Matthew Carletti, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, a brokerage firm and investment bank in Hartford, estimates that about half of those claims would be covered by insurance. Several large insurers have sharply increased their reserves to pay claims over the last year or so, creating a direct charge against earnings.
Some lawyers argue that the 1994 provision has been leading companies to file for bankruptcy sooner than in the past.
"Under this provision, the earlier a company goes in and the more assets it goes with the more impact it can have on the shape of its bankruptcy and the speed with which it emerges from bankruptcy," said Mr. Gilbert, the Washington lawyer.
Insurance industry experts say that, while other courts may not adopt the approach of the California court, it is still a cause of major concern. The prospect of these kinds of cases becoming a trend is causing insurers "to get sick to their stomach," said Mr. Carletti, the analyst, who specializes in asbestos and other environmental issues.
Mr. Stahl, the insurance company defense lawyer in Chicago, said that while he was skeptical that the strategy would be widely adopted, doing so "could drive insurance companies out of business or at least limit their ability to provide coverage."
Mr. Hartwig, the Insurance Information Institute economist, said the California verdict "was certainly a negative from the insurance industry's perspective."
Mr. Cathcart, in the Los Angeles office of Hancock, Rothert & Bunshoft, said Judge Chirlin misinterpreted and misapplied California law and "did not correctly interpret what happened in the bankruptcy court."

HEADLINE: Europe Plan on Chemicals Seen as Threatto U.S. Exports 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
The European Union announced a proposal today that would require manufacturers of industrial chemicals to test their products before they can be used, a change that the Bush administration said could threaten the $20 billion in chemicals that the United States exports to Europe each year.
 Five years in the making, the proposal, which requires the approval of European governments and the European Parliament, would shift the burden to prove the safety of chemicals onto manufacturers instead of governments. The tests would be registered with a new agency. Under current rules, about 99 percent of the total volume of chemicals sold on the markets have not been subjected to testing requirements. 
 "There is no control whatsoever of the 400 million tons of chemicals sold in the European Union each year," said Margot Wallstrom, Europe's environment commissioner, at a news conference. "Our reform proposal therefore requires industry to provide public information on the chemicals they produce or import and the risks associated with their use."
The American chemical industry has lobbied hard against the proposal, criticizing it as excessive, bureaucratic and unnecessary.
"One of the basic problems with Europe's approach is that it needs all the information on all chemicals in order to make those decisions," said Mike Walls, senior counsel to the American Chemistry Council trade group. The European chemical industry has also criticized the proposal, though not as harshly.
The dispute follows a pattern of Europe's trying to impose stricter environmental rules, which the United States then labels as unnecessary, costly and potential trade barriers.
European officials said today that their proposed testing was aimed at improving public health and the environment at a time when health problems like allergies and male infertility are rising. The costs of cleaning up damage from chemicals like asbestos is already in the billions of dollars.
To the Bush administration, the proposal amounts to unsound science and an abuse of regulatory authority, complaints American officials have already leveled against Europe for its concern about genetically modified food and a plan to require that all such food, known as genetically modified organisms, be labeled to alert consumers.
"This is a big game; it will dwarf the G.M.O. dispute," said William Lash, assistant secretary of commerce for market access and compliance. "Any benefit they gain from these tests will be outstripped by the cost."
Some representatives of European environmental groups have labeled the proposal a disappointment. They said they had hoped the proposal would move faster and that it would include tougher safeguards, like an obligation for industry to stop using hazardous chemicals when a safer alternative is available.
"It comes down to one question: Do we want to phase out the chemicals that accumulate in wildlife and ourselves, and those that disrupt our hormones?" said Michael Warhurst of the World Wildlife Fund. "I believe that the European public does, and the European Commission is failing to get moving on this crucial task."
European officials stressed to critics that this was the beginning of a debate on how best to regulate chemicals. The 1,200-page plan was posted today on the union Web site, which invited comments.
But White House officials already have enlisted other trading partners in Latin America and Asia to oppose the European proposal. If enough changes are not made, the administration could consider challenging the rules before the World Trade Organization as a restraint on trade. 
"We are concerned that this is potentially a trade barrier," said a senior trade official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "This would have a huge extraterritorial effect here and in Asia, with Europe imposing its rules on everyone else."
Commerce officials are holding public meetings to organize industry opposition to the testing plan arguing that there must be a far cheaper way to protect the environment and public health. European officials said the chemical testing could cost at least $3 billion over 20 years.
The European Union is the world's largest chemical producer, accounting for about 28 percent of the world output. The industry, Europe's third largest in manufacturing, employs 1.7 million directly and some 3 million people indirectly.
Some experts say that the Europeans are too lax in their oversight.
"The European chemical industry understands that there is a need for a fundamental change," said Joel Tickner, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. "It really has upset their colleagues in the United States."
Under the European proposal, manufacturers and importers of chemicals would be required to submit paperwork and tests documenting the safety of chemicals. The more hazardous chemicals and those used in the greatest volume would be subject to the greatest scrutiny.
In contrast, the main chemical regulation in the United States is the 1976 Toxic Substance Control Act, which has been widely criticized for being weak and too deferential to industry. The vast majority of nonpesticide chemicals are not subject to any required screening before introduction here.
The European chemical industry has tempered its criticism of the new proposal, focusing on the application of the tests rather than the premise.
"The initial white paper looked promising, balancing the social aspect, environment aspect and the economic aspect," said Marc Devisscher, a spokesman for Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council. "We feelthe environmental pillar is a little bit too dominant. It will end up in a huge bureaucracy."
The European Union also announced today that it had won approval from the World Trade Organization to impose duties worth $4 billion on American imports unless the United States repeals a law giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations. 
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, said today that he was committed to passing legislation to avoid the penalties. Two representatives, Philip Crane, Republican of Illinois, and Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill last month that they said would comply with the W.T.O. ruling. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a European proposal to require testing of industrial chemicals before they are imported misstated the purpose of public meetings organized by the United States Commerce Department, which has criticized the proposal. They are part of a broad initiative to discuss a range of manufacturing issues; they were not called specifically to organize opposition to the proposal.

HEADLINE: BUDGETS IN CRISIS: THE GOVERNOR; 
G.O.P. Senators Say Pataki Rebuffed Their Peace Feeler

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 7 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the State Senate said today that they had tried to get Gov. George E. Pataki back to the bargaining table to avoid an override battle that would further fracture their party, but that so far he had rebuffed their overtures for peace.
 Instead, the Republican governor went on a campaign-style trip with stops in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, to continue his attack on the budget the Legislature passed, which he has again vowed to veto by the May 14 deadline. 
 A spokesman for the governor, Joseph E. Conway, said, "The governor has an obligation to tell hard-working New Yorkers exactly what the Legislature's fiscally irresponsible spending spree will cost them." 
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, said Mr. Pataki should instead be in the Capitol, leading the way out of the impasse and the battles likely to come.
Business leaders, too, said they were awaiting alternative ideas from the governor on how to help the state and the city out of the worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's. Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said Mr. Pataki had yet to make good on a promise to give members of her group a plan for $1 billion in aid to the city.
"We haven't heard any alternative package to the one that the Legislature has passed," Ms. Wylde said. "We're confident that the governor cares about the city. Unfortunately, the process that's going on in Albany now is a little opaque as far as we're concerned."
Mr. Bruno implored Mr. Pataki to sign a bill the Legislature passed last week to restore $1.1 billion worth of the governor's cuts to local school aid, or take some other action on the issue to ease the fears of local property taxpayers. "So, governor, come back to Albany," Mr. Bruno said. "Sign the school aid package or do whatever you are going to do."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, issued a similar call for action on the Legislature's $92.8 billion budget. 
Assembly leaders and a spokesman for Mr. Bruno also lashed at the governor, saying his campaign against the legislators' budget was based on misinformation. They said it was the budget that the governor had proposed in January and that the Legislature had rejected that would wreak havoc on suburban, rural and urban constituents by prompting higher school and property taxes and hospital layoffs. The governor proposed the cuts to help close a nearly $12 billion budget shortfall and to avoid taxes. 
"His notion about hard-working New Yorkers -- they are the very same New Yorkers that are paying exorbitant property taxes, who are worried about their schools and the educational opportunities for their children that are being endangered by the governor's budget proposals," said John E. McArdle, Mr. Bruno's spokesman.
An aide to Mr. Pataki said the governor had tried to bridge the differences between his administration and the Legislature by arranging for a meeting Tuesday between legislative budget analysts and his staff members. Republican legislative leaders said the meeting ended with the two sides no closer and with the aides feeling they had been summoned to be lectured on the perceived pitfalls in their plan.
Still, the Republicans in the Senate said that they would like to avoid a veto showdown, and that they have continued to press for talks with the governor and his aides. 
Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican senator from Depew in western New York, said Mr. Bruno had sought to approach the governor. "Joe has been trying to say to him, 'You know, George, this is nutty, we don't want to fight with you constantly,' and we thought maybe yesterday he was going to be a little more accommodating," Mr. Volker said. "And then he ripped us." 
Mr. Bruno is so confident of where his members stand that on Saturday, when the governor telephoned him, he offered to let Mr. Pataki talk in person to his 38-member caucus. Mr. Bruno told the governor he could speak with them as a group or individually, with Mr. Bruno present or not. Instead, the governor has been calling the senators and trying to warn them about what he believes will be the dire consequences of their budget, both sides said.
Mr. Bruno has also offered the governor a chance to work on a mutually acceptable economic development plan, worth about $250 million, for localities around New York, something many legislators said would allow the governor a path back into the budget discussions.
As further evidence of the rift the budget issue is causing in the party, the Republican State Committee released a letter bearing the signatures of 46 of the state's 62 county Republican chairmen who support the governor's stand on the budget. The state committee's executive director, William H. McGahay, said election figures from November showed that 1.8 million of the 3 million registered Republicans statewide lived in the 46 counties.
No one from Nassau or Suffolk Counties on Long Island, which have more registered Republicans than any other counties and which Mr. Pataki dominated in his re-election race last fall, signed the letter.
Mr. Bruno said that he respected the county leaders but that they did not know the facts of the budget battle. "How could they know?" he said. "There is so much misinformation spread all over the state."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: March Jobless Figures Released 

BYLINE:  By Janny Scott (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 Joblessness in the city appeared to ease in March, but labor analysts said the figure actually reflected a drop in the number of people seeking work and a shrinking number of jobs. The unemployment rate for New York City dropped to 8.5 percent in March from 8.8 percent in February, according to figures released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. 
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the state fell to 6.0 percent from 6.1 percent, slightly above the national rate of 5.8 percent. At the same time, the number of private-sector jobs in the state declined by 6,700, when seasonally adjusted. There were gains in construction, broadcasting and security services, but losses in professional and business services and in employment services in particular, analysts said. Janny Scott (NYT)

HEADLINE: Mideast Peace, One Day at a Time 

BYLINE:  By Dennis Ross; Dennis Ross, envoy to the Middle East in the Clinton administration, is director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the last week the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians appeared to be improving. The Palestinians approved Mahmoud Abbas as their first-ever prime minister, and he declared that terrorism threatened to destroy the Palestinian cause -- language one never heard from Yasir Arafat. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel reiterated his understanding that it would take painful concessions by Israel to achieve peace, including a willingness to part with areas central to Jewish history like Bethlehem, Shilo and Beit El. And Secretary of State Colin Powell is on his way to Jerusalem to promote President Bush's "road map" toward a peacefully coexisting Israel and Palestine.
 But these hopeful signs were accompanied by a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv and an Israeli incursion in Gaza, which yet again left noncombatants dead on both sides. Then Mr. Abbas was stymied by Mr. Arafat and other Palestinian leaders over his plans to reorganize the Palestinian security services. And aides to Mr. Sharon said Israel was unlikely to commit to the road map until after he meets with President Bush in a few weeks. 
 Are we watching yet another brief moment of opportunity undone by Palestinian terrorism and Israeli reprisal? Perhaps not -- we are at a promising stage because the interests of the Israelis and Palestinians have greatly converged. But everyone involved must recognize what is possible and what is not. These shared concerns of the leaders on both sides only involve stopping the current Intifadah. We must focus on changes in the near-term reality, not a lasting peace that would require concessions neither side can make now.
Mr. Sharon knows that Israel's economic woes cannot be overcome so long as the daily struggle with the Palestinians goes on. Nor can the Israeli Defense Force stay in the Palestinian cities of the West Bank indefinitely. It is not only that Israel's army, largely made up of reserves, is being sapped in terms of manpower and morale, but also that the Palestinians' hostility toward Israel will continue as long as they feel the cities are under siege. 
For his part, Mr. Abbas knows that the war is a disaster for the Palestinians. Nearly two-thirds of those in the West Bank and Gaza are living below the poverty line. More than 2,000 have been killed; 30,000 more have been wounded. Some 580 schools have closed, as students cannot get to them. And polls of Palestinians now show a decisive majority favor an end to the violence. 
Thus neither prime minister is focused on the endgame of peacemaking right now. Mr. Abbas has no authority to make concessions on issues like the control of Jerusalem, borders and refugees. To gain credibility on tackling these core questions, he has to show that he can reform the Palestinian Authority and reduce Israeli control of Palestinian lives. Ariel Sharon, for his part, won't consider addressing the major issues until he knows that he has a partner who will truly dismantle all the terrorism networks in the Palestinian areas. None of this will happen overnight. 
From this standpoint, the road map makes sense. It speaks of three phases to peace, and does not immediately get to trying to resolve the issues of Jerusalem, borders and refugees until the third phase. Its weakness, however, is that it offers an illusion of specificity, with dozens of paragraphs of obligations for each side, but without any clear way to set in motion the actions Palestinians and Israelis must take. 
Moreover, the absence of clear measuring sticks for judging performance will leave each side in a position to claim it has done what was required, no matter the reality. For example, the Palestinians are supposed to make arrests and dismantle terrorist groups. But how many people should be arrested, and who are the key targets? What does the essential terrorist network consist of, and does it include the Dawa -- the social support structure of the terrorist group Hamas? 
On the Israeli side, what is the real number of illegal settler outposts? Israel is supposed to withdraw to its defense force positions of September 2000, but where exactly were they?
Without clear understandings between the Israelis and the Palestinians now, the road map is likely to go the way of the Mitchell Report and the Tenet plan before it. However, it is not just the road map that requires these specific understandings. There also needs to be a concrete plan on changing the immediate situation. No Israeli prime minister -- certainly not Ariel Sharon -- is going to relax Israeli controls on the Palestinians if it might lead to a new wave of suicide bombings. And the first Palestinian prime minister is not going to be able to sustain difficult steps against groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah if he cannot show his people that they are going to be able resume normal life without border closings, sieges of cities, and Israeli checkpoints separating their towns and villages.
The two sides need to be clear on what each is going to do, where it is going to do it, how it is going to do it, and when it is going to do it. Can they come to an agreement on their own? I doubt it. From my long experience dealing with the two sides, I know that the potential for using the same language to mean different things existed even in the best of times of dialogue and cooperation. Now, in a very hostile environment, the potential to talk past each other and inadvertently create profound misunderstandings is even greater. It is already visible in the debate over "confronting" Hamas -- with Palestinians feeling this means persuasion, the Israelis that it means physical destruction. 
Israeli expectations must be reconciled with Palestinian capacities -- and that will happen only with American help. Mr. Powell has the best chance of success this weekend if he puts his emphasis on near-term specifics. His success at getting the two sides to agree on what to do now will determine whether the road map is a genuine path toward peace or yet another Middle Eastern cul-de-sac.

HEADLINE: Senators Question Effectiveness of $1.4 Billion Settlement 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
Senior United States senators questioned today whether the $1.4 billion Wall Street settlement would change attitudes at the top of the biggest brokerage firms, while regulators defended the agreement as a historic move toward reform.
 "Firms are not contrite and simply consider the fines and penalties as a means to make a problem go away," said Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the settlement that was made final last week with 10 firms. 
 "I am not convinced that the global settlement has done enough to change attitudes at the top of these banks," said Mr. Shelby, chairman of the committee. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28 released final terms of a settlement resulting from almost two years of investigations into analysts issuing overly positive research, mostly in the 1990's market bubble, to please corporate managers and win investment-banking business.
Mr. Shelby compared huge investor losses with the relatively modest payout and asked William H. Donaldson, chairman of the S.E.C., whether the settlement punished Wall Street enough.
Mr. Donaldson, a multimillionaire former investment banker and former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, pledged further inquiries of brokerage executives. He said, "You cannot dismiss the fact that these are the largest fines that have ever been given.
"This is not the end," he said. "This is just the beginning." 
The settlement banned two analysts from the securities business for life: Henry Blodget, the former Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch, and Jack B. Grubman, once the top telecommunications analyst at Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney.
But no other individuals have been singled out despite thousands of memos and e-mail messages released by investigators showing managers deeply involved in an intertwining of research and investment banking that compromised analysts' work.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, the top Democrat on the banking panel, said Wall Street must "get with the program."
Mr. Sarbanes, who helped write the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley corporate and accounting reforms that came after the collapse of Enron, added, "If the people on Wall Street can't be sensitized to what's happened, then obviously the regulators are going to have to sensitize them."
The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who spearheaded the first inquiries into analyst misconduct, told the committee that his investigation of individuals would intensify. He called brokerage executives "fair game" for regulators.
Turning the tables on Congress as the hearing moved to the historic causes of the scandal, Mr. Spitzer attacked "an overarching effort to deregulate the financial services industry over the last 20 years."
He said, "I think we may now be paying the price for that deregulation," which came amid reassurances from investment and commercial banks that they could police themselves.

HEADLINE: As Bush Tax Plan Falters, Conservatives Find a Silver Lining 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
When the Republican leaders of the House defied President Bush last week and dropped his plan to eliminate the tax on dividends, liberals were not the ones high-fiving each other victoriously in the hallways.
 It was, in fact, the most conservative members of the House who enjoyed a moment of triumph, thrilled that one of their most cherished goals, reducing the tax on capital gains, might now have a real chance of passage. 
 Many conservatives had long preferred their tax cut to the one advocated by the president, but until the last few days, party loyalty prevented them from saying so. Now that the president's tax plan is faltering, however, his high standing in the polls has not prevented many Republicans from openly dismissing his proposal. 
"A great number of conservatives in the Republican conference are more enthusiastic about the new House bill than the president's proposal," said Representative Mike Pence, a conservative Republican from Indiana. "Frankly, I never really understood how the White House plan to eliminate the taxation on dividends would get the economy moving. But millions of Americans understand the power of cutting the tax on capital gains."
On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee passed an economic program that would reduce the tax rate on both capital gains and dividends after it became clear the president's plan would not make it through the Senate. The tax cuts, which are expected to be approved by the House on Friday, have picked up tepid support from the White House and almost none in the Senate, but they have the hearty backing of many House Republicans.
"This capital gains tax cut is going to generate even more economic activity, and have a bigger effect on the stock market, than just the dividends piece," said Representative Phil English, a Pennsylvania Republican who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "The president had a good idea, but this is easier to understand and easier to sell."
Republicans in the Senate have yet to embrace any part of the House plan, although they will have to deal with it in an eventual conference committee. Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the capital gains idea was a "reasonable approach, but it's not my preferred approach."
Late Wednesday, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee reached a tentative agreement on a plan to reduce the dividend tax. The plan would exempt the first $500 in dividend income from taxes and would reduce the tax on dividends above that amount over 10 years. 
The Finance Committee plan, which includes $20 billion in aid to states, is about $85 billion over the $350 billion limit for the package in the Senate, but Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the committee chairman, said the amount would be reduced by additional revenues to be specified in the coming days.
Reducing the 20 percent tax on capital gains, which are the profits from the sale of an investment, has long been an article of faith among conservative House Republicans, who say it will stimulate investment by businesses and individuals and lead to the creation of jobs. More than 90 House members belong to the Zero Capital Gains Tax Caucus, which is led by Representative David Dreier, Republican of California.
There is no comparable coalition for cutting the dividend tax, and several Republicans said they were surprised and disappointed that President Bush chose in January to propose cutting the dividend tax rather than capital gains. Mr. Dreier and other House members tried to get both cuts, and one of their strongest backers was Representative Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader. But when the White House insisted on having its plan with no additions, the House went along.
That changed last month when the Senate supported less than half of the president's plan, giving the House an opening to rewrite the tax package according to its own design. After hearing from advocates of a lower capital gains tax, Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, proposed cutting the tax to 15 percent from its current 20 percent level for most taxpayers, and taxing dividends at the same level.
Republicans say Mr. DeLay and other House leaders eagerly accepted the idea and suddenly Mr. Thomas, whose lack of orthodoxy has made him an object of suspicion among conservatives, is now something of a hero. He said today that he saw no point in simply passing the president's plan again, and so he listened to members who had strong but differing ideas on tax reduction.
"I think that you have to remember that the concept of reducing taxes didn't originate with the Bush administration," Mr. Thomas said, in the dry way that has become his trademark. "There are some people who have advocated certain things on that subject over a long period of time."
Democrats consider the capital gains plan even worse than the president's dividend tax cut, noting that capital gains are concentrated even more heavily among the wealthiest Americans. "The Thomas bill actually, and I never thought I could see this, gives a greater benefit to millionaires than the president's original bill," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. House Democrats presented their own tax proposal today, which calls for raising the child tax credit to $800 from $600, allowing increased write-offs for businesses, extending unemployment insurance and providing aid to states.
But Republicans cite their own studies showing that the combination of dividend and capital gains tax reductions would create nearly as many jobs as Mr. Bush's original proposal, and for a smaller cost.
"There's a lot more enthusiasm now," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington. "The president had a good plan, but what we have now just makes a lot of sense to more people, and it has a much broader effect."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: REBUILDING; 
U.S. Economic Penalties Against Iraq Are Ended

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT with ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today ended many of the sanctions the United States had placed on Iraq before the Persian Gulf war, easing the job of contractors rebuilding Iraq.
 The move lets American companies begin exporting many goods to Iraq, and allows people who live in the United States to send money into the country, up to a limit of $500 a month per Iraqi household. 
 "The regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules Iraq," President Bush said at the White House today, in an appearance with President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain. "And no country in good conscience can support using sanctions to hold back the hopes of the Iraqi people." 
At the Treasury Department, Secretary John W. Snow said the suspension would help contractors struggling to import equipment into Iraq to rebuild the country. He cited the dredging of the harbor in Umm Qasr, an important commercial gateway, saying the job had been complicated by the lack of laptop computers, among the items prohibited from being sent to Iraq under the sactions. The Bechtel Group, the lead contractor in Iraq, is working on the harbor.
The penalties being suspended are separate from the United Nations' strict sanctions against Iraq, which remain in effect. President Bush has called for those to be removed as well, and he said today that Britain and Spain would soon introduce a resolution at the United Nations to lift those sanctions.
The lifting of the penalties seems likely to put pressure on other countries to follow suit in order to allow companies to do business legally in Iraq. It could put similar pressure on the United Nations if officials there see such individual actions as a threat to its authority.
Treasury officials said the suspension of their sanctions did not conflict with the United Nations penalties. "This is wholly consistent with the program," David Aufhauser, Treasury's general counsel, said. The first President Bush imposed the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990, shortly after it invaded Kuwait, and Congress passed additional penalties in November 1990.
In a continuing dispute over a major project in Iraq, officials of Halliburton today defended the contract of their subsidiary with the Pentagon to repair and operate oil fields in Iraq. Questioned by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, the Army Corps of Engineers released new information about the noncompetitive contract worth as much as $7 billion given to the subsidiary, Kellogg Brown & Root, for two years of emergency work.
In a letter released this week, Lt. Gen. Robert B. Flowers, the commander of the Corps of Engineers, said the contract was not only to repair oil fields but also to operate the fields and distribute their products.

HEADLINE: Three Getaway Trucks 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The night after President Bush gave him 48 hours to surrender, Saddam Hussein sent his son Qusay to the vault of Iraq's Central Bank to make a modest withdrawal for the family's departure. 
 It took three tractor-trailers to haul away nearly a billion dollars in cash -- all in $100 U.S. greenbacks -- plus $100 million worth of euros. Thus did Saddam & Sons bring off the grandest larceny in bank history. 
 Reading Dexter Filkins's scoop in The Times, my mind harks back to a question asked of Frank Sinatra two decades ago by the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission: Did the singer ever carry $2 million in an attache case to a mobster? Sinatra, irritated at the bagman charge, snapped: "If you could get $2 million in an attache case, I'll give you $2 million." 
The novelist Norman Mailer called me when I reported that exchange. He had done some calculations: "A $100 bill measures 6.2 inches by 2.6 inches. You can squeeze 350 bills down to one inch. That's $35,000 in a one-inch packet. You can lay six of those packets along the 17-inch axis of an attache case, and four others lengthwise into the space left on that first layer." 
Ten packets per layer amount to $350,000, and the novelist measured five layers in the 12-by-17-by-5-inch case. That makes only $1,750,000, but with half-inch packets of hundreds stuffed in the corners, Mailer announced triumphantly, "you can fit $2,012,000 into an attache case." We agreed that Sinatra lost his bet.
This is by way of illustrating the physical size of Saddam's severance pay. Five hundred equally jampacked attache cases would be required to contain that stolen billion dollars in hundreds, not to mention the loose change in euros (presumably for tips in Europe).
Where does one take such truckloads of cash? Not to a family palace or home, the first places to be bombed or searched. Logic suggests a city outside the war zone. There the moneycould be laundered to make it untraceably fungible -- able to secretly purchase North Korean missiles and nukes, or be used for bribes to Russian guardians of warheads, to pass weapons on to terrorist groups. That danger is what makes finding that money more than a satisfying solution to a massive theft -- it's an urgent matter of national security. There's a chance that much of the money has already been found, but even an unaccounted-for few hundred million can underwrite a lot of terror.
Fact No. 1: the Fed tells me that $312 billion in $100 bills is floating around the world, twice as much as exists in the U.S. of that denomination of our currency. (That "float" amounts to an interest-free loan from the world to us.) Fact No. 2: each bill has a serial number, which requires the thief of a huge run to route it through a variety of cutouts lest it be traced back. Fact No. 3: trucks don't have wings.
The stolen billion was probably driven out of Iraq on March 18, the night before the war began. Across which of its borders? Iran, Saddam's enemy, is least likely; Turkey, which does not want further tensions with the U.S., unlikely; Jordan, possible; Syria, occupying Lebanon, with its corrupt Beirut banks, the most probable.
Bashar al-Assad's financiers are sophisticated. To conceal revenues from its illicit pipeline from Iraq, Syria issued phony reports for years exaggerating its own oil production. As a result, the International Monetary Fund concluded that Syria's economic growth in 2001 was double the real percentage. The new Iraqi government should have a billion-dollar claim against Syria for its rip-off of Iraqi oil assets; the shadow of that should induce Bashar to help us track down Saddam's looting of Iraq's treasury.
Money-laundering experts worry that in the past six weeks, Saddam's agents could have been buying and moving gold and gold futures, depositing cash under fictitious names and through straw corporations, moving to the "layering phase": distributing disguised assets through seemingly legitimate enterprises.
Is our financial antiterror network up to Saddam's final challenge? This is far bigger than anything it's had to tackle before.
As a jocular Mailer told me about Sinatra's bet: "You collect and we'll share." In this historic heist, every bill on the getaway trucks belongs to Iraqis.

HEADLINE: Trouble In Bush's America 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
While our "What, me worry?" president is having a great time with his high approval ratings and his "Top Gun" fantasies, the economy remains in the tank. And the finances of state and local governments are sinking tragically into ever deeper and ever more unforgiving waters.
 You want shock and awe? Come to New York City, where jobs are hard to find and the budget (as residents are suddenly realizing) is a backbreaking regimen of service cuts, tax increases and that perennial painkiller, wishful thinking. 
 The biggest wish, of course, is that the national economy will suddenly turn around and flood the city and state with desperately needed revenues. Meanwhile, the soup kitchens and food pantries are besieged. 
"This is the worst situation I've been in," said Alfonso Shynvwelski, an unemployed waiter who stood in a long line of people waiting for food at the Washington Heights Ecumenical Food Pantry on Broadway in upper Manhattan. Mr. Shynvwelski, 36, has worked at a number of upscale restaurants, including the Russian Tea Room, which has closed. He's been unemployed for a year.
"It's the first time in my life I've had to look for food this way," he said.
This lament is being heard more and more often in the city, which has an official jobless rate of nearly 9 percent. The real rate is substantially higher, which means that more than 1 in 10 New Yorkers who would like to work cannot find a job.
Last week Local 46 of the Metallic Lathers Union announced that it would allow 200 people to apply for membership, which would mean a shot at high-paying work. The line of applicants began at Third Avenue and 76th Street and almost circled the block. The earliest arrivals waited in line for three days. They slept on the sidewalk.
In George Bush's America, jobs get erased like chalk marks on a blackboard. More than 2 million have vanished on Mr. Bush's watch. There are now more than 10.2 million unemployed workers in the U.S., including 1.4 million who are not officially counted because they've become discouraged and stopped looking.
There are also 4.8 million men and women who are working part time because they can't find full-time jobs.
John Challenger, the chief executive of the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, offered a cautionary word to the wishful thinkers who insist that prosperity is just around the corner. "The sharp increase in the job cuts last month," Mr. Challenger said, "should serve as a warning that it is premature to conclude that the quick end to the war in Iraq will bring a quick turnaround in the economy and job market."
The high unemployment and sharply reduced social services are having devastating consequences. In some cases people are being driven to destitution.
"This is a really spooky time for us," said John Hoffmann, who runs a food pantry and soup kitchen in the Bronx. He's faced with both a surge in demand and, because of government budget cuts, a threat to his financing.
"These are folks who are new to services like ours," Mr. Hoffmann said of his latest wave of clients. Many of them are working men and women who were struggling to support their families from one paycheck to the next. When workers in that situation are laid off, they have nothing to fall back on.
Nearly a quarter of a million jobs have been lost in New York City in the past two and a half years. Taxes are going up and services are going down -- and still that is not enough. Similar scenarios are being played out in city and state governments throughout the country.
California is trying to borrow its way out of a nightmarish crisis. Texas, already near the bottom nationally in social services, is heading further south.
Two forms of help from the federal government are needed. One is direct assistance to local governments to help alleviate the disastrous budget shortfalls. The other is an economic stimulus program that really works, that boosts the economy and creates jobs through investments in some of the nation's real needs, rather than simply transferring trainloads of money to the wealthy in the form of tax cuts.
Mr. Bush has no interest in such remedies. Easing the economic struggles of poor and working families in America is not part of his agenda.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Interpublic chooses a financial executive from outside the industry as chief operating officer.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
A PHARMACEUTICAL executive with extensive financial credentials but no experience at an advertising agency was named yesterday as the chief operating officer of the struggling Interpublic Group of Companies.
 Interpublic, which owns agencies like Deutsch, McCann-Erickson and Weber Shandwick, has been searching for months for an executive to serve as second in command after a cascade of surprising financial setbacks and shortfalls that severely damaged its credibility. 
 Interpublic surprised some analysts again yesterday in selecting Christopher J. Coughlin, the executive vice president and chief financial officer at Pharmacia, for the job.
"I like that he has a financial background," said Lauren Rich Fine, the advertising analyst at Merrill Lynch. "I didn't expect that to be the primary trait of whomever they hired." 
But given the extent of financial and operational issues waiting for resolution, a fresh set of eyes, even from outside the industry, was probably called for, she said.
At Interpublic, executives said it was precisely Mr. Coughlin's outside history, including his experience managing large companies in transition, that made him appealing.
"From my standpoint, what helps is not whether he came from outside or inside, but what helps is his experience in his career at dealing with complexity, with change, processes and systems," said David Bell, chairman and chief executive at Interpublic in New York.
Mr. Coughlin, 50, has nearly three decades of financial, executive and operational experience. He began his career at Arthur Young, now Ernst & Young. In 1996, he was named executive vice president and chief financial officer at Nabisco Holdings, later serving as president of Nabisco International, now part of the Altria Group.
He joined Pharmacia in Peapack, N.J., in 1998, in time to help the company try to absorb acquisitions and adjust to its merger with Upjohn. After he helped engineer Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia, which closed April 16, Mr. Coughlin said he began looking for his next opportunity.
The agency company model seemed a good fit, he said. "This multibusiness environment, with new companies coming in, is something I'm quite familiar with," he said. "I wouldn't underestimate the challenges here. The challenges are not only organizational, within I.P.G., but also in the economic environment we're in."
Interpublic began its search for a chief operating officer in November, when the extent of those challenges was just becoming clear. The company was reeling from a string of bad news, including revenue shortfalls, losses and liabilities at divisions with specialties like sports marketing, disclosures of accounting improprieties and decreases in expected earnings.
Although just one other giant agency company, the Publicis Groupe, has a chief operating officer, and Interpublic eliminated the position in January 2001, another set of hands seemed desirable. John J. Dooner Jr., the chairman and chief executive at the time, hoped a new No. 2 would help shore up the company and reassure Wall Street, investors and potential clients.
The hunt wound up outlasting Mr. Dooner's own tenure as chief executive, which ended in February when the board demoted him to chairman and chief executive at a company division, the McCann-Erickson World Group, and promoted Mr. Bell to succeed him. It continued into March, when Interpublic reported that the Internal Revenue Service was auditing its tax returns for 1994 to 1996.
The hiring of Mr. Coughlin, which is effective June 16, after six months of uncertainty, will be quite welcome, said Alexia Quadrani, the advertising analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company.
"It's been a long time coming," she said. The appointment means, she added, Interpublic will finally be led by top executives with experience in the upper ranks of public companies. That may mean it will be more attuned to shareholder needs and perception than in the past, she said.
Of course, Mr. Coughlin's long history as a chief financial officer may prompt speculation on the Street about the fate of Interpublic's own chief financial officer, Sean F. Orr, who will now report to Mr. Coughlin.
Most likely, Ms. Fine of Merrill Lynch said, Mr. Orr will be relieved. "To the degree that this company has been in reactive mode, it could allow someone to be reactive and someone to be proactive," she said. "There's more than enough to do."
Indeed, a formal inquiry into the finances of Interpublic by the Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing. Interpublic is still in talks to sell NFO WorldGroup, a research unit, and investors will be watching today when the company is scheduled to release its first-quarter results.

HEADLINE: BUDGETS IN CRISIS: CITY HALL MEMO; 
No Politician? The Polls Agree With the Mayor

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The prevailing political theory at City Hall goes something like this: Politics do not matter. If Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg remains true to his convictions, resists the taint of special interest groups and makes tough choices that keep the city sound, New Yorkers will appreciate and reward him. 
 But that theory is being severely tested as Mr. Bloomberg finds himself in what appears to be the lowest point in his 16-month mayoralty, based on a chorus of critics and the latest Quinnipiac University poll. 
 Last week, the mayor was rebuffed in his months-long effort to extract a commuter tax from leaders in Albany, and was forced to impose tax increases on his own constituents in its stead. 
Mr. Bloomberg's relationship with the labor unions is so tense that labor experts struggle for a comparison. The strain was underscored this week by a threat from the head of the teachers' union to withdraw support for the mayor's sweeping changes to the public education system. His reorganization of the school system is also the subject of a lawsuit filed by some state legislators who originally supported him.
Advocates for the poor, who were thrilled to have an open reception from Mr. Bloomberg after years of being snubbed by Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, are now bitterly denouncing the current mayor for excluding them from any role in key policy decisions. Business leaders, essentially Mr. Bloomberg's peers, are now privately grumbling that they detest the mayor's latest tax policies. 
Yesterday, the cloud over City Hall darkened when the Quinnipiac poll was released showing that only 32 percent of New York City voters polled approve of the mayor's job performance. 
The poll, coming in the wake of a six-month whirlwind of increases in taxes and transit fares and higher prices on regulated rental apartments, is Mr. Bloomberg's worst showing yet. The polls have fallen almost steadily since February 2002, when 65 percent of New Yorkers approved of the job he was doing.
In the insult-to-injury category, while 89 percent of polled New Yorkers said that Mr. Bloomberg is intelligent, only 40 percent would savor a dinner invitation with the mayor, a man who is feverishly social and sought out by a broad swath of NewYork society. 
While 61 percent of those questioned said that the mayor had "strong leadership qualities," only 33 percent agreed that he "cares about the needs and problems of people like you," which may speak to Mr. Bloomberg's inability to communicate his broader mayoral goals.
Quinnipiac surveyed 757 registered voters in the city from April 29 to May 5. On May 2, the outlines of a plan to raise sales and income taxes became known. The margin of sampling error for the poll is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
If any of this ruffles the feathers of Mr. Bloomberg -- who came into office with the stated goal of "making a difference" absent any deeper political ambitions -- he seems not to show it. Yesterday, during a news conference at City Hall, he sniped at a reporter who asked about the cost of a new mobile emergency command center, but let questions about the poll roll off him like a spritz of Evian at the beach.
"You got to do what's right," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And when I go home at night I can look in the mirror and say, 'I stood up and I made the right decisions.' " 
Mr. Bloomberg, who has said he intends to run for another term, added: "The public in the end will take a look and say, 'There was somebody that made the right decision, the city's better.' And whether they want to have dinner with me or not, I don't know."
Mr. Bloomberg added that he would like to break bread with Bono, whom he met at the TriBeCa Film Festival the night before, and said he assumed that the singer shared that desire. 
The fact that Mr. Bloomberg grabbed for Bono's name underscores a paradox of his tenure that has haunted him since the first day he began to make budget cuts. 
The mayor's vast personal fortune led him to take the ultimate leap into public service, working for a dollar a year at one of the hardest political jobs in America. By his own account, it was another leg of his broader philanthropic vision.
His billions enabled him to run successfully for mayor and even support city programs out of his own pocket. (He has contributed millions of dollars to cultural and other city institutions.) 
But his wealth has also created an intractable chasm between himself and the majority of the eight million people he serves who are now sitting by as their taxes rise, their services are cut and they are given little reason to expect an economic recovery any time soon.
"I just don't feel the mayor understands poor people," said Christine Cutchin, 75, who founded the Roundtable for Seniors, a recreational center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that is scheduled for closing in the budget cuts. When it was pointed out that every imaginable constituent was being hit in the current budget plans, she shook her head emphatically and said, "These seniors have already paid their dues."
Aides to the mayor uphold his conviction that voters will get over their angst over increased rent, property, water, cigarette and income tax bills. "He's also been at this long enough to know that polls don't measure your accomplishments," said Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary. "They measure moods. It's not personal because the people who are being polled don't know him." 
But it is clear that some New Yorkers who have gotten to know the mayor, at least professionally, are also less than enamored with him. Union officials and their members are battling with the mayor over budget issues, and many of them are deeply offended that Mr. Bloomberg, in their view, has written them off as a costly distraction.
"There has been a real change of heart among the union leaders toward the mayor," said Randi Weingarten, who is head of the Municipal Labor Council and the teachers' union. "He trashes us and trashes the work force."
Advocates for the poor and downtrodden, who have been welcomed into City Hall, are now crying bait and switch. They say they are often left out of the loop or even duped regarding the administration's plans for homeless families, AIDS services and other policy matters. 
"On a certain level the Giuliani administration had more integrity than the Bloomberg administration," said Charles King, the co-president of Housing Works, an AIDS advocacy group. "The Giuliani administration was pretty straightforward that they were going to do it their way without consultation with the community."
Mr. Skyler dismissed this talk. "We always welcome and solicit input, but ultimately the mayor is the one who needs to make the decisions," he said.
The press secretary was not terribly concerned with the fact that so few wanted to eat with the newly lithe mayor. "It's understandable," Mr. Skyler deadpanned. "Nobody likes to eat with somebody on a diet."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the decision of Randi Weingarten, the New York City teachers' union president, to withdraw support for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's school reorganization plan misstated the name of another organization she leads and her title in it. (The name was also misstated in articles on May 8, May 3 and April 11; the title was wrong on April 11.) The organization is the Municipal Labor Committee, not Municipal Labor Council. Ms. Weingarten is chairwoman, not president.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "MATTHEW BARNEY: THE CREMASTER CYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through June 11). The most anticipated show by any American artist to emerge in a decade or more. "Cremaster," Mr. Barney's nine-year, five-film project, here presented whole for the first time, is an inspired benchmark of ambition, scope and forthright provocation for art in the new century. I recall Elizabeth Murray's describing how Philip Guston's crazy late works gave her heart to do her own mature paintings. Mr. Barney has brought to the art world a new freedom to explore narrative. He has introduced a new repertory of materials, gooey, strange, malleable and synthetic, which nobody thought of as germane before. Never mind that the films and many (not all) of his related sculptures, installations and photographs are very beautiful. The show, an installation itself, brings them together. The earliest "Cremaster" sculptures are film props, cobbled into installations that don't jell. But the latest are better: twin steel towers framed in plastic, a suite of abstract sculptures derived from automobile chassis. Vaseline and plastic combine with cement and steel -- pink and gray, rough and smooth, hard and soft -- the materials sustaining a narrative of formal eloquence. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; $10 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT: PHOTOGRAPHS BY RYAN McGINLEY," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through May 18). It isn't often that an artist makes his New York solo exhibition debut in the august galleries of the Whitney. But Mr. McGinley, 26, is doing so as part of the museum's "First Exposure" series, a showcase for new photography. He works in what might be described as a life-style genre, whose exemplars also include Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tillmans and Larry Clark. The 20 large color pictures of Mr. McGinley's 20-something friends, lovers and fellow artists avoid the grit of Mr. Clark's work and the noirish narcissicism of Ms. Goldin's. Instead, these are basically sunny, feel-good pictures, particularly interesting for an approach to sexuality that suggests intriguing socio-political shifts in gay self-presentation. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* "MANET/VELAZQUEZ: THE FRENCH TASTE FOR SPANISH PAINTING," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 8). The Met has clearly called in every chip to make this show spectacular. The first rooms are a virtual survey of great Spanish painting of the 17th and 18th centuries; then comes a virtual Manet retrospective, with some Degas and Courbet for good measure; then a virtual 19th-century American overview of the most gifted portraitists influenced by Spanish painting via Manet, Degas and Courbet: Eakins, Chase, Sargent and Whistler. The thesis of Spanish influence on French art is hardly new, but it is explored in such precise and fresh detail, discreetly, without pushing comparisons (in that respect it's not like "Matisse Picasso" at the Modern, notwithstanding the coincidental titled pairings) that you would be churlIsh not to leave edified and amazed. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through Aug. 15). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "MATISSE PICASSO," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 4520 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through May 19). If you're thinking of skipping it because of the crowds, that's not a good enough excuse. This is one for the ages: an eye-educating, often revelatory parlor game, with the fate of modern art as the stakes. The premise is a little dubious -- the two of them competing as if in stately isolation from everything else going on in art -- but the results look great. Choosing a winner is the sport of the event and the inevitable outcome of pitting titans mano a mano. Matisse comes out looking consistently good. To grasp 20th-century art, Picasso once said, "you ought to see side by side everything Matisse and I were doing." He was right about that. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Admission: $20; $15.50 for students and 65+; under 16 with an adult, free. Reserved tickets: Ticketmaster, (212) 307-5577; or toll free, (866) 879-6662, with Ticketmaster surcharges (Kimmelman).

"ELIE NADELMAN: SCULPTOR OF MODERN LIFE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through July 20). Despite the clarion title, this exhibition is too monotonous, stiffly installed and short on drawings to do full justice to the erudite, polymorphous achievement of the Polish-born American sculptor Elie Nadelman (1882-1946). Still, don't miss this opportunity to see his work in quantity, especially the streamlined wood figures from the 1920's and the small truculent plaster figurines, which were found in his studio after his death. Their suave economy, ineffable stillness, delicate gestures and seamless blend of historical and popular sources make them among the most complex, fully visual sculptures in Western art. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "ST. ADOLF-GIANT-CREATION: THE ART OF ADOLF WOLFLI," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through May 18). The distinction between insider and outsider art is all but nullified by this stunning show of the densely patterned drawings that Wolfli (1864-1930) made in the last 35 years of his life at Waldau, a mental asylum in Bern, Switzerland. Brought to order by vast architectonic structures that allow several forms of communication to speak at once yet remain distinct, these works are embedded with saints, devils, written texts, mathematical calculations, musical scores and geometric symbols. They treat the eye to a ride through a multicultural terrain bounded by Piranesi, biblical myth, illuminated manuscripts, tantric mandalas and Swiss cuckoo clocks. And they attest to a vision as ancient as it is modern that verifies both Wolfli's careful observation of his surroundings and Jung's theory of the collective unconscious. Not to be missed. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5, students and 62+ (Smith).

* "THOMAS STRUTH, 1977-2002," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 18). This midcareer retrospective is the right event for right now: serious, tradition bound, circumspect about the world. Mr. Struth operates from a chilly peak, where the air is thin. But what results are obsessively meticulous photographs, some of them enormous, like mural paintings. They are hypnotic, silent, slightly claustrophobic, brainy and gorgeous, qualities that can seem in lively tension with one another. Art is a means of "locating yourself in your time," Mr. Struth has said. He has done series of streets, jungles, museums, portraits and church facades. Standing before his crowded museums and churches, we can become absorbed in the chaos of culture, sacred places made profane. In the jungle we acquiesce to the spiritual pleasure of solitude. The silence is calming. We may find ourselves in our time.Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "WHISTLER, WOMEN AND FASHION," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through July 13). A dandy, a wit and a social butterfly who cultivated his image as a star aesthete, James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) had a lifelong interest in fashion and women's clothes. This show honors the centenary of the painter's death by exploring his intense, unabashed involvement with fashion. He obsessed over what his female sitters wore, choosing the clothes they posed in and in some cases actually designing them himself. The display includes many major images of women in their finery and several magnificent gowns of the Whistler period along with smaller oils, drawings, pastel studies, costume designs, prints and watercolors, and relevant 19th-century fashion plates. It's a fitting tribute to a bravura brush. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Grace Glueck).

Galleries: Uptown

JANNIS KOUNELLIS, Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through May 24). These works on paper from the 1970's and 80's by Mr. Kounellis, a maverick sculptor and painter who participated in the Arte Povera movement in the 1960's, tap into the many themes of his larger projects. They range from the merest of sketches to finished drawings. Fragile wisps of thought, more substantial images like factories and locomotives, black overall patterns of skull-faces that seem to evoke a mass catastrophe: some fragments are powerful bits of visual poetry, but others are slight to the point of meaninglessness (Glueck).

"SALLY MICHEL, MILTON AVERY: A PORTRAIT," Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through May 30). Also known as Mrs. Milton Avery, the widow of the artist, Sally Michel used her own name as a painter in her own right. This warm memorial tribute to Michel and Avery mounts a group of informal, private portraits of each artist done by the other. A wall of Avery by Michel, who died in January, shows him painting, napping, smoking, reading, thinking, leaning. A facing wall of portraits by Avery (1885-1965) shows Michel smiling, mothering their daughter, March, wearing a new hat and painting a portrait of her husband. This small show is an engaging celebration of a highly productive relationship (Glueck).

"OBSESSIVE PLEASURES," Pavel Zoubok, 1014 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 879-5858 (through May 24). More cheerfully overwrought than obsessive, the works in this theme show include Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt's circular collages of foil, plastic and colored pipe cleaners; Barbara Takenaga's cosmic dot paintings; Daniel Zeller's finely lined drawings, like zany topographical maps; Amy Yoes's paintings of ruffles, stripes, blossoms and architectural elements; John Digby's cut-out vines; Nora Aslan's extremely dense yet expansive flower collages; Aric Obrosey's laceworks; and Christopher Tanner's glittery paisley patterns (Ken Johnson).

* "KURT SCHWITTERS: COLLAGES, PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, OBJECTS, EPHEMERA," Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444 (through May 23). The German artist Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948) made artful arrangements of found scraps -- torn photographs, ticket stubs, labels, newspaper clips and other discarded bits -- into abstract compositions that balanced colors, forms, textures and printed matter to dazzling effect. More than 60 of his works, Dada-oriented but also much influenced by Constructivism and Russian Suprematism, are brought together here in a museum-quality display that ranges in date from before 1920 to the late 1940's. One standout in this bountiful show is a gem from 1931, "Untitled (Red, Gray, Black)," a rigorously structured composition with all the elegant trappings of Suprematism-Constructivism brilliantly translated into "Merz," Schwitters's no-meaning name for his own visual language (Glueck).

GEORGE SEGAL, "Bronze," Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through June 14). There was always a Hopperesque ennui about Segal's plaster-cast figures. Late works cast in bronze are truly lugubrious. A quartet of chunky women in balletic poses perform a ponderous dance; three dark gray people with the closed eyes of sleepwalkers meet under one-way street signs pointing in two directions; and in "Street Crossing," seven blind souls painted white wander aimlessly in a modern purgatory (Johnson).

HELEN TORR, "Out of the Shadows," James Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through June 8). Torr, the wife of Arthur Dove, was an accomplished if not highly original painter and an excellent draftsman in her own right. This retrospective, organized by Anne Cohen De Pietro of the Heckscher Museum on Long Island, is studded by gems in a range of styles, from ecstatic Dove-esque abstractions to delicate yet sumptuous still lifes that Georgia O'Keeffe might have envied (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

* WILLIAM BECKMAN, Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545 (through May 17). Mr. Beckman paints like Hans Holbein but in a contemporary mood of existential anxiety. An extraordinarily vivid painting of the artist and his female companion in overcoats, looming bigger than life and gazing out at us with tense, somber expressions, has a novelistic weight to it. They could be characters in a Russell Banks tale, enduring the spiritually and materially erosive demands of modern living (Johnson).

FERNANDA BRUNET, "Bang," Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through May 16). Graphic pop and gestural dynamism combine in this Mexico City artist's paintings. Ms. Brunet takes images of explosions, deluges, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves from Japanese comic books and turns them into semiabstract compositions, in a palette of earth tones and silver. They humorously suggest transports of erotic ecstasy (Johnson).

JOHN CEDERQUIST, "Furniture That Builds Itself," Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through May 31). Mr. Cederquist's beautifully made woodworks are simultaneously functional pieces of furniture and zany cartoons in two and three dimensions. With painted Mickey Mouse arms wielding drills and planes as if in the act of building, these funky sculptures are deceptively whimsical meditations on the mind's construction of reality (Johnson).

"HEAVEN AND HELL," Barbara Mathes Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-5135, (through June 6). This high-low meditation includes Stephen Balkenhol's rough, wooden Everyman twins as an angel and a devil; a leering antique silver Satan photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe; montages illustrating Dante's "Inferno" by Robert Rauschenberg; a big celestial photograph by Thomas Ruff; a terrestrial paradise photographed by Thomas Struth; painful signs by Jenny Holzer; and the convergence of an angel and a manhole cover in a luminous nocturne by Joseph Cornell (Johnson).

TOM WESSELMANN, "The Great American 60's," Maxwell Davidson, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7555 (through June 13); "Nudes and Abstracts," Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through tomorrow). Wesselmann then and now: Davidson's selection of works from the 1960's includes one of the Pop Art master's classic Great American Nude apartment paintings -- real telephone and radiator included -- and seductive small studies of female body parts: pillowy lips, nubile breasts and coy painted toes. The new work at Miller finds the artist in a Matissean mood, folding his pin-up iconography into compositions of Cubist semiabstraction and, with a series of large reliefs of sweeping, brightly colored planes, breaking into purely decorative abstraction (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

OLIVE AYHENS, "Bridges," Gary Tatintsian, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 633-0110 (through May 24). It is hard to capture the dizzying dynamism of New York City in painting, but Ms. Ayhens succeeds with her exuberantly expressionistic canvases. She paints overhead views of streets and bridges with reckless confidence, insouciant disregard for ordinary perspective and a fine eye for detail and light. In some cases she creates shotgun weddings of urban and wilderness scenery with environmentalist intentions, but mainly to vertiginous effect (Johnson).

* ATUL DODIYA, "Broken Branches," BosePacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074 (through May 31). The centerpiece of Mr. Dodiya's haunting New York solo debut show is an installation of nine tall glass-fronted wooden cabinets filled with well-worn objects, including old photographs, tools and handmade prosthetic limbs. The cabinets are copies of those found in a museum at Gandhi's birthplace, and the meticulously composed still lifes inside are political and personal portraits of the texture of India itself, a nation rich in social and spiritual resources but crippled by sectarian hatred. The show also includes a series of beautiful large-scale watercolors, which draw connections between India, where Mr. Dodiya lives, and the larger world (Cotter).

RAINER GROSS, "Doppelganger/Contact Paintings," Axel Raben, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 647-9064 (through May 24). This New York-based German artist makes sensuous abstract paintings by a process of his own invention that involves fusing two paintings face to face and then pulling them apart. Exhibited singly or as diptychs, the paintings look like flaking wall sections. They have lush, supersaturated colors and dry, crusty surfaces that look like velvet from a distance (Johnson).

MAIRA KALMAN, "Just Looking," Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410 (through June 14). Ms. Kalman's sweet, sometimes mildly acerbic gouache paintings suggest Alice Neel under the influence of Indian miniature painting. Working on paper with a fine brush and cheerful colors, the prolific children's book illustrator and New Yorker cover artist (co-creator of the "Newyorkistan" map) paints goofy people in parks, portraits of famous designers' dogs and a green plastic pail captioned "Dear Bucket" (Johnson).

"KARAOKE DEATH MACHINE," Daniel Reich, 308 West 21st Street, (917) 408-9097 (through June 2). This is more like a visit to someone's tiny, dark and incredibly cluttered apartment than to a gallery exhibition; actually it is Mr. Reich's tiny, dark and incredibly cluttered apartment-cum-gallery. A stream-of-consciousness salon-style installation of more than 100 small works by more than two dozen artists as well as many images lifted directly from commercial media, the show is uneven, to say the least. But it has a grainy video copy of an early film by Niki de Saint Phalle and an excellent title (Johnson).

JEAN-FRANCOIS MORICEAU AND PETRA MRZYK, "Only for Your Eyes," Marcus Ritter, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7375 (through May 17). This young cartoon-making team generates sight gags with seemingly effortless abandon. Hairy prehistoric people shaving their private parts; anthropomorphic paintings on strike, carrying signs that say, "We want a new curator"; an owl with Mickey Mouse ears; a woman with square breasts; a giant eye with two pupils. More than 100 of these black-ink line drawings, individually framed and stacked up against the wall, will give your sense of humor an invigorating workout (Johnson).

BRUCE MOROZKO, John Elder, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 462-2600 (through May 24). A former designer for Jim Henson Associates and a teacher of monster-making classes in public schools, Mr. Morozko makes whimsical clay sculpture featuring regiments of doglike creatures that march in order, organize in stacks and turn themselves inside out. "Gene Pool" is the touching portrait of a racially mixed nuclear family: a gourd-headed mother, block-headed father and their two rubbery children (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* "THE STAGE OF DRAWING: GESTURE AND ACT," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through May 31). It's not easy to assemble a truly engaging show from a vast collection of drawings like that owned by the Tate in Britain. But this one, selected by a British artist, Avis Newman, with Catherine de Zegher, director of the Drawing Center, really works. Not a tiresome institutional tour but a vividly personal one, it views drawing as "an open-ended and exploratory activity," with exhibits ranging from a 295-foot line on a roll of wrapped paper to precise renderings of 19th-century hairdos. The mix of artists runs from J. M. W. Turner to Andy Warhol; the juxtapositions reveal affinities across centuries and cultures (Glueck).

Brooklyn

ROBERT GRUNDER, Sixtyseven, 67 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-0387 (through May 18). Mr. Grunder's semiabstract paintings of mall stores and parking lots are O.K., but his bird's-eye views of freeways, overpasses and cloverleaf intersections painted on white grounds have a cool dynamism that nicely evokes the speediness of modern life (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "MONTIEN BOONMA: THE TEMPLE OF THE MIND," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through Sunday). The art of the Thai artist Montien Boonma (1953-2000) combines many influences, from Southeast Asian Buddhism to Arte Povera and Joseph Beuys. But his art, by turns witty and somber, is not primarily about hybrid identities; it is about how to forge a life of psychic balance in an unbalanced and unbalancing world. There's nobody like him and nothing in town like this modestly scaled survey show. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

"FRAKTUR TREASURES FROM THE SCHWENKFELDER LIBRARY AND HERITAGE CENTER," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Sunday). Among the more vibrant practitioners of fraktur, the Pennsylvania German art of embellishing letters and documents, were members of a Protestant sect called the Schwenkfelders, still going strong in Pennsylvania, where they migrated in the early 18th century. They brought with them the old-country custom of illuminating documents with decorative writing, drawings, borders, angels, hearts, flowers, birds and more esoteric symbols. The highly stylized work was called fraktur from the broken elements of the lettering. The Schwenkfelders put their all into Geburtscheine (birth certificates), Vorschriften (writing samplers), love letters, marriage certificates, religious texts and house blessings. The work in this show, both religious and secular, is lent by the Schwenkfelder Library in Pennsburg, Pa., which since 1884 has collected more than 1,000 examples of Pennsylvania fraktur and is especially rich in Schwenkfeldiana. Don't let all the cutesy hearts and flowers put you off; there's an innocent exuberance about this work that's captivating. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

JOHN WILLIAM HILL, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through tomorrow). Hill (1812-1879) founded the now little remembered American Pre-Raphaelite movement. He was immune to the medievalism of the English Pre-Raphaelites, but he took to heart John Ruskin's admonition to work from nature. Most of the skillfully made drawings and watercolors here are conventionally picturesque, but two densely worked watercolors of fruits, vegetables and nuts on the ground have an earthy palpability that one imagines Henry David Thoreau would have appreciated (Johnson).

TAKASHI MURAKAMI, Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9889 (through tomorrow). Mr. Murakami, the self-styled Warhol of Japan, has entered into a contract with Louis Vuitton to design handbags and other merchandise and to update the company's logo. Whether you find this appalling or intriguing, paintings rendering the distinctive Vuitton pattern in confectionery colors are visually ravishing, and a video cartoon of a little girl plunging into a Vuitton-patterned dream world is entrancing (Johnson).

LAWSON OYEKAN, "Trial With Light," Garth Clark, 45-46 21st Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 706-2491 (through tomorrow). This London sculptor's upbringing in Nigeria is reflected in impressive six- to seven-foot totem-like works in red clay, which evoke African tribal art and giant African termite mounds. But they are also canny plays on Modernist precedents: the monolithic bulbous forms evoke Minimalism and the perforated, mud-pie construction calls to mind Process Art. All of which makes a compelling mix of the modern, the timeless, the local and the cosmic (Johnson).

"POETRY OF SIGHT: THE PRINTS OF JAMES McNEILL WHISTLER (1834-1903)," New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 (through tomorrow). A salute on the centenary of his death to the painter's brilliance as a printmaker, this show presents more than 130 etchings, drypoints and lithographs that trace Whistler's career from its beginnings in Paris to his last years. A much less showy and theatrical side of Whistler is apparent in this display, which includes the famous sets done in France, London and Venice. Other graphic work, correspondence, photographs and personal documents are also on view in this well-organized presentation. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Glueck).

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Free Air Or Not, Your Tires Need It

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
THE question from my daughter, a new driver, came one cold rainy evening. "Where do I go to get air for my tires?" she asked. I had to confess to that parental rarity: no answer. The gas station I most often used in our New Jersey town had recently removed its air pump. Another pump I knew of was broken.
 Her concern made me realize that it had been a long time since I had checked the air in my own tires. (Or cleaned my gutters, waterproofed my boots, defrosted my refrigerator or any of the other tasks that fall into the same category of tedious responsibility.) Soft tires can lead to flats and accidents, and they reduce fuel economy, but many of us fail to tend to them. An estimated one-third of vehicles on the road have at least one soft tire. 
 It used to be easier to attend to one's pneumatic responsibilities. When attendants routinely wiped windshields and offered to check oil levels, gas stations all had free air pumps.
Now, you may not find a working air pump at all. The modern concept of a gas station is less car-servicing business and more convenience store with gas pump. Air for customers' tires isn't much of a concern.
A study released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in November 2001 showed that while 90 percent of gas stations had air pumps, 10 percent of them didn't work, and of those that did, nearly a third provided inaccurate pressure readings. If you do find one working, you are likely to have to pay to use it.
My daughter and I spent that evening driving around in a cold drizzle looking for a pump. I asked her if she had quarters.
"How much air do you get for a quarter?" she asked.
"Just about enough to fill three tires," I answered, speaking from experience.
"How much for 50 cents?"
"The same."
But in the end we had a stroke of luck. In Clifton, N.J., at the E&A Gulf station, we actually found a free pump.
"The station up the road charges 50 cents for air," I teased the attendant. "Is their air better than your air?"
"Free air is good," he said. "People like free air."
"Free air" -- a slogan once displayed at gas station tire pumps -- symbolized the freedom of the road in the early days of auto travel, when flat tires were almost daily events. Now, using an air pump usually costs a quarter or 50 cents for five minutes.
While air for tires may no longer be free, it's still a bargain. A 20 percent underinflation in a car's tires can increase fuel consumption by 10 percent, according to Bill Egan, a Goodyear engineer. The highway safety agency and the Department of Energy have calculated that underinflated tires increase gas consumption in this country by 3.4 million gallons a day, or 1.24 billion a year. Calculating the cost of gasoline at about $1.60 a gallon, that's nearly $2 billion.
Underinflation also causes flats. The Society of Automotive Engineers has reported that 87 percent of flat tires have a history of underinflation.
And soft tires can also lead to handling problems, especially on trucks and S.U.V.'s. Studies released by the highway safety agency and the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering suggest that about a quarter of cars and a third of S.U.V.'s and light trucks are operating with at least one tire that is 20 percent below ideal pressure.
Basic tire care is simple. Find the suggested pressure numbers inside the door frame or in the owner's manual. (Don't go by the figure stamped on the tire; it is the maximum pressure for the tire itself but may not be right for your particular car.) Then use a gauge to check the tires. The familiar tire gauge, about the size of a fat pen, costs about $5; digital models run to $20 or so. Tires should be checked when cool or at least after a relatively short drive. And don't forget to check the spare.
Few drivers check their tire inflation pressure monthly, as recommended. (The American Rubber Manufacturers Association says the proportion is 11 percent).
After the Firestone tire recall of 2000, Congress passed a law requiring that vehicles have signals on the instrument panel to alert drivers to low tire pressure, but it doesn't take effect until 2006. So far, the systems that might be used to accomplish this remain technically quirky.
For decades, a gas-station air pump was usually an Air Tower, made by the Eco Company, which is now part of OPW, a maker of pumps based in Cincinnati. To use it, you simply turn a dial to the desired inflation pressure number and hold the hose to the tire until the machine chimes three times. "The Air Tower is reliable, field-proven and time-tested," said Gary Specht, customer service manager for OPW, but though the company still makes it, it has fallen out of favor because it is comparatively expensive to build and maintain.
Now, motorists will often encounter pumps made by Air Serv of Mendota Heights, Minn., sometimes combined with vacuum cleaners. Some are free, others take coins. Probably the most common is a model with a retractable hose to guard against vandalism. 
If you miss the old days, you can buy a restored classic pump from Vintage Vending in Salem, N.H., which specializes in restored Coca-Cola machines, gasoline pumps and the like. The company will sell a restored vintage Air Tower for $1,995.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Cabaret, the Champagne of New York

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
On a cold, rainy Friday in April, Feinstein's at the Regency, the 140-seat cabaret in the Regency Hotel that metamorphoses from a corporate breakfast nook in the mornings to a supper club at night, was packed with patrons who had paid a $60 cover charge to attend an extraordinary show that might never be seen again after its two-week run.
 Holding forth at one of two pianos was the composer Michel Legrand. Sitting on a stool nearby was his longtime collaborator, Alan Bergman (half of the Hollywood husband-and-wife lyric-writing team of Alan and Marilyn Bergman). Facing Mr. Legrand on the second piano was the jazz whiz Mike Renzi. Midway through the show, the pop-jazz singer Patti Austin, who had the first hit recording (a duet with James Ingram) of the Legrand-Bergman standard "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?," arrived onstage and opened with another of the team's finest songs, "You Must Believe in Spring." 
 As the musicians whirled through a cavalcade of Legrand-Bergman chestnuts, from "The Windmills of Your Mind" to the high points of the score for "Yentl," they offered a deeply personal retrospective of one of the most extravagantly romantic songwriting legacies of the last three decades. Vocally Mr. Legrand was as exuberant as a teenager, while Mr. Bergman projected a gentle, sagelike wistfulness. Delivering the stentorian ballads from "Yentl," Ms. Austin exuded a perfect mixture of poise and grandeur. All the while Mr. Legrand and Mr. Renzi riffed together on their dual pianos like two jazzy Rachmaninoffs.
The evening's blend of intimacy and musicianship represented the essence of the cabaret experience at its best, and the show was the highlight of a New York nightclub season that has only another month and a half left. (Still to come are Mary Cleere Haran at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel and the Pizzarelli Family at Feinstein's, both top-notch.) Each year, there may be 10 shows of comparable quality in New York's upscale supper clubs.
And such evenings don't come cheap; dinner for two and a show at Feinstein's, at the 100-seat Cafe Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel or at the 85-seat Oak Room can easily cost more than $250. Still, that's not quite as much as the price of a restaurant dinner and two orchestra seats for a hit Broadway musical. And in terms of bang for the buck, a great cabaret performance provides a more transporting emotional experience than a brassy Broadway musical.
This weekend, two premier cabaret acts are appearing at the Cafe Carlyle and the Oak Room. At the Carlyle, Bobby Short, the ebullient 78-year-old singer and pianist who turns every performance into a party, began his 35th spring season on Tuesday, performing with an eight-member jazz band. If Mr. Short's voice has grown noticeably hoarser in recent years, he remains a great entertainer who projects the spirited joie de vivre of a sophisticated cherub, performing a repertory that features the best songs by the likes of Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Andy Razaf, Cy Coleman and Vernon Duke. At the Algonquin, Karen Akers, a statuesque beauty with a rich, buzzing contralto, is performing "Theater Songs," a program of beautifully chosen out-of-the-way gems from Broadway musicals (some of them obscure), with the pianist Don Rebic. In the two decades she has been performing, Ms. Akers has undergone a personal revolution, thawing from a regal, diffident ice princess into an intensely expressive and communicative performer who has found a rare balance between Broadway extroversion and an art singer's refinement. 
Over at Feinstein's, Keely Smith, the 75-year-old singer and widow of Louis Prima, is keeping the flame alive for raucous Las Vegas swing with a tribute to Count Basie, accompanied by a hot nine-piece band that exuberantly mimics the Basie style. With Prima, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin now gone, Ms. Smith, who used to play a deadpan Cher-like foil to her husband's Sonny-like cutup, is the closest we'll get to witnessing first-hand an offhand style of Rat Pack playfulness that has become legendary.
Because the cabaret experience has so much to do with the intimate sharing of emotional experience through song, the older a performer gets, the richer that communication tends to be. Even whenthe voice begins to fail, the seams and cracks can work to a singer's expressive advantage by infusing a song lyric with a more profound sense of time. The cabaret genre is responsible for making popular a raft of modern standards, led by the theater songs of Stephen Sondheim, and the brilliant, cynical jazz commentaries of Dave Frishberg. Now and then, an isolated gem like Francesca Blumenthal's "Lies of Handsome Men" or Jason Robert Brown's "Stars and the Moon" becomes a standard within the genre.
Nobody embodies the agelessness of popular song more evocatively than Blossom Dearie, the pixielike singer and jazz pianist who is performing at Danny's Skylight Room. (The small, sparely appointed cabaret in the back of Danny's Sea Palace, a Thai restaurant on Restaurant Row, is the most discriminating of Manhattan's second-tier cabarets.)
With her pageboy haircut and tart wisp of a voice, Ms. Dearie, who is in her late 70's, finds several layers of wit, wistfulness -- and yes, sex! -- in a repertory that runs from Dave Frishberg to Antonio Carlos Jobim. (Her dreamy rendition of Jobim's "Wave," on her recent album, "Blossom's Planet," is definitive.)

'You Do It for Love'
The term "fabulous invalid," which has regularly been affixed to the theater, might more aptly be applied to cabaret, since its economic survival is always in question. A series of interviews with booking agents and club owners suggest that business is down overall about 10 percent in New York City since 9/11 in a field where profits are marginal at best. Or as one club owner put it: "Nobody makes money in the nightclub business. You do it for love." Whether the top-of-the-line cabarets associated with hotels make money is a matter of debate. But the nightclubs' name value and the prestige (and the hotel business they might attract) are ultimately incalculable.
In the last year, three Manhattan cabarets have closed. Arci's Place, the popular and well-run supper club at Park Avenue South and 31st Street, where Christine Ebersole brought a brilliant act that rivaled the glory days of Bette Midler in fun and musicality, closed after a real estate dispute and has been looking for a new home. Judy's, a lower-echelon showcase club in Chelsea, also closed, as did a short-lived upstairs supper club atop the Firebird restaurant on Restaurant Row.

A Surge of Youth
Although the cabaret field has the image of a high-class retreat for fading older performers, young blood is stirring up the field. Peter Cincotti, the gifted singer, pianist and songwriter whose debut album recently supplanted albums by Diana Krall and Tony Bennett and K. D. Lang on Billboard's chart of best-selling jazz albums, is a 19-year-old student at Columbia College who can play like Fats Waller and Erroll Garner and sing like the young Jack Jones. The rapid rise of this earnest and meticulous performer follows that of Ms. Krall, now a platinum-selling artist, who made several appearances at the Oak Room, and of the charismatic New Orleans singer and pianist Harry Connick Jr., whose blazing ascent into all-around show business stardom took him briefly through the Oak Room.
Michael Feinstein, part owner of Feinstein's at the Regency and its new sister club, Feinstein's at the Cinegrill in Los Angeles, was only 29 when he made his New York debut at the Oak Room in the mid-1980's. Since then, he has become a major concert and nightclub attraction who sells out his annual engagements at the Regency. Along with Mr. Short, Barbara Cook (who has graduated to concerts) and a few others, he is one of aselect group of cabaret performers who make serious money performing popular standards.

Breaking Through
For most of the second-level performers, the cabaret life is a grueling struggle with modest expectations. One of the few who have broken through is Ann Hampton Callaway, the honey-voiced singer who appeared on Broadway in "Swing" and moved increasingly from pop standards into jazz. A skillful songwriter, who made her name in piano bars improvising songs from audience suggestions, Ms. Callaway is performing at the Kaplan Penthouse tonight and tomorrow as part of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series. Another is KT Sullivan, a comic raconteur with operatic training, who is appearing at the Neue Galerie on the Upper East Side.
Both women have played the Oak Room, which has also boosted the career of Stacy Kent, a young, lemony-voiced American-born jazz singer and Sarah Lawrence College graduate who built a following in England before tackling the United States. To hear her tangy duets with her husband and musical partner, the saxophonist Jim Tomlinson, is to hear echoes of interplay between Billie Holiday and Lester Young, or Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz, but with a delicious dash of screwball humor thrown in.
Jane Monheit, a plummy-voiced pop-jazz singer in her early 20's, has also established a successful career bouncing between jazz clubs like the Blue Note and cabarets like the Oak Room and the Cafe Carlyle. If Ms. Monheit has little to say onstage, she has a ravishing voice to match her sultry, sensual air and has built a solid following. For unalloyed lyricism, her versions of "Some Other Time" and "Haunted Heart" on her newest album, "In the Sun" (N-Coded Music), are hard to beat.
Another talented young contender is the Canadian singer Michael Buble, the protege of the pop producer David Foster, who nurtured the career of Josh Groban. "Michael Buble" (143 Records/Reprise), the debut album of the singer, who recently played the Cinegrill in Los Angeles and is soon to open at the Blue Note in New York, is benefiting from a major record label push. Like many younger cabaret singers, he freely mixes rock-era songs with pre-rock standards, and the material runs from "The Way You Look Tonight" to the Bee Gees ("How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?") to Queen's rockabilly knockoff, "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," to the old Dean Martin hit "Sway," which coincidentally appears on Mr. Cincotti's record.

Mixing the Categories
No one has given traditional pop music a bigger shot in the arm lately than Norah Jones, the genre-bending young singer, pianist and songwriter whose six million-selling album, "Come Away With Me" (Blue Note), recently won her several Grammys. Ms. Jones didn't ascend through more staid uptown clubs but first gained a local following downtown at the Living Room. She later played Makor on the Upper West Side and Joe's Pub in the East Village.
Like most of the younger singers, Ms. Jones doesn't draw the kinds of stylistic and temporal distinctions -- between soft-rock and Tin Pan Alley, between country, pop and rock -- that the older generation of singers has done. Her shows freely mix material by Willie Nelson and Hank Williams with traditional standards like "The Nearness of You" and originals like "Come Away With Me," the sweetly sexy and uncategorizable title cut of her album.
Her success and the surprise success of Rod Stewart's "It Had to Be You" (J Records), a mediocre album of standards, all done in variations of the same loping tempo, are cited by champions of traditional pop as evidence that a widespread hunger for that music exists. But since mass-market radio, which is still the engine behind record company promotion, for the most part turns a deaf ear to traditional pop, most of the best of that music goes undiscovered. Satellite radio and adult-alternative formats, however, have begun making some tentative inroads into the top-40 mentality. 

The Downtown Experience
The cabaret world below the upscale supper clubs tends to divide into two branches. There are thriving clubs, like Don't Tell Mama on Restaurant Row, that rely on a high turnover of showcase acts (many with Broadway stars in their eyes) who are expected to fill the room with friends and supporters. In Greenwich Village, the Duplex Cabaret Theater is experiencing a renewal by booking acts like the lusty pop-rock belter Baby Jane Dexter, who is appearing Saturdays in an open-ended run. Nearby is the venerable piano bar and showcase club, Rose's Turn, a Village institution.
But the future Norah Joneses are more likely to come from a downtown axis of clubs whose performers gleefully fuzz the boundaries between old and new, and between pop, rock, jazz, rhythm-and-blues, swing, country, world music and performance art. At the nexus of the scene is Joe's Pub, the thriving satellite of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, where more than 700 acts appear each year, seven nights a week. Most perform there without the kind of weekly guarantees that uptown supper clubs provide.
The talent is not limited to unknowns. The stars who appear where the prices are reasonable and the hipness quotient high include Ute Lemper, Richard Thompson, Sandra Bernhard, Audra McDonald, Jimmy Scott and Maria Muldaur.
The downtown circuit, which has few points of intersection with the more theater-oriented clubs, now draws record company talent scouts. The clubs include the Living Room on the Lower East Side, the Cutting Room in the Flatiron district, the Slipper Room on the Lower East Side, Fez in the East Village, the Starlight Bar and Lounge on the Lower East Side and, in Brooklyn, the BAM Cafe in Fort Greene and Pete's Candy Store in Williamsburg.
A sampling of the downtown performers who have amassed followings includes David Driver (who performs the Scott Walker songbook with the Loser's Lounge Band), Raul Midon (a rhythm-and-blues singer-songwriter and virtuoso guitarist), Julian Fleisher (offbeat swing versions of vintage pop, rock and soul hits as well as original songs), Morley (earthy, cosmopolitan soul with a spiritual bent), and the singer-songwriters Gavin DeGraw, Jen Chapin and Rebecca Martin.
For these young performers, the pantheon of songwriting giants doesn't end at Rodgers and Hammerstein or Stephen Sondheim, but extends through Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen (whose song "Hallelujah" has become a kind of downtown equivalent to "As Time Goes By"), Marvin Gaye, Billy Joel, Randy Newman, Stevie Wonder and Tom Waits.

Selling the Genre
The cabaret field has no more ardent promoter than Donald Smith, the executive director of the Mabel Mercer Foundation, which each fall produces the Cabaret Convention, an annual convocation of performers (both well-known and obscure) that began at Town Hall in 1989, with marathon showcases that are usually sold out. In recent years, Mr. Smith has extended the convention to Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Palm Springs, and in mid-July he will bring 36 performers to the John Drew Theater at Guild Hall in East Hampton, N.Y., for three nights.
Mr. Smith's tastes run toward traditional, elegant cabaret that puts a premium on smart patter and canny theatrical presentation and reveres the ghosts of Noel Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Cole Porter and, above all, Mabel Mercer, who more or less invented the intimate cabaret style known as parlando and who died in 1984.
In his promotional efforts for the genre, Mr. Smith has traveled all over the United States. He reports that almost every major city has a club that presents some form of cabaret, although the distinctions between jazz and cabaret frequently blur. Besides Feinstein's at the Cinegrill in Los Angeles, some of the more notable are Davenport's in Chicago, Scullers Jazz Club in Boston, Blues Alley in Washington, Odette's in New Hope, Pa., the Royal Room in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Manor in West Orange, N.J.
But despite some occasional crossover, there is an enormous communications gap between the exclusive, rarefied, uptown concept of cabaret, for which Mr. Smith carries the torch, and the more open-ended, populist downtown scene exemplified by Joe's Pub. The sooner these worlds can reconcile and begin a conversation, the healthier the fragile cabaret field is likely to become.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.

Opera

"THE MERRY WIDOW," Bronx Opera. For some 35 years, the Bronx Opera has been a people's company, giving chances to talented younger singers and presenting affordable productions in English translation in a commodious auditorium, the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College in the Bronx. This weekend the company presents a new production of Lehar's elegant operetta "The Merry Widow," conducted by the artistic director and founder, Michael Spierman, though an assistant conductor, Eric Kramer, will preside over tonight's performance. The production is directed by Ben Spierman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Lovinger Theater, Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833. Tickets: $15-$30. (Anthony Tommasini)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC. With its view of the Manhattan skyline and its live, intimate acoustics, this barge floating on the East River is one of the finest places in the city to hear chamber music. Tonight and Sunday, Mark Peskanov, violinist, and Steven Beck, pianist, play three sonatas by Bach (BWV 1017-19) and works by Gyorgy Kurtag. Tomorrow, Andrew Armstrong, pianist, plays Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" and joins Mr. Peskanov and Edward Arron, a cellist, in Tchaikovsky's A-minor Trio. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday afternoon at 4. Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; $20 for students (James R. Oestreich).

BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC. Whether or not these two New York premieres are the food of love, they are definitely inspired by Shakespeare. George Benjamin's "Sometime Voices" is based on one of Caliban's speeches from "The Tempest," and Hans Werner Henze's Symphony No. 8 draws from "A Midsummer Night's Dream." In keeping with the theme, a performance of Act III from Verdi's "Falstaff" will follow. The fiery music director Robert Spano leads the orchestra, soloists and the Canticum Novum Singers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $55 (Jeremy Eichler).

FREDERIC CHIU. In a rather absurd historical coincidence, Prokofiev and Stalin died on the same day in 1953 (March 5). That makes this an anniversary year for the composer (not to mention his tormentor), and the pianist Frederic Chiu observes the occasion with a discussion and performance of Prokofiev's monumental wartime Sonata No. 8, completing a three-part series that included No. 6 and No. 7. Tonight at 7, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $30; $15 for students (Eichler).

DESSOFF CHOIRS. In a program called "Musica de Nueva Espana," this well-trained choir turns its attention to the Spanish musical influence in the New World. Included are Renaissance and Baroque sacred settings from Latin America, as well as works by more recent composers, among them Alberto Ginastera. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 831-8224. Tickets: $35 to $50 (Allan Kozinn).

ELYSIUM. This chamber ensemble, led by the wonderful violinist Eriko Sato, includes members of the New York Philharmonic, Qiang Tu, a cellist, and L. William Kuyper, a horn player. David Oei is the guest pianist. The program offers works of Telemann, Schubert and Mendelssohn. Sunday night at 8:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $35; $15 for students and 62+ (Oestreich).

MET ORCHESTRA. James Levine and the Met Orchestra, having commemorated Berlioz's bicentenary at home with "Les Troyens" (and looking forward to "Benvenuto Cellini" next season), continue the festivities nearby with two Berlioz programs. Or rather one and a half, since each program is anchored by the "Symphonie Fantastique." In the first, Olga Borodina sings "Le Mort de Cleopatre"; in the second, Michael Ouzounian is the viola soloist in "Harold in Italy." Tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: tonight, $39 to $177; Sunday, $39 to $152 (Oestreich).

EDGAR MEYER. For the second of its concerts intended to bring top-notch music to the people of New York free, the new, nonprofit "Free for All at Town Hall" has turned to Edgar Meyer, the eclectic double-bass soloist (now there's a term you seldom hear) who won a MacArthur "genius grant" last year for his distinctive music. This concert shows Mr. Meyer in his characteristic range, from Vivaldi to Schubert to a number of his own compositions (including "The Great Green Sea Snake"). Amy Dorfman, a longtime collaborator of the bassist, is the accompanist. Sunday afternoon at 5, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787. Free; tickets are required, and are available at the box office on the day of the performance (Anne Midgette).

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Kurt Masur conducts, concluding a three-week stint with the orchestra, his first return as music director emeritus. The program is vintage Masur: Brahms's First Symphony and Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto, with Nicholas Angelich as pianist (replacing Maurizio Pollini, who canceled because of back problems). Mr. Angelich, a young American, makes his Philharmonic debut. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $34 to $108 (Oestreich).

MURRAY PERAHIA. The pianist Murray Perahia seems at his artistic peak. His only shortcoming is that he has mostly hewed to the standard Classical and Romantic era repertory and avoided exploring the contemporary music. Living composers would surely line up to write for him, if he were interested. But all the works he will play on Sunday's recital at Carnegie Hall are ideally suited to his intelligence, temperament and exquisite pianism: Bach's Partita No. 4; Beethoven's late Piano Sonata, Op. 101, and Schubert's late Piano Sonata in A. Sunday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $37-$94. (Tommasini)

ST. LAWRENCE QUARTET. This Canadian group, widely regarded as the best of the younger generation of string quartets, has given some incendiary readings of Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich in New York in recent seasons, but this weekend it is playing two concerts devoted mostly to new music. Tonight at Weill Recital Hall, the group is playing Osvaldo Golijov's haunting "Yiddishbbuk," written for the St. Lawrence when both Mr. Golijov and the quartet were in residence at Tanglewood. Also at Tanglewood that summer was the Ying Quartet, another fine group that established a fast friendship with the St. Lawrence players. Two of the Yings -- Phillip Ying, the violist, and David Ying, the cellist -- are to join the St. Lawrence in Schoenberg's "Verklarte Nacht." Also on the program is Mozart's Viola Quintet in G minor (K. 516). On Sunday the St. Lawrence gets up early to play John Adams's "John's Book of Alleged Dances" and the String Quartet No. 2 by Christopher Hatzis, a Canadian composer, at Lincoln Center. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $42. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $18 (Kozinn)

ANDRE WATTS. As part of the Great Performers series, this prominent American pianist returns to Lincoln Center for a solo recital of bread-and-butter repertory: Schubert's Klavierstuck No. 1 (D. 946), his Sonata in A minor (D. 784) and his "Wanderer" Fantasy; three Chopin etudes, Debussy's "Estampes" and selections from Ravel's charming "Miroirs." Sunday afternoon at 3. Avery Fisher Hall, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $50 (Eichler).

Dance

ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER. Ailey will be celebrated in a program of excerpts and his full "Revelations" (tonight and tomorrow afternoon).

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. The company will present "La Bayadere" -- to some the quintessential experience of classical ballet -- in this opening weekend of its eight-week spring season. To start there is the exquisitely beautiful "Kingdom of the Shades" act, in which the faltering hero gets stoned and imagines that he is dancing with the dead lover he has justbetrayed. The dancers performing the lead roles of Nikiya, Solor, Gamzatti and the Bronze Idol are Julie Kent, Ethan Stiefel, Irina Dvorovenko and Herman Cornejo (tonight); Nina Ananiashvili, Julio Bocca, Gillian Murphy and Carlos Lopez (tomorrow afternoon); and Alina Cojocaru, Angel Corella, Stella Abrera and Joaquin De Luz (tomorrow night).

Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $40 (Dunning).

BOOGIE DOWN DANCE SERIES 2003 AT BAAD!: ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER. Mr. Aviles and his dancers will present a program of short solo works and a duet called "The Naked Bald Man and the Goddess" that draw on social or club dancing as well as modern dance to explore, as Mr. Aviles puts it, "hope in the eye of dumbfounded chaos." Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD!), 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, (718) 842-5223. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).

Tonight (and next Tuesday and Friday) at 8; tomorrow (and next Saturday) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 2 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 7 p.m. Wang Theater, 270 Tremont Street, Boston, (800) 447-7400.

Tomorrow night at 8. Cobi's Place, 158 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (516) 922-2010. Tickets: $20 (Dunning).

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11. Tickets: $20 in advance; $25 at the door (Dunning).

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30. Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 633-7202. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).

"KALPANA." This rarely seen film by Uday Shankar has quite an underground cult following. The director Satyajit Ray saw it at least 16 times, praising it for its original use of montage and framing. Shot over 90 days with dancers who had never been filmed, the 1948 film depicts India when the era of the Raj was giving way to independence. The film will be introduced by Dr. Sunil Kothari, a leading Indian dance scholar, who will participate in discussions after the screenings tomorrow and Sunday. Tomorrow night at 8; Sunday and Monday at 1 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-3809. Tickets: $9.50; $7 for students (Dunning).

KEIGWIN KABARET. Larry Keigwin is one of the blithest spirits in New York dance, as well as a dynamic performer and a choreographer with a fully functioning imagination, heart and brain. For this event he has gathered guest choreographers (Charlotte Griffin and Kara Tatelbaum), dancers and downtown stars like Julie Atlas Muz, the postmodernist stripper; Jonathan Nosan, known for his sexy contortion act; and Bradford Scobie, a ukelele player. Sunday night at 7. Joe's Pub, at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).

KINDING SINDAW. This New York-based Philippine dance and martial arts group will present "Lemlunay," a dramatic adaptation of a sacred epic of the same name from the T'boli people of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Thursdays through Saturdays through May 17) at 7:30; Sunday and May 18 at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $20 (Dunning).

LATINO AMERICAN DANCE: NOT FESTIVAL PROJECT.

HEADLINE: Toyota Profit for Last Year Sets Recordfor Automakers 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 8 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation reported strong gains in profits for 2002 and one of the largest net income figures in the automotive industry's history today, mainly because of strong demand in the United States. But the company said its three-year run of strong profit growth is in jeopardy in the current year because of sluggish economic growth around the world.
 Toyota joined Honda Motor, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors in reaching new financial peaks in the latest fiscal year, which ended March 31. Toyota has been able to outsell its American rivals without relying nearly as heavily as they do on cash incentives to draw buyers. And the higher fuel prices and uncertain economy in the United States have tended to favor Toyota and the other Japanese makers, because their cars are more fuel-efficient and are seen as more reasonably priced. 
 These advantages, along with a one-time gain from the sale of pension assets, helped Toyota record 945 billion yen ($8.1 billion) in net income for the latest fiscal year, a gain of 53.4 percent from the prior year. None of the Big Three American car manufacturers have ever reported so large a profit. Ford Motor came closest in 1997, with $6.9 billion.
Operating profits, which more closely reflect Toyota's ability to sell cars, rose 27 percent, to 1.4 trillion yen ($12 billion), in the latest period; sales increased 6.3 percent, to 16.1 trillion yen. The figures were at the lower end of most analysts' expectations.
Though Toyota executives said they were encouraged by the company's strong showing in the United States in the the first four months of the 2003 calendar year, they were guarded about prospects for the months to come. Worldwide, the company expects car sales to grow by less than 1 percent in 2003, they said, and Toyota may be able to increase operating profits only if the yen weakens against the dollar.
"It is very hard to predict where the foreign exchange market is going," said Ryuji Araki, a Toyota executive vice president. Still, Mr. Araki said, the strong reception for new Corolla and Highlander models in the United States means that Toyota may sell more than two million cars in North America this year.
Toyota is stepping up production in the United States to further insulate it from the vagaries of exchange rates, to reduce inventories and to shorten delivery times to dealers. It plans to build a factory in San Antonio that will make Tundra trucks, starting in 2006. And a new version of the Prius electric-gas hybrid car is due this fall.
Toyota is also devoting attention to Japan, where it controls 42.3 percent of the market. The company sold about the same number of cars in the latest fiscal year as in the year before, but revenue from those sales grew 6.9 percent. The Toyota Wish minivan was the best-selling vehicle in Japan in April, the first time a minivan topped the list. The Corolla was second, outpacing compact cars from Honda and Nissan. In all, 6 of the top 10 were Toyotas.
The company also plans to combine some of its dealerships in Japan and to introduce Lexus, its luxury brand, to its home market. Last month, Toyota announced plans to speed up decision making in the company by cutting the size of its board in half and, for the first time, appointing non-Japanese directors.
Ultimately, though, Toyota and other Japanese carmakers make the bulk of their money in the United States. Toyota's lineup remains popular there, but the average age of its buyers is rising. To keep its brands fresh and sales growing, Toyota, Honda and Nissan each must come up with models that can attract younger Americans, as Volkswagen and Hyundai have done.
"The Gordian knot for Toyota is that its cars are so popular with baby boomers that it turns off the Gen X crowd," said Chris Richter, an auto analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. "If you can't change with the new generation, your customers will eventually get old and die."

HEADLINE: Fed Is Startingto Fret Over Falling Prices 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
In deciding this week to keep short-term interest rates at 1.25 percent, the Federal Reserve Board warned of "an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation." The topic also came up at its March meeting, according to minutes released yesterday. Economists have been talking about the dangers of falling prices for several months, but why did the Fed take note now? 
 First of all, some experts believe that the risk of deflation has increased of late. Commodity prices have been dropping for years, but now energy prices, after a spike leading up to the war in Iraq, have also slipped. 
 Most important, however, is the absence of an engine to drive the economy forward. With weak demand, prices could begin to fall in widespread fashion. 
Ethan S. Harris, the chief economist of Lehman Brothers, puts the chance of broad deflation in the near future at about 25 percent. "You need weak economic activity for one and a half or two years" for deflation to occur, he said. "You never get the boom that's going to heal the economy."
Another concern is that the Fed is running out of leverage against deflation. 
Though it took no action on Tuesday, several Wall Street banks expect it to cut short-term interest rates to 0.75 percent before July. As short-term rates edge closer to zero, expanding the money supply -- the method the Fed uses for lowering rates -- might have little effect on the ease of obtaining credit. Interest rates could not fall below zero, after all. Economists call this state of affairs a liquidity trap.
"It's right for the Fed to be concerned about it and talking about it," said Laurence M. Ball, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. "The key thing to look at is not any particular price level, but the interest rate. When it hits zero, then you're in trouble."
Professor Ball did not predict that interest rates would fall to zero, but he warned that an unexpected shock to the economy could be more damaging with rates so low."When you're walking along the side of a cliff, the closer you are to it, the more dangerous it is," he said. "There's no particular chance you're going to fall off it, but there's always the chance you'll get jostled."
Falling prices might not sound like such a bad thing, at least from a consumer's point of view. Moreover, deflation can be a side effect of a healthy economic development, like the surges in efficiency that have steadily lowered the prices of personal computers. 
But what the Fed is worried about now, the experts said, is deflation arising as a symptom of the economy's frailty. And falling prices could cause some real problems by themselves.
For example, rapid deflation can cause a huge redistribution of income and wealth from debtors to creditors, said Willem H. Buiter, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.
When prices are expected to fall, interest rates tend to fall, too. If prices are lower tomorrow than they are today, a dollar will be worth more tomorrow in terms of what it can buy. And the more borrowers think that prices will fall in the future, the less they will be willing to pay in interest on loans. Similarly, existing loans with fixed interest rates become more valuable to lenders -- and more onerous to borrowers -- as prices fall.
"That kind of redistribution is often very painful because it causes all sort of distress," Mr. Buiter said, like corporate insolvencies and defaults by banks.
Deflation can also cause problems for companies with fairly inflexible costs of doing business, Mr. Harris said. "The auto industry has a pretty rigid cost structure, and obviously they'd like to see some inflation in the economy," he said. "Instead, what they're getting is they have to keep cutting the prices of their vehicles."
Mr. Harris also said expectations for deflation -- if not brought on by a "productivity revolution" that makes the economy much more efficient -- could themselves perpetuate economic weakness. If people think prices will fall in the future, they will postpone purchases. After two years of weakness, he said, "we already have a little element of the deflation psychology in the economy."
Some economists have also argued that falling prices for goods and services could lead to falling wages -- something workers might find intolerable. But Professor Ball said there was little evidence to support that idea. "There has actually been a number of studies in the past few years looking at wages, and finding that wages do fall in certain circumstances and there doesn't seem to be such a taboo about it."
The consequences of deflation are on display, of course, in Japan which has experienced deflation for the last three years after a decade of economic weakness. Japan's troubles began in 1990 when a huge crash in prices of real estate and securities suddenly depressed the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend. In the midst of deflation, short-term interest rates eventually fell to zero, largely handcuffing the central bank.
Well aware of Japan's striking example, the Fed's governors have been barnstorming the country in recent months to assure the public that, even with low interest rates, they still have tools to fight deflation. In a speech in December, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the Fed could buy Treasury bonds with long maturities to drive down long-term interest rates. In January, a Fed governor, Edward M. Gramlich, said that with interest rates at zero, a rapid expansion in the money supply might still be enough to stop deflation. 
But some economists have remained skeptical.
"It's probably a good thing for them to say, 'Oh, don't worry, we have a lot of tools to deal with it,' " Professor Ball said. "That bolsters confidence, and is maybe good for the economy. Having said that, I'm not sure it's true that they have lots of tools. If there were any really obvious tools that the central banks could use to get you right out of a liquidity trap, Japan would have done it."
In fact, both Mr. Buiter and Professor Ball argued that in situations like Japan's, central banks should make way for the lawmakers who control taxes and spending.
"It is always both technically and politically dead easy to stop deflation and get rid of it, if you don't want it," Mr. Buiter said. "It is not necessary for these things to persist. The government should immediately prime the pump and send the checks to all deserving and undeserving Americans."
Professor Ball agreed. "The textbook solution to a liquidity trap is a fiscal expansion, and there's every reason to think that would work." In a situation of low demand and deflation, he said, "before too long, enough political pressure would build up for a big fiscal expansion."
Unfortunately for Japan, this escape plan was hard to carry out. Japan's overwhelming debt burden limited the government's ability to cut taxes or spend money. And its problems ran deeper than weak demand and deflation.
"Deflation is kind of the icing on the cake," Mr. Harris said. "The big problem in Japan is the big failure to deal with the problems in the banking system. No stimulative policy is going to work if your financial system isn't functioning -- if the process of getting funds from savers to borrowers breaks down."
The United States, the experts said, is not mired in similar straits. The financial system is healthy, and, Mr. Buiter pointed out, the boom and bust in asset markets was far smaller in the United States than in Japan.
"Real estate and house prices never went on the kind of walkabout that they did in Japan," he said. "There is no parallel between what Japan has been going through for the last 10 years- plus now and what lies in store for the United States."
Professor Ball added that the government here had more latitude to fight deflation in the event of a liquidity trap. "Even though our long-term fiscal situation is not great, it's not as bad as Japan's," he said.
On that point, however, Mr. Harris was not equally sanguine. "When you get into a deflation environment and you're trying to get the economy going, there aren't any really easy solutions," he said. "Usually when you get to deflation, you already have a significant budget deficit. That's in fact true for the U.S."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Exceed 400,000 for a 12thWeek 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Applications for initial unemployment benefits exceeded 400,000 for a 12th consecutive week, the Labor Department said today, the longest stretch since the economy was emerging from a recession in 1992.
 Jobless claims dropped to 425,000 last week from 453,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. 
Some economists consider claims above 400,000 a sign of slack demand for workers. 
 Companies are trimming payrolls to shore up profits after the weakest three months of consumer spending in a decade.
"These persistently high claims pose a significant threat to the prospects of a second-half upturn since weak job conditions make consumers more cautious about spending," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. Claims reached a 13-month high of 459,000 in the week that ended April 19.
Federal Reserve policy makers kept the benchmark interest rate at the lowest since 1961 earlier this week and said they expected growth to pick up later this year.
Economists had estimated that claims last week would fall to 440,000 from the initially reported 448,000 a week earlier, based on the median of 35 forecasts. The less-volatile four-week moving average of claims rose 3,250, to 446,000, the highest since mid-April last year.
The number of people continuing to collect state unemployment benefits rose to 3.665 million in the week that ended April 26. That was the highest in six months.
"What is worrying is that continuing claims continue to rise," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York. "It confirms that the jobless are having a lot of trouble finding jobs. The bottom line is there is no improvement yet" in the job market.

HEADLINE: Fed's Views on Prices in March 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHI NGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee was already mulling the possibility of disinflation at its March meeting, well before its acknowledgment this week that a slowing in price rises was a possibility, minutes released today showed.
 "Inflation would likely remain subdued," the minutes of the March 18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee said. "Indeed, members saw further disinflation in core prices as a distinct possibility over the next several quarters." 
 The committee at its most recent meeting on Tuesday had noted the possibility of an "unwelcome substantial fall in inflation," although it also said the probability of that was "minor."
The summary of the March minutes, released with a seven-week delay, showed that the issue was already on the minds of policy makers before Tuesday and might cause further discussion about deflation. Deflation is an outright fall in prices usually accompanied by a severe slump in economic activity.
The committee refrained from changing interest rates at the March meeting, even as some of its members worried that the uncertainty of the Iraq war and a slowing economy were taking their toll.
"While the economic expansion had displayed signs of faltering in recent weeks, the reasons for, and hence the duration of any period of weakness, could not be reliably ascertained," the minutes said.
Such doubts led the committee to abandon its usual statement about whether the risks to the economy were balanced evenly or leaning toward weakness or inflation.
"Most members believed that the major uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation made it impossible to assign reasonable probabilities to plausible alternative economic outcomes and that any effort to do so would provide a misleading impression of the committee's confidence and knowledge about the economic outlook," the minutes said.
The F.O.M.C. also held rates steady at Tuesday's meeting.

HEADLINE: France Seeks Pension Reform, Confronting Unions 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 8 

 BODY:
France's social safety net is less safe than ever these days.
 By far the most explosive domestic issue in the country is reform of the expensive and generous pension system, a "pay-as-you-go" setup in which today's workers pay for the retirement of the previous generation. 
 But confronted with the demographic reality of retirees who are living longer and the prospect of waves of baby-boom retirees, the center-right government has decided to confront the unions and try to push through painful reforms in the public sector by the summer.
Full-page ads in the country's major newspapers on Wednesday carried an unusual, emotional open letter by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin to working men and women. "Conceived more than 50 years ago, our retirement system no longer corresponds to the current and future demographic reality," he wrote. 
The statistics are daunting. Mr. Raffarin said that in 1960, four workers financed each pensioner, compared with two in 2000 and one by 2020. The burden on each worker has therefore grown. Unless there are radical changes, he added, pensions will shrink by 50 percent in 20 years and the entire retirement system "will be doomed."
Later on Wednesday, President Jacques Chirac presented a draft reform plan to the cabinet. It will be presented in a final form later this month and then sent to the National Assembly for debate in June.
Under the plan, France aims to bring public sector workers -- more than one-fourth of the French work force -- in line with the private sector by 2008. That would force public sector workers to contribute to the state pension system for 40 years, up from 37-and-a-half years now.
By 2020, the payment period would be increased to 42 years. Government support for early retirement, a clever way to hide unemployment, will be phased out. Tax incentives will be introduced to attract workers to company-based savings programs like those in the United States, and workers will be allowed to get a pension "bonus" if they work beyond 40 years.
Currently, public sector workers like elementary school teachers, nurses and policemen are allowed to retire at full pension at 55; some civil servants can even retire at 50.
UNSA, a large civil servants' union, estimates that the government's reform plan will lower pension levels by between 30 and 50 percent in the public sector.
"This isn't reform of the pension system -- it's the destruction," said a recent UNSA statement. Herve Baro, secretary general of the union, said in Friday's issue of Le Monde that the government did not "properly measure the damaging side effects of its project," adding, "Our determination to act is stronger than ever."
The unions are particularly concerned about their workers' losing some of the hidden benefits they enjoy under the current system. Bonuses are added into final salary calculations, which add, for example, 19 percent to police pensions. Government employees who work overseas receive a 35 percent bonus on the basic pension benefit.
Early retirement programs make it easier for many civil servants, particularly women with children, to retire after 15 years of paying into their pension funds.
Some commentators have said the reform package does not go far enough. "If 25 years after Britain, 15 years after Italy and 10 years after Spain, France finally started to cut back the public sphere, it would be a revolution," wrote Alexis Brezet on Tuesday in the center-right daily Le Figaro. 
Last night, Mr. Raffarin pled his case on national television, saying he was willing to listen to constructive criticism but would not tolerate any effort to thwart his overall plan.
"I work with all those who want to improve our reform in order to save the pension system," he said in an interview with France 2 television. "But those who want to block things should not count on me for any tender feelings. I will carry out this reform because it's in the country's interest."
He underscored that populism would not win out. "Let's be clear," he said. "Parliament must decide. The street should express itself, but it's not the street that governs."
The "street" in essence means the unions, which have a long history of mobilizing the working masses against pension reform and have scheduled a national strike for May 13. A demonstration in Paris is planned two weeks later. Last month, a strike over the proposed changes crippled rail and air traffic.
Mr. Raffarin has a large majority in the National Assembly and can push through just about any reform bill he wants. But the great fear of the government is a repetition of the devastating strikes over pension reform in 1995, which so damaged the government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe that it lost a general election two years later.
France is also under fierce pressure to meet European Union targets on budget deficits. On Wednesday, France was ordered by the union to either cut taxes or reduce spending to resolve the deficit problem by October. The government has announced that it will freeze spending next year in an effort to reduce its deficit of 3.6 percent and bring it into conformity with the European Union limit of 3 percent.
"The government would be wrong to believe that just because it is not politically in any danger it is protected from a large-scale social movement on pensions," Bernard Thibault, secretary general of the giant union C.G.T., said in Le Monde Thursday, referring to the prospect of public protests 
The Socialist Party said in a statement today that it was Mr. Raffarin who was guilty of "a test of strength and of obstructionism of which he accuses all opponents of his reform." His goal, the statement said, is for workers to "work more and in fact to earn less."
The Communist Party today called for workers to "do everything to thwart" what it described as this "regressive plan."
The pension crisis is not unique to France. A World Bank report issued today concluded that most nations in Europe must urgently change their pension systems or face a sharp decline in the living standards of their retirees.
The report also said that in most European countries, the pension system fails to take into account rising divorce rates and growing numbers of female workers as well as the increase in part-time and self-employed workers.

HEADLINE: Citing SARS, Northwest Invokes Clause to Allow Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines, citing a decline in Asian traffic because of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, has invoked an emergency clause in its labor contracts that allows it to lay off employees without notice.
 The action is the first by an airline to invoke the clause, called force majeure, in response to the illness, known as SARS. Airlines around the world have experienced double-digit declines in traffic to Asia, where Northwest and United Airlines are the two major American carriers. 
 Officials of the union representing Northwest's mechanics, which was informed of the move in a letter from Northwest on Tuesday, said yesterday that the airline was exaggerating the impact of SARS as part of its campaign to win $1 billion in wage and benefit concessions from its unionized workers. 
"What if we come back and say, 'No way, we're not giving concessions to Northwest again?' " said James Atkinson, president of the union, Local 33 of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. "If that happens, here's their answer: 'We're invoking force majeure and taking out another 1,000 technicians.' "
It was the third time in 18 months that Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has invoked force majeure. It took that step after the September 2001 attacks and again in March, citing the war in Iraq, when it was the only airline in the United States to invoke the clause.
Mary Stanik, a spokeswoman for the airline, said Northwest did not plan any immediate layoffs. 
On Tuesday, Northwest said that its traffic on flights to the Pacific dropped 25 percent in April from year-ago levels, measured by available seat miles. Its load factor to the Pacific, reflecting the number of paying passengers on its flights, was 63 percent, down 10 percentage points from a year ago. 
Northwest is the largest United States carrier to Japan, where Tokyo is it main hub for flights to the rest of Asia, including Hong Kong, where SARS is a concern. Northwest does not serve Hong Kong directly from the United States. 
At United, Pacific traffic fell 19.7 percent in April, compared with a year ago. Its load factor on Pacific flights was 50.9 percent.
Despite that, United does not plan to invoke force majeure, said Rich Nelson, a spokesman for the airline. Two months ago, in anticipation of the war in Iraq, United applied a less-sweeping policy that allowed it to furlough workers at all levels of the company for brief periods without pay. That policy remains in effect, but United does not see a need to invoke the broader force majeure clause either because of the war or SARS, Mr. Nelson said.
Northwest and its unions have tangled over whether the airline's fortunes are dire enough to require the kind of concessions that United, US Airways and American Airlines have obtained from their workers through bankruptcy or the threat of a bankruptcy filing.
Northwest's chief executive, Richard Anderson, said last month that the airline was in danger of entering Chapter 11 if it could not obtain wage and benefit cuts. Yesterday, Ms. Stanik said the force majeure declaration was "another example of Northwest's continuing efforts to communicate to its unions the current economic realities."
Though it lost $396 million in the first quarter, analysts have viewed Northwest as in better shape than its rivals, with enough cash to get through the rest of the year. Many analysts regard its efforts to win wage and benefit cuts as a bid to stay competitive with its rivals' newly lowered costs.
Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a trade group for corporate travel departments and business travelers, said that Northwest was risking its credibility by citing SARS as a reason for force majeure, when its Asian business represents only one-quarter of its flights.
"At a time in the industry when we have reached the lowest of low points in terms of trust between employees and management, to use this kind of heavy-handed tactic to wring concessions is, I think, a very counterproductive approach," he said.
The declines in Asian traffic at Northwest and United are far less severe than those experienced by other international carriers. At Air France, traffic to Asia fell 29.5 percent in April. At the Australian carrier Qantas, flights to Hong Kong are down 64 percent from a year ago. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about a decision by Northwest Airlines to invoke an emergency clause in its labor contracts that lets it lay off employees without notice referred incorrectly to the airline's decline in traffic to the Pacific in April. The 25 percent drop from April 2002 was for revenue passenger miles -- a measure of the number of seats actually sold -- not for available seat miles.
The article also misstated the change in Northwest's load factor, reflecting the number of seats occupied, across the Pacific. It fell by 14.6 percentage points, to 62.9 percent, not by 10 percentage points.

HEADLINE: With Tussles, House Renews a Job Program 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Voting largely along party lines, the House agreed today to renew a $6.6 billion employment training program, rejecting Democratic criticism that the measure would sanction discrimination by religious groups that provide job services.
 Lawmakers approved the bill by a vote of 220 to 204. Its sponsors said it would provide needed training and employment counseling at a time of rising unemployment. 
 "The backbone of a strong economy is a well-developed work force," Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Education and Work Force Committee, said. 
Democrats accused Republican backers of the bill of trying to roll back civil rights protections by allowing groups with religious affiliations that receive the federal money to limit employment to those sharing their religious views. Some compared it to the old practice of posting signs like "No Irish Need Apply."
"Don't take people's tax dollars and say you can only hire your own," Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said.
Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois, said, "Yes, faith-based organizations should be allowed to do their work, but they should not be allowed to discriminate at the same time."
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said it was "profoundly unwise to allow the federal government to fund religious discrimination."
"It is bad for our churches, bad for our work force and bad for our society," Ms. Pelosi said. 
Republican advocates of the provision said they were simply restoring an exemption to discrimination law provided in the original 1964 Civil Rights Act. They also argued that they were extending to religious groups the same protections offered to other organizations providing social services.
Several Republicans said Planned Parenthood accepted federal grant money but was not forced to hire employees opposed to abortion.
"Faith-based organizations cannot be expected to sustain their religious mission without the ability to employ individuals who share in their tenets and practices," Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of Colorado, said. "It is that very faith that motivates these people to help Americans that are in trouble."
The House debate opened a new front in the political and policy fight over groups with religious affiliations receiving federal money for social programs.
President Bush's broad plan to direct more federal money for social services to religious groups has stalled. It was a centerpiece of his presidential campaign and among the first pieces of legislation he sought from Congress.
On Wednesday, Republican House members said they were joining the Senate in abandoning the initiative and pushing instead for a bill confined to encouraging charitable contributions.
At the same time, Republican lawmakers said they would try to enact its provisions step by step in bills like the job training proposal. Mr. Bush has also moved to enact elements of his plan through executive order.
But the House provision is likely to complicate the employment bill's prospects in the Senate, where there is strong opposition among Democrats to language they say sanctions discrimination by religious groups that receive federal money and where lawmakers in the minority have more opportunity to stall proposals they do not like.
Democrats also said the measure adopted today did nothing to extend help for unemployed workers whose benefits will run out at the end of the month.
"This is the wrong bill being considered at the wrong time for the wrong reason," Representative George Miller of California, senior Democrat on the workforce committee, said.
The measure would continue a large-scale job training program enacted in 1998 that expires on Sept. 30. The program centers on "one-stop career centers" that bring together a variety of employment services like recruiting and training to assist the unemployed or those seeking new work. The authors of the bill said it would eliminate some bureaucratic hurdles to make it easier to establish such places.
Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao praised the House action today and said the measure was a major step toward giving workers "the employment and training services they need to better provide for themselves and their families."

HEADLINE: A Strong Euro With Few Admirers 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 8 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Europeans were wringing their hands over a seemingly endless slide in the value of the euro. These days, the currency is pole-vaulting ahead of the United States dollar, nearing levels it has not achieved since its introduction in January 1999.
 So are the Europeans cheering? Hardly. 
 The euro's rise has set off a new bout of hand-wringing by business executives, economists and politicians, who fear that a strong currency could stir up as many problems as the weak one did. And while the problems are different, at a time of weak economic growth in Europe, they may be no less troublesome. 
"It's a real threat," said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. "For Europe's exporters, it's like being a jogger, constantly running uphill and against headwinds."
Today, the European Central Bank resisted intense pressure to cut interest rates to offset the surging euro. The bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, said at a news briefing that "there's not yet anything excessive" about the currency's rise. It promptly jumped again in European trading, to $1.15, a new four-year high. Later in New York, the euro settled at $1.1493, compared with $1.1369 late Wednesday.
Mr. Duisenberg said the central bank wanted to see if the euro's rise had staying power before easing its policy. "We have to know more," he said, like whether it "will continue, or will peter out, or will reverse." 
With the euro up 4 percent against the dollar in the last two weeks, and roughly 30 percent since January 2001, companies like Volkswagen, Swatch and Henkel are contending that the situation has already dented sales, both through the conversion of dollar-based sales into euros and by making their goods more expensive for American consumers.
"I cannot recall the currency ever having had such a material effect on results," said Nikolaus Schweickart, the chairman of Altana, a German drug company that gets 26 percent of its sales in the United States. "The weak dollar has had the effect of cutting our upward spurt in half."
Altana reported a 10 percent jump in sales in the first quarter. If the exchange rate had remained steady, the jump would have been closer to 20 percent. Mr. Schweickart's emphasis on the weak dollar underlines a main reason that the galloping euro is not seen as a cause for celebration here.
Whatever the political benefits of a strong currency -- especially one that originally got off on the wrong foot -- people here know that the euro's surge now is less a reflection of European strength than of American weakness.
With ballooning current-account and budget deficits, the United States these days is a less attractive place for investors to put their money, and other countries, like Japan, scarcely look better. So Europe, by virtue of its stability and relatively sturdier public finances, has soaked up a lot of global capital.
"Europe's weak economies should not attract that much investment," said Michael Heise, chief economist at Allianz, the huge German insurer. "But investors expect a long-term period of deficits in the U.S. That is worrying."
For Mr. Heise, the rapid appreciation of the euro meant rewriting a presentation he gave this week to his bosses at Allianz about how they should allocate assets.
Allianz is also revising its projections for the euro's value. Originally, it forecast parity with the dollar at the end of this year and a rise of 10 to 15 percent in 2004. But to the surprise of Mr. Heise and other economists, the dollar got no lift from the end of the Iraq war, and an expected gradual appreciation in the euro's exchange value instead became a spike.
Commerzbank, which has also revised its forecast, now expects the euro to settle at $1.12 to the dollar by August. 
Some experts contend that the euro was growing in stature even before the recent tide of red ink in Washington. 
Niall C. Ferguson, a professor of financial history at New York University, said there had been a marked shift in the global bond market toward euro-denominated bonds. From 1995 to 1999, he said, 53 percent of all corporate and sovereign bonds were issued in dollars, and only 20 percent in the currencies of the 12 European countries that now use the euro.
But in the four years since the common currency began trading, Professor Ferguson said, 44 percent of new global bonds have been issued in euros, nearly equaling the 48 percent issued in dollars. 
"I'm not wholly convinced the euro is the heir to the dollar," he said. "But there is evidence that investors are switching from dollars to euros. I'm absolutely sure some of it is a reaction to the deficit."
The trouble is that long-term weakness in the dollar -- which many European economists expect -- is likely to inflict more pain on countries that export to the United States than on Americans themselves.
True, a summer trip to Tuscany will be more expensive for American tourists, while a Las Vegas vacation will be cheaper for Europeans. But such windfalls will be more than offset by the price pressure on exports, which have been a rare source of economic momentum in countries like Germany.
Goldman, Sachs estimates that a 10 percent rise in the euro's value against the dollar cuts an average of 4 percent off the profits of European companies. A shift on that scale in the exchange rate over two years would trim 1.1 percentage points off a country's economic growth in the first year and 0.2 percentage point in the second.
For Germany, already resigned to eking out just 1 percent growth in 2003, that could be a body blow.
Volkswagen said its net income tumbled 68 percent in the first quarter because of its aging products and its exposure to currency fluctuations. The exchange rate alone cut 400 million euros -- then $456 million -- from its pretax profits, while sales in the United States dropped 3.9 percent.
Mr. Mayer noted that companies like Volkswagen weathered a previous period of dollar weakness, from 1985 to 1995. They emerged lean and fit, which allowed them to reap big benefits a few years later, when the euro dropped sharply in value. Now, some of these companies are wheezing again, and looking for excuses.
"There's a blame game going on," Mr. Mayer said.
Indeed, some European executives play down the effect of the euro. Hugo Boss, the German apparel maker, reported a 5 percent decline in its sales in the first quarter; if not for the euro's rise, it said, sales would have been flat. But the chairman of Hugo Boss, Bruno E. Salzer, said he did not think he had lost American customers because of the euro. In part, that is because Hugo Boss makes much of its men's apparel for the United States market in Cleveland and those costs have not really increased.
"We wouldn't change our prices because of changes in the exchange rate," Mr. Salzer said. With a nervous laugh, he added, "if one day the euro is worth $3, I'll have to rethink my strategy."
Economists note that a stronger euro gives Europeans greater purchasing power, something that could help rekindle long-dormant consumer spending. That would be vital to reviving the German and French economies.
One byproduct of the rising euro has been an abrupt end to complaints by people here that the introduction of euro notes and coins in January 2002 had inflated prices at cafes, restaurants and hairdressers.
Perhaps the least predictable effect of a robust euro is on the European Monetary Union as a political experiment. Euro-skeptics in Britain have seized on its strength as another reason to delay the country's adoption of the currency, saying it would threaten the competitiveness of British industry. The British pound has not appreciated at all against the dollar this year.
In Sweden, where a referendum on adopting the euro will be conducted in September, a recent poll found that 50 percent of people opposed the move, while only 34 percent supported it. The Swedish prime minister, Goran Persson, is recruiting business leaders in hopes of swaying public opinion.
Experienced analysts say that the debate over the euro is, at heart, political rather than economic. 
"The Swedes used to say, 'Extremely weak currency -- we don't like extremely weak currencies,' " noted Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research group in Brussels. "Now they say, 'Extremely strong currency -- we don't like extremely strong currencies.' "

HEADLINE: The Tax-Cut Fixation 

 BODY:
The best thing to be said for the tax-cut legislation being concocted in the Republican-led Congress is that the Senate version finally accepts the idea of providing emergency fiscal aid to the deficit-battered states. Even so, the $20 billion proposed is short of actual needs and is likely to be undercut by fresh state revenue losses resulting from other negative factors in the G.O.P. proposals. 
 The worst thing to be said for the differing bills now moving through the two houses is that they continue to emphasize upper-bracket boons while totally ignoring the plight of the nation's unemployed workers. Most regrettably, the fight to kill off President Bush's favored dividend tax cut -- thought to have been rejected earlier in the Senate -- appears far from over. True, the latest Senate compromise won by Olympia Snowe of Maine trims this deficit-stoking measure to a quarter of the president's plan. But it introduces a sliding scale that would eventually let wealthier Americans shelter 20 percent of dividends. 
 One result of this compromise is to give dividend relief a foot in the door in the negotiations between House and Senate conferees later this month, when both chambers have completed work on their bills. Dividend cuts would have been unlikely if they had been struck from the Senate agenda. As it is now, the White House will have another chance to seek even larger dividend relief.
Meanwhile, the House bill heading for a vote today includes not only dividend relief but also a capital gains cut favored by persistent conservatives. They failed to win this windfall for the affluent two years ago, when there was a budget surplus. Now, despite record deficits and spiraling debt, they are determined to resurrect this bad idea for the final poker-game negotiations.
In another nod to the White House, both houses would accelerate the tax cuts enacted two years ago. The upper brackets are doing best here, too, with the top rate dropping to 35 percent, although speeding up child care and marriage credits will aid those further down the scale. Most unconscionably, neither house is repairing the damaging fine print in the president's plan that effectively denies these credits to children in the very poorest families. 
Lower-income families, of course, would be the quickest to spend the money to help provide some of the stimulus the Republicans claim is their first priority. Instead, the G.O.P. remains fixated on high-income concerns, framing the reconciliation talks as little more than an exercise in dueling sugarplums.

HEADLINE: Fewer Feds at the Airport 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has sometimes seemed reluctant to finance homeland security needs adequately. Still, it may come as a shock to many Americans that the Transportation Security Administration, the federal security force created in direct response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is facing budget problems.
 To save $288 million a year, the agency is being forced to shrink its ranks of newly minted airport passenger screeners by 6,000, or roughly 10 percent of the total. As a result of the cuts, New York area airports will lose significant manpower, about 700 screeners. 
 Adm. James Loy, the former Coast Guard commandant who runs the new agency, and other federal officials deserve a great deal of credit for meeting a series of ambitious Congressional mandates over the past year and a half as they oversaw the creation of the Transportation Security Administration. Aviation security is unquestionably tighter than it has ever been.
That said, these announced cutbacks raise troubling questions about the federal government's staying power in this war on terrorism, despite assurances that they will not compromise security or cause major inconvenience at terminals nationwide. Put charitably -- is aviation security really an area of the budget in which to be seeking "efficiencies" at this time?
Nobody would advocate wasting taxpayers' dollars on thousands of superfluous screeners, but there is reason to be skeptical of claims that the retrenched agency will now be deploying the right number of people needed to do the job. House Republicans, who never wanted a government takeover of aviation security in the first place, have long sought to deprive the Transportation Security Administration of needed resources, going so far as to insist on an arbitrary cap on the number of screeners that could be hired. 
The last thing the beleaguered travel industry and the economy need are for still-jittery travelers to question the government's commitment to domestic security now, or for them to shy away from flying if they encounter long lines and endless hassles. 
With the approach of summer and signs that travel might be picking up again, this is hardly the right time for Congress and Tom Ridge's Department of Homeland Security, the security agency's new parent, to be looking for savings at airport checkpoints. It sends the wrong message.

Weak Reports on Jobs and Retail Sales Send Stocks Down

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a second day yesterday, eroding gains from a recent rally, as weak jobs data and anemic retail sales reports renewed doubts about the strength of the economy.
 A report released yesterday showed that claims for first-time unemployment benefits remained above 400,000. Also, retail chains, including Wal-Mart Stores, Target, J. C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck all missed their sales targets for the month, and several retailers forecast weak quarterly earnings. 
 "The sales reports out of the retailers were on the light side," said Peter Dunay, chief market and options strategist at Wall Street Access, a brokerage firm in New York. 
"You have to be concerned that the consumer, who's been the pillar of strength of the economy, may be tiring," he said. "They're tiring because they're worried about unemployment, so they're starting to trim their spending."
The weak retail and jobs data led some investors to take profits from the rally that began in mid-March. Stocks have risen on hopes for an economic recovery later this year, but many investors fear the market has moved too far, too fast.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 69.41 points, or 0.81 percent, at 8,491.22. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.35 points, or 1.01 percent, to 920.27. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 17.07 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,489.69.
In New York, June crude oil ended 2.86 percent higher, at $26.98 a barrel, as United States stockpiles fell. The euro hit a four-year high against the dollar, which is hurt by low interest rates and the trade gap. In New York, the euro settled at $1.1493, up from $1.1369 late Wednesday.
Yesterday, the treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said the United States was experiencing a "wobbly" recovery, as weak global expansion, particularly in Japan and Europe, sapped domestic growth.
Retail stocks were mixed, after leading retailers reported poor sales in April as chilly weather offset the benefit of a late Easter and a swift end to the fighting in Iraq. Wal-Mart was down 7 cents, at $55.01, after saying it expected a 1 percent to 3 percent rise in May sales at stores open at least a year, compared with a 6.2 percent jump last May.
But the clothing retailer Gap Inc. rallied 68 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $17.28, after hitting a 52-week high at $18.03. It was the New York Stock Exchange's second most active issue. Gap's April sales at stores open at least a year rose 20 percent, helped by revamped merchandise and more focused marketing.
On the Nasdaq, Comcast, the No. 1 cable service provider, fell after it reported a wider quarterly net loss even as it raised its full-year outlook for new cable and high-speed Internet subscribers. Comcast shares ended down 20 cents at $30.22.

Treasury Prices Steady
By Bloomberg News
Benchmark Treasury yields held yesterday at their lowest level since March, as stocks fell and weak employment and retail sales reports added to the evidence of slowing economic growth.
Bonds pared their gains as the Treasury's $18 billion sale of 10-year debt drew the weakest demand since at least 1983, according to Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. The new 10-year note at auction was priced to yield 3.70 percent, and by late in the day, in when-issued trading, the yield was unchanged.
The 30-year bond fell slightly and its yield was unchanged at 4.68 percent.
Here are the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of 10-year notes:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.378
High Yield: 3.700%
Low Yield: 3.500%
Median Yield: 3.615%
Total applied for: $22,178,530
Accepted: $18,251,867
Noncompetitive: $88,878
Interest set at: 3 5/8
The 10-year notes mature May 15, 2013.

PERSON: Olivier Long 

HEADLINE: Olivier Long, 87; Led Predecessor of the W.T.O. 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Olivier Long, a Swiss diplomat who helped keep the Western world moving toward freer trade in the 1970's despite protectionist pressures brought on by soaring oil prices, inflation and recession, died on March 19 in Geneva, according to the Web site of the World Trade Organization. He was 87.
 As director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade from 1968 to 1980, Mr. Long helped to bring about the largest reductions in tariffs since World War II. GATT, an organization based in Geneva, was created in 1948 to oversee international trade. 
 Mr. Long was the second director general of GATT, taking over from Eric Wyndham White, who had run the organization for the first 20 years of its existence. At first he was reluctant to take the job, since doing so meant giving up his post as Switzerland's ambassador to Britain and Malta, which he had accepted in 1967.
Representatives of the leading industrial nations met at a 1973 summit meeting in Tokyo, setting off a six-year free-trade effort that became known as the Tokyo Round. These were difficult years for proponents of free trade. When oil prices quadrupled at the end of 1973 -- a consequence of actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- the twin shocks of recession and inflation rippled through the world economy. National currencies became exceptionally unstable.
Industries everywhere pleaded with their governments for protection against foreign competitors. Yet Mr. Long managed to hold the world's democratic industrial governments, as well as some 20 developing countries, to the free trade commitments they had made at the start of negotiations.
Not only did many tariffs drop, the Tokyo Round also represented the most comprehensive effort until then to eliminate or control other sorts of trade barriers, like quotas and export subsidies.
In 1995, at the conclusion of another trade-liberalizing exercise known as the Uruguay Round, GATT's role in governing world commerce was assumed by the World Trade Organization, a new and more powerful institution.
Olivier Long was born at Petit-Veyrier, Switzerland, near Geneva, on Oct. 11, 1915. He was educated at the University of Paris and the University of Geneva, where he completed his doctorate in law. After military service in 1939-43, he joined the International Red Cross and traveled across wartime Europe, negotiating prisoner-of-war exchanges. After the war, he joined the Swiss federal government, and after service in Washington he began to work on trade issues.
He had close personal ties with many leading French politicians, and as a result became an intermediary between Charles de Gaulle's government in Paris and the Algerian National Liberation Front. He helped set up the talks that led to the Evian agreements of 1962, which ended the Algerian war.
Mr. Long returned to commercial diplomacy, playing a prominent role in negotiations that led to creation of the European Free Trade Association, a trading bloc set up in 1959 by seven European countries that did not wish to join the six-nation European Community, or Common Market.
He is survived by his wife, the former Francine Roels, whom he married in 1946, and by two daughters and a son.

HEADLINE: State's Highest Court Hears Case on Financing of Schools 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
After wending its way through the legal system for a decade, a lawsuit accusing New York State of dodging its constitutional obligation to educate all children, particularly those in New York City, made it before the state's highest court today.
 The suit, backed by the Bloomberg administration and virtually every school district in the state, seeks a complete overhaul of the state budget, posing the question of whether $13 billion a year is enough to give three million students what the court calls "a sound, basic education." 
 It also contends that the city's schools, in particular, have been shortchanged for so long that one-third of its elementary students are functionally illiterate, 40 percent of its ninth graders never get a high school diploma and more than half of its graduates who enter City University of New York require extensive remedial work.
"All the children in the state are entitled to a meaningful high school education that prepares them for competitive employment," Joseph F. Wayland, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said before the court, known as the Court of Appeals. "How can children be entitled to anything less?" 
Having won a critical round in a lower court, Gov. George E. Pataki's lawyers were placed in the awkward position of defending a decision he has publicly disavowed. 
Last June, the Appellate Division ruled that the state need not guarantee anything more than an eighth- or ninth-grade education, a finding the governor flatly rejected as inadequate during his re-election campaign but his lawyers refused to back away from in court.
In the state's defense, Daniel Smirlock, the deputy solicitor general, argued that the city not only received more money than most of its counterparts across the nation but that the state's contributions had grown steadily over the last decade.
Even though the government aspires to see all students graduate, he added, all the state constitution requires is that children are provided with a "minimally adequate" education, meaning that they are prepared to vote, sit in jury boxes and hold down "gainful employment."
"As a tribute to the teachers of New York City, that standard is being met," he said. "The students in the city do O.K."
In a clear sign of how seriously they take the case, the judges allowed each side to argue for more than an hour, about three times as long as they do in most cases.
Still, they seemed to be left with as many questions as answers, and appeared unclear about how they could ensure safe environments, suitable curriculums, adequate class sizes and other benchmarks of academic adequacy without venturing outside their expertise and stepping on the Legislature's toes.
"How do we begin to do that?" said Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye.
Or, as her fellow justice, Judge Albert M. Rosenblatt, later put it: "We're judges. We're not educators."
Though they gave few indications how they would rule, the judges expressed concern over high dropout rates, paltry facilities and limited economic opportunities for those who fail to graduate. They also showed impatience with the idea that the state is not responsible for anything more than an eighth-grade education, as the lower court had ruled.
Even so, the judges seemed equally concerned about setting such a high standard that plaintiffs would come back year after year, contending that school systems statewide had failed to live up to the court's definition of an acceptable education. And they worried about the cost of setting the constitutional floor of a sound education too high, perhaps at the expense of other state responsibilities.
"We have an $11 billion deficit," Judge Richard C. Wesley said. "Is this a blank check?"
A ruling is expected by the end of June.

HEADLINE: Reluctantly, a Tribe Starts to See Casinos As Being Imperative 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: GOWANDA, N.Y. May 8 

 BODY:
For years, the Cayugas wanted no part of gambling fever. As the Senecas, the Oneidas and the Mohawks began earning millions from casinos, the Cayugas held to the old rules of consensus and unanimity. If even one of the five clan mothers opposed it, it could not happen.
 "I suggested it three years ago, and it was 'no, no, no!' " said Frank Bonamie, a member of the Cayuga Indian Nation of New York. He said that tribal leaders felt that gambling was contrary to the spiritual tradition of the nation. 
 But in a reversal that has angered some tribe members and puzzled others, the views of at least some members have changed. And last month, the Cayugas signed an agreement with a casino promoter, Empire Resorts Inc. (formerly Alpha Hospitality), to sponsor a $500 million casino in the Catskills. 
Although the plan still faces considerable obstacles, the casino could eventually be one of three the state wants to see built in the area. 
The Cayugas' change of position on casino gambling illustrated how the federally granted right to sponsor gambling has, even for the most reluctant tribes, made it something close to an economic imperative to embrace casinos.
"We all have personal feelings about it," said Tim Twoguns, a leader of one of the tribe's five clans. "But as a people, we have to look at the future in the long run, or we may not exist anymore."
The Cayugas have only about 475 members, Mr. Twoguns said, a fraction of the 8,000 or so Cayugas who ruled the northern Finger Lakes region when the first white settlers arrived. And they are the only one of seven federally recognized tribes in New York without a reservation.
So as the Cayugas held to their old beliefs, other tribes, notably the Senecas, have embraced casino projects and have begun investing in businesses like tax-free gasoline and tobacco sales throughout western New York.
The roads from Salamanca -- one of the gateways to the Seneca reservation -- to Buffalo show evidence of the tribe's aggressive entrepreneurialism. There is a Seneca Gas-Fuel next to the Seneca Restaurant off the New York State Thruway exit at Hamburg. There are Seneca convenience stores, libraries, health clinics and cultural centers, and in the center of the city of Niagara Falls, the four-month-old Seneca Niagara Casino, which has started dispensing $500 monthly stipends to tribe members. Before too long, the tribe plans to have two new hotels at Niagara Falls, plus casinos in Buffalo and on the Pennsylvania border.
By embracing casinos early and vigorously, the Senacas have also, under an agreement with the state, closed off western New York to the Cayugas and other tribes, producing a free-for-all among other tribes to fill the three Catskills casinos the Legislature has authorized.
Without a reservation, the Cayugas' tangible proof of their status as a nation until recently came mainly in the form of $44 and about a yard of unbleached muslin treaty cloth, which each member of the tribe receives annually from the state of New York as payment for a land purchase more than 200 years ago. 
"We're lucky that we've existed this long without land," said Clint Halftown, who is directing the tribe's new business ventures. 
As a sign of the Cayugas' new business interest, the tribe recently borrowed $1.3 million from the Oneida Nation, operators of the Turning Stone casino in Verona, to buy its first business, a gas station and car wash in the village of Union Springs on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake. 
Yet the Cayugas are still a long way from owning a casino. They will have to settle their longstanding claim for 100 square miles around Cayuga Lake before the state will grant the necessary permission for a casino. A federal court has awarded the tribe $247 million for what it determined was illegally confiscated land, and the state has appealed. The Cayugas have also appealed, saying they want the land.
"We will not trade our land for a casino," Mr. Halftown said.
The Cayugas must also persuade the Bureau of Indian Affairs to authorize a casino off tribal land, a step that is not unusual for the bureau, but which may be impeded by the dissension among its members.
"We're not informed, that's the problem," said Kate John, a tribal member, in a telephone interview. "These things get decided and no one knows how." When asked if there would be a tribal meeting where all would be made clear, Ms. John laughed mirthlessly and said goodbye.
Mr. Bonamie is the last surviving signatory of the tribe's 1984 land suit against New York, and he pushed for a gambling project three years ago, to no avail. Today, he owns a logistics business in Auburn, and has all but stopped paying attention to tribal matters.
"A lot of the members still don't believe in gambling, so between you and me, I think they are going to have some problems with this. Halftown doesn't have the power to do what he's doing."
Mr. Halftown bridled when he was asked to explain how he had come to be authorized to sign a casino agreement on behalf of the Cayuga Nation.
"You guys don't understand our internal process, but I'm not going to disclose it to you," he said. "It's private."

HEADLINE: California Ponders Big Loan in Deficit Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8 

 BODY:
Facing a huge budget shortfall and skepticism on Wall Street about the state's creditworthiness, California officials are considering floating as much as $10 billion in bonds to stave off a cash flow crisis that some are warning could come as early as this summer.
 Under a proposal being weighed in Sacramento, the state sales tax would rise by one-half cent to finance the new borrowing. California already has one of the highest sales taxes in the nation, 7.25 percent, and counties have the authority to increase that for their own use. For example, the sales tax in San Francisco is 8.5 percent. 
 Republicans in the Legislature have also expressed a willingness to borrow to help cover the budget shortfall, but they want to finance the new debt by dedicating part of current sales tax revenue to it. 
California's budget for the current fiscal year and the next is $35 billion out of balance because of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and continued high spending. The administration of Gov. Gray Davis will issue revised numbers next week that officials say will show that the gap has grown by as much as $2 billion since the last estimate, in January.
On Monday, Governor Davis signed into law several bills that reduced the budget gap by $3.6 billion by borrowing to make payments to state pension funds and cutting spending on education and some health care programs. Mr. Davis, a Democrat, has warned that the rest of the gap cannot be closed without new taxes. 
But he has not endorsed the bond proposal. That was developed by the California Department of Finance, the state budget office. 
At stake is financing for virtually every state operation, including prisons, hospitals, state universities and parks. Local school districts have already issued 25,000 layoff notices to teachers, anticipating deep cuts in state education financing. Not all these teachers will be laid off, but such notices are required to those who might be dismissed. Local law enforcement agencies are bracing for budget cuts and police layoffs. 
Fees for parks and college tuition have already risen this year, and further increases are expected. But the budget hole keeps deepening, in large part because state income tax revenue continues to fall below projections while the cost of providing social services continues to rise.
A separate agency would be created to issue the bonds. It would bear some similarity to New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency that issued bonds to rescue New York City from potential bankruptcy in the 1970's. Those bonds, which originally had a 30-year maturity, may not be paid off until 2034, New York City and State officials said this week.
California officials are considering much-shorter-term debt, perhaps five years, hoping that the fiscal crisis is a temporary hangover from the high-technology roller coaster of the past five years. But Wall Street is watching Sacramento closely, financial analysts say, and is likely to impose high borrowing costs on the state unless the budget problems are addressed with structural changes and not temporary bandages.
California's bond rating from Moody's Investors Service is A2, a mediocre rating shared by only two other states, Louisiana and New York. All other states are several grades higher, a Moody's official said. Moody's has downgraded California three times since the energy crisis of 2000-01 and the collapse of the technology bubble at about the same time.
Ray Murphy, chief California analyst for Moody's, said the rating agency was withholding judgment on various budget proposals circulating in Sacramento. But Mr. Murphy said the Republican plan to divert part of existing revenue to pay interest on a new bond issue simply postponed the day of reckoning. 
"Deficit financing just pushes the problem out for another year," Mr. Murphy said. "So it doesn't eliminate the problem. They're still going to have to deal with the imbalance in fiscal 2005."
He said that bond underwriters -- who set the interest rate for new debt and thus determine the state's cost of borrowing -- would look more favorably on a plan that raised new money and dedicated the revenue to repaying the bondholders.
In January, Governor Davis proposed a budget that included $8 billion in increased taxes on income, sales and tobacco products to cover part of the shortfall. It has gone nowhere as Republicans in the Legislature have fiercely resisted the tax increases, saying that the state's fiscal problems are caused by excessive spending, not insufficient taxation. Republicans have proposed cutting state spending across the board by 7 percent to 10 percent.
Democrats dominate both the Assembly and the Senate but do not have the two-thirds majorities necessary to pass a budget without some Republican votes.
Representative Dave Cox, the Republican leader in the Assembly, said his caucus remained adamantly opposed to raising taxes to address the budget crisis. But Mr. Cox said Republicans were willing to consider some form of borrowing. 
"While we don't like borrowing money to finance the deficit," he said, "paying the money back over five years is far superior to raising taxes that will further stymie the economy and deter our economic recovery."

HEADLINE: Heady Days for Kuwait Stock Exchange 

BYLINE:  By ABEER ALLAM 

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, May 7 

 BODY:
Waleed al-Houtti keeps his eyes trained on the flashing stock prices streaming across the bottom of his computer screen, and sporadically answers a phone. On one call, Mr. Houtti, the assistant general manager for local investment at the Kuwait Stock Exchange, says a single word -- "Really?" -- and then hangs up with a wide smile. "I just sold stocks I bought yesterday, for double the price," he explains.
 And it was not hard to do. Kuwait's stock market, one of the largest in the Middle East, is soaring. The main index has shot up by 26 percent since the start of hostilities in neighboring Iraq, and has nearly doubled since October. 
 The mood in the market is nothing short of euphoric, with Kuwaitis and foreign investors alike pouring money into stocks, out of relief at the toppling of Saddam Hussein and because of the limited number of other investment opportunities in the country. 
"Kuwaitis love to play the stock market," Mr. Houtti said in his office on the fifth floor of the stock exchange. "Before the liberation of Iraq, we were always worried about when Iraq's large army might invade again. Now everyone feels more secure." 
It shows. In the last few weeks, Kuwaitis have poured as much as 12 billion Kuwaiti dinars ($40 billion) in savings into the exchange, whose total market capitalization is about $100 billion, second-largest in the Arab world, after Egypt. 
The Kuwait exchange has been something of a barometer of public confidence in the gulf region since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Kuwait Stock Exchange Index weakened noticeably when the Bush administration began turning up the pressure on Iraq late last summer, but it began a sustained rally in early October, when military action against Iraq started to look likely. 
The imminence of hostilities dried up trading in late February and March, as many Kuwaitis concentrated their attention more on stocking up emergency provisions than on investments, and the Iraqi missiles that struck a Kuwaiti shopping mall on March 28 dented stock prices as well. 
But the collapse of the Iraqi government brought a stampede back to the market, and the index shot up from 2754.7 on March 29 to 3510.8 on May 3.
"I used to invest in the American stock market," said Saad Mohammad al-Saad, a Kuwaiti investor. "But after Sept. 11, we felt we were not welcomed in America any more, and it is very difficult to get into the European stock market, and we had Saddam on our border. Now that the security hazard is gone, the Kuwaiti stock market is very attractive." 
Mr. Saad tries to invest conservatively, sticking to the exchange's blue chip companies, like the National Bank of Kuwait, Kuwait Insurance, Kuwait Cement and Kuwait Pipes Industries, and avoiding the more speculative real estate stocks. "Most real estate shares are very inflated," he said. "You can make loads of money, but share prices are not realistic at all." 
The rally in the exchange is being driven by more than just relief and freed savings. According to Mohammed al-Thamer, director of the trading department at the Kuwait Stock Exchange, many local companies benefited directly from the military action against Iraq, especially transportation companies. 
Mr. Thamer said Kuwaiti companies had generally posted good results in the first quarter, and that the transportation sector in particular was expected to be robust for the rest of the year as the United States-led coalition's rebuilding efforts in Iraq expand and the need for supplies increases. 
Randa Azara Khouri, chief economist at the National Bank of Kuwait, said paper and packaging, construction, telecommunications, cleaning services and food companies had also won lucrative contracts with the American military.
Oil prices fell as the demise of the Iraqi regime seemed assured, reducing state revenue in Kuwait. But interest rates fell as well, helping introduce greater liquidity into the stock exchange.
While Kuwaitis held back on consumer spending during the war, hotels and restaurants saw a boom in business from foreign journalists and military personnel who came to the emirate in great numbers as the war neared.
Today, Kuwaitis are trying to return to the comfortable life they remembered before tensions with Iraq first became inflamed in 1990. Patrons have returned in force to the Souk Sharq market on the waterfront, where the Iraqi missile struck in March. Crowds of women dressed in traditional black abaya, men in long shirt-robes and teenagers wearing the latest Western fashions shop for luxury goods like Gucci bags, Cartier jewelry and Rolex watches. And their ebullience translates into the stock market.
"The Kuwaitis can feel safe now," Mr. Thamer said. "It is at least 30 to 35 years before another Iraqi regime claims Kuwait again."

HEADLINE: A Greenspan Tactic Buoys the Bond Market 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN has done it again. He has played the markets like a virtuoso musician.
 Mr. Greenspan's reputation in the long run will rest on whether he can get the economy moving again. If not, he will be remembered for the hubris he showed during the bubble, when he assured worriers that there was no need for the Federal Reserve to deal with the inflating stock market because he knew how to deal with bubble aftermaths and prevent lasting economic damage. 
 He has reason to worry. The bubble's economic impact has lasted far longer than anyone expected, despite Dr. Greenspan's diet of Fed rate cuts, which has cut short-term rates to 40-year lows. There are indications that capital spending in the technology sector has finally hit bottom, but an early upturn is no sure thing.
For months, Fed officials have been saying they were in no danger of running out of ammunition. The Fed could buy longer-term Treasuries, they said, even if it had not done so for decades.
Until this week, the markets seemed to view such talk as an academic exercise of little interest to traders. But the Fed's statement when it left rates unchanged on Tuesday decoupled the issues of economic growth and inflation, and reassured investors that rates will stay low even if the economy does better. "They basically made clear they are not tightening for a long time," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs.
The impact on expectations was drastic, and can be seen in the eurodollar futures market. That market lets you bet on where short-term interest rates will be in the future. And traders are now betting that rates will rise far more slowly than they had expected. The market expectation for short-term rates in June 2006 is now 3.695 percent, down half a percentage point since the Fed acted.
By giving a boost to the bond market while not alarming stock traders, Mr. Greenspan pulled off a neat trick, even if expectations of sustained low interest rates also hurt the dollar.
It is the currency markets that may provide the most interesting tales of intrigue over the next year if world economic growth does not accelerate. As it is, nearly every country has reason to hope for a weakening currency, to help its exports compete.
Consider the dollar. Its strength in recent years has come because foreigners were eager to invest here, and thus redeploy the dollars they got as we ran huge trade deficits. It stands to reason that if American investments seem less attractive, foreigners will invest less and the dollar will decline.
But some central banks, notably in Asia, have no intention of allowing that to happen. "China likes the current system," Mr. Dudley said. "It allows them to keep their currency undervalued and people employed. It is part of a policy of political stability in China." The central bank in China has been buying dollars at a rapid pace to keep the Chinese currency from rising against the dollar.
Only the Europeans seem oblivious to what is happening. Even as the leading European economies teeter near recession, the European Central Bank is reluctant to lower its interest rates.
That helps the euro, but Europe does not need such help. Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, points out that the latest data, for March, indicated that the dollar price of American imports from Europe had risen 6.5 percent over the previous year, while the euro was up 25 percent against the dollar. The difference is shrinking margins for European exporters.
A weak world economy means that everyone is fighting for shares of a too-small pie. The hope is for a growing pie. That is why the Fed's indication that it will not tighten for a long time is welcome, and why lower European interest rates are overdue.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Discusses Risks of Derivatives 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 8 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, expressed concern today over the risks posed to financial markets by the concentration of the $142 trillion derivatives market in the hands of a few investment banks.
 Derivatives are contracts based on underlying securities or other variables, ranging from interest rates and currencies to energy and weather. 
They allow investors both to spread risk and to make big leveraged bets. 
 Mr. Greenspan, as he has done in the past, praised derivatives, saying their benefits materially outweighed the risks and had insulated the financial system from the stock market crash and economic downturn.
But, for the first time, in a conference organized by the Chicago Fed, he detailed the potential dangers to financial markets if a big derivatives dealer had to exit the market, and he called for more meaningful disclosure.
Mr. Greenspan repeated his opposition to regulating derivatives, but said heavy concentration in the market "gives me and others some pause."
"If a major dealer exited and other dealers were unwilling to fill the void, the liquidity of the market likely would be impaired," Mr. Greenspan said.
According to the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements, the global over-the-counter derivatives market had grown to nearly $142 trillion by the end of last year.
In his speech, delivered to the conference by satellite, Mr. Greenspan said that a single dealer accounts for about a third of the global market in both interest rate and credit derivatives, and a few dealers account for more than two-thirds.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: FINANCES; 
Syria and Jordan Suspected of Being Conduits for Funds Drained From Iraq

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
In an era when huge sums of money zip around the globe electronically, President Saddam Hussein and members of his government were old-fashioned. They liked cash. 
 Treasury officials said this week that relatives of Mr. Hussein stole nearly $1 billion in currency from Iraq's central bank shortly before the war, and federal authorities and investigators are focusing on Syria and Jordan, which they say have long been conduits for government funds that Mr. Hussein moved secretly out of Iraq. 
 Syria and Jordan are drawing special scrutiny because both neighbors had extensive business dealings with Iraq, particularly in oil trading, which provided ample opportunities for Mr. Hussein to cloak funds. 
American officials charge that both countries turned a blind eye to the transfer of money by Mr. Hussein's government, which violated United Nations Security Council sanctions, and investigators fear that political leaders and financiers in both nations are unlikely to cooperate with them now in the search for the funds.
"It's difficult to locate some of Saddam's assets because there've been major leaks in the international sanctions regime that made it easy for Iraq to circumvent," said a United States government official who requested anonymity.
"Neighboring countries that border Iraq may make it difficult for us to pursue financial forensic investigations because they're more prone to engage in commerce with Iraq," the official added.
On March 20, the White House announced that it was stepping up its efforts to recover the hidden funds. Since then, officials have identified about $1.2 billion that Mr. Hussein concealed overseas, only a portion of what he is believed to have stolen. 
In recent years, Mr. Hussein's son Qusay oversaw the Iraqi government's oil smuggling, according to a report published last fall by the Coalition for International Justice, a Washington advocacy group. American and Iraqi officials suspect that Qusay Hussein orchestrated the pre-war looting of Iraq's central bank.
According to oil analysts and Western intelligence officials, Syria mingled Iraqi oil profits skimmed by the Hussein government with foreign currency reserves stored in its central bank, funds that will be impossible to examine or track without Syrian cooperation.
Syria's central bank in Damascus, as well as its consulate in Washington, did not respond to phone calls and faxes requesting interviews.
The best-known spigot suspected of filling Mr. Hussein's personal coffers was Iraq's oldest oil pipeline, from the northern oil fields around Kirkuk to Syria's Mediterranean port, Baniyas.
The pipeline pumped oil that was sold at cut-rate prices to Syria in return for kickbacks to the Hussein government, according to oil analysts and American officials.
Although American officials complained that the pipeline circumvented economic sanctions, it remained open until United States forces closed it last month.
"Syria continually denied doing it, they said they were testing the line," said James Placke, an oil analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "Well, they tested the line for two and a half years at the rate of about 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day." 
Since 1996, the United Nations has had official control of all Iraqi oil profits, which were to be used to purchase food and other relief supplies for Iraqi civilians.
While the United Nations has defended its oversight of the program, the General Accounting Office estimated last year that oil smuggling and other kickbacks linked to the United Nations program allowed Mr. Hussein to steal about $6.6 billion between 1997 and 2001.
Syria's efforts to conceal oil trade with Iraq extended to its dealings with the International Monetary Fund, an influential lender of last resort to struggling countries. According to data the fund circulates internally and only to central banks, Syria omitted Iraqi oil in accounting for production figures submitted to the agency.
Such fudging allowed Syria to artificially inflate the strength of its own oil sector to the monetary fund and masked commerce that enriched Mr. Hussein. An fund spokesman, Bill Murray, declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of data from member countries.
Although investigators declined to comment on how Iraqi oil profits were handled in Syria, the mechanism for doing so would have been straightforward. Syria's government-controlled oil company, Sytrol, handled oil sales from the Iraqi pipeline and would have forwarded payments directly to the Hussein government or, as some analysts say, deposited the money in Syria's central bank.
If the money left Damascus for Europe, the United States, or other off-shore havens, it might have traveled through international banks that have correspondent accounts with Syria's central bank -- offering a number of paths for investigators to track as they look for stolen assets.
"I think the connection with Syria enhanced Saddam's ability to circumvent sanctions and obtain resources he needed to run his regime," said Representative Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat who has pushed for American economic penalties against Syria. "I can say with some degree of expectation that Saddam's ability to import and export dollars was made possible by Syrian cooperation."
Nonetheless, investigators will be hard pressed to establish a paper trail distinguishing Iraqi cash from Syrian cash in many of the oil deals and then linking it to particular bank accounts.
"I don't expect Saddam Hussein to open accounts under his own name -- he will use shell companies," said Jacques de Wattewylle, assistant secretary for financial and economic affairs in Switzerland's Foreign Ministry.
"That will present difficulties, especially in countries that have poor know-your-customer rules" for banks, Mr. de Wattewylle added.

HEADLINE: Divided Senate Panel Passes a Scaled-Down Tax Cut Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Voting mostly along party lines, the Senate Finance Committee approved a scaled-down tax cut today that satisfies few senators but moves the bill along a legislative path where it can be changed.
 Senators from both parties said the details of the bill were sure to be altered before it was finally passed and sent to President Bush. The legislation was adopted by a vote of 12 to 9, with all the Republicans and Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, a Democrat, in favor and all other Democrats opposed. 
 The central provision of the measure, likely to go before the Senate next week, would make the first $500 of stock dividends investors receive tax free each year and would exempt from taxes a portion of dividends over $500 -- 10 percent through 2007 and 20 percent after that. 
The $350 billion, 10-year tax cut is a far cry from President Bush's $726 billion plan, which would have excluded almost all dividends from taxes. It is also much less generous to investors than the $550 billion tax cut bill the House is expected to pass on Friday, which would lower the tax rate on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent.
The final legislation will be written in a House-Senate conference committee, where the White House will have a leading role.
The only senator who was even slightly enthusiastic about the Senate measure today was Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. But she was the swing vote, and her view was the one that counted. The bill was written to her specifications because without her vote, it would have become stalled in the committee.
Ms. Snowe would have voted against a larger break for dividends, she said, and other Republicans would have voted against a measure that had no exclusion for dividends.
Republican senators on the committee vowed to try to change the bill when it reaches the Senate floor. "I am not satisfied with the mark we have right now on dividends," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. "We didn't do enough."
The only reason to vote for the measure, said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, was "to keep the bill alive and allow the Senate to work its will."
Democrats on the committee were equally dissatisfied, but for opposite reasons. With the highest budget deficits ever in the offing, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that if the bill became law it would be "mortgaging America's future" and that it would "not improve our economic outlook but worsen it considerably."
Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana who often sides with Republicans on tax matters but opposed the bill today, emphasized that it would be changed. "We're not finished with the bill," he said. "It's a long way to the end."
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman, did some fancy shuffling to create a package that could win a majority. He had to abandon his first proposal this week -- to repeal the tax on dividends and then reinstate it after three years -- because he could not get enough votes for it.
In addition to the different treatment of taxation of stock dividends in his new plan, Mr. Grassley set aside $20 billion for unspecified aid to the states, explaining that the exact provision would be written on the Senate floor. And he kept the measure within the $350 billion limit established in the budget plan the Senate approved last month with some tax increases he called offsets.
The most important of these offsets would repeal the law that excludes $80,000 a year of the income of Americans working abroad from income taxes and allows these overseas workers to receive tax-free housing allowances.
This offset, called a pay-for in Congressional jargon, would give the government $32 billion more revenue over the next 10 years and was critical to Mr. Grassley's ability to produce a bill within the $350 billion tax-cut ceiling. But important business interests oppose the provision, and senators agreed it was unlikely to become law.
"That pay-for is not going to last," said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the top Democrat on the committee. "There's just not enough political support for it."
Another offset would prohibit American companies from avoiding United States taxes by incorporating in offshore tax havens like Bermuda.
The dividend portion of the measure would cost $80 billion in lost revenue over 10 years, much less than the nearly $400 billion the Bush plan would cost.
Other elements of the Senate bill are essentially the same as those in the versions proposed by the president and the one now before the House.
Among them are provisions that would lower tax rates for middle- and upper-income taxpayers, give a tax break to married couples and raise the tax credit for each child to $1,000 from the current $600. If these are unchanged, most families can expect rebate checks of $400 per child a couple of months after the bill becomes law, representing their saving from the higher credit.
The bill would also follow the president and the House and increase to $75,000 from $25,000 the amount of investment expenses small businesses could write off in the year the money was spent. But the Senate measure does not have the more generous depreciation rules in the House bill for larger businesses.

HEADLINE: Yale Hospital Plans to Halt Foreclosure for Bill Collection 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 8 

 BODY:
Yale-New Haven Hospital announced today that it would stop using foreclosure on homes as a way of collecting patients' bills and would erase $84,000 owed by 170 patients with bills at least five years old.
 Officials also said the hospital would change other billing practices that have been criticized, saying it would stop adding court costs to patients' bills and would start requiring lawyers to seek the hospital's approval before attaching liens to patients' homes. 
 Some of the hospital's critics applauded the concessions, although the changes stop short of addressing issues raised in a lawsuit by the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. In February, he sued the hospital, charging that it erected "unreasonable and formidable barriers" around funds that had been donated to the hospital specifically for charity care. 
The lawsuit accused the hospital of failing to inform patients of the funds' existence, making them exhaust other sources of reimbursement before they could apply for the funds, and restricting eligibility in ways that the donors had never requested. As a result, the lawsuit said, only about 55 patients applied each year, even as the funds grew to $37 million and the hospital became more aggressive about collection.
The hospital, which initially said it was "shocked and surprised" by the lawsuit, has not responded to it in court. Mr. Blumenthal said today that "Yale-New Haven should not have been surprised" by his suit and that legal action might follow against other hospitals now that his investigation into potential misuse of such "free bed funds" has expanded. 
"Our hope is that others with the same problems will address them readily and voluntarily," he said. 
So far, Yale-New Haven has had all the attention. One New Haven widower, whose wife had been treated there in 1982, ended up struggling under a $38,000 hospital debt that outlived his wife. He was the subject of a Wall Street Journal profile in March, after which the hospital forgave his bill. 
The New Haven Advocate, which had written about the hospital's billing practices as early as May 2001, published another article last month under the headline "Heartless Hospital." Local clergymen and union officials seeking to increase their representation of the hospital's 6,000 employees held a demonstration last week, calling on the hospital to "repent." 
The hospital also announced today that it would support a proposal by Martin M. Looney, the majority leader of the State Senate, to set interest rates lower than 10 percent for repayment of debtors' bills that end up in court. The hospital is less keen on other proposals by Mr. Looney to steer more state money to hospitals that treat indigent patients without charge and less to hospitals that pursue payment.

HEADLINE: Into The Sunset 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Chutzpah, according to the classic definition, is when you murder your parents, then ask for sympathy because you're an orphan. But what do we call it if after you are placed with foster parents, you try the same thing all over again?
 I ask this question in light of the tax-cut package the House is expected to pass today -- a package that relies on exactly the same bait-and-switch tactics used to sell the 2001 tax cut. Since the scam involved in the 2001 tax cut remains one of the wonders of modern political economy, it is a measure of our leaders' contempt for the intelligence of the public -- or maybe for the press -- that they think they can use the same tricks a second time. 
 Here's the story: in 2001, as now, some swing senators insisted on a budget resolution limiting the size of any tax cut. No problem. House-Senate negotiators pushed through a huge tax cut anyway, "saving" several hundred billion dollars by making the whole thing expire in the 10th year. Among other things, this "sunset clause" implied that heirs to large estates would pay no tax if their parents died in 2010, but would face significant taxes if their parents made it into 2011. At the time I suggested that it be renamed the Throw Momma from the Train Act of 2001.
Needless to say, the bill was silly by design. The administration didn't intend to compromise: it fully expected to get the sunset clause repealed in a future Congress. And President Bush was soon out there ridiculing the way the tax cut was programmed to expire, implying that the expiration date was imposed by scheming liberals, when in fact it was a trick perpetrated by his own Congressional allies.
Now Congress is voting on more tax cuts. This time we're already running a record budget deficit, and the long-run prospect is bleak. Still, the administration claims to be making a concession by agreeing to scale back its $726 billion tax cut to a mere $550 billion.
So how does the House bill, which is broadly similar to the administration's proposal, stay within that $550 billion limit? Sunset clauses! Many of the provisions would supposedly expire in 2005, others in 2012. Otherwise, it's a bigger tax cut than the administration proposed. And the sunset clauses, like those in the 2001 tax cut, are clearly a mere gimmick: as soon as a tax cut becomes law, the administration will begin demanding that the whole thing be made permanent.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the true cost of the House bill, without the sunset scam, would be $1.1 trillion over the next decade. You know, $550 billion here, $550 billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.
The new tax cut plan echoes the 2001 scam in other ways. In 2001 a tax cut that delivered about 40 percent of its benefits to the richest 1 percent of families was marketed as a tax break for ordinary folks. The same is true this time. In fact, the extent to which the House bill favors the rich is breathtaking: the typical family would get a tax break of only $217 next year, but families with incomes above $1 million would get an average of $93,500 each. The center estimates that over the next decade, 27 percent of the tax cut -- about the share that goes to the bottom 90 percent of the population -- would go to these very high-income families, who comprise a mere 0.13 percent of the population. 
Finally, as in 2001, we're being told that this tax cut will create lots of jobs. But why should we believe that? It's hard to find an independent economist who thinks that the Bush proposal would create the 1.4 million jobs claimed by the administration -- and as I've explained in this column, even that many jobs would be a poor payoff for a tax cut that big. 
And bear in mind that Bush-style tax cuts now have a track record. Of the 2.1 million jobs lost over the past two years, 1.7 million vanished after the passage of the 2001 tax cut.
Nonetheless, the odds are that this scam, like the scam of 2001, will succeed. The tax cut will be passed, and the budget will plunge even deeper into the red. And one day we'll realize that international investors are treating us like a banana republic -- that they won't finance our trade deficit unless they are paid very high rates of interest (have I mentioned that the dollar has just fallen to a four-year low against the euro?) -- and everyone will wonder why.

HEADLINE: Republicans Pledge Aid For Abolitionist's Home 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Republican Congressional leaders pledged nearly $1 million today to refurbish the former home of the 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass.
 In a ceremony at Cedar Hill, Douglass's Washington estate, the leaders signed a resolution that they introduced to Congress to allocate $955,000 for restoration of the house, which has been damaged by exposure to moisture in recent years. 
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the financing would help complete a three-year, $2 million renovation project on the property. 
"This really is the very best of what government can be about," Dr. Frist said on the front porch of the house, which sits on a bluff with a grand view of the Capitol.
Born into slavery on Maryland's Eastern Shore in 1818, Douglass escaped to freedom at age 20 and eventually became one of the country's most prominent orators and civil rights activists. He lived at Cedar Hill from 1877 until his death in 1895.
The National Park Service, which has maintained the Douglass home since 1962, will oversee its renovation. The estate is one of 12 sites within the park system dedicated to preserving and interpreting African-American history.
The ceremony provided a backdrop for the start of a Republican-led agenda that, Republicans say, seeks to strengthen African-American families and help them achieve economic security. The initiative consists mainly of support for Republican legislative proposals like tax cuts and vouchers for low-income students to attend private schools. 
Armstrong Williams, a conservative columnist and an organizer of the Republican initiative, said the effort originated because of the furor last year over the remarks of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who said the nation would have been better off had Strom Thurmond been elected president in 1948 when he ran on a segregationist platform. 
That event "rallied the entire party," Mr. Williams said. He added that Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, told him that "this is our last chance to get it right," in reference to the Republican Party's relationship with African-Americans.
A spokesman from Mr. DeLay's office confirmed that Senator Lott's comments played a role in shaping the agenda, which the Republicans call "fulfilling America's promise."

HEADLINE: To Meet Budget, Museum Sets Two-Week Shutdown 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Museum of Art has announced that it will close for two weeks in August, a casualty of the city's proposed budget cuts to cultural institutions.
 The decision came even as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday an emergency effort by New York City's public libraries to raise $36 million in private support for books, materials and core services during the economic downturn. 
 Closing the Brooklyn Museum from Aug. 4 through Aug. 19, first reported in The Daily News yesterday, will save $250,000, said Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the museum. The nearly 300 union and nonunion employees will rotate shifts for the two weeks so that everyone will be on furlough for at least a week, he said. 
"It feels terrible," Mr. Rubin said. "To our employees, we're asking them to take a 2 percent pay cut that they'll never get back. And it's the public that we're sort of turning our back on."
At the Muhlenberg branch of the New York Public Library on West 23rd Street in Manhattan yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg called on New Yorkers to do their share to help make up for the budget shortfall.
"What I would suggest is that you write a check, get all of your friends to write checks, and if every one of your friends gets another person to write checks, with six degrees of separation, pretty soon everybody will be supporting the culturals," he said. "That's what I do, that's what you should do. And you can volunteer, you can man phone banks for them, you can do a lot of things."
The city's libraries have warned that the mayor's proposed budget cuts will whittle their days of operation to four a week. In testifying before the City Council yesterday, Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library, said the proposed budget cuts "leave libraries on the precipice of four days of service."
But the campaign to raise private support for the libraries -- started with $4.5 million from the Carnegie Corporation and a $1.5 million gift from the Starr Foundation -- will be used to buy more books, not to keep libraries open more days, officials said.
The cuts proposed under the mayor's budget would amount to a reduction of $2.4 million to the Brooklyn Museum, which has an operating budget of $28 million. The museum has been hurt by the drop in philanthropic giving due to the weak economy.
The museum has already canceled several exhibitions scheduled for next year, frozen hiring for the last 18 months, cut back on family programming, halted staff trips and reduced departmental budgets.
Mr. Rubin said he expected there would be more to come. "Revenues are hard to come by," he said. "There is no way I'm going to be able to say this is the last thing we're going to do this year."
The Brooklyn Museum was forced to close for two weeks about a decade ago because of city budget constraints. "I got a lot of heat for it," Mr. Rubin said. 
It is one of 34 institutions owned by the city or on city property that make up the Cultural Institutions Group, whose budget would be reduced to $77.7 million from $105.6 million under the mayor's proposed budget.
The Department of Cultural Affairs is apportioning the cuts in a two-tier system. The 14 organizations with operating budgets larger than $6 million would be cut 35 percent in the 2004 fiscal year, which begins July 1. The 20 groups with budgets of less than $6 million would be cut by 24 percent. 
The cuts are directed only at operating expenses. The cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, testified at a City Council hearing yesterday that the cuts were difficult but fair. "The Department of Cultural Affairs is not being asked to take a disproportionate share of the city's reductions," she said.
Under the proposed budget, the hundreds of arts organizations that are not city-owned -- known as the program group -- would be cut to $11 million from $18.7 million.

HEADLINE: It's Not Bloomberg, It's the Economy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "No Politician? The Polls Agree With the Mayor" (City Hall Memo, front page, May 8) raises the question, Do polls matter? Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has remained true to his convictions. 
Although he hasn't mounted a charm offensive, he has tackled the challenges with characteristic drive and determination. He inherited a precarious state of affairs. 
 The next poll that matters is the election. Until then, let the mayor stay the course. In an economy like this, we all get moody.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: UNITED NATIONS; 
U.S. WILL ASK U.N. TO BACK CONTROL BY ALLIES IN IRAQ

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8 

 BODY:
A draft resolution to be introduced by the United States, Britain and Spain on Friday morning lifting economic sanctions against Iraq calls for the Security Council to endorse American and British control of Iraq's political development and financial resources for at least 12 months.
 Under the resolution, new Iraqi oil revenues and at least $3 billion in the current United Nations-controlled escrow fund would be transferred to a new Iraqi Assistance Fund to be "disbursed at the direction of" the United States and Britain -- referred to as the "provisional authority" -- in consultation with the interim government to be formed in Iraq. 
 An advisory board that would include representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations would have the right to appoint auditors to examine the accounts of the fund.
American officials said today that by incorporating an important role for the United Nations in supervising Iraq's most important industry, they were making a concession to Security Council members that opposed the war in Iraq and were skeptical of lifting sanctions on a country under military occupation.
Administration officials were optimistic about their chances of winning Security Council approval for the resolution, perhaps unanimously. 
The "vital role" that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and President Bush promised for the United Nations centers largely on its representation on the advisory board of the assistance fund and on the role of a new United Nations special coordinator in Iraq. The special coordinator, according to the resolution, would work with "the authority and the people of Iraq with respect to the restoration and establishment of national and local institutions for representative governance." 
There is no mention in the resolution of the United Nations weapons inspection team led by Hans Blix. The American ambassador here, John D. Negroponte, said the United States saw no role for the inspectors "for the foreseeable future."
Knowledgeable diplomats say that France has signaled that, despite misgivings over the occupation of Iraq, it will not veto a resolution to lift the sanctions and may even vote yes. 
French diplomats have said repeatedly in recent weeks that they want to be "pragmatic." 
Russian diplomats have been more inclined to focus on fulfilling the requirements of existing Security Council resolutions. But the draft resolution lacks any explicit mention of the requirement most frequently cited -- that the United Nations weapons inspectors certify Iraq's disarmament. 
In brief remarks to reporters today, Mr. Negroponte emphasized the need for speed in lifting the sanctions, saying, "There is no reason why a resolution lifting the sanctions on Iraq should take a prolonged period of time to discuss, and we think that this should be accomplished within the next couple of weeks."
Mr. Powell began lobbying for the proposal by speaking today with the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer.
Assistant Secretary of State Kim R. Holmes met with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia in Moscow today and is scheduled to land in Berlin on Friday.
A senior administration official said today, "This resolution is designed to get a 15-to-0 vote at the Security Council." The official added, "We think everybody who voted with us last fall, and then lost their way this spring, will accept the fact that, like it or not, the Iraqis should not have to live under sanctions." 
German officials informed the administration this week that they too would support lifting the sanctions, American and German officials said today. Many diplomats predict Russia will go along because the roughly $1.5 billion in contracts for Russian goods sold to Iraq may be honored. It is unclear what will be done about the billions of dollars -- rough estimates run from $6 billion to $8 billion or more -- in debts the former Iraqi government owed Russia.
The resolution would allow the United Nations oil-for-food program, which currently has committed nearly $10 billion to pay for everything from essential foods to heavy industrial goods, to be phased out over four months. The program began in 1996 as a way of easing the sanctions' impact on Iraqi civilians. With the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the Security Council delegated the secretary general to adjust the current obligations and make food, medical and sanitation imports a top priority. 
But the draft resolution authorizes the secretary general to pay only for contracts that provide essential aid like food and medicine, and does not expand it to the more expensive contracts for industrial goods. So it is conceivable that not only the $3.2 billion in unobligated funds currently in the account but a significant portion of the $10 billion already committed could end up in the assistance fund. 
For Bush administration officials, the management of the oil sector is perhaps the most crucial issue. "This is where the graft, corruption, threats and the ability of the previous regime to develop its arsenal of weapons comes from," said an administration official. "It's an area where ordinary Iraqis and people living far away deserve assurance that it's going to be run transparently and honestly."
The assurance, in the American view, is provided by the establishment of the assistance fund to be overseen by an international advisory board that includes representatives of the United Nations Security Council, the I.M.F., the World Bank and "regional institutions." 
The money in the fund is to be held in the Central Bank of Iraq and audited by independent public accountants chosen by the International Advisory Board. The fund will also be the recipient of foreign assistance -- the "vessel" into which outside aid flows, using the term Mr. Powell spoke of last month. 
Assuming that the Iraqi transitional government being assembled is in place by the end of this month, as the United States' current timetable indicates, the United Nations special coordinator would arrive after the first phase of nation-building is complete, but would be in place for the next phase of establishing a permanent Iraqi government.
The resolution's language invests the special coordinator with no explicit authority in the creation of a new Iraqi government and civil institutions, but American officials say the position's authority will rely more on the special coordinator's abilities to work with the various forces in Iraq than on the wording of the resolution. 
The official would also coordinate reconstruction efforts by United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations and promote economic reconstruction "through coordination with national and regional organizations," local authorities, donors and international financial institutions, the resolution said.
All proceeds from future oil sales will flow into the assistance fund, which will be held in the Iraqi central bank. The draft also calls on all nations to seize and transfer any assets held by the ousted regime or its officials to the assistance fund.
Both petroleum products and the revenues from their sale, under the resolution, would be immune from any financial claims made on the Iraqi government or its agents.
The resolution also calls on all nations to "take appropriate steps" to facilitate the return of Iraqi cultural property and antiquities looted in the days immediately after Mr. Hussein's government fell, and to prohibit trade in these items.
While the United States and Britain were negotiating the final form of the draft in the past week, on the military front, a flurry of diplomatic activity was under way to assemble an international coalition of military forces consisting of as many as 17 countries to carry out peacekeeping and security functions in Iraq.

HEADLINE: In Senate, a Dole Is Following a Clinton Path 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
She is the celebrity senator whose first act was to disappear.
 Elizabeth Dole -- twice a Cabinet secretary, the wife of the former Senate majority leader and a former presidential candidate who ran a primary campaign against George W. Bush -- is perhaps the most famous member of this year's new Senate class. When she took her seat in January, the expectation in Washington was that Mrs. Dole, already well schooled in the ways of the capital, would quickly assume a high profile. 
 Instead, the North Carolina Republican has gone underground, everywhere but in her state. She seems to be following the path of another well-known senator with a prominent husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Dole demurs at the question. 
"I think being the new senator from North Carolina, it's important to put North Carolina first for a while," she said in an interview, her first with a national news organization since joining the Senate.
The other Senator Dole -- Mrs. Dole's husband, Bob -- is not so bashful about the comparison. "That's what Hillary did," the former Senate majority leader said, with characteristic bluntness. "I don't think Elizabeth is following anybody's model, but I think Hillary did it about right. You come in with a fairly high profile, the first thing you want to do is get the confidence of your colleagues and let them know you're one of 100."
Most freshmen keep their heads down during their early months in office. Political analysts said it is smart strategy, and Mrs. Clinton, Democrat of New York, called it "an obvious route" for her colleague from North Carolina. Yet Mrs. Dole appears to be turning low profile into a high art.
She has rejected a string of requests for national television appearances, from ABC's "Good Morning America" to CNN's "Larry King Live." She shuns Washington news conferences and waves off reporters who might try to catch her for an off-the-cuff quote. When Senate Republican leaders asked Mrs. Dole to join a rally in support of President Bush's judicial nominees, the answer from her office was the same as always: a firm, polite no.
While she has made herself scarce in Washington, Senator Dole has popped up all over North Carolina, appearing in tiny towns and mountain hamlets most senators would never visit. During the spring recess, she and her aides crisscrossed the state in a rented Dodge, with Mrs. Dole working in the back seat. 
Their destinations included towns like Flat Rock, population 1,690, where Mrs. Dole presented local officials with a federal check to finance the construction of water and sewer lines, and Winterville, population 4,791, where she helped to break ground for a new library and police and fire station.
Mrs. Dole is careful to control her image as a North Carolinian -- so careful that she agreed to an interview only because it took place in the state, at a Marine base, Camp Lejeune. Her aides said a picture of her in her Washington office was out of the question, though a photographer later caught her at a Senate hearing.
None of this shocks North Carolina political consultants. "She largely won the Senate race on star power and it looks to me like she's trying to build a reputation as sort of a workhorse, not a show horse," said Gary Pearce, a Democratic consultant there. "She hasn't done anything that Democrats could much attack here, much as we'd like to."
During her campaign, Senator Dole, who grew up in Salisbury, N.C., but has lived in Washington for decades, was accused of being a carpetbagger. Since the election, the 66-year-old senator has been putting down firmer roots. She is busy remodeling her childhood home, a four-bedroom English Tudor occupied by her 102-year-old mother, who has recently taken in Mr. Dole's dog, a schnauzer named Leader.
"We're undergoing daily renovations and remodeling and redecorating now, at her direction," said Mrs. Dole's brother, John Hanford, who lives 40 miles away, in Charlotte. "She's taking it room by room, to suit her new lifestyle."
Mrs. Dole spent a rainy Friday at Camp Lejeune late last month, meeting privately with military commanders, war widows and marines injured in Iraq. Shortly past 6 p.m., the senator appeared at the door of the guest house where she had spent the previous night, looking fresh and composed in a blue periwinkle suit. True to her reputation for graciousness, she offered her visitor a towel to dry her hands from the rain.
Mrs. Dole said she felt a little overwhelmed when she first entered the Senate -- "You feel like you are changing the tires while the car is running" -- but added that she now feels herself settling in to her job. 
She recently moved to permanent quarters on the first floor of the Senate Russell Building, a big step up from the "little bunker" in a basement she used to occupy. It was so hard to find, she said, she sometimes joked that "Dick Cheney was considering this as a new secure undisclosed location."
In the Senate chamber, Mrs. Dole sits at her husband's old desk, which was offered to her by its most recent occupant, Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat. While the Doles discuss the Senate, she said she doesn't ask for much advice, except about the chamber's arcane rules. "I said, 'You know, all these rules go back to 1884,' and he said, 'Other things are more important right now.' "
Still, being married to the former majority leader has its advantages. When Mrs. Dole was stuck in Washington for a late-night vote, she sent Mr. Dole back to Salisbury to ride in a float in her hometown parade. 
When she set out to persuade the Pentagon to assign new fighter jet squadrons to a base in Cherry Point, N.C., it did not hurt that she was negotiating with Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee -- and happens to be a close friend of Mr. Dole. 
Mrs. Dole is no stranger to national policy, having served as secretary of transportation under President Reagan and secretary of labor under the first President Bush. But her first months in the Senate have been consumed with initiatives to shore up North Carolina's sagging economy. She serves on three committees of importance to her state: banking, agriculture and armed services.
Her first bill calls for federal recognition, and hence federal dollars, for the Lumbee Indian tribe. She is working on a buyout plan for tobacco farmers, and legislation to help customs officials curb illegal textile imports -- a move Mrs. Dole said would save the state's beleaguered textile industry billions of dollars. All would make good on campaign promises. 
"That's Elizabeth," said former Representative Tillie Fowler, a good friend of Mrs. Dole. "This is somebody who wants to keep her word."
Her zeal to represent North Carolina has left some wondering if Mrs. Dole will carve out a niche for herself. On major votes, she has followed party lines. When the Senate considered a nonbinding resolution stating that the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion was "appropriate and secures an important constitutional right," Mrs. Dole was the only one of the 14 women senators who voted against it. Even Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership, voted in favor.
"What agenda is there for her aside from the Bush agenda?" asked Ferrel Guillory, director of a program on Southern politics and the news media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "What does she do, except support what he wants?"
She is reaching across the aisle when she can, making friends with Democrats, for example, in a weekly Senate Bible study session. And as a former president of the American Red Cross, Mrs. Dole joined Mrs. Clinton in a bid to have the International Committee of the Red Cross accept the Israeli counterpart. 
"She's obviously working hard," Mrs. Clinton said. "It is always hard to start a new job, and to do it in the glare of the public spotlight, as both she and I had to do, magnifies all the adjustments. The expectations and the curiosity are intense."
But unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was hardly welcomed by Republican leaders, Mrs. Dole was already part of the close-knit Senate family, and has connections at the highest levels of the Bush administration.
Some analysts wonder when, or if, she will use those connections. "Is there more there?" asked Jenny Backus, a Democratic strategist. "Is she going to be an active senator and move out of her husband's shadow?"
If she has an answer to that question, Mrs. Dole is not giving it away. "I just want to be the best senator from North Carolina," she said, smiling, "that I can possibly be."

HEADLINE: American Empire, Not 'If' but 'What Kind' 

BYLINE:  By IVO H. DAALDER and JAMES M. LINDSAY; Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution in Washington, are co-authors of "America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy," which is to be published this fall.

 BODY:
The 100,000 American troops patrolling Baghdad and other Iraqi cities retain "absolute authority within Iraq," declared their commander, Lt. Gen. David McKiernan. At the same time, American forces are being deployed in a grand crescent surrounding the greater Middle East, from the Balkans southeast to Djibouti, east through the Persian Gulf region into Pakistan and Afghanistan, and north into Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
 Little wonder that commentators at home and abroad continually speak of a new American empire. In the last six months alone, as debate on Iraq peaked, the phrase "American empire" was mentioned nearly 1,000 times in news stories, while bookstores have been quickly filling their shelves with freshly minted tomes on the subject. 
 On one side are those who urge Washington to reject the imperial temptation. These voices can be found on both the far right and the far left. Pat Buchanan, author of "Republic or Empire?" and editor of the new American Conservative Weekly, is concerned that the "conservative movement has been hijacked and turned into a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology," which, he says, is a far cry from the conservative movement he grew up with. Noam Chomsky, whose "Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Domination" is scheduled for publication in the fall, warns that the Bush administration's "forthright declaration that it intends to rule the world by force" amounts to fanaticism. 
On the other side are the so-called neoconservatives, who say the United States has the opportunity to remake the world in its own image. The syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, says American foreign policy should seek to transform the unipolar moment of the 1990's into "the unipolar era." William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, told Fox News recently: "We need to err on the side of being strong. And if people want to say we're an imperial power, fine."
Some commentators go even further, arguing that the problem is not too much American imperialism but too little. In their eyes, Afghanistan taught that failed and failing states threaten American security by providing safe havens for terrorists, drug traffickers, transnational criminal networks and other no-goodniks. "Given the historical baggage that 'imperialism' carries, there's no need for the U.S. government to embrace the term," Max Boot, author of "These Savage Wars of Peace" (Basic Books), wrote this week in USA Today. "But it should definitely embrace the practice." In Iraq this "means imposing the rule of law, property rights and other guarantees, at gunpoint if need be."
The British historian Niall Ferguson makes a similar argument for an imperial America in his new book, "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power."
The Bush administration and its supporters, not surprisingly, recoil at any suggestion that their foreign policy is or should be imperial. "The metaphor is seductive yet vicious," complains Philip Zelikow, director of the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs and someone who helped draft the administration's national security strategy, which was articulated last September.
President Bush has been less direct but no less definitive. In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute in February, he committed the United States to rebuilding Iraq after the war. "America has made and kept this kind of commitment before -- in the peace that followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments."
Yet for all the debate over whether or not the United States should be an empire, that question is beside the point. Like it or not, the power and reach of the United States have already turned it into an empire. Indeed, it has been one in some form or another for more than 100 years, ever since the United States triumphed in the Spanish-American War and American troops occupied Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
And the American imperium did not stop there. In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt engineered Panama's rebellion against Colombia. The next year he asserted the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Washington not only had the right to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere, it also had the right to exercise "an international police power" against any country in the Americas engaged in "chronic wrongdoing." Over the next three decades, the Marines conducted long occupations of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Nicaragua while fulfilling Roosevelt's charge to restore "the ties of civilized society."
The United States did go marching home again after World War I. But it didn't after World War II. Instead Washington built a web of permanently entangling alliances that stretched around the globe. At one point the United States had military bases in more than 70 countries.
Today no other country can begin to match the reach and lethality of the American armed forces. Only the United States can send bombers from its heartland on a round-trip mission to attack targets anywhere around the globe and do so with great stealth, precision and destructive force. Only the United States can quickly dispatch ground forces in large numbers to any battlefield in the world and defeat any traditional foe. Only the United States can deploy a truly blue-water navy across every ocean, with 12 mammoth aircraft carriers each housing a modern air armada larger than the entire air force of most countries.
There is no doubt that the United States can afford this vast military might. The American economy accounts for 31 percent of the world's total output, as much as it did in the 1950's. It is larger than that of the four next-largest national economies (Japan, Germany, France and Britain) combined, and it accounts for almost half the gross domestic product of the G-7 countries (which also include Canada and Italy). At the same time, military spending consumes a smaller share of the American gross domestic product today than it did a decade ago, and only about half of what it did during the height of the cold war. "Being No. 1 at great cost is one thing," the Yale University historian Paul Kennedy marvels. "Being the world's single superpower on the cheap is astonishing."
The real debate, then, is not whether to have an empire, but what kind. Should America pursue a go-it-alone strategy as it did in 1910, when the United States exerted its power largely at the point of the bayonet and ignored the views of others? Or should it be the empire of 1950, when Washington embedded American power in multilateral institutions that reflected American interests but also constrained its freedom of action?
This question was the crux of the dispute with the United Nations over whether to invade Iraq and the one preoccupying the world now as the reconstruction begins.
President Bush has made it clear since Sept. 11 that he intends to lead, and other countries can follow or get out of the way. He and his supporters say the United States embodies a unique blend of might and right that can deliver a world of peace and prosperity for all. To forsake that opportunity in a fit of self-doubt or excessive modesty, they say, will only make Americans and all other peoples less secure.
Critics, by contrast, favor an empire built on international cooperation, alliances and law. They argue that is the only way to reassure countries fearful of American dominance and keep them from using their diplomatic and economic power to contain the United States.
As the Iraq war underscored, the United States' great power enables it to act alone and still achieve many of its goals swiftly and effectively. But over time such a unilateral exercise of power will breed more and more resentment abroad to the point that other states may decide to work together to obstruct the chosen American course. Then, the United States could stand alone, a great power frustrated in the pursuit of its most important goals.

HEADLINE: Colleague Ill, So 30 Toronto Hospital Workers Are in Quarantine 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 9 

 BODY:
Thirty health care workers have been placed in quarantine after a nurse administrator at a major Toronto hospital came down with symptoms that could possibly mean she is suffering from SARS, the respiratory disease that has spurred fears and throttled the city's economy in recent months.
 It has been more than three weeks since a new case of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has been reported here, and officials say it is highly unlikely that the nurse has anything more than a bad respiratory tract infection. 
 But as a precaution, 30 workers at Mount Sinai Hospital were placed in quarantine at home last week, wearing masks around family members, after the nurse administrator suffered a fever and cough. 
"We didn't want to take any chances," said Dr. Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Mount Sinai. "If we were wrong, the consequences for the city would just be so huge."
The possible new case was reported only this week, without fanfare, and the 10-day quarantine for the health care workers ends late Saturday night. Officials of the World Health Organization have complained that Canada has been slow in reporting cases, a charge local health authorities dismiss.
Health officials treated the possible new case as a blip in a rapidly improving picture. The number of active probable cases in the Toronto area stands at 24, which is 15 fewer than a week ago. There has not been a death since April 30. The death toll in Toronto is 23, with no other fatality reported in Canada. Three patients remain in critical or deteriorating condition here.
Almost all of the 7,000 people who have been placed in quarantine are back at their jobs. Hospitals are slowly returning to normal after several were forced to postpone elective surgery to minimize the public's exposure to hospitals where SARS infected dozens of health care workers.
Almost every case in Toronto has been linked to a single elderly Chinese immigrant who returned home with the disease two months ago after visiting her family in Hong Kong. After two SARS cases in the United States and the Philippines were linked to travel to Toronto, the W.H.O. issued a travel advisory on April 23 urging travelers to postpone any unnecessary trips to Toronto.
As for the ailing Mount Sinai nurse administrator, who has not been identified, she is recovering at home and three members of her family are also in quarantine. She was in contact with SARS patients on April 22 but was wearing protective gear at the time.
Officials said she developed a slight cough on April 30, and stayed home the following three workdays. On May 5, she went to the Mount Sinai emergency room complaining that she had a fever. She was kept in the hospital for several days before she was released.
"She continues to do well," Dr. Low said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about a new SARS quarantine of health care workers in Toronto referred incompletely to travel advisories for Toronto. The World Health Organization issued an advisory on April 23 urging travelers to avoid unnecessary trips there, but lifted it six days later.

HEADLINE: Deflation Threat Dismissed 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Miss., May 9 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said today that he saw no significant threat of deflation in the United States, three days after the Federal Reserve warned of a possible fall in inflation. 
 "I don't think the U.S. has any risk of being in any significant deflationary period," Mr. 
Snow told reporters. Any comparison with Japan, where prices have not risen since 1998, "would be inappropriate," he said. 
 Fed officials, including Alan Greenspan, have said that deflation is a remote possibility. 
Mr. Snow later told business leaders in Memphis that deflation was a "monetary phenomenon" and thus something for the Fed to address. "We have very competent leaders at the Federal Reserve, and I'm sure they have the tools to deal with it," he said.

HEADLINE: Get Ready for Britons Bearing 1,290-Pound Stoves 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Will Americans, confused by a lackluster economy and wearied by higher energy costs, pay $12,000 for a nearly five-foot-wide enameled iron stove that has no dials, no gauges -- and is designed to stay on all the time?
 William McGrath, the chief executive of the Aga Foodservice Group, is hoping they will. Aga stoves have been known since the Roaring 20's as an English country house staple; David Oglivy, the famous advertising man, cut his teeth selling Agas in the 1930's. 
 "You have a shooting stick, you have a spaniel, you send your children to some ghastly boarding school and you have an Aga," Mr. Oglivy told the BBC in 1997, describing his upper-crust clientele. 
But selling the Aga to Americans may not be so easy. Agas are still relatively unknown in the United States -- aside from a few celebrities who own them like Dustin Hoffman, Mel Gibson, Billy Joel and Sarah Jessica Parker. Instead, most upper-income Americans (and their decorators) have opted forthe bigger, restaurant-style Vikings, Garlands and Thermadors, priced at $6,000 to $10,000, which, in turn, have spawned dozens of cheaper lookalikes, by everyone from Amana to Frigidaire.
Mr. McGrath, 44, attacks this trend as "soulless stainless," and says the world, and especially Americans, are ready for a change. He plans to go head-to-head against the Vikings, not only with the original 58-inch-wide Aga, but with a new model developed primarily for the States, which comes with the same super-thick enameling but looks and acts more like an American range, for closer to $7,000.
Called the 6-4, the stove has six burners on top, and four ovens; at 39 inches, it is about the same width as most of the "soulless" American cousins.
And it does not stay on all the time. 
This is Aga's first attempt to make the American market a significant part of its stove business. The company, which has headquarters in the West Midlands, England, is introducing a full-scale American campaign, complete with advertising, public relations, new displays and training sessions for both employees and potential customers. 
Last year, Aga sold 7,500 stoves (300 in America); in a few years, the company hopes to sell 10,000, including the 6-4. The chief financial officer said last week that the company hoped to sell 500 in the United States this year. Within the last year, Aga pots have come on the market; a new enameled steel Aga refrigerator (very 1930's looking) will be introduced soon.
Besides selling more Aga-made appliances, the company's goal is to raise the price of Aga stock, which has declined about 27 percent in the last year.
Despite the slip, Mike Costello, a research analyst for Dresden Kleinwort Wasserstein, said that "continued growth and net cash make Aga more secure than most manufacturers."
Two years ago, Aga sold its cast-iron pipe business to a Belgian company for $1.2 billion, paid off some debt, enriched its shareholders by buying back stock at a philanthropic price and bought all or part of two home furnishings concerns: one of them French and the other the American chain of mid-price home furnishings called Domain. 
Domain is headed by Judy George, 62, who founded the Boston-based chain 18 years ago, and will be handling the American distribution of the Aga. Starting soon, Agas will be displayed in the 27 Domain shops and in independent dealers' stores across the United States, focusing initially on the Northeast, "that bastion of Anglophilia," Ms. George said.
Until now, the Aga was limited to the upstairs, downstairs British stately home, with perhaps a few Hollywood villas thrown in.
The coal-burning stove was invented in Sweden in 1922 by Gustav Dalen, a Nobel-winning physicist. (Mr. Dalen was blinded after an acetylene cylinder exploded -- seconds before the accident, he told onlookers that his experiment was perfectly safe.) 
The Aga is made in a foundry in Coalbrookdale, near Birmingham -- the same foundry started by Abraham Darby, the inventor of the smelting process in 1709.
The stove is made pretty much the same way today as it was in the 20's -- except that instead of coal, it now runs on either gas or electricity. A traditional model is almost five feet wide, weighs 1,290 pounds and, before it is installed, requires a home visit by the dealer, who is trained to measure niches, prescribe vents and, in some cases, re-engineer the floors. (Installation costs $700 to $1,200, depending on the model and the type of venting; carpentry is extra. So is shipping.)
But the weight does not matter to a lot of its buyers. (Energy costs do, but the Aga salesmen contend that the largest stove costs only $1 a day to run and is never really hot -- just cozy.) What matters most may be the look; the thick-skinned shiny enamel, which comes in 14 colors, including one akin to a red candy apple, another closer to that of a New York City taxicab. 
"We reject an amazing amount of enameling," Mr. McGrath said. "If it looks different in different lights or if there's a dimple here or there, our customers don't want it." 
Last year, Mr. McGrath opened the company's first London shop on Beauchamp Place, a silver spoon's throw from Sloane Square. "The shop was one of our little breakthroughs," he said. "We'd never had a shop inside the M25, the London ring road. It was part of our move from the countryside to the more urban customer."
One of Aga's new advertisements shows a hip-looking Sloane Ranger in a black cocktail dress standing in front of a black Aga, with an equivocal expression one commentator here interpreted as "You can't actually believe I would wreck my manicure cleaning this thing, do you?" The ad reads: "Welcome to the New Iron Age."
Still, it is not easy to sell an Aga. Even the salesmen admit that new owners need time to perfect their cooking technique. Each oven has a different purpose, and a different name: simmering, roasting, baking and warming ovens. The top burners, with their distinctive chrome covers, can cook hamburgers or sizzle pancake batter. Stews are simmered, not on the stove top where they can dry out, but in the simmering oven, where the moist heat surrounds the dish.
Before Ms. George's company was acquired by Aga, she wanted to try an Aga for herself. 
"I figured if I couldn't cook on it, I wouldn't do the deal," she said.
She made roast stuffed leg of lamb, roast potatoes, rice pilaf, rolls and blueberry surprise -- all at one time.
It all came out fine.

HEADLINE: Korea's New Wave 

BYLINE:  By Suki Kim; Suki Kim is author of "The Interpreter," a novel.

 BODY:
I was born and raised in South Korea until immigrating to the United States in the 1980's when I was 13. Last year, I visited both Koreas and witnessed anti-American protests in Pyongyang and Seoul. Fifty years after the armistice ended the Korean War on July 27, 1953, significant factions on both sides of the 38th Parallel hate America.
 Although North Koreans seem stuck in their 1950's rage with the United States, South Koreans have moved on to resentment. While Seoul boasts the world's largest Starbucks and young South Koreans have gone to desperate measures -- including face lifts and tongue alterations -- to look and sound Western, their anger with the United States is palpable. 
 Korea has a long history of subjugation, by China, Mongolia and Japan. After the liberation from Japan in 1945, the "big brother" role was taken over by the United States. But now, having the third-largest economy in Asia, South Koreans -- especially young ones -- no longer want to be the "little brother." They don't trust Americans and they don't want American troops on their land. They think the two Koreas could unite if America would go away and mind its own business -- a factor President Bush needs to address when he meets with South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, who won the votes of a vast majority of young South Koreans.
When I attended elementary school in South Korea, Kim Il Sung, then North Korea's Great Leader, was depicted in illustrations as a porky, red-faced man with devil-like horns. At lunchtime, teachers told us to finish our rice because of the poor, starving North Korean children who suffered under their ruthless leader. In the school lobby hung a poster with the last words of a child hero, Lee Sung Bok, who was said to have perished at the hands of North Korean soldiers for crying out, "I hate Communists!"
Today, things have changed. School textbooks now credit Kim Il Sung with the defeat of the Japanese occupiers. His son, Kim Jong Il, North Korea's current leader, is honored with the title "chairman." This increasingly positive perception of North Korea reflects cultural and historical ties. More than 10 million families were separated by the war, and for Confucians, there is no greater sin than abandoning one's family. Even though a half-century has passed since the war, the desire to be reunified is at the core of Korean culture.
Young South Koreans have no recollection of the war. What they remember are the American-supported military-backed dictators who ruled through the late 80's and exploited the North Korean threat to silence anyone who disagreed with them. As a result, the younger generation distrusts the government. Young Koreans believe that the Korean War was never truly a civil war, but rather a proxy conflict for the cold war enemies, and they blame the United States for standing in the way of re-unification.
Their picture of one happy Korea fails to consider Kim Jong Il's propensity for nuclear weapons and his monoculture of the Great Leader. Now North Korea, where some two million people have died from starvation, is seen as the poor sibling, whom the rest of the world has abandoned because of America's hostile policy. This sympathy has little to do with Kim Jong Il's regime and more to do with a desire to be independent of the United States. 
President Roh's wavering stance toward America since the election is not giving them confidence, and President Bush's "axis of evil" rhetoric is aggravating the wound. We will see if next week's meeting does much to reconcile this younger generation. The problem is that young South Koreans have been taught not to listen. The disillusionment stems largely from the legacy of the Korean War and America's role in perpetuating it.

HEADLINE: Tall Tales Of Appalachia 

BYLINE:  By John O'Brien; John O'Brien is the author of "At Home in the Heart of Appalachia," a memoir and social history.

DATELINE: GREEN BANK, W.Va. 

 BODY:
CBS is developing a reality TV series modeled after "The Beverly Hillbillies," the 60's sitcom. A poor family from a remote corner of southern Appalachia will be transported to a California mansion, the ensuing comic antics shown to America. 
 Well, as a West Virginia farmer might say, that's a load of fertilizer. Having spent virtually my entire life in West Virginia, I can say with some authority that the strange, woebegone place called Appalachia and the hillbillies who inhabit it are a myth -- one devised a century ago to justify outsiders' condescension and exploitation. 
 In the 1870's, there was no "Appalachia." At that time, this mountainous stretch of the country from West Virginia to northern Georgia was one of the most prosperous agricultural areas in America. The people here drew upon their English, German and Scotch-Irish roots to create a variety of vibrant, peaceful cultures. 
But in the 1880's that started to change. Outsiders came, ones who didn't care about the thriving farms. They wanted raw materials for their factories, and the mountains had them. Our mountains were covered with the largest and oldest hardwood forest that people hadever seen. The coal deposits were the richest in the world. Industrialization came here like a cyclone roaring through the mountains. People like my ancestors were bullied, threatened and cheated out of their land. By 1920, timber companies had cut the entire forest. Most of the profits left the state along with the timber and coal. 
As the mountains were denuded, the industrialists portrayed the families they were robbing as "backward people" and themselves as the prophets of progress. The missionaries who often accepted large donations from the industrialists exaggerated the "otherness" of these strange people. "Local color" writers made brief visits to the mountains, then wrote fanciful books about the queer, violent mountain folk. As realistic as Harlequin romances, local-color books like Mary Murfree's "In the 'Stranger People's' Country" were read and reviewed as journalistic accounts. 
College professors began to use them as textbooks in sociology classes. The news media took its part with the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud in the 1880's and 1890's -- a conflict that as Altina L. Waller wrote in her book "Feud," was not really a family feud, but a war between coal mining interests and local interests. Corrupt politicians took isolated incidents and described them as a hillbilly feud. 
Reporters from the big cities wrote about "white savages" and "West Virginia barbarians." (The New York Times, for example, said of people in eastern Kentucky: "They are remarkably good shots and effective assassins," adding that they "are so accustomed to murder that they do not look upon it with the horror with which it is regarded in civilized communities.") Then, in 1897, the president of Berea College in Kentucky, William Goodell Frost, desperately trying to raise money for his failing institution, created a fund-raising campaign based on the idea of saving the people in the Appalachians from themselves. In an Atlantic Monthly article, Frost described the southern Appalachians as our "contemporary ancestors" waking up from a Rip van Winkle-type sleep and in need of help in joining modern America. Frost's article made mythic Appalachia and its backward hillbillies a permanent fixture in America's imaginary landscape.
Many in the southern Appalachians are certainly poor, but the poverty grew out of the vagaries of the coal market and outsiders' control of resources. Industrialists and others, however, blamed the people for their own poverty, and this myth continues because it is entertaining to the Americans beyond the mountains. Some of the region's middle-class writers continue to churn out Gothic hillbilly tales, the descendants of local-color stories.
This mythology has even been accepted by the people living here. Not long ago, one of the student counselors at West Virginia University told me that the most persistent problem she encounters is a lack of self-esteem. Bright, capable, young men and women do not think they belong in college because they are hillbillies. I have taught at a small private college in West Virginia. Ninety percent of the students were from out of state. The few West Virginians on campus huddled together in their own corner of the student union. They had become marginal people in their own state.
My own father spent his life backing up, apologizing for the space he took up in the world. He took the hillbilly stereotype to heart and all of his life believed that he was backward and inferior -- a despair I, too, have been trying to escape all of my life. 
The reality show that CBS is considering not only exploits my part of the world, it also separates struggling Appalachians from the rest of the American poor. If a television network proposed a "real life" show treating poor African-Americans, Latinos, American Indians, Asians or Jews as curiosities, they, and all Americans of good will, would be justifiably outraged.
Many of us in the southern Appalachians are outraged too. That's why coal miners from the southern Appalachians plan to protest "The Real Beverly Hillbillies" outside the shareholders' meeting on May 21 of CBS's parent, Viacom. It's time the people of the southern Appalachians stood up for themselves.

HEADLINE: Sales Decline at French Media Company 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 9 

 BODY:
Lagardere, the large French media company, said today that first-quarter sales fell 12 percent, hurt by lower revenue at its aerospace business. 
 Total sales dropped to 2.72 billion euros ($3.13 billion) from 3.08 billion euros a year earlier, Lagardere said. 
Revenue from Lagardere Media, the largest division with magazines like Elle, rose 1 percent, to 1.91 billion euros. 
 Lagardere, which also owns 15 percent of the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company, known as EADS, has been expanding its media business in the last two years to lower its dependence on the military and aerospace businesses. EADS, the primary owner of Airbus S.A.S., said on Tuesday that first-quarter sales fell 14 percent, as airlines put off deliveries because of the war in Iraq and slower economies. 
Shares in Lagardere fell 52 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 33.93 euros in Paris. The stock has declined 12 percent this year. 
One division, Hachette Filipachi Medias, publisher of more than 220 magazines including Woman's Day, benefited from an increase in advertising that started in the fourth quarter, especially in the United States, Lagardere said. 
Lagardere agreed in October to buy Vivendi Universal's publishing division for 1.2 billion euros, to add the Larousse and Le Robert dictionaries and the educational publisher Nathan. The transaction is being reviewed by European antitrust authorities.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Amid Concerns Over Deflation, Bond Market Has Strong Week

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The bond market had its best week in years, the stock market eked out small gains and the dollar fell sharply after the Federal Reserve's surprise announcement that it was worried that continued economic weakness could convert falling inflation rates into a bout of deflation.
 The announcement by the Fed, which was made Tuesday, was a double plus for the bond market, where investors expect interest rates to decline, and prices to rise, in the face of weak economic growth and low or declining inflation. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note, which was little changed yesterday, finished the week at 3.68 percent, compared with 3.93 percent a week ago, a 6.4 percent fall that was the biggest weekly percentage decline in yield since October 1998. 
 For equities, the Fed's concerns about economic weakness reduced Tuesday's gains and sent the market lower on Wednesday and Thursday. But all three main stock gauges bounced back yesterday, each rising at least 1.3 percent. Only the Dow Jones industrial average, however, closed higher than it was on Tuesday, the day of the Fed announcement. 
While current economic data is disappointing, the Fed's apparent new policy is to keep interest rates low, even if the economy picks up its pace, to ensure that the decline in inflation does not accelerate. Currently, core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, is around 1.5 percent.
That Fed policy should be beneficial for stocks in the long run, as faster economic growth and a small pickup in inflation -- which provides room for price increases -- should both be good for corporate profits.
The dollar, which was little changed yesterday, was down 2.2 percent for the week against the euro and 1.6 percent against the yen. It was the fifth consecutive weekly decline for the dollar against the euro. The dollar also fell 1.7 percent against the Canadian dollar, 2.3 percent against the Swiss franc and 2.2 percent against the Australian dollar.
Slower economic growth here is bad for the dollar, as fewer foreign investors are attracted to the American stock market. In addition, interest rates here moved much lower than those in Europe last week, making the United States bond market less enticing to foreigners. The dollar was also hurt by the hint from the Fed that it would reduce rates further if the economic weakness continues or there is an acceleration in the decline in inflation.
The most recent data from the Treasury shows that the flow of foreign investment into the United States bond and stock markets slowed for the third consecutive month in February, falling 31.2 percent from January.
Another thing hurting the dollar is the growing current account deficit the United States has with the rest of the world. That deficit, which includes profits on investments as well as trades in goods and services, has to be covered with foreign dollar inflows. When they slow, one consequence can be a weakening of the dollar.
On the other hand, a falling dollar should spur economic growth here by helping American exporters be more competitive abroad by lowering the price of their goods to foreigners. For example, domestic automakers should be able to be more competitive with Japanese and European competitors as the price of their cars rises for Americans.
In trading yesterday, the Dow rose 113.38 points, or 1.3 percent, to 8,604.60, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 13.14 points, or 1.4 percent, to 933.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 30.46 points, or 2 percent, to 1,520.15. The Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500 index have now risen for four consecutive weeks and hit new highs for the year Tuesday. The Dow, now up three of the four last weeks, is still 238.02 points below its 2003 high of 8,842.62.
Technology stocks continued to lead the Nasdaq higher and also helped to lift the S.& P. 500-stock index and, to a lesser extent, the Dow. Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel and Dell were among the market leaders yesterday. In the four consecutive weeks that the Nasdaq has risena total of 11.9 percent, the information technology index of the S.& P. 500 was up 13.3 percent while the telecommunications services index rose 11.2 percent. The other leading category in that period was chemical, steel, paper, plastic and other materials; that index was up 8.6 percent.
Another plus for stocks has been the better-than-expected growth in corporate earnings for the first quarter. With reports from 448 companies in the S.& P. 500 index and forecasts for the rest, earnings are up 12.9 percent over the first quarter of 2002, according to Thomson First Call. That beats the Jan. 1 forecast of 11.7 percent from Wall Street analysts.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 991 7/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.68 percent, from 3.70 percent Thursday.
The dollar, which is down 8.7 percent this year against the euro, inched higher yesterday as the euro slipped to $1.1488. The dollar rose against the yen to 117.19 yen, from 116.88 Thursday.
The price of crude oil for June delivery jumped 74 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $27.72 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Bloomberg News reported that the Army Corps of Engineers said that the date for the return to oil production in Iraq will be delayed at least six months, until January, because of damage from looting. For the week, the price of crude oil shot up 8 percent but is still well below its recent high of $37.83 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Summer May Bring a Bottled Water Price War 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The bottled water industry is on the verge of a price war that could drive down the substantial profit margins enjoyed by bottlers like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestle and, according to some analysts, drive smaller competitors out of business. 
 Earlier this year, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers lowered the prices of Dannon water by 25 percent at grocery stores and mass retailers like Wal-Mart. In those stores, the company soon edged ahead of its chief rivals: Nestle, the industry leader, with 38 percent of the domestic bottled water business, and PepsiCo, which makes Aquafina, the leading brand of water. 
 In response to pricing pressure, CG Roxane, which sells the Crystal Geyser brand, lowered its prices. Pepsi and Nestle, which markets several regional brands including Poland Spring and Deer Park, have not committed themselves to lowering prices, but have said they will defend their positions, setting the stage for what could be a summer of water wars. 
The bottled water industry, the fastest- growing segment of the beverage business, has become a lifeline of sorts for cola companies that have been struggling to revive slumping soda sales. But competition among major beverage companies is becoming more intense as growth in the industry slows and consumers show a willingness to purchase less expensive private-label brands. 
Analysts are skeptical that a full-scale price war like the cola wars of the 1990's will erupt. But if companies see their profit margins erode significantly, they could look for profits someplace else, most likely by raising prices of carbonated soft drinks, analysts said. 
"If you look at the economics of the water business, rational players would stop reducing their prices from here because if they don't, they will not be making money in the supermarket channel," said William Pecoriello, a beverage analyst at Morgan Stanley. "You can point to the cola wars, the fast food wars, where even though you can look at traditional economics, there are market share battles that take place where the players aren't rational."
The latest round of aggressive marketing began shortly after the Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers agreed last year to become the sole distributors of Group Danone's bottled water brands in the United States. With the agreement, Coke added Evian, a high-end water brand, and Dannon waters, which are less expensive and are considered low-tier waters. Coke already had a midprice water offering in its Dasani brand.
Brands vary by price, pedigree and process -- purified versus spring water, for example -- but they are all basically the same thing. "They all hydrate equally well," said John D. Sicher, the editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
The products at the center of the pricing turmoil are lower-tier bottled waters that tend to sell well in outlets like discount club chains, grocery stores and discount stores like Wal-Mart. Bottled water sales in those types of stores, called take-home channels in the industry, have posted double-digit growth in the last year, analysts said.
In these stores, the gross profit margin on water, which is usually sold in multipacks of 16 or 24 bottles, is about 22.4 percent, according to a Morgan Stanley research report. In convenience stores, where waters are usually sold in single-serve bottles, the margins are much higher, at 58 percent, according to the report. But sales of single-serve waters have begun to slow, causing beverage companies to depend more heavily on sales of multipacks in grocery stores, analysts said.
Beverage makers are "taking the high margins away in the grocery channel, which will mean that it may even put some pressure on immediate consumption," Mr. Bellas said. "You can't have too big a disparity. Those are important channels, and that's where most of the carbonated soft drink companies wanted to raise price, and now they're going in the opposite direction. It's a very controversial strategy." 
The beverage companies have not yet seen the impact of the water wars on their bottom lines. Bottled water makes up just 2 percent of Coca-Cola's profits in the United States, analysts said, but the business is viewed as an important part of the company's portfolio. The real threat, analysts said, is what could happen to water margins two or three years down the road.
Officials at Nestle declined to discuss their strategy for bottled water. But Jane Lazgin, a company spokeswoman, said Nestle would protect its market share.
Nestle has already introduced Nestle Pure Life, a lower-end brand that is beginning to show up on grocers' shelves across the country. Pepsi has planned a national promotion and marketing campaign for Aquafina for the summer, but the company has no plans to lower prices. In fact, its bottlers have raised prices since last year.
"We're still in the sweet spot for the category and have no real motivation to get down into the price wars that are going on right now," said Steve Sears, the vice president for marketing of noncarbonated beverages at Pepsi. "We also know from years of carbonated soft drink success that nobody wins at these price wars, and that eventually they'll all tire of making no money." 
Still, there is speculation among beverage analysts that if the price wars become heated, Pepsi may decide to introduce a lower-tier water brand to protect Aquafina, which competes as a moderately priced product. Mr. Sears said his company was looking at a number of options.
John R. Alm, the president and chief operating officer of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler, said there were no plans to increase prices on Dannon brands, even though the lower-tier brands have yet to turn a profit. Mr. Alm said his company was betting on a long-term strategy for growth. 
"We firmly believe that there will be profitability in every one of the bottled water categories," Mr. Alm said. "There has to be or we won't last."
In the face of a probable decline in water profits, beverage companies are looking to new product lines. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are both exploring milk-based drinks that could appeal to the health-conscious and to parents looking for a substitute for sugary or caffeinated drinks for children. Coca-Cola has also expressed interest recently in the coffee business. The company tested two coffee-making machines at restaurants in Atlanta, but has yet to decide what it will do next, company officials said.

HEADLINE: Air Shuttle Services Facing Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Airlines operating East Coast shuttles have traditionally courted travelers with all the zeal of a lovesick bachelor. They hand out free magazines, provide express check-in and sometimes shower frequent fliers with triple miles.
 What is occasionally missing these days, though, are the planes. 
 Falling demand has prompted Delta Air Lines and US Airways to scale back their hourly weekday schedules for the first time in the decade that they have offered shuttle flights between Boston, New York and Washington. The first time, that is, other than immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
Now, travelers sometimes must wait up to two hours for a flight. And though the airlines say that they still keep planes standing by to handle overflow crowds, Delta recently watered down its shuttle guarantee: passengers denied a seat because of overbooking are promised another flight within a half-hour, rather than 15 minutes.
On US Airways, meanwhile, economy-class passengers on some shuttle flights will lose three inches of legroom next month, as the airline begins using planes with first-class cabins that squeeze space in coach.
All this may signal the end of the golden age of the East Coast shuttles, a travel mainstay since Eastern Airlines, now defunct, first began running such flights in 1961. The airlines offering shuttle service, the passengers flying them and the amenities on board have changed over the years. But the shuttles' schedules and reliability generally stayed consistent. And during boom years, they have been among their operators' most profitable flights.
These days, though, shuttles with pared-down service have to compete for businesspeople who are migrating to tele- and video-conferencing and to Amtrak trains. For some loyal fliers, the attraction of the shuttles could be wearing thin.
"They should keep this concept of it being like a train," said John Shirey, a product manager for a credit card processing company who was waiting at La Guardia Airport on Wednesday evening for a US Airways shuttle to Boston. "If there's a seat when you show up, you get on. Taking out some flights during the day bothers me."
Kevin Joyce, an investment banker who was catching a shuttle to Washington that day at Logan Airport in Boston, agreed. "It's not as good as it used to be," he said. "Before, you could finish up your meeting and show up at the airport and never be more than 20 or 30 minutes from the next flight." 
Delta and US Airways say they intend to return to hourly schedules next month. But they could drop those plans if travelers stay grounded. US Airways had said it would restore flights on May 3, but decided to extend its cutbacks.
The number of shuttle passengers has plummeted since 2000. About 380,000 people flew on Delta and US Airways shuttles in the first two months of this year, down 29 percent from the period three years ago, according to the government's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
In April, Delta and US Airways cut weekday shuttle schedules as much as 25 percent. US Airways trimmed to 12, from 15, the number of daily flights on its New York-Boston and New York-Washington routes, eliminating departures at 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. The airline cut its Washington-Boston weekday schedule to 12 daily flights by taking out two morning departures each way.
Delta began running shuttle flights every two hours rather than every hour from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays and Sundays to and from New York. (Delta's Washington-Boston service is not a shuttle operation.)
The oversupply of shuttle seats worsened in October when American Airlines, a unit of AMR, started its own shuttle flights serving the same three cities, though it uses smaller regional jets and offers fewer flights than the other airlines. American flew 34,300 passengers on its New York-Washington and New York-Boston shuttles in the first two months of the year.
"I think the shuttle market is ripe for a rethink, but the airlines are not good at rethinking," said Joe Brancatelli, an advocate for business travelers who writes an Internet column. "So they just cut back on service, and this makes people angry."
Stacy Ehrlich, a lawyer from Washington, said she and a colleague showed up at La Guardia Airport on Tuesday afternoon to catch the 3:30 Delta shuttle from New York to Boston, only to find it had been cut from the schedule. They decided to take the 2:30 flight, even though her colleague needed to participate in a conference call at 2 p.m. He used his cellphone for the call as he boarded the plane, she said. "We kept asking, 'What happened to the 3:30?' " Ms. Ehrlich said. "We just assumed the flights ran every hour."
Even before April, the airlines had been canceling an increasing number of shuttle flights, though they did not make wholesale changes to their weekday schedules. In the first two months of this year, Delta had 1,498 departures and US Airways 1,490 departures on the New York-Washington route, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. For Delta, that was a 19 percent drop from 2001 levels; for US Airways, it represented a 16 percent drop.
Amy Kudwa, a spokeswoman for US Airways, attributed the decline at her airline to the elimination of 6 a.m. departures from the weekend schedule and to bad weather one weekend in February. Catherine Stengel, a Delta spokeswoman, said that after Sept. 11, Delta began canceling more weekend flights because traffic was less "robust."
Mike Bell, Delta's vice president for schedule planning, said that Delta was trying to manage overcapacity by switching all its shuttle flights from Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which mostly have 155 seats, to 737-300's, which have 120 seats.
"There's always concern any time you roll back service," he said. "You're concerned about failing to capture your customers."
US Airways is also switching some of its shuttle operation to 737-300's, but in a manner that will leave many passengers with less legroom. Starting in June, it will use the two-cabin aircraft on its Washington-Boston route, Ms. Kudwa said, instead of single-cabin Airbus A-319's. The 737's will have a dozen first-class seats with three more inches of legroom than in coach class in the Airbus jets; the 114 economy-class seats will have three inches less.
"It's unfortunate they're going to get more crowded," said Eric Anderson, a six-foot computer networking consultant from Maine who was catching a shuttle from New York to Boston on Wednesday.
Both Delta and US Airways have policies aimed at ensuring that any traveler who arrives at a shuttle gate shortly before departure will get on a flight promptly.
Since September, US Airways has promised that shuttle passengers who arrive at the gate within 10 minutes of a scheduled departure and cannot get on the flight will be put on a plane within a half-hour or receive a $200 travel voucher.
Until recently, Delta had a more generous policy. If a passenger arrived within five minutes of departure and was denied a seat, Delta would put the passenger on a backup plane within 15 minutes or provide a free one-way shuttle ticket. In March, Delta stretched the wait to 30 minutes and said the guarantee applied only on nonholiday weekdays.
Problems from overbooking are now made worse by the cutbacks in departure schedules. If no backup planes are available, lines for later flights can stretch to hundreds of people when there is a gap of two hours between departures. At some points in the last month, shuttle terminals at La Guardia and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington have resembled refugee camps for the laptop-and-cellphone set.
Even outside of those chaotic times, shuttle loyalists have bristled at the increasingly cramped flights during rush hours.
The schedule cutbacks "make it more crowded in the late afternoon, early evening hours, like now," said Michael Hennelly, a publicist at an association of copper manufacturing companies, as he stepped off a Delta shuttle at La Guardia on Wednesday evening. "It'll be easier when they add more flights back."
Outside the terminal, Mr. Hennelly joined a long line of men and women in dark suits waiting for cabs. The sun slipped low, and some of the last shuttle jets of the day lifted off over Flushing Bay. There were fewer and fewer of them traversing the skies.

HEADLINE: Bronx Man Is Charged In a Series Of Rapes 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
The police have arrested a Bronx man who they believe has raped five women and robbed several since January during attacks in elevators in Chelsea and the Bronx.
 The suspect, Tyrone Williams, 23, was arrested in front of his home on Thursday night, the police said, and was charged with rape, sodomy and robbery. 
The arrest came on the day Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case. 
 The police received two tips from callers that helped lead to Mr. Williams' arrest, said Deputy Inspector Susan Morley, chief of the Special Victims Division. 
In a curious coincidence, Mr. Williams was also identified as a suspect almost simultaneously through a DNA match using a sample from the scene of a January rape, Inspector Morley said. Mr. Williams's DNA was on file in a state database because he had served time for a 1999 burglary conviction.
Five victims have identified Mr. Williams as their attacker, Inspector Morley said, and a sixth has not yet had a chance to view him in a lineup. In one of the six attacks, the victim was sexually assaulted but not raped. 
"We believe we have the right person for all six events," Mr. Kelly said. 
The first attack was on Jan. 15, in Chelsea, the police said, and the latest was on May 2, also in Chelsea. The suspect carried out robberies on four occasions, the police said.
Mr. Williams, who is unemployed, has worked as a messenger and attended classes at Long Island University, Inspector Morley said. He has a criminal record dating to 1997 that includes burglary and grand larceny convictions, the police said, and had finished his parole on the burglary conviction on April 12.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg: High Marks 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding the results of the Quinnipiac University poll about the public's appraisal of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (City Hall Memo, front page, May 8): 
 I do not want to go to dinner with Mayor Bloomberg either. He inherited a major economic disaster from the previous administration, and he is doing his very best to address the city's economic problems. 
I am glad that the public gave him high marks for his leadership and intelligence. Along with his honesty and hard work, they are the necessary ingredients for a menu plan for a properly balanced economic recovery. 
We elected the mayor to be a viable leader, not a dinner companion!

HEADLINE: A Neighbor's Vision of the New Iraq 

BYLINE:  By M. Javad Zarif; M. Javad Zarif is ambassador of Iran to the United Nations.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, when Saddam Hussein started attacking commercial ships in the Persian Gulf, initiating the "tanker war," Iran proposed the establishment of a security and cooperation arrangement in the region to prevent the widening of theIran-Iraq war and to ensure stability in the area. This idea was later enshrined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 598. The resolution brought the Iran-Iraq war to an end, but the provision on regional security foundered. 
 Likewise, when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was brought to an end in 1991, the Security Council once more underlined the need for regional security, but again nothing was put in place. In retrospect, those proposed security systems, under an appropriate international umbrella, could have spared our region two decades of devastation and tragedy. 
 Now, with the menace of Saddam Hussein gone, it remains to be seen whether the Iraqi people and the region as a whole will benefit, or whether we will see chaos in Iraq and a new round of instability in the area. 
There is an international consensus -- extremists of all sides notwithstanding -- that stability and moderation in the region are pivotal for global security and prosperity. Yet efforts by the major powers to attain these objectives through the old paradigm of political domination, force projection and imposition of their will have produced little but conflict, insecurity, arms races, dictatorship and extremism. Iran has suffered tremendously; we have a vested national security interest in helping to reverse this trend and replace it with participation, moderation and confidence. 
The devastating effects of the invasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein's regime in 1980, as well as protracted instability in Afghanistan over two decades -- producing terrorism, drug trafficking and an influx of refugees -- have given rise to a strong national consensus in Iran that confrontation, regardless of outcome, brings nothing but death, destruction and tremendous waste of valuable human and material resources. 
Iran has no territorial ambitions and has not invaded any neighboring country for close to two and a half centuries. Thus, while prepared to defend our dignity, we have opted to build strong relationships with our neighbors and will continue to do so. We further believe that it is time to finally establish an indigenous and internationally guaranteed regional security arrangement under United Nations auspices. 
The momentum created by the removal of Saddam Hussein should be used to replace mistrust and the arms race with mutual security and transparency. As the region's largest and the most populous country, Iran has a great stake in discouraging a renewed arms race, especially one involving unconventional weapons. Furthermore, considering our huge reconstruction needs and a young population requiring a large portion of our limited resources, a costly arms race is counterproductive and obviously contrary to our security interests.
We also understand that developing nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction does not enhance Iran's security. That is why it is party to more international disarmament treaties than almost any other country in the region. As for recent complaints by the Bush administration, Iran would have no difficulty showing maximum transparency with regard to its nuclear energy program, provided that reciprocal guarantees for access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes can be provided by the international community, particularly the United States. It is our right as well as our obligation to future generations to acquire peaceful nuclear, chemical and biological technology under the relevant international rules. It would be inconsiderate of the needs of future generations to allow oil and gas, a finite resource, to remainour only source of energy and our major source of foreign exchange.
The rising extremism in the region is as much a threat to Iran as it is to the West. Long before the 9/11 tragedies, Iran nearly went to war with the Taliban and their masters in Al Qaeda who had murdered Iranians inside Iran and Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. We provided vital assistance to the Northern Alliance before the defeat of the Taliban, and have supported the creation and stabilization of the new government.
However, while we have a high stake in defeating extremism, we cannot accept many of the tactics employed to this end by the United States. Bare and brutish force may reap some rapid benefits, but in the long run it creates a more fertile breeding ground for extremism. This phenomenon has spread largely as a response to lack of justice and political participation. It can be removed only by addressing the root causes that gave rise to it in the first place. 
Our region needs reform geared toward greater participation, respect for the rule of law and human rights. Reform, however, must be homegrown. Democracy cannot be imported, let alone imposed by tanks and missiles. Indigenous models of reform and participation may not be as fully articulated as the systems of the West (which has had its own periods of trial and tribulation). Reform efforts like that within Iran should be seen as a process rather than a project -- with the attendant ups and downs, setbacks and victories. But in the final analysis, these are the only models that Middle Eastern people can truly claim ownership of, and that can withstand the pressures of time and changing geopolitical circumstances.
The most urgent test case is Iraq. The challenge is how to move to a peaceful, democratic, inclusive and representative system on the ashes of one of the most brutal dictatorships in recent memory. While all members of the international community must help in the process of stabilization and reconstruction, no one from the region or outside can or should impose his image of a democratic and peaceful Iraq on its people. The people of Iraq are inheritors of a great civilization and possess vast human and natural resources. They have the right and most certainly the ability to determine their destiny. Iran is prepared to fully support and contribute to any genuine process by the Iraqi people in this direction, a process that should also enjoy the legitimacy of the United Nations. We do not seek to interfere or impose any type of government on the Iraqi people, and believe all should refrain from doing so. 
Iran and its neighbors have paid the price for three wars that took a tremendous toll on human life, economic stability and national and regional trust. We cannot afford to lose yet another opportunity. No short-term interest or political or ideological design is important enough to allow confrontation, imposition, exclusion and rivalry to prevail. We must all join in building a better future for our region.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Complete Ban On Products With Asbestos 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Asbestos should be banned from all new products sold in the United States, according to a draft study from a panel that included doctors, business and government experts and union representatives.
 The use of asbestos, a heat-resistant mineral put in insulation, roofing tiles and brakes, has fallen drastically since the early 1970's, when it was conclusively linked to lung and other cancers. Asbestos mining ended in the United States last year. 
 Still, more than 26 million pounds of asbestos, mainly from mines in Canada, was added to brakes, roofing materials and other products in 2001, compared with 1.5 billion pounds in 1972. An additional 90 million pounds of cement that contained asbestos was imported from Mexico or Canada in 2001, according to the study.
The study, titled Asbestos Strategies, was conducted by the Global Environment and Technology Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes environmentally friendly development, under a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. Its conclusions were reported this week by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Prolonged exposure to asbestos has been proved to cause cancer and asbestosis, a painful and sometimes fatal scarring of the lungs. But scientists continue to debate the risks of low levels of exposure. The rates of mesothelioma, a fatal cancer caused by asbestos that takes 20 to 40 years to develop, peaked in the mid-1990's and have fallen slightly since, according to data from the National Cancer Institute. In 2000, a person younger than 55 had one in a million chance of developing mesothelioma. Levels of serious asbestosis have also dropped.
Nevertheless, many scientists say that even low levels of asbestos can sometimes cause mesothelioma, and when asbestos is found in the air, building owners can be forced to remove it at great expense. Many European countries already ban asbestos, and the European Union has said that all its members must ban it by 2005.
The report argues that to reduce risk and lower costs for building owners, Congress should ban "the production, manufacture, distribution, and importation of products with commercially added asbestos." Insulation or other products that contain trace amounts of naturally occurring asbestos should be excluded from the ban, according to the study.
The report also calls for a national registry of mesothelioma victims "to facilitate epidemiology studies to evaluate the effects of asbestos exposure." Some doctors and plaintiffs' lawyers say that the number of mesothelioma cases is underreported because the cancer grows slowly and can be difficult to diagnose.
In 2001, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, introduced legislation to ban asbestos and create a mesothelioma registry. The bill did not make it out of committee, but Todd Webster, Senator Murray's spokesman, said she planned to reintroduce the bill in coming months.
"Senators, like most Americans, think asbestos was banned long ago," Mr. Webster said. "Asbestos is still not banned, and still not safe."
He added that the "report is the most powerful statement yet on the need to ban asbestos and makes it nearly impossible for anyone to oppose this needed legislation."
A secretary at the Asbestos Institute, a Montreal group that promotes the use of asbestos, said no one at the institute was available to comment on the report.
The report comes as a bipartisan group of senators works on legislation to end all lawsuits related to asbestos and create a $100 billion trust fund to compensate victims of asbestos disease.

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks a Free Trade Zone With the Mideast by 2013 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., May 9 

 BODY:
President Bush today offered a powerful economic incentive to the nations of the Arab world by proposing the creation of a United States-Middle East free trade area by 2013.
 In a commencement speech to 1,200 graduates of the University of South Carolina, Mr. Bush promoted the trade deal as a symbol of American commitment to an Arab world alienated by two American-led wars in two Muslim countries in the last two years, and as a means of bringing stability to a region bypassed by globalization and torn by terrorism. 
 "The Arab world has a great cultural tradition, but is largely missing out on the economic progress of our time," said Mr. Bush, who stood out among the maroon South Carolina robes in a deep blue graduation robe from Yale, his alma mater. The trade deal, he said, would bring the Middle East into an "expanding circle of opportunity." 
Mr. Bush also said that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who left tonight for the Middle East, and Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, would meet with regional leaders in Jordan next month to discuss economic liberalization.
"We will work with our partners to ensure that small and midsized businesses have access to capital, and support efforts in the region to develop central laws on property rights and good business practices," Mr. Bush said. "By replacing corruption and self-dealing with free markets and fair laws, the people of the Middle East will grow in prosperity and freedom."
Administration officials acknowledged that the idea of creating a free-trade zone that would stretch across North Africa and Asia from the Atlantic faced enormous hurdles. "This is not something that's going to occur tomorrow," a senior administration official said. Officials noted that the 23-nation region had more trade barriers than any other part of the world and that many of the countries had highly restricted economies. Some of the nations -- Libya, Syria and Iran -- are operating under United States economic sanctions.
Today a senior administration official said that some nations were clearly more ready than others for joining a Middle East free trade area. The United States would work with the countries of the region in a series of graduated steps, the official said, and those that demonstrated sufficient economic and political reform would become eligible for inclusion in the deal.
Officials said that the United States government would continue to help countries that demonstrated reforms to become members of the World Trade Organization.
Democrats praised Mr. Bush's approach as an important step toward pressuring nations in the region to make economic and political reforms, but said it was unclear how far and how quickly the administration was willing to go in lifting trade barriers that hurt the Middle East.
Edward Gresser, a former Clinton administration official who is now a trade analyst with the Democratic Progressive Policy Institute, said that the administration should immediately lift tariffs on such Middle East products as olive oil, figs, dates, leather goods, luggage and clothes to make them cheaper in the United States and create jobs in the Arab world. "That's where you could really get a lot of benefit and people to work," Mr. Gresser said.
Both Mr. Gresser and Bush administration officials today pointed to the success of the trade deal between Jordan and the United States, signed during the Clinton administration and ratified during the Bush administration, which in the last year increased imports of Jordanian goods to the United States by 80 per cent, to $412 million. Mr. Gresser said that the deal has put 40,000 people in Jordan to work since 2000.

Karl Rove's Campaign Strategy Seems Evident: It's the Terror, Stupid

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
Hailed as the White House's political genius, Karl Rove was as ebullient and unrevealing as the Great Oz in journeying here this week for no apparent reason. He seemed to be scouting restlessly for some Tin Man or Cowardly Lion among the passel of Democrats on the campaign road that passes through here next winter.
 "A complete nerd," Mr. Rove said by way of smiling self-introduction to political science students at St. Anselm College. 
 But a canny enough nerd at that. Crowds of political junkies reached to touch the hem of his garment, but Mr. Rove was no James Carville strewing raw-meat quotations of Machiavellian cuteness. He amiably disclosed very little about the president's re-election strategy. Until, that is, a student asked about the war in Iraq.
"First of all, it's the battle of Iraq, not the war," Mr. Rove carefully corrected. He went on to describe a far larger and longer war against terrorism that he sees clearly, perchance fortuitously, stretching well toward Election Day 2004.
If there were any doubt, Mr. Rove served notice to any and all Democratic challengers that feeding the aura of a wartime president, which has been bolstering Mr. Bush's standing in opinion polls by 15 points and more, would remain his campaigners' first priority across the next 18 months. 
He made the Bush strategy clear: It's the terror, not the economy, stupid, even if the nation is suffering rolling deficits and relentless unemployment, and despite Mr. Bush's serial tax cuts for the captains of industry. Democrats may want to talk health care and other economic issues, but they will have to grapple their way through a patriotic blitz of a campaign, if Mr. Rove has his red-white-and-blue way. Democrats can rightly fear an "October surprise" coming color-coded by Tom Ridge next time around.
"The country has not been hit since 9/11," Mr. Rove took care to note, as if tracking a new gross domestic product index as he fielded a question about the civil rights strictures of the Patriot Act.
A few days earlier, the president was rarely mentioned in the opposition's primary debate in South Carolina, where nine Democrats tacitly conceded what a difficult target he is right now. When they cited the Iraq war it was mainly in excoriating one another's positions rather than Mr. Bush's handling of it. They could be seen struggling to work out believable critiques of the president's stewardship of homeland security within the bounds of patriotism and the confines of their long primary trek.
The difficulty of the Democrats' task was exemplified after some party leaders tried to complain about political crassness in the president's cheeky performance in fighter pilot regalia at the carrier-deck victory tableau. Within half a news cycle, analysts turned back on the Democrats to ask whether they were already slipping into pre-emptive sore losing.
"This is not a country built on envy," Mr. Rove advised. He was speaking of "confiscatory" federal taxes on the wealthy but offering a remark that serves well as a larger caution for campaigning Democrats. They can only watch next year when Mr. Bush carries out a grand Rove strategem and presides at a Republican renomination convention in the heart of Democratic New York City. This will be within staging distance of 9/11's ground zero, site of an earlier memorable scene of Mr. Bush atop the rubble, exhorting the nation through a bullhorn.
Mr. Rove and the other Bush lieutenants know they cannot afford to be heavy-handed about the campaign implications of the New York visit. At the same time, Democrats must grudgingly concede that Mr. Bush is entitled as president to be leading a commemoration of the nation's continuing grief within days of his renomination.
Mr. Rove seemed rather pleased at one student's question about whether the convention was designed to "play off the emotions of 9/11." With obvious relish, he alleged that it was the Democrats who had schemed too much in choosing a July convention in order to "booby-trap" the Republicans into a mid-August date, which would have left them competing for attention with the Summer Olympics in Athens. The choice of New York as August fades into September was the checkmate result, Mr. Rove said, not quite gloating but enjoying the opening call to battle.
Mr. Rove is particularly curious about the Democrats' challenge in terms of a different sort of war. His true passion in the approaching fray seems to test fully a pet theory that in the current 50-50 standoff of the parties, even a narrow G.O.P. incumbency offers a whip-hand opportunity to secure a long-lasting party dominance. "That's the situation we face, and we are the governing party," Mr. Rove declared, alerting the students to what the Democrats already know.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Aims to Move Many Infirm Welfare Recipients Into Work Force 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration is embarking on an ambitious plan to move a large number of the last group of welfare recipients not enrolled in a work program into the work force. They include the sickest recipients, who now account for the majority of people on welfare.
 The administration will try to get those deemed unable to work off the welfare rolls and into the federal disability program instead. Others deemed temporarily ill are being directed to health care programs so they can improve enough to be able to get and hold jobs. 
 The number of public assistance cases has fallen drastically since 1995, when the city began its program requiring welfare recipients to work for their benefits if they were able to. In the eight years, the rolls have dropped to 208,110 cases from 561,762.
Of those remaining on welfare, 55 percent were people who were considered, in social service jargon, "unengageable" or "partially engageable," meaning they were not able to work, or could work only minimally for their benefits.
Those in this group tend to have the most serious health or social problems. They suffer from conditions like severe hypertension. They may have several small children at home, some with health problems of their own. Sometimes, they are people with AIDS, or they have very few work skills and need help developing them.
The Bloomberg administration is potentially facing a new federal standard that would require 70 percent of welfare recipients to work. But, independent of that, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has insisted that the city's welfare rolls continue to shrink, even during the current and severe economic downturn, and his administration has put together a strategy to reach that aim.
"The overwhelming goal is to get people to self-sufficiency," said Verna Eggleston, the commissioner for the city's Human Resources Administration.
To that end, the administration is overseeing a pilot program with the city's public hospital system in which people with chronic but manageable illnesses enter a "wellness" program for treatment of their illnesses. The program directs recipients to a primary care physician at a municipal hospital, and then requires them to follow a course of treatment and to return for evaluation on whether they can work.
The Human Resources Administration estimates that it will save $12.6 million a year by moving public assistance recipients through the program.
Beneficiaries who need other services, such as in-home care for an elderly person, would be matched quickly with the service they needed, so that they, too, could get into the work force, Ms. Eggleston said.
"You take all the services you can and wrap them around the family," she said.
Those who are judged by the administration as unable to work would be steered toward Supplemental Security Income, known as S.S.I.
But even with an aggressive effort to place this last and most difficult group of recipients, the city would be unable to meet the new federal standard that would require states to get 70 percent of welfare recipients working, Ms. Eggleston said.
Ms. Eggleston and her deputies are lobbying federal lawmakers to give New York more flexibility in how it administers its program. For example, she said she would like the city to count residents who are enrolled in the new wellness plan among the 70 percent who have made it off welfare.
"A key thing we must continue in Part 2 of welfare reform is that we must advocate for this group that their participation in this plan will result in a level of self-sufficiency," Ms. Eggleston said, "and that should count for something."
Under the White House proposal, which was passed by the House and is being reviewed by the Senate, the city would be permitted to count wellness program participants, as well as people enrolled in substance abuse programs for three months out of a 24-month period.
"One of the problems with people's reactions to the president's welfare proposal," said Wade Horn, the assistant secretary for children and families at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, "is that they react to the headlines, which is 70 percent participation and 40-hour work week. But the plan passed by the House gives states new flexibility on what would satisfy the law."
As successful as New York has been in complying with the 1996 federal law requiring welfare beneficiaries to work, the ratio of the state's welfare recipients is still higher than the national average. This is in part because of a state policy that permits families to collect a large portion of their former monthly grants even when the adult heads of households have refused to participate in an assigned work activity.
In other states, the entire family is taken off the rolls in that situation, in a move known as full family sanction. Proponents of full family sanction suggest that without it, some nonworking adults feel encouraged to collect benefits for their children while working jobs under the table.
"In a large number of states," said Lawrence M. Mead, a professor at New York University who is an expert on the federal welfare law, "they have a full family sanction, and then an entire case is closed."
He estimates that 2 to 3 percent of the national population is on welfare, while New York may be closer to 5 percent.
The city's planned wellness program "would address a different part of the program, which are those people who claim to have health reasons for not working but don't meet the S.S.I. test," Professor Mead said. "But New York has a serious problem with families that are unengageable" because the full family sanction does not apply to them, he added. New York City has not asked the state to change that law, Ms. Eggleston said.
The agency's wellness program, which began in February at Bellevue Hospital Center, "will be significant," said Patricia M. Smith, first deputy commissioner at the Human Resources Administration. "Before, for example, we told people, 'You have uncontrolled hypertension; get it under control. Here is your comeback date.' That was fairly unsuccessful because people did not go to the doctor, did not go, did not follow regimen or something like that.
"Now," Ms. Smith continued, "when someone comes out of the evaluation with that diagnosis, if they don't have their own doctor and want to avail themselves of that, we get them an appointment with a doctor within 24 hours."
People are expected to work at getting better and then join the work force.
"And in all candor," Ms. Smith said, "some individuals will not get better, and they should be moving to S.S.I., and that is an O.K. result."
Ms. Eggleston's agency has also been using technology to reduce fraud and speed up the benefits process. Computer databases have replaced paper documents in many cases, and agency workers are able to run welfare applicants' names against databases at the Department of Labor, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other agencies to determine eligibility and prevent fraud.

HEADLINE: An Overseas Penalty Stays; Tax Cut Goes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Advocates of a crackdown on the overseas operations of United States companies won two victories this week during Congressional negotia tions over an economic stimulus plan.
 A proposal for a one-year reduction in the taxes on foreign profits, a plan that its supporters said would help the economy by bringing a flood of investment back to the United States, did not make the House version of a stimulus bill passed today. On Thursday, in an effort to pay for a broader tax cut, the Senate Finance Committee approved a provision to increase taxes on companies that move their headquarters offshore. 
 The defeat of the one-year tax cut makes it unlikely to be included in the final version of the stimulus bill, tax experts said. The fate of the provision that would penalize companies that set up a parent company in an overseas tax haven remains more uncertain. 
The bills, which draw few of the same supporters, are parts of two of the biggest economic debates in Washington: how to stimulate an economy that has been struggling for almost three years and how to prevent corporate scandals like those at Enron and Tyco International.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the chairman of the finance committee, has been pushing since early last year to penalize companies that set up a nominal headquarters in Bermuda and other tax havens. The measure would narrow or eliminate the gap between the effective tax rates of these companies and their rivals.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the committee, also supports the penalties.
Tyco, Ingersoll-Rand and Accenture are among the companies that are based overseas and as a result pay lower taxes than some of their competitors based in the United States.
Since policy makers began debating the issue last year and some called such moves unpatriotic, companies have all but ceased making them. Stanley Works, which was planning to move to Bermuda, announced last year that it would instead stay in Connecticut.
Advocates of the penalties say that companies should not be able to reap the financial and political benefits of having their executives and many of their employees based in the United States without paying for their share of government services. But after more than a year of pushing for the measure and failing to succeed despite widespread public anger at much of corporate America, the advocates said this week's victory still did not leave them confident that the measure would become law.
"It strikes me there's a slight chance something will get done, but only because I think Grassley and Baucus are adamant that something get done," said Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, who offered a similar bill in the House. The opposition of businesses to the measure still means its passage is unlikely, Mr. Neal said.
Many opponents of the measure, on the other hand, said they still expected it to be passed eventually because it remained politically popular to punish companies that appeared to be abandoning the United States to increase their profits. But the real problem, the opponentssay, is that corporate taxes in the United States are too high, encouraging companies to go elsewhere to remain competitive. 
"If the tax structure continues to be unfavorable, I can assure you that companies will figure out a way" to avoid taxes, said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at Institute of International Economics, a research group here. "There are so many subtle ways that can happen."
Richard E. Anderson, a tax lawyer at Arnold & Porter in New York, added, "Something like this is going to happen."
Researchers disagree about whether American companies pay a higher tax rate than companies elsewhere. 
The measure -- which would be retroactive to March 2002, when Mr. Grassley announced that companies should stop moving their headquarters overseas -- was included in the Senate Finance Committee's version of the stimulus bill because it would raise $2.6 billion, Senate aides said. Senate Republicans have been looking for ways to save money and afford a larger tax cut without changing the federal government's overall fiscal condition. 
The Congressional Budget Office released a new estimate today, saying that the federal government will run a deficit of more than $300 billion this year. In March, the budget office estimated that the deficit would be $246 billion.
The effort to reduce taxes on overseas operations for one year is hailed by its proponents as a direct stimulus for the economy. It would reduce the tax rate on so-called repatriated earnings of American companies to 5.25 percent from 35 percent.
"Those corporations that support the provision believe that with a one-year time period, a substantial amount of money will come back into the United States," said Bob Shapiro, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who has lobbied in favor of the measure. 
J. P. Morgan estimated that the measure would cause $300 billion in assets to return to the United States. This money would then be spent on new factories or be paid to shareholders as dividends, lifting economic growth, proponents say.
"It would stimulate the economy at virtually no cost to the American Treasury," said Idil Oyman, a spokesman for Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, who sponsored the bill.
Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, also tried to include the measure in the Finance Committee's version of a stimulus plan, but most Democrats and a few Republicans opposed it, defeating it.
Opponents argue that the measure would reward companies for having moved valuable parts of their operations to other countries. It would also create momentum to keep the tax permanently low, they say.
"It sends a signal to these companies: stay out and you'll get a little bit each year," Mr. Neal said.

HEADLINE: House Approves 10-Year Tax Cut For $550 Billion 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
The House voted today to cut taxes by $550 billion over the next decade, strongly endorsing President Bush's drive to stimulate the economy through lower taxes but differing sharply with him on the shape of the package.
 The 222-to-203 vote was almost entirely along party lines, but four Democrats supported the cuts and three Republicans opposed them. 
 The tax plan approved today is $176 billion smaller than the one the president originally advocated, and it rejects his top priority of ending all taxation of corporate dividends. Even the president's closest allies in the Republican-controlled House said he could not get all he wanted at a time of rising deficits, given the refusal of moderate Senate Republicans to go along. 
But administration officials say they will continue to press their case. The Senate is to take up its own tax cut bill next week, and the issue then moves into a crucial conference committee between the two chambers, where the administration will play a leading role. 
Having got much of what it wanted in today's vote, the White House seeks to use the House bill as leverage in the Senate, where moderates have insisted on a smaller, $350 billion tax cut over 10 years, which is much less generous to investors than the House version. In tacit recognition that his original $726 billion plan had been sidelined, Mr. Bush began stumping last month for a tax reduction of "at least" $550 billion.
The House plan embraces the core philosophy of the Bush administration and most Republicans that tax breaks for businesses and upper-income taxpayers will lead to the creation of jobs. But rather than drop all taxes on dividends, which the president has said amount to double taxation of corporate profits, the bill takes a more conventional Republican path of reducing the tax on those dividends and the tax on capital gains, both of which are paid mostly by the wealthiest Americans.
The top tax rate on capital gains would fall to 15 percent from 20 percent while the top tax rate on dividends would also drop to 15 percent. The new cuts would come on top of the $1.3 trillion 10-year tax cut enacted in 2001.
"The less burden the government places on the back of small businesses and income earners, the more economic activity we'll have," Representative John Linder, Republican of Georgia, said in today's raucous debate. "That means more jobs and that means more taxpayers and indeed more revenues."
The plan differs significantly from the one approved on Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee and scheduled for a full Senate vote next week. The Senate plan would reduce the tax on dividends but not on capital gains, and it would raise taxes for many Americans living abroad to fit the package into the Senate's much lower ceiling of $350 billion. The Senate plan would also give $20 billion in aid to struggling state governments, an idea that House leaders have forcefully rejected.
The eventual conference between House and Senate tax writers promises to be intense and possibly rocky, even though all the principals will be Republicans. After today's vote, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois flatly rejected the Senate Finance Committee's idea of raising taxes on Americans living abroad, and said the House expected to keep the total tax cut as close to $550 billion as it can. "We want to get the best bang for our buck as possible," Mr. Hastert said. "I would hope we can bring the Senate as far along as you can bring the Senate along."
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, who as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee developed the House tax cut plan, went further than the speaker, saying that the $550 billion approved today was "just barely enough" to energize the economy.
But that amount would probably be impossible to pass in the Senate, where Republican moderates have refused to go above $350 billion.
Administration officials nonetheless characterized the House bill as a "good first step."
"I look forward to building on this success to deliver the economic boost America's workers deserve," President Bush said in a statement issued after the vote.
House Democrats raged today at both the substance of the plan and the refusal of Republican leaders to allow them a chance to introduce an alternative plan without the big reductions in dividend and capital gains taxes. Republicans had ruled the Democratic proposal out of order because it included unemployment insurance benefits and other nontax items, giving Democrats a daylong platform to complain that House leaders were stifling debate.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the debate was "a day of infamy" because his alternative bill could not make it to the floor. 
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the Republicans were robbing the poor to give tax cuts to the rich, an act he called "sickening and simply un-American." And Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas, said the tax cut for millionaires was almost as large as the $100,000 contribution that Mr. Bush's top fund-raisers, known as pioneers, contributed to his campaign.
"With this bill, Republicans are pushing more of the same old failed economics," Mr. Frost said of the 2001 tax cut, $1.35 trillion. "It doesn't seem to matter that those failed policies have left America with the worst economy in a generation, or that America has actually lost jobs since we passed Part 1 of the pioneers' tax relief act two years ago."
But Representative David Dreier of California, chairman of the Rules Committee, which refused to allow debate on the Democratic bill, said his party had saved the Democrats from embarrassment.
"We have done the minority a tremendous favor, by saving them from casting a vote in support of a tax increase," Mr. Dreier said, drawing catcalls from the opposition.
The four Democrats who voted for the tax cuts were Representatives Rodney Alexander of Louisiana, Robert E. Cramer of Alabama, Ralph M. Hall of Texas and Ken Lucas of Kentucky. The three Republicans who voted against the cuts were Representatives Michael N. Castle of Delaware, Amo Houghton of New York and Jim Leach of Iowa.
The centerpiece of the House bill, equaling half its cost, is the reduction of the tax on capital gains and dividends to 15 percent for most taxpayers. Capital gains, the profit when an investment is sold, are now taxed at 20 percent, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income, which can be as high as 38.6 percent.
The bill would also allow businesses broad new write-offs to reduce the cost of new investments. The provision won particular praise from lawmakers representing manufacturing states, who said the extra cash would prompt businesses to hire more workers. "This is the best bill for manufacturing that has ever come to the floor of the House in my 21 years in this Congress," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a moderate Republican from Connecticut.
To fit all the cuts into the $550 billion limit the House imposed last month, however, tax writers had to resort to several techniques derided as gimmicks by Democrats.
The bill calls for an increase in the child credit to $1,000 from $600, reduction of the tax penalty for some married couples and expansion of the bottom tax bracket. But all those breaks would expire in 2005, making the total tax cut appear smaller.
Republicans openly acknowledge that once those cuts are in law they intend to return to the issue and make those tax breaks permanent before they expire.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "ADDING IT UP: Tax Cuts Approved by House"The House of Representatives yesterday passed a 10-year, $550 billion tax-cut bill that was similar to President Bush's $726 billion in most respects except in its cuts for investors. Provisions similar to President Bush's proposal: CUTS FOR INDIVIDUALS -- Changes are through 2005 only Lower the top tax rates for middle- and upper-income people - now 27 percent, 30 percent, 35 percent and 38.6 percent - to 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, 200310-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 74.0 Raise the income threshold for the alternative minimum tax to $43.250 for an individual and $64,000 for a couple10-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 53.0 Increase the tax credit for children, now $600 per child, to $1,00010-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 45.0 Increase the standard deduction for married couples to double the deduction for individuals beginning this year, and expand the 15 percent tax bracket to cover more income10-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 43.4 Expand the 10 percent tax bracket to cover more income10-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 18.6 CUTS FOR BUSINESSES Temporarily increase, to 50 percent from 30 percent, the percentage of investment expenses larger businesses could write off10-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 21.5 Extend through 2004 the current law allowing businesses to use current losses to recoup taxes paid in the profitable years of the 1990's10-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 14.6 Increase the amount of expenses on plants and equipment that small businesses could write off immediately to $100,000 from $25,00010-YEAR COST IN BILLIONS: $ 2.7 Substantially different from President Bush's proposal: CUTS FOR INVESTORS Lower the maximum tax rate for stock dividends and capital gains to 15 percent.

HEADLINE: The Other Killing Machine 

BYLINE:  By Steven Merritt Miner; Steven Merritt Miner, a professor of history at Ohio University, is the author of "Stalin's Holy War."

 BODY:
 GULAG
A History.
By Anne Applebaum.
Illustrated. 677 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $35.
 IN the introduction to this important book, Anne Applebaum, a columnist for The Washington Post, ponders why the Soviet and Nazi regimes are treated so differently in the popular imagination. Young people who would never purchase Nazi regalia think nothing of sporting T-shirts emblazoned with the Communist hammer and sickle. Yet, as Applebaum shows, the Soviet killing machine was certainly equal to its Nazi counterpart. Wisely, she avoids wandering into the muck of comparing the two totalitarian terror apparatus to decide which was worse, but she argues that "at a very deep level, the two systems are related." 
Ever since Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn published his magisterial three-volume history of the Soviet concentration-camp network, "The Gulag Archipelago," in the early 1970's, the grim details of life in what he called the Soviet sewage system have been well known. From arrest by the Soviet secret police through interrogation, to deportation and hard labor, the life-and-death cycle of the gulag is a familiar story. Other witnesses, like Varlam Shalamov and Evgeniya Ginzburg, have also brilliantly described prisoners' constant struggle against hunger, cold and disease. So a great deal of what Applebaum writes about in "Gulag: A History" has been told before.
But that does not lessen her achievement. When Solzhenitsyn's volumes first appeared they had an enormous impact. Yet he soon fell from favor, dismissed by some as an anti-Communist crank, by others as a nationalist anti-Semite. As documents from the Soviet archives have now shown, much of this defamation campaign was financed and encouraged by the K.G.B. But the attacks had their effect: a group of so-called revisionist historians, who dominated the study of the Stalin years in the United States and Britain during the 1980's, waged a war against the portrayal of the Soviet Union by Solzhenitsyn and other anti-Soviet memoirists.
Instead of the slave empire, these historians stressed the country's rapid economic development and urbanization under Stalin, which supposedly fostered widespread support for the regime. None questioned the existence of the gulag. Rather, they minimized its place in Soviet life and denied that the population as a whole was ever terrorized. 
Applebaum's book weighs in heavily in support of Solzhenitsyn on almost every point, and her account is backed not only by a careful use of the vast memoir literature but also by a thorough mining of the long-closed Soviet archives. Most important, she supports Solzhenitsyn's central argument: that the gulag was not some incidental Stalinist accretion to Lenin's visionary concept of Socialism. The cancer of police terror was embedded in the original DNA of Lenin's creation, "an integral part of the Soviet system," in Applebaum's words. Under Lenin, the first concentration camps were created; the first mass executions were carried out. He bequeathed to his successor a well-functioning police state. 
Applebaum estimates that from 1929 through 1953 -- the years of high Stalinism -- more than 18 million people coursed through the camps, with a further six million being exiled to remote regions of the Soviet Union. The vast majority of these people were guilty of nothing. An Orwellian logic underlay the whole enterprise. As one police investigator explained to his victim: "We never arrest anyone who is not guilty. And even if you weren't guilty, we can't release you, because then people would say that we are picking up innocent people." 
Particularly useful is Applebaum's account of the camps during World War II. It was precisely at this time that the system reached its peak of lethality. Fully a quarter of the inmates perished during 1942, but the appetite of the security forces was so insatiable that the gulag's population dropped less than 20 percent. Following the war, whole new categories of inmates flooded into the camps: German P.O.W.'s, anti-Communists from the western borderlands or from the new Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. Little known in the West, some 600,000 Japanese troops fell into Soviet hands, forced to labor for years after the cessation of hostilities; only a fraction ever returned home. Stalin also punished with deportation entire nationalities -- Chechens, Ingush and Crimean Tatars notably -- ostensibly for collaboration with the Nazis but, in fact, Applebaum argues persuasively, to eliminate nationalist resistance to Moscow.
One great difference distinguished the Soviet and German systems: there was no Soviet equivalent of the death camps. People sentenced to death in the Soviet Union were generally shot before entering the camp network. Applebaum estimates these victims at just under one million during the Stalin years. Instead, Soviet prisoners were expected to earn their keep by contributing to the creation of Soviet Socialism. They mined gold, felled timber, dug canals or lay rails, most often in harsh areas to which free labor could never be enticed. By the outbreak of war in 1941, the gulag was the single largest employer in the world. 
Yet the Soviets never managed to make it pay for itself. Leon Trotsky had once defiantly stated that it was "the worst sort of bourgeois prejudice" to call slave labor inefficient; such labor could contribute mightily to the growth of the Soviet economy. Lenin believed him, as did Stalin -- with even greater zeal.
Defenders of the Soviet system have all too often played Stalin's game, excusing -- or, rather, "explaining" -- the gulag as a direct descendant of the czarist Siberian exile system. But Applebaum's numbers tell their own story: on the eve of the 1917 revolution, under the czar, only 28,600 convicts were serving sentences of hard labor, compared with the millions committed to the gulag under Lenin and Stalin. At some point numbers matter; quantity becomes quality. It is simply wrong to maintain that the gulag was nothing more than a modernized version of its czarist predecessor.
In the end, bourgeois economic realities defeated Bolshevik will and ruthlessness. Projects created with slave labor proved to be shoddily built and inefficient. One notable Stalinist showpiece, the White Sea canal, was designed to allow warships and commercial vessels to pass between the Baltic and the White Seas. Perhaps 25,000 people died digging this canal, yet despite the enormous human cost the canal was too narrow for warships; only shallow draft boats could navigate its course. Touted at the time as one of the great achievements of Stalinist planning, it stands instead as proof of its titanic moral and economic failure.
Applebaum gives due consideration to the post-Stalin years of the gulag and to the way the memory of this vast crime against humanity has played out since the Soviet Union's collapse. It is all too easy to assume that Stalin's death in 1953 brought an immediate end to the camp system; in fact, it persisted and, though it wound down dramatically during Khrushchev's thaw, did not finally disappear until well into the Gorbachev years. A brave but small band of Russians, notably the organization Memorial, commemorates the victims of the gulag. But most of their countrymen seem uninterested. The revelations about the crimes of the Stalin era have all come too late, and life today in the former Soviet Union is so hard.
Significantly, there have been no trials, no truth and reconciliation commissions. Many of the mass graves have been unearthed, but these attract little notice in Russia and scarcely more than a paragraph in Western newspapers. Irreconcilable versions of the past contend for the current Russian soul. An astonishing number of Russians -- perhaps as many as 15 or 20 percent -- reject Memorial's documentation of the terror and view Stalin as a positive historical figure. Applebaum cites Russians saying that the gulag was somehow a historical necessity; that without it Russia could never have tapped the vast resources of the Far East.
Most worrisome, Russia's current leader is a product of the unrepentant and largely unreformed F.S.B., successor to the K.G.B. The talk in Moscow is of restoring the statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky -- the first head of the secret police, and a man who can justly be called the Patriarch of the Gulag -- to its place in Lubyanka Square, right in front of the headquarters where so many innocent Soviets were swept into Solzhenitsyn's sewer system. This would be a historical obscenity. It is fervently to be hoped that people will read Anne Applebaum's excellent, tautly written and very damning history. Even more fervently, one hopes that it will soon be translated into Russian.

 REEFER MADNESS
Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor
in the American Black Market.
By Eric Schlosser.
310 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $23.
 SEX! Drugs! We'll get to cheap labor in due course. "The current demand for marijuana and pornography is deeply revealing," Eric Schlosser writes in the introduction to "Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market," three essays that explore facets of America's estimated $650 billion underground economy. "Here are two commodities that Americans publicly abhor, privately adore and buy in astonishing amounts." Schlosser, who delivered a stirring indictment of the business and culture of American appetites in his first book, "Fast Food Nation," now throws more muck rakes at our national mores. 
The first is a chapter on the booming business of American marijuana cultivation -- and a damning of the nation's mandatory minimum sentencing laws. The last is a serious romp through the recent history of pornography in the United States, a story that hangs on the tale of Reuben Sturman, the self-styled Walt Disney of porn, who died in a prison hospital in 1997. Stuck in the middle is an investigation of the terrible working conditions endured by illegal immigrants in California in order to harvest strawberries under the hot sun. 
What connects these three reports? The free market. We are a nation of consumers. (Perhaps our demand for strawberries is less revealing of our souls or culture than our desire for filmed sexual intercourse or a quarter-ounce of pot, but we do purchase a lot of them all the same.) Schlosser's guiding principle for "Reefer Madness" seems to be that the three essays can add up to a refutation of Adam Smith's theory of the modern market economy. "The idea of the marketplace as the fullest expression of democracy has a strong appeal," he writes in the conclusion, "Out of the Underground." "But it assumes that economic motives are the only human motives. If making money were all that mattered, there would be no nurses, teachers, poets, farmers, soldiers, police officers or professors of medieval literature." To which list I would add: no stoned video-store clerks or onanistic builders of amateur porn sites on the Web, either. And, of course, no advocates for fair wages for migrant farmworkers. 
Schlosser's argument walks a difficult, winding path. Porn, he says, should be made legal across the board, and pot as well. Both actions would throw light upon the darkness of the black market and thus reduce America's gross national pretense of virtue. At the same time, though, he writes, "All those who now consider themselves devotees of the market should take a good look at what is happening in California. Left to its own devices, the free market always seeks a work force that is hungry, desperate and cheap." Which is true enough. As Schlosser smartly notes: "The sort of black market labor once narrowly confined to California agriculture is now widespread in meatpacking, construction and garment manufacturing. The growth of the underground has lowered wages, eliminated benefits and reduced job security in these industries." 
But we were talking about pot and porn. The addition of labor to the discussion renders the argument muddy. And as a result, "Reefer Madness" often seems more a congealed denunciation of American hypocrisy than a volume that came together as the result of careful thought. Small-time drug dealers in jail for life, migrant strawberry workers living on the edge of slavery, porn stars reclaiming their sexual power and businessmen profiting from that goal -- this all may be the underground, but you can't see it for the fog. 
You know what, though? Never mind. There are other measures of a journalist's success than the cohesion of a collection of essays. Schlosser is a fine and diligent reporter with a real gift for description, and his three dispatches are fascinating pieces of work. In particular, Schlosser's riveting profile of Mark Young, an Indiana man convicted on federal charges for his part in arranging a large marijuana sale, does much to humanize his examination of America's domestic marijuana business, a business, the author reports, that is worth more than $4 billion a year. 
"One of the great ironies of American drug policy is that antidrug laws have tended to become most punitive long after the use of a drug has peaked," Schlosser writes, adding: "Marijuana use among the young peaked in 1979. Strict federal laws were passed seven years later, when use had already fallen by about 40 percent; and the explanation most young people gave for quitting marijuana was the perceived health risk, not fear of imprisonment." Young, who had introduced a buyer to a seller of marijuana, received a life sentence, Schlosser reports, and was placed in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan.
Schlosser's investigation of California's strawberry harvest, meanwhile, is harrowing in its description of workers who labor six-month years for less than $7,500 and have life expectancies under 50. It is also fiercely eloquent in its conclusions. "If the current abuse of illegal immigrants is allowed to continue," he writes, "the United States soon won't have to import a foreign peasantry. We will have created our own."
His chapter on pornography, "An Empire of the Obscene," the longest in the book, rockets along on the heels of its protagonist, Reuben Sturman, a wily porn magnate and antigovernment agitator who could make a fine noir hero for Hollywood. "You wanted to know how the industry started," Sturman tells Schlosser when they meet in a medium-security prison in Kentucky a year before Sturman's death. "Well, you're looking at the person who started it."
Here's what to do. Read these three pieces as if they were distinct articles in the same magazine, one that can afford to have only a single, hard-working reporter on staff. This is very good journalism, after all, stacked like cordwood. And there is much to learn about the evils of this world -- even if there's no need to tie them all together just yet. Black markets, Schlosser writes, "will always be with us. But they will recede in importance when our public morality is consistent with our private one." See you then.

HEADLINE: The Erdogan Experiment 

BYLINE:  By Deborah Sontag; Deborah Sontag is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
The new prime minister of Turkey stood stiffly in his formal office in Ankara, his mustache pulling his mouth into a frown. Serious pouches hung beneath his eyes as he shook hands briskly and positioned his lanky frame on a high-backed chair. Like a patient nodding to the dentist, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 49, signaled he was ready to be interviewed. It seemed clear that he would have preferred to stretch out on the carpet and go to sleep. 
 There was no trace of Erdogan's famous charisma, of the fiery oratorical skills on display just the previous day in Parliament, when I found myself responding instinctively to his booming voice's cues, knowing, without understanding the Turkish, when I was supposed to rise, to clap, to cheer. Rather, during that evening interview last month, at several points while his remarks were being translated, Erdogan's head bobbed forward and his eyelids drooped shut. He could be forgiven; his party's first months in office had been grueling. 
 The war in neighboring Iraq was drawing to a close, much to Erdogan's relief. The war was unpopular in Turkey and costly to Erdogan. Because he is a pragmatist, Erdogan supported America's request to use Turkish soil as a staging ground. Yet, despite the fact that his party held two-thirds of the Parliament, he failed to win legislators' approval for the request. It was a significant failure, damaging his new government's relations with the Bush administration, depriving Turkey of billions in loans and grants and provoking questions about Erdogan's competence and control of his party. 
As he also backpedaled on the ever-divisive Cyprus issue, fumbled with Turkey's wrecked economy and confronted Kurdish riots in an earthquake zone it seemed that Erdogan was extinguishing all too quickly the hopefulness that his fledgling party's emphatic win in the Nov. 3 general elections had produced. Influential Turkish columnists abandoned their infatuation with the young Turk who had vanquished the old guard. One, Cengiz Candar, told me he had "stopped even pronouncing Erdogan's name publicly." (It is pronounced EHR-doe-ahn, by the way).
Such pressure would have taxed the most seasoned politician, and Erdogan, once a popular mayor of Istanbul, was a novice on the national stage. Yet Erdogan was accustomed to proving himself. A pious man in a country where secularism is worshiped, and once a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, he had always been an outsider. And now, though he was tired, he was, more precisely, annoyed. It had been only a month since he assumed the premiership. He clearly felt, not unreasonably, that he deserved the benefit of the doubt.
The stakes were high, as not only his advisers but also opposition leaders told me. Tayyip Erdogan was an experiment for Turkey with ramifications that went well beyond Turkey. As a devout Muslim with an Islamist past who had nonetheless evolved into a modern, pro-Western democrat, Erdogan had the potential to set a powerful example for the region. If he could ease Turks into a less hostile separation of mosque and state, if he could help Turkey undertake long-overdue democratic reforms, then perhaps one day he would exemplify a way in which Islamic faith and democratic principles not only coexisted but also collaborated. 
But first he needed to be given a chance to succeed. The transition to statesman after a life of struggle with the state was not a simple one. Fingering the Turkish flag on his lapel, Erdogan crossed his legs. "Our people made us the governing party," he said defiantly. "Those who claim to respect democracy, why don't they respect the vote of the people?" 
Erdogan knows that many in the establishment distrust him or look down on him or do both. He knows they can't quite believe that Erdogan is their prime minister; indeed, many seem embarrassed by his ignorance of foreign languages and by the head scarf that his wife wears as an emblem of her faith. He knows they are suspicious of his claims that he has evolved and that they imagine him to have a secret plan to impose religion on the nation. "I have faced this all my life," Erdogan said. 
But he is weary of it. "Before anything else, I'm a Muslim," Erdogan said. "As a Muslim, I try to comply with the requirements of my religion. I have a responsibility to God, who created me, and I try to fulfill that responsibility. But I try now very much to keep this away from my political life, to keep it private." Poker-faced, he exhaled. "A political party cannot have a religion. Only individuals can. Otherwise, you'd be exploiting religion, and religion is so supreme that it cannot be exploited or taken advantage of."
To understand Erdogan's dilemma, it helps to understand the depths of Turkey's commitment to secularism. It began with the very establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, and the founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's rejection of traditional Islam as incompatible with his goal of establishing a modern European state. Ataturk shut the Islamic caliphate, dissolved religious courts, outlawed mystic sects and secularized schools. He replaced the Arabic script with Latin script. He outlawed the fez and all but imposed the homburg. He adopted the Swiss civil code and granted women the vote.
As secular nationalism became Turkey's religion, the military took on the role of protecting Ataturk's legacy, which meant keeping elected officials on a leash and overthrowing or undermining them if necessary. Erdogan himself is unofficially on probation. Turkey's "deep state" sees its duty as preventing the nation from backsliding into religion and ethnic, especially Kurdish, separatism. Islam was, of course, never snuffed out. While most Turks came to consider themselves Turks first, they were still Muslims. And from the start, especially in the heartland, traditional Islam survived despite repression. To this day, in what seems an arcane, self-defeating expression of Turkey's secularism, women wearing head scarves are not allowed to attend universities or work in government. Prime Minister Erdogan's two daughters, in fact, go to Indiana University, where they are free to cover their hair and get a degree at the same time. His wife does not appear at state functions lest her designer head scarf provoke fears of an imminent theocracy. 
Erdogan's family comes from a devout world in the Black Sea region. His father, Ahmet, migrated to Istanbul in the 1930's, settled in Kasimpasa, a rough working-class quarter, and found work as a captain with a state maritime company. Kasimpasa has a body language all its own, and Turks say that Erdogan retains the Kasimpasa swagger, a way of leading with his right shoulder. Although the district was infamous for its gangs and pickpockets, Erdogan remembers the neighborhood as an idyll, with fruit trees and fields, where kids could get their hands dirty. "I was shaped by that mud," he said, "not like the poor kids of today who are surrounded by asphalt."
Near the now-ramshackle mosque where Erdogan studied the Koran as a child, the district manager of Kasimpasa, Ali Riza Sivritepe, spoke of growing up with him. They fetched water from the same well, flew kites and shot marbles over the irregular paving stones. (Erdogan, steely in his ambition even then, always won.) "He was a very serious child," Sivritepe said. "Everyone respected him here and called him Big Brother."
His father, according to a biography, was an authoritarian with a temper that could be tamed best by Erdogan's kissing his shoes. Once, Erdogan's father punished him for using bad language by hanging him from the ceiling by the arms. "After that day, I never swore again," Erdogan said.
When Erdogan was 7, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes -- "God bless his soul," Erdogan said -- was hanged. Elected in 1950 in Turkey's first free elections, Menderes was a secularist but demonstrated a tolerance for religious practice that his predecessors had not possessed. Over 10 years in government, he faltered and became repressive, and when the Turkish military overthrew him, the coup was largely welcomed. But when Menderes was sent to the gallows, many Turks were horrified. "Some are saddened by things like this, and they give up," Erdogan said. "In my case, this sadness turned into an attraction for politics." 
Part of the Erdogan lore is that in fifth grade he refused to use a newspaper as a prayer rug in a religion class. It was inappropriate, he told his teacher, who took a special interest in him and persuaded Erdogan's father to send him to a state-run Prayer Leaders and Preachers school, which offered a secular curriculum amplified by religious instruction. Erdogan was particularly good at reciting nationalist poetry. During poetry contests, Sivritepe recalled, Erdogan would hide a Turkish flag inside his shirt and whip it out for dramatic effect.
Erdogan was also good at soccer, but he kept his playing secret from his father for years, hiding his soccer shoes in the coal bin. His father considered soccer a diversion from education and faith. In truth, politics was the real diversion. Erdogan juggled soccer -- playing professionally for 11 years -- political activism and school for more than a decade. He graduated with a degree in management at age 27.
During that era, political Islam became a force in Turkey, and Necmettin Erbakan, a German-educated engineer, emerged as its leader. Erbakan preached a return to religious values, which resonated in the heartland and in the poorer urban neighborhoods. While Erbakan's first party, National Order, was banned for fomenting fundamentalism, the authorities later encouraged him to try again, seeing him as a counterweight to leftist parties. But his second party, National Salvation, grew steadily more radical and anti-Western, inspired by the Islamic revolution in neighboring Iran.
Erdogan was one of Erbakan's disciples. His political climb began when he was appointed chairman of National Salvation's youth group. Young Erdogan would practice his fiery rhetoric on abandoned ships, facing into the wind as he rehearsed his salutation: "My sacred brothers whose hearts beat with the excitement of a big future Islamic conquest. . . . " 
Erdogan's future wife, Emine, belonged to an Islamist women's group, the Idealist Ladies Association, and she was mesmerized by his oratory. After six months of chaperoned dating, the couple became engaged and married in 1978. Two years later, National Salvation was dissolved along with all other parties in another military coup. Not to be suppressed, National Salvation was reborn as the Welfare Party, which is where the Islamists, some of whom saw an Islamic state as their goal and some of whom aspired only to greater tolerance of religion, hit their organizational stride.
Erdogan named a son after his leader, and Erbakan made him chairman of the Welfare Party's Istanbul branch. They built a political machine that provided social services as it secured political power, appealing to the needy and disgruntled as well as to the faithful. But they did not always agree. Erdogan stopped kissing Erbakan's hand because it struck him as retrograde, and he subtly pushed for greater democracy within the party and for broader outreach. Erdogan was not Erbakan's first choice to be the Welfare Party candidate for mayor, but the older man bowed to the will of the party. Erdogan took his campaign into pubs, discotheques and even bordellos, and computerized the campaign offices. He made women the worker bees of his organization and involved secular men too.
In 1994, Erdogan was elected the first Islamist-oriented mayor of Istanbul. His victory stunned the country. It meant that the Islamists were succeeding in reaching beyond the mosque communities. It also meant that Erdogan was a force to be contended with. Indeed, many found Erdogan a more compelling package than his mentor. Whereas Erbakan was a flashy dresser and and an autocratic figure, Erdogan styled himself as an authentic representative of the masses. "In this country, there is a segregation of Black Turks and White Turks," Erdogan once said. "Your brother Tayyip belongs to the Black Turks."
At the Hope Barbershop in Kasimpasa that Erdogan used to frequent, Ibrahim Azak, a barber, called him "the best" at politics for just that reason. "He was raised in a place like this," Azak said. "He doesn't come from a palace. When he shops, he carries the bags himself."
As mayor, Erdogan adopted modern management practices and proved singularly adept at delivering services, installing new water lines, cleaning up the streets, planting trees and improving transportation. He opened up City Hall to the people, gave out his e-mail address, established municipal hot lines. He was considered ethical and evenhanded. (One building-trade professional, however, told me that the corruption endemic to Istanbul City Hall persisted under Erdogan and that donations of equipment and vehicles were still solicited in exchange for building permits.)
Yet from the moment he pronounced himself the "imam" of Istanbul, Erdogan began both provoking anxieties and recoiling from the fact that he had provoked them. He banned alcohol from municipal establishments, which created concern that he would eliminate alcohol from restaurants too. But he never did. He revived an elaborate project for a mosque complex in the city's heart, then backed off when there were protests. He never clearly allayed secular concerns, keeping them alive instead with comments like: "Democracy is like a streetcar. When you come to your stop, you get off." 
Meanwhile, the Welfare Party finished first in a close national election, and Erbakan became the country's first Islamist prime minister in 1996. With his rhetorical cannons firing away, he declared Turkish politics a pitiful imitation of the West and announced a campaign for worldwide Muslim solidarity. He overreached. After 12 months, the military forced him to resign.
There had long been differences between the younger party leaders, who came to be known as the modernists, and Erbakan and his men -- whom they called the Politburo. When Erbakan was ousted and subsequently banned from politics, the modernists had their opening. But first they had to withstand the legacy of Erbakan's radical provocations of the establishment, a crackdown that would pave the way for Erdogan's rise.
In December 1997, the Welfare Party sent Erdogan to a political rally in southeastern Siirt, an impoverished, religious district where his wife's family originated. On that day, as he had several times before, he recited a quatrain by Ziya Gokalp, an ideologue of Turkish nationalism: "The mosques are our barracks,/the domes our helmets,/the minarets our bayonets,/ and the believers our soldiers."
Erdogan told me that the poem had been approved for textbooks by the education ministry, and he added, somewhat disingenuously, I think, that it principally served oratorical purposes. "It was an attention getter," he said. "It would make the people spirited." In the speech following the poem, however, Erdogan went on to proclaim that Islam was his compass and that anyone who tried to stifle prayer in Turkey would face an exploding volcano. 
It was what one observer, Asla Aydintasbas, a New York-based columnist for the newspaper Sabah, described as an "Al Sharpton moment." Erdogan was playing to the crowd and prodding the military. And the military took the bait. Erdogan was charged with inciting hatred on the basis of religion, and convicted.
But this time, it was the bureaucracy that had overreached. Erdogan's conviction not only enhanced his popularity among religious Turks but also disturbed many secular Turks. "It's not right what happened to him," said Cuneyd Zapsu, a businessman who owns the Azizler holding company. "I don't want to live in a country where someone goes to jail for a poem. He was persecuted because they sensed his power, and I think it was not religion but a class thing. The so-called elite has never lived in this country's reality. They've always been afraid of the people. That's why all our laws are restrictions, not freedoms."
In 1999, thousands accompanied Erdogan to the gates of the prison in western Thrace where he would serve five months. Erdogan told me that when the door clanked shut behind him it marked a breaking point as well as a turning point. "Prison," Erdogan said, "matures you." 
Zapsu visited Erdogan in prison frequently. A free-spirited 46-year-old, Zapsu first met Erdogan when he was running for mayor. Erdogan had been looking for a liaison to the business community, and he heard that Zapsu, whose grandfather was a well-known Kurdish poet, was a maverick with an open mind. " 'I don't want your money,' " Zapsu said Erdogan told him. " 'I want your help. Nobody from the establishment wants to talk to me.' " At that time, Zapsu said, Erdogan was more rigid. He wouldn't shake the hands of Zapsu's daughters; he hugs them now. But Zapsu said there was something special about Erdogan. During Erdogan's incarceration, Zapsu worked to persuade him to break with Erbakan and his anti-Western philosophy. It wasn't that hard, Zapsu said. Erdogan was coming to that conclusion himself. And Erbakan never visited anyway. 
For the modernists in the Welfare Party, Erbakan's ouster followed by Erdogan's conviction undeniably demonstrated that confrontation with the establishment wasn't getting them anywhere. Fehmi Koru, columnist for an Islamic-oriented newspaper, told me: "When I first started writing about democracy, some members of the community criticized me openly, saying Islam and democracy were incompatible. But they grew ready for a change." 
They decided to start a new party that would aim for a broader political base. They would stop conducting politics with religious symbols and demonstrate instead how true belief informs politics wisely. Metin Heper, a political scientist, said that Erdogan believes in the potential of Islam to unite people around an ideal and build morality, integrity and drive. "He believes in a kind of Islamic version of the Protestant work ethic, where you work hard for the benefit of the country because it is the good and right thing to do according to Islam," Heper said. A poll taken to determine the public's chief concerns generated the party name, Justice and Development, and its symbol, a glowing electric light bulb. 
Justice and Development would be a party in which religious people could feel at home, but it wouldn't be a religious party. Its members would be Muslim Democrats in the mold of Europe's Christian Democrats. It would entice Westernized Turks from abroad, like Egemen Bagis, 33, a businessman living in New Jersey until Erdogan recruited him to run for Parliament without, Bagis said, ever asking whether he drank (he does) or whether his wife covered her hair (she doesn't). 
Zapsu, a founder of the party, introduced Erdogan to Ishak Alaton, an industrialist who is part of Istanbul's small Jewish community. The avuncular Alaton told me that he came to see Erdogan as a "practical man of good will" who represents "the forces of change" in Turkey.
Just as Zapsu was Erdogan's Henry Higgins, advising him on how to deal with the establishment and the West, Alaton took on introducing Erdogan to the American Jewish community and helping him send signals that he would maintain Turkey's relationship with Israel. It required a little re-education first. "They had this impression that the world was run by Jews," Alaton said. 
On Nov. 3 last year, Erdogan's 16-month-old political party captured the first single-party majority in 15 years and the first substantial one in 50 years. It won 34 percent of the popular vote, which translated into a phenomenal 363 seats out of 550 seats in Parliament. All but one of Turkey's established political parties -- the Republican People's, founded by Ataturk -- failed to reach the 10 percent threshold needed for representation. 
The victory was a resounding rejection of the old, corrupt, mismanaged and fragmented Turkish political order. It was also an embrace of Erdogan personally but not of Islamism. On election night, Erdogan immediately sought to reassure the establishment that he would not be an agent of unwanted change. In a news conference, he said that his government would not interfere with anyone's way of life, would uphold Turkey's Western-oriented foreign policy, would abide by an International Monetary Fund rescue plan and would continue the battle for admission to the European Union. The Turkish markets soared.
Even then, many distrusted his transformation. "He's saying all the right things about Europe and moving westward," an American diplomat told me, "but I fear he's like a wolf in sheep's clothing." Those who knew him well, though, took him at his word. "He wanted to change the system, but the system changed him," said Rusen Cakir, one of Erdogan's biographers. Alaton said he had no concerns that Erdogan was a closet fundamentalist. "He came to power partly because he had this religious platform, but he knows it's a dead end. He knows confrontation with the bureaucracy on religion would break him." One Turkish lawyer put it to me more cynically: "He believes in profits, not prophets."
After his victory, Erdogan had a problem: banned from politics in 1998, he could not become prime minister. So Abdullah Gul, who is now the foreign minister, assumed the premiership temporarily. In early December, President Bush invited Erdogan, still only chairman of the party, to the White House. This caused considerable controversy in Turkey, since it meant the United States was according international legitimacy to a leader considered illegitimate by the Turkish military.
According to Bagis, who served as Erdogan's interpreter during the December meeting, Bush raised the issue of faith that Erdogan has worked so hard to keep in the background. Startling the Turks, Bush said: "You believe in the Almighty, and I believe in the Almighty. That's why we'll be great partners." Erdogan left Washington with Bush's backing for Turkey's long-frustrated accession to the European Union and headed to Europe to lobby for a firm date for talks. There he faced his first serious setback. The E.U. scheduled negotiations to begin in December 2004, but only if Turkey had undertaken sufficient reforms.
Erdogan's party, meanwhile, speedily passed a reform of a more self-interested variety, amending the Turkish constitution so that the ban on Erdogan could be lifted. Conveniently, the results of elections in Siirt were nullified because of procedural irregularities, opening up a few seats in Parliament. So Erdogan was preparing to run in by-elections just as the United States was moving closer to war in Iraq. 
Erdogan had been open in his disdain for Saddam Hussein and calculating in his backing for the American request to base tens of thousands of troops in southern Turkey. The Turkish public, however, was adamantly antiwar, and many in Erdogan's party, especially the more hard-line religious members, firmly opposed him on this issue. Erdogan was quickly learning that his high-wire act wasn't going to be easy to pull off. He was supposed to be the anti-Erbakan, so he was not about to impose his will on his party. Critics of Erdogan's performance, however, say that he should have done just that. "Leaders have to lead," the columnist Candar said, adding cuttingly, "Being the darling of the simple people is not enough during such turbulent times." 
Erdogan's advisers said that the United States did not fully grasp the political risk that he was taking and how much he needed written agreements demonstrating what Turkey would get in return for cooperating. "They were used to dealing with our generals and not a politician trying to be democratic," Zapsu said. The Turks were insulted when the Americans sent a State Department negotiator rather than a senior leader to work out an agreement with them. They acknowledge that they misjudged the United States' determination to launch a war, with or without Turkey's help, and that they bargained inexpertly. They were thin-skinned too when details of the financial bartering were leaked and cartoons in American newspapers portrayed them as bazaar hagglers. "There was a very ugly campaign against my country," Erdogan said.
In the end, Gul, the acting prime minister, had to go to Parliament with promises but no signed guarantees from the Americans. The military establishment didn't want to help Erdogan, so the generals, whose support for Turkey's participation in the war might have persuaded opposition members to vote for it, kept a low profile. Parliament failed -- by three votes -- to authorize the stationing of American troops in Turkey. The Americans were furious. 
In early March, Erdogan was elected to Parliament and Gul prepared to step aside. Erdogan told me that Bush called to congratulate him, saying he'd never known any politician who had won 85 percent of the vote; Bush also asked him to try again in Parliament. Erdogan, however, told the American president that he needed to wait for Parliament to formally approve him as prime minister first, which his Turkish critics saw as cheeky, immature standing on ceremony.
By the time Erdogan was installed as prime minister, the Americans were asking only for the right to fly over Turkish airspace, and they got it, Erdogan said. Luckily for Turkey, the war was quick and contained. As it was drawing to a close, during that April interview, Erdogan insisted that Turkey had done more for the U.S. war effort than any other country except England. Turkish airspace was a singularly essential ingredient, he said. "How could they feel let down by our doing all this?" he said defensively. 
Earlier this year, when Muslim faithful were traveling to Saudi Arabia for the hajj, the new Turkish authorities shrouded a billboard at the airport that featured a model in an itsy bitsy bikini. Arch-secularists wrung their hands: this must be the first sign of the coming fundamentalism, they cried. The swimsuit company sued the government, and secularists cheered it on, until one day some realized that they were rushing to the defense of a pretty cheesy picture. Suddenly, everyone got quiet. Overnight, the billboard was moved to a discreet location and uncovered. It was a small, common-sensical compromise. But it raised the possibility of grander, more profound ones.
Alaton argues that Erdogan should be given more time by his own people and more open support from Europe and America. "Erdogan shouldn't be punished," he said. "Maybe people of good faith should understand how important he is." 
And even Kemal Dervis -- a leading opposition figure and, as an elite, polyglot former World Bank official, the antithesis of Erdogan -- told me he thinks the government's success, remote as it seems now, would truly reverberate. "It would send the message that you can be an overtly Muslim country and part of the club of developed nations too," Dervis said. "The significance of that for the world at large would be incredible."
Unfortunately for him, Erdogan has been scrambling on several fronts. His government rattled the business community by advocating a pension increase, just the kind of populist spending measure that Turkey didn't need. Further, while he had pledged to push a plan to reunify Cyprus, his government ended up backing away from a showdown with Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, and the Turkish military at a critical moment. This greatly disappointed those who thought he would be an agent of change. To take on the military too soon might be suicidal, they acknowledged, but to defer confrontation could also render him impotent. 
Slipping confidence in Erdogan, as always, has been colored by distrust of his intentions -- or at least his party's intentions -- on the religion issue. But maybe that concern is misplaced. 
Maybe Erdogan doesn't have the guts or power to push through any serious reforms, least of all on religion. Or maybe Erdogan, straddling two worlds, is the perfect person to defuse the tensions between secular and religious forces in Turkey.

HEADLINE: The Price of Power

BYLINE: By David Grann. 
David Grann is a frequent contributor to the magazine. He wrote most recently about the baseball player Barry Bonds.

 BODY:
On July 24, 1998, a lone gunman entered the United States Capitol. He wore a green fedora and carried a .38 Smith & Wesson, with extra bullets in his pockets. He was not a particularly good shot, but he had the rare clarity of mind of someone propelled by delusion, including the firm belief that there was a ''ruby satellite system'' in the Capitol that could reverse time. At the front door, he drew his pistol only inches from a Capitol Police officer's head and shot him, point-blank. He then turned near a statue of Abraham Lincoln and began shooting at another officer. In the exchange of gunfire, a tourist was hit in the face. As the intruder approached the office of Representative Tom DeLay, a detective named John M. Gibson yelled for everyone to get down. Staff members hid under their desks. Gibson opened fire, hitting the gunman again and again before collapsing himself.
 ''They got John!'' one of DeLay's aides yelled. ''They got John!'' 
 Only moments earlier, William Harrison Frist, then an unheralded Republican senator from Tennessee, was on the other side of the Capitol, out of earshot of the gunfire, speaking on the patient's bill of rights. ''As a practicing physician,'' he stated, ''I am absolutely convinced that health care is delivered best when that relationship between the doctor and the patient is given the very highest priority.'' When he finished, the onetime heart and lung transplant surgeon adjourned the Senate and headed to the airport. But as he climbed in his aide's car, the Capitol physician's office called and said, ''We have men down.''
 Frist drove as close to the scene as he could. He took off his coat and ran past the police barricade. ''I'm Senator Frist,'' he told an officer, flashing his ID. ''I'm a doctor.'' 
 The police, still fearing there was more than one shooter, ushered him down a long marble corridor that smelled of gunpowder. He knelt by the first victim, checking his wounds and inserting a breathing tube. He lifted him on a stretcher and assisted paramedics as they wheeled him into an ambulance. But before they could close the door, the patient went into cardiac arrest. Although Frist helped to shock back his heartbeat, he was certain the man would die from his injuries.
 A medic yelled that there were more victims inside, and Frist rushed back into the building to treat another of the wounded, a slight man who was lying on the carpet and bleeding heavily. An artery in his chest was severed, and Frist concentrated on stemming the flow of blood. He then rode along with him in the ambulance, keeping him alive by forcing oxygen into his lungs. Only as they approached the hospital did he learn that the man he had rescued was the accused gunman, Russell Weston Jr. ''You're not a judge; you're not a jury,'' Frist later explained. ''You're a physician.'' 
 The scene, like so many in the life of Bill Frist (only months ago he rescued a family in a car accident while driving through Florida on vacation), has helped to elevate him above the ranks of the ordinary politician. Last December, when he stepped in to replace the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, in the wake of Lott's racially charged remarks, he was hailed by his colleagues not as an astute politician but as a citizen legislator, known less for his voting record than for his ''healing touch.'' At a time when the Senate was increasingly ridiculed as obstructionist and out of touch -- ''a cruel joke,'' as one historian called it -- Frist was seen as someone who could master not only the institution behind closed doors but its image in front of the public as well. Though he had less political experience than any other Senate leader in history, he represented the G.O.P.'s ideal vision of itself: someone who saves lives not through doling out government aid but through his own daring acts. ''He's our messiah,'' a Republican aide proclaimed after he was chosen.
 At his first news conference as majority leader, Frist fueled the impression that even his ideology was rooted in the purity of medicine. He said that his training allowed him ''to listen very, very closely, to diagnose, to treat and, yes, to heal.'' He accepted his new responsibility, he added, ''with a profound sense of humility very similar to placing that heart into a dying woman or a child or a man.'' 
 It is, of course, common to see politics through the prism of your experiences. Plato thought that philosophers should rule as kings. And while it is true that medicine and politics often share the goal of aiding others, in practice they are quite different. Indeed, where medicine is supposed to be clinical and dispassionate, democratic politics often requires unseemly compromise and a certain ruthlessness. It is less about saving lives than serving them through tedious, incremental steps. 
 After barely 100 days as majority leader, Frist has found himself caught between these two forces, between the vision of himself as a savior and his own political ambitions. Rather than being hailed as a messiah, he was, only a few weeks ago, denounced by members of his own party as a betrayer, a double-dealing politician who negotiated what they called ''a secret deal'' on the president's tax cut. And the story of how Frist has tried to reconcile these competing visions of himself -- and in the process to emerge as the heir to George Bush in 2008 -- is not just about the power of healing but also about the price of power. 
One day not long ago, I went to meet Frist in his office. In the arcane world of the Senate, where nearly everything is meted out according to station (there are separate elevators and subway cars reserved for senators), the size and location of your office is perhaps the most visible measure of influence. While junior members are relegated to basements in distant buildings, Frist's main office is in the oldest part of the Capitol, just off the Senate floor. Lott had cleared away his belongings, and Frist's name was now stenciled on the large mahogany door in gold. Rather than ''Senator,'' however, he had added the letters ''M.D.'' 
 As I waited in his reception area, I glimpsed what Howard Baker, another majority leader from Tennessee, had called ''the second-greatest view in Washington: the Washington Monument and the Mall.'' After a while, Frist hurried in wearing an elegant dark blue suit with a light blue tie. He has been called ''the new face of the Republican Party,'' and up close he has immaculate features and thick brown hair. But there is something slightly mechanical about his manner, as if after years of performing surgery, he has learned to hold himself perfectly still. ''I'm Dr. Frist,'' he said, extending his hand.
 As several aides vied for his attention, he led me through a series of doors until we reached his private office. It was unusually spare. There was a desk and a couch and, in place of the traditional wall of photos with presidents and dignitaries, only two paintings. ''They're from my son,'' he said of the artwork. ''I don't want all that other stuff that people put up.''
 On his bookshelf was ''Master of the Senate,'' the third volume of Robert A. Caro's epic biography on Lyndon Johnson. ''People ask me if I've read it,'' Frist told me, ''and the answer is yes. But I don't want to be like him. I want to be just the opposite. That's the last leader I want to become.''
 While Senate majority leader is one of the most coveted positions in Washington, it was not created by the Constitution but by other senators and thus has little power of decree, which is why it has been famously -- or infamously -- occupied by masters of the art of the deal. (''I'm a compromiser and a maneuverer,'' Johnson once said.) It is a job that previous Senate leaders have likened to ''herding cats'' and ''trying to push a wet noodle.'' And though in December Frist was seen by the White House as the ideal man for the job -- an untarnished and loyal ally who would carry its water -- he has increasingly struggled to move the Republican agenda with only a one-seat majority and little experience. Even on his first day, after hours of negotiating a deal on extending unemployment benefits, the Democratic minority threatened at the last minute to undermine him. ''After a lot of hard work, I'm obviously disappointed, because this is the first move out for me, . . .'' Frist declared on the Senate floor in exasperation. ''But I guess that is what I can come to expect.'' Unlike the speaker of the House, he could not ram through legislation simply by using parliamentary rules. A single senator, using a filibuster, could impede him; a single defector from his ranks could stop him cold. After Republicans boasted that they needed only one vote to pass Bush's plan to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, Frist spent days trying to use his influence to find that vote. By the end of his first 100 days, he was still looking. 
 But this morning, before Frist set out on his schedule, he walked over to an antique cabinet. Inside was his medical bag. ''I always keep it right here,'' he said. He carried it to the center of the room and began to go through it. ''This is basically everything you need.'' He pulled out a series of long, slender tubes. ''I can use these to breathe in someone.'' He tilted his head back, exposing the white of his neck, and outlined with his fingers where he would make an incision. ''There's a little piece of cartilage that you can cut and then slip the tube into.'' After a brief demonstration, he dropped the tube and held up what appeared to be a mask. ''This is for mouth to mouth,'' he said, ''and this is an endotracheal tube, like the one I used in the Capitol shooting.'' He removed a strange L-shaped tool. ''Come here,'' he said to one of his aides, who was trying to usher him to his next appointment. ''Open your mouth.'' His startled subject took a step back. ''I won't stick it in,'' Frist assured him. ''This is called a laryngoscope.'' He had applied one during the recent car accident in Florida. ''I told the paramedic, 'Get away,' and I used this one, because you can get a little more leverage.'' He continued to go through the items, checking the batteries, unscrewing tops, examining syringes. ''Oh, yeah,'' he exclaimed, pointing to a defibrillator. ''This is if you were to drop dead. The first guy I resuscitated over here in the Dirksen Building, I had to shock him seven times to get him back. But I got him back.'' He paused and looked at all the items spread on the couch. ''I can keep anyone alive,'' he said. ''I don't care what their problem is. This is all you need.''
''The Iconography of the Healer,'' as Bill Frist calls it, began in his family long before the senator was born. It accumulated the power of myth on Feb. 3, 1914, when the Mobile & Ohio passenger train was approaching the station in Meridian, Miss., where Bill Frist's grandfather, Jacob Chester Frist, worked as the stationmaster. As he peered down from the platform, Jacob Frist saw several pedestrians crossing the tracks in front of the speeding train and broke into a run, shouting for them to get out of the way. Everyone jumped back except for an elderly woman who was holding her grandchild, a 3-year-old who was crippled from a previous spine injury and encased in a full body cast. ''I was helping . . . keep the people out of danger, . . .'' the station porter later recalled, ''when I saw Stationmaster Frist hurl himself ahead of the moving train.'' As Frist pushed the woman and child out of the way, the train slammed into him, throwing him at least 15 feet in the air. ''If Stationmaster Frist had not hurled himself . . . against this woman and child,'' another witness told authorities, they would ''undoubtedly have been killed.'' 
 Jacob Frist, meanwhile, lay on the ground, his head severely traumatized, his leg shattered. For nearly a year he was confined to his house. After an account of his heroism appeared in The Meridian Star, people from across the country deluged him with letters, including one that said, ''Your brave act was such as our Savior would have us do.'' 
 In March 1915, President Woodrow Wilson awarded him a medal and commendation. In a note expressing his thanks, Jacob Frist wrote: ''I shall hand them down to my children and hope that my boys will do the same thing when they grow to be men should they ever have occasion to be placed in a like position. I think it the duty of every man, when women and children are in danger of being killed to try and save them.''
 Nearly five years after he was injured, Jacob Frist died from a cerebral hemorrhage, which was attributed to the accident. Bill Frist's father, Thomas, was only 8 years old. The accident was the last thing, he said, he remembered of his father.
 Raised in a boarding house, Thomas Frist eventually became a doctor, which, as his son later observed, ''offered him the two things he most needed -- a way to ensure that his family was well provided for and a way to validate the selfless generosity that lay behind his father's impulsive sacrifice.'' In 1968, with the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken, he helped found the Hospital Corporation of America, one of the first private hospital chains in the country. ''He was this incredibly odd combination,'' one of the family's friends confided. ''On the one hand, he was this old-fashioned doctor who made everyone feel at ease, and on the other, this kind of hustler.'' As his business dealings transformed the Frists into one of the richest families in America, he continued to preach the power of his calling, especially to his children. His first son, Thomas Jr., who helped his father start H.C.A., initially became a surgeon. And his second son, Robert, also became a surgeon. Of all the children, though, nearly everyone agreed that Billy Frist was the most like his father. He had the old man's courtly charm, his missionary spirit and, what's more, he had the same ambition. 
 In ''Transplant: A Heart Surgeon's Account of the Life-and-Death Dramas of the New Medicine,'' an unusually candid memoir that Frist wrote before he ran for office, he said of his childhood: ''I longed to be first in everything, to be king of the hill, the grammar school capo di capo. I imagine I was quite insufferable.'' He sought out younger boys, he said, ''who could look up to me, admire me. . . . I found it a virtual sin against nature when one of my young friends, though smaller, could kick a ball farther than I could. I resented anyone my age who was more popular, bigger, faster or smarter. I was jealous of them. I feared them. They might take over.'' By high school, he was, among other things, class president, quarterback and voted most likely to succeed. Printed under his yearbook photo was his nickname: Mr. President. 
 When Frist arrived at Princeton in 1970, with aviator glasses and short hair, he quickly signed up for pre-med courses. ''Having people come up to my father and say, 'Thank you for saving the life of my mother,''' Frist told me, ''that became a part not just of his identity but my identity.'' He rarely slept and was often seen in his room, late at night, poring over his books. ''In those days, there were groupies who would come in after class and want to continue the discussion,'' Uwe E. Reinhardt, the noted health economist who became Frist's close friend and mentor, told me. ''And Billy Frist was always there.''
 On one final exam, Reinhardt asked his students to come up with a corrupt accounting scheme to show how companies could legally commit fraud. ''I do remember he gave the most ingenious answer I had ever seen,'' Reinhardt said. ''It was wholly corrupt.''
 After graduating cum laude, Frist set out, at last, to medical school at Harvard, which offered him, as he put it, a chance to ''help others, to do good, while reaping most of the benefits our society can bestow -- prestige, power and wealth.'' 
 During his second year at Harvard, he saw his first heart. ''I stared at it cradled in my hand, spellbound,'' he said. Later, he spent days and nights in the lab, dissecting the hearts of cats for a research project, convinced he was on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. But with only six weeks to complete his project, he ran out of specimens. Though he was an animal lover, he went to shelters, collecting cats as pets, before sacrificing them in the interest of science. It was, he acknowledged in ''Transplant,'' ''a heinous and dishonest thing to do, and I was totally schizoid about the entire matter. By day, I was little Billy Frist, the boy who . . . had decided to become a doctor because of his gentle father. . . . By night, I was Dr. William Harrison Frist, future cardiothoracic surgeon, who was not going to let a few sentiments about cute, furry little creatures stand in the way of his career.''
 Within the world of medicine, cardiothoracic surgeons are generally considered a breed unto themselves: they are stereotypically the most driven, intrepid and emotionally detached. Frist, who taught himself to fly at 16, seemed much less removed than many other surgical residents. Patients recall Frist leaning into them, attuned to their needs and fears. But he also maintained an ability to separate himself that sometimes startled even his friends. ''People would get close to Bill, and then the wall would suddenly come up,'' his college roommate, Rob Mowrey, said.
 Consumed by his training to be a heart transplant surgeon, the one person he allowed in was his high-school sweetheart, who also planned to become a doctor. After dating for 10 years, they finally got engaged. But weeks before the wedding, increasingly filled with doubts, he met another young woman, named Karyn, who came into the emergency room with a sprained wrist. ''I felt as if I'd known her all my life,'' he said later. Two days before the wedding, after being up for 48 hours on call, Frist flew to Nashville, still in his hospital whites. They sat at his fiance's house, surrounded by gifts. ''I explained that nothing was right with my life,'' he wrote. ''With me. With me and her. I cried. And she cried, and I stayed an hour, and I flew back to Boston the next morning. . . . I headed straight to the hospital from the airport. My next shift was starting.''
One day in the late 80's, after he had married Karyn and started his own transplant center at Vanderbilt University, Frist got a call in the middle of the night. A colleague said, ''I think we've got a heart.''
 Frist took out the three-by-five card that he always carried with him. It was before the days of organ registries, and on it was a list of all his patients waiting for a donor. There were not enough hearts for all of them, and he knew that whomever he chose, another on the list would most likely die. A doctor had once asked him, ''How can you play God like that?''
 Frist now went down the list and reluctantly made his choice. ''I would always be worried about the person who had just died,'' his wife told me. ''But Bill wouldn't think about that. He couldn't. He would only think about retrieving the heart and the patient he was going to give it to.''
 As he raced to catch a plane, Frist carried two pairs of scissors, scrubs, tubing, six bags of saltwater and a red-and-white Igloo cooler. When he arrived at the hospital, he stood over the body, cutting open the donor's chest with a scalpel and scissors. He took out the heart and held it up. It weighed only about 10 ounces. He packed it in ice and placed it in the Igloo. Then he raced back to Tennessee, where his patient was already waiting in the operating room.
 ''You take what people regard as the soul of life outside the body,'' he told me, as he sometimes had other reporters, while we were walking through the Senate. ''Then you take another heart, and it's sitting in a bucket like a piece of meat, and you carefully lower it in.'' As he demonstrated, he held out his hand motionless, as if it were a heart. ''Then, bang, it starts beating again.''
 He often worked for days on end; on vacations he would take his beeper, prepared at any moment to harvest a heart. He enclosed on the back page of ''Transplant'' an organ donor card for readers to fill out. ''I pursued every vehicle I could,'' he explained.
 In 1993, he was appointed by Ned McWherter, the governor of Tennessee, to head a commission on the state's $3 billion Medicaid program. The governor told Frist that based on his findings he was going to take the $3 billion and put it into a total managed-care system.
 Frist was startled. ''How can you do that? You're just one person.'' 
 The governor laughed. ''That's what politics is all about.''
 ''At that point the light clicked,'' Frist told me. ''The power . . . of one individual.''
 Then that same year, as his old friend Professor Reinhardt accompanied him on a plane trip to harvest a heart, Frist had his head buried in a large ring binder. ''I was teasing him,'' Reinhardt said, ''about looking up in a manual where the heart is.'' Frist lifted his head and shouted over the roar of the engine, ''This is campaign literature.'' Later, after he had removed the heart, he said, ''This is my last transplant.'' 
 The announcement that Frist intended to run in 1994 for the United States Senate against Jim Sasser, an 18-year incumbent in line to become the next Democratic majority leader, initially stunned most of his family and friends. Frist was so consumed with medicine that he hadn't even voted until 1988. Yet what surprised some people even more than his decision to run was the party with which he chose to align himself. ''I always assumed he was a Democrat,'' said Dr. Norman Shumway, the renowned transplant surgeon who trained him at Stanford. Reinhardt assumed the same thing: ''I thought he was naturally a Democrat.''
 At Princeton, Frist had worked as an intern for a Democratic congressman. His mother was a staunch liberal who liked to tell friends, ''I'll die before I vote for a Republican.'' His oldest brother, Thomas Jr., had donated to Democrats throughout the state, including Sasser. Even Bill Frist's father, who often voted Republican, had recently contributed to the Democratic National Committee. 
 And while Bill Frist hadn't registered to vote until 1988, when he did, he donated $1,000 to the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore, the only politician whom he praised in ''Transplant.'' And in 1993, when he made his first foray into public policy and led the state Medicare commission, it was for McWherter, a lifelong Democrat. 
 Several friends told me that Frist had confided that he wasn't sure whether he should run as a Democrat or as a Republican. ''I said, 'What are you?''' McWherter recalled asking him at one point. ''He said, 'Well, I'm not sure.' I said: 'Well, you got to make up your mind. This is a two party system.'''
 According to some friends, before he chose, he even did ''research'' to see if he had a better chance of being elected as a Democrat or Republican. ''They looked at the east of Tennessee and decided he had a better chance getting elected as a Republican,'' one friend told me.
 When I asked Frist about his ideological evolution, he said, ''I just didn't change; those are my values.'' He denied doing any kind of polling, but acknowledged that he had told people he didn't know which party to join. ''The pattern in my life is to systematically address an issue, and that was just another issue. I made a list of 20 people and said, 'I want to do something that is beyond saving people one on one.' I went around and talked to everybody, everyone I knew in politics, and said, 'What is the real difference between Democrat and Republican?''' 
 And if there was any ideological ambivalence -- ''That party stuff doesn't matter to me,'' he had initially told Reinhardt -- once he made his decision he showed little evidence of it. It was a year in which Democrats were in trouble throughout the country, a year of a massive anti-incumbent revolt led by Newt Gingrich, and Frist seized on the backlash with fervor. After vowing to the state party chairman, ''I will be the best student you will ever meet,'' he prepared 16, 17, 24 hours a day -- and longer, staying up three nights straight, then napping for an hour and going another three days in a row, including Sundays. He sought advice from the masters of the art, most notably Karl Rove, who would later steer George Bush into the White House and who traveled with Frist briefly at the outset of the campaign. ''I've never spoken about it before,'' Frist said when I asked about it. ''But it did have an impact. The fact that this guy had come in, and no one thought I could win. And he said, 'You could do this thing.''' 
 And as his main tutor Frist hired Tom Perdue, a brilliant and ruthless campaign manager who only a few years earlier had settled a $400,000 libel suit for accusing an opponent of bribery and who now helped devise a strategy that would serve as a blueprint for Frist's entire career. While Frist attacked Sasser endlessly as an ignoble Washington insider -- his commercials featured ''The Ballad of Liberal, Taxing, Two-Faced Jim'' -- Frist portrayed himself as the quintessential outsider, a noble doctor. His unofficial campaign slogan was ''Listen, diagnose and fix.'' 
 Drawing on more than $3.7 million of his own estimated $20 million fortune, much of which had been earned from stock in his father's and brother's company H.C.A., he dispatched Perdue to unleash a barrage of negative attacks. One commercial showed Sasser's face on Mount Rushmore alongside Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic congressman recently indicted for corruption. His campaign also tried to link Sasser to Joycelyn Elders, the black surgeon general who had spoken controversially about masturbation, and Marion Barry, the black mayor of Washington who had been caught smoking crack cocaine with a former girlfriend. ''We'd never seen anything like it,'' Sasser told me. ''I'd been in the Senate 18 years, and I'd never seen a campaign so vicious. Handbills would mysteriously appear in redneck areas showing me with Joycelyn Elders. He'd say while he was saving lives as a heart surgeon, I was busy sending Tennessee dollars to Marion Barry. It was clearly a racist attack. The slanders went on and on and on.''
 In the end, Frist achieved one of the most stunning upsets in electoral history -- ''a political earthquake,'' as he proclaimed at his victory party. Or, as one newspaper exclaimed with a hint of disbelief, ''Is There a Doctor in the Senate?'' 
''I just want to put another log on the fire,'' Frist said, standing in his office one winter afternoon. He went out of the room and came back with several logs bundled in his arms and placed them in the fireplace. 
 As he sat down at a long wooden conference table, he clapped his hands and said, ''So what are we going to do?''
 I said I wanted to talk about how he had transformed himself from a doctor into a senator. ''It's been pretty seamless,'' he said. ''The learning curve in medicine is much steeper and more arduous. This comes naturally.'' He paused, as if he had said something he regretted. ''So if you say that, it's like you're a natural politician. But I do like people, so it's not hard.'' 
 As he spoke, an aide came in the room. He nodded toward me. ''This is my psychoanalyst here,'' Frist joked. Then, comparing his new role with his old one, he continued, ''Addressing the big issues -- life-and-death things -- I think that can apply to the political end of it.''
 That same day, amid hours of meeting with advisers trying to break a Democratic filibuster of a Bush judicial nominee, Miguel Estrada, Frist appeared on the Senate floor and said he wanted to ''put my physician hat on for one second.'' The terrorist threat had recently gone up from yellow to orange.
 ''This is a time of stress,'' he said. ''In talking to my colleagues and their families, I sense that when we go to this high alert . . . people do not sleep as well. Some people eat more. . . . Some people develop back pain.'' He listed several things that people could do to cope. ''Again, as a doctor -- and then I will take my doctor hat off -- exercise regularly, eat well and get a good night's rest.''
 When he returned to his office, he asked me: ''Did you hear my talk on the floor? Me just talking about it will help in these life-and-death issues.'' Later he held a private conference call with a group of Senate spouses, who had expressed growing alarm over the senators' physical safety. 
 Frist told everyone to get out pencils and paper. ''No. 1,'' he said, ''during an attack cellphones won't work. No. 2, local phones may go out as well, so you need an out-of-state contact.''
 ''I have a question about iodine,'' one senator's wife asked.
 ''If you're near a nuclear reaction,'' Frist explained, ''it protects the thyroid, but it doesn't protect the rest of the body.''
 What about duct tape?
 ''Karyn Frist, do we have duct tape in the house?'' he asked his wife, who was also on the phone. He said he only advocated it for high-risk scenarios, and he told them not to worry about their spouses. If anything ever happened at the Capitol, he said, ''I will act with no hesitation. . . . That's what I did for a living before I came here.''
 Afterward, while the two of us sat by the fire, he seemed pleased with the call. ''To me, the mission is no different'' between a doctor and a senator, he said, sipping from a cup that said ''Senate Majority Leader.'' ''So it's not a matter of changing; it's a matter of adapting and compromising. There's much more negotiation in this business. In medicine, there is no room for compromise, and in this, there is much more negotiation to reach one's goals.'' Then, as he stood to go, he added, ''The danger is if you adapt too much you can never recover.''
 When frist first arrived in the Senate in 1994, he quickly discovered what every new member did -- that despite holding one of the highest offices in the land, he had little influence within the institution. Ranked No. 99 out of 100 in seniority, Frist wasn't even initially given permanent office space. After the first State of the Union address, his wife recalled: ''We just stood there by ourselves. No one came up to him, and I felt so bad. I wanted to go out and grab one of these reporters, and say: 'Please talk to my husband. He's a senator from Tennessee.'''
 Until then, there were primarily only two routes to power within the institution: one, which had prevailed for centuries, was through the back alleys of the institution; the other, which had become more prevalent in recent years with the advent of cable news channels and C-Span, was by building up a base of power outside the institution -- by, in effect, running against its tradition of horse trading, as someone like John McCain had. But while the former route could take years and taint your image, the latter never allowed you to truly dominate the institution. And Frist, who had become one of the quickest studies in politics, seemed to pursue a different path, one that had rarely, if ever, been tried. ''I don't have time to pay my dues, to be congressman, a cabinet member, another senator,'' he said.
 At first, it appeared that he intended to rise only by adhering to tradition, by bending to the will of his party patrons. Where he had once expressed doubts about his party allegiance, he now voted, with rare exceptions, the party line. He voted against gay employment rights and the Endangered Species Act. He voted for Bill Clinton's impeachment and against campaign finance reform. He voted for reducing Medicare growth and minimizing the role of government in health care, though a close friend told me that before running for office Frist had expressed a desire for a universal health care system like Canada's. And though other friends told me that they were certain Frist was for abortion rights, he voted steadfastly anti-abortion. (Even on one of the few occasions that he bucked his party and voted for Henry Foster as surgeon general, it seemed more personal than political. Foster, whom conservatives opposed because he had performed abortions as an obstetrician, was from Frist's home state and an old medical colleague.) 
 Before long, Frist's voting record was nearly indistinguishable first from Bob Dole's and then Lott's. Each told colleagues privately that Frist had the makings to one day be majority leader. And while Lott promoted him as the ''resident doctor,'' Frist began his own crusades not just to serve people but also to save them -- to rescue thousands of Americans dying from lack of organ donations and millions decimated by AIDS in Africa. But when his initiatives clashed with the entrenched powers in his party, he nearly always tailored them to appease his Republican patrons. After the Bush administration objected to his provision to increase emergency spending on AIDS to $500 million in 2002, he withdrew it at the last minute, cutting the initiative by more than half for that year. ''It was devastating,'' said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance. ''He had the right instincts, but he refused to stand by his own policy.''
 While Frist told Zeitz and others to be patient -- that he would eventually prevail by working within the system -- he also spoke of the competing instincts within him. ''There is this tension between two forces I am engaged in,'' he once told The Boston Globe, ''between raw political power versus what is probably a little more deeply inside of me, the real quest, the real drive for substantive issues, of really changing things for these few years I am in the United States Senate.''
 After he joined anti-abortion conservatives and opposed creating human embryos for research, many in the medical establishment complained that he had finally turned his back on his own profession -- denying patients the best chance for a cure for diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Charles Barnett, a Tennessee doctor, told National Journal: ''Bill Frist is the biggest disappointment to me. . . . He took this political stand not to help people, but to pay off the far right so nobody would get mad at him.'' 
 Frist said to me: ''Are there things I've done -- or have I voted certain ways -- that if I could, I'd take them over and go back and redo them? The answer is yes.'' When I asked him for examples, he cited only one: the farm bill.
 Finally in 2000, after six years of accumulating the goodwill of his Senate leaders, Frist started to construct his own political machine with the help of a new powerful patron: George Bush. Already connected to Karl Rove, Frist took several unheralded jobs -- including Senate liaison to the campaign -- that cemented his ties to the Bush team, which soon put him on the short list of vice-presidential candidates. During his own Senate re-election bid that year, Frist even coordinated his advertising with Bush -- a little-noticed gesture that helped deliver Gore's home state to Bush. 
 More important, Frist decided in 2000 to take the largest political gamble since he ran for office and to assume the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, which controls every race across the country by recruiting candidates and disbursing millions of dollars. ''Most of my colleagues advised me not to do it,'' Frist explained. ''Most said, You're a policy maker, you pull people together. Then all of a sudden you're a raw political figure. You're out there with the harshest political rhetoric. You have to be shrill and tear into the guts of people.'' 
 As he had in 1994, he immediately showed how aggressive he could be, releasing a series of attack ads that exploited Bush's popularity on the war on terrorism. ''That comes from Frist,'' said his old mentor, Perdue, who at the time was running the Senate campaign of Saxby Chambliss in Georgia. ''That was not just one day, 'Let's use the president.' That was well thought out.'' He added: ''Frist didn't do that without a tacit approval. He would never violate his relationship with the president, and that was a very good strategy.'' 
 While some Democrats claimed that Frist was calling into question their patriotism, Frist relied again on Perdue, who unleashed what was considered the most devastating ad of the cycle: it showed a picture of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein that eventually faded into the Democratic incumbent, Max Cleland, a Vietnam war hero who lost both his legs and his right arm in battle. Perdue told me that he sent each commercial he made to Frist and his staff to ''let them be another focus group,'' and ''they never told us not to do anything.''
 Hunkered down at his campaign headquarters, Frist spent hours recruiting candidates with Rove, with whom he communicated on his BlackBerry, and raising money. Just as he had once found a way to legally circumvent the accounting system on his college exam, he now found loopholes in the campaign finance system. Rather than divest his stocks from his family's company, which in 1994 merged with another company and was later fined $1.7 billion for the most massive health care fraud in history, he simply kept his stocks in a blind trust. And while the company still donated to his own campaign and to the Senate campaign committee, Frist specifically targeted pharmaceutical companies for donations -- and in particular Eli Lilly, which along with its employees gave more than $400,000 to the senatorial war chest during the election cycle. The company went so far as to buy 5,000 copies of Frist's new book, ''When Every Moment Counts: What You Need to Know About Bioterrorism From the Senate's Only Doctor,'' which it distributed to doctors around the country. In contrast to Jim Wright, the former speaker of the House who had to resign over selling his book to lobbyists, Frist made sure he didn't receive any financial remuneration and instead gave the profits to charity. Meanwhile, Frist offered his own boost to the company -- introducing a provision that, among other things, protected Eli Lilly from lawsuits over a vaccine that thousands of parents maintained caused autism in their children. After the bill stalled, the same exact language mysteriously appeared in the Homeland Security Bill and consequently passed. (Representative Dick Armey belatedly took credit for inserting the language several weeks after his retirement, though few believe he acted alone. In January, Frist honored a deal brokered by Lott to remove it. But after he tried to reintroduce the bill again this year, angry families declared in a press release, ''Frist tries to move under the veil of war.'') By the eve of the 2002 election, Frist had raised more money than any G.O.P. senatorial campaign chairman in history. ''All of a sudden, he became a natural,'' Perdue said.
 What is striking is not that Frist has increasingly mastered the art of politics -- after all, he is in a profession that demands it -- but that unlike other politicians, he has mastered the art of seeming above it. Rather than act like a consummate insider, he maintained the glow of a noble outsider. Once, while other senators were in committee meetings, he resuscitated a tourist dying of a heart attack. Another time he ran from a leadership meeting to rescue Senator Strom Thurmond after he collapsed on the Senate floor. Unlike John Glenn or John McCain, who entered politics as heroes, he had become a hero while in politics. 
 By the time he defied all expectations and delivered the Senate back to Republicans in the fall election, he had quietly amassed one of the most formidable political machines in Washington, commanding the loyalty not only of the senators he had brought into power but the entire G.O.P. caucus and the White House as well. When Lott's status as majority leader came under siege barely a month later, Frist emerged as the most likely candidate for a job that most spend their entire careers seeking. ''He was tough enough to make it happen,'' Bob Dole told me of Frist's positioning himself to be a potential majority leader. ''I think he knew there might be an opportunity when he was ready.'' 
 Frist had already conferred with his advisers about running for president in 2008, and some of his allies cautioned him that being majority leader could damage his presidential hopes -- that the Senate had become increasingly ungovernable, a place that sank the higher ambitions of all those who tried to preside over it. Lott, who was once seen as a rising star, had been vanquished, and Dole, who had abandoned the position to run for president, could never fully escape his reputation as a wizard of Byzantine transactions. Frist had even once told his wife: ''Don't ever let me become majority leader. What majority leader has ever been a great legislator?'' But for all its risks, the position seemed to hold an even greater lure -- overnight it would transform the doctor into one of the most dominant and recognizable politicians in America.
 Frist soon began to organize behind the scenes. ''He believes there was a divine sense in this,'' his friend Dr. Thomas Nesbitt Jr. explained. ''He believes that God had his hand in this.''
 Speaking to me of his campaign for majority leader, Frist said, ''It's a little like driving down the road in Florida and seeing people dying and responding.'' 
 Though more experienced members tried to outflank him, none had reputations that could counter the damage to the party's image. More significant, none had the invisible hand of the White House behind them. Reinhardt, who like many of Frist's friends and allies says he believes Frist will use his power to become a historic leader, explained the relationship this way: ''Part of this came from the White House, which said this is a good guy we can use, and part of it came from his side. I would be very shocked if Billy wasn't thinking of the presidency in 2008, and he feels that being in that camp at this time is useful for his career.''
 Finally, on Dec. 19, Frist sent out a simple statement: ''If it is clear that a majority of the Republican Caucus believes a change in leadership would benefit the institution of the United States Senate, I will likely step forward for that role.'' The next day his old benefactor Lott stepped down.
Not long ago, Frist was sitting in his new office when a senator he had just helped elect returned his call. Frist put him on speakerphone. ''Did I get you out of the most important meeting now?'' Frist said, his accent rising slightly.
 ''Well, I'll tell you what, if I had to sit there any longer and listen to Leahy and Schumer [expletive] and moan. . . . ''
 Frist joked about life in the big city, and then he asked the member for a small favor: he needed him to recite a speech in the old Senate chamber -- a ritual that usually fell to the lowest person on the Senate totem poll. ''It's an annual tradition . . . to have a senator read it,'' he said, noting he had done it, too. ''You got C-Span with you in the room, watching you.''
 ''I don't have to wear a wig, do I?''
 Frist smiled. ''I'd really encourage you to do it,'' he said. 
 The newly elected senator hesitated for a moment. ''That'll be neat.''
 ''Good. . . . I'll put you down.''
 Before hanging up, the other senator said he had a small favor to ask of Frist, too: a major Republican donor was seeking an ambassadorship to some overseas economic development organization. ''I don't even know what the hell it is,'' the junior senator said, ''but he wants it.''
 Frist thought about it for a moment. ''He has lots of dollar figures down there?''
 ''That's exactly right. And he did raise a chunk of money for me.''
 ''All right,'' Frist said. ''You're a good man.''
 The exchange, which took place while I was sitting in the room, offered a glimpse not just of the Senate business but also of the business of the Senate. Early on, Frist used his newfound leverage -- maneuvering and compromising -- to pass the appropriation bills and legislation outlawing partial-birth abortions. But before long, even more than his predecessors, he found himself unable to control the unruly cloakrooms of the Senate. He failed to enact much of Bush's heralded faith-based initiative or find the one vote he needed for drilling in the Alaskan wildlife refuge or overcome the Democrats' filibuster of Estrada. Lott had told The Times of his old disciple: ''I guess I just have a different view of how to get things done. They used to criticize me for moving the trains, but after all, what's the main goal here?'' 
 Then only a few weeks ago, when he tried to broker an old-fashioned deal and move the trains on the president's most important domestic initiative -- a $726 billion tax cut -- he made what he acknowledged was a critical ''mistake.'' Unable to muster enough votes to pass a budget that would accommodate such a large figure, he approved a pact with two moderate Senate Republicans to reduce the tax cut by more than half, which was not, given his slim majority, an unreasonable compromise. But in a move that reflected his inexperience -- Dole had cautioned him that ''the only thing you have up there is your word'' -- he failed to mention the agreement to G.O.P. leaders or to the administration, which was determined to stick to a higher figure. And in an extraordinary step, many Republicans, who had only months earlier championed him, publicly rebuked him. 
 ''You just feel very betrayed, very frankly,'' Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina told The Washington Times. ''We were just furious, and we're still furious.'' Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, whom Frist had just helped elect, told The Washington Post, ''The way to lose everyone over time is have people feel you are not dealing straight up.'' Anonymous White House aides even let it be known that Rove had tracked down Frist while he was on a trip in Asia and told him he had disappointed the president. 
 Rather than rescue the institution, he seemed on the verge of becoming just another product of it. Where he had come to power promising to be ''a healer'' -- to avoid the kind of rhetoric and divisiveness of Lott -- only a few weeks ago he chose to support a key conservative ally, Senator Rick Santorum, who likened homosexuality to incest and polygamy. And after barely 100 days, there were reports that Frist was ''losing control of his troops'' and ''off to a rocky start.'' It was as if he had achieved what he had always wanted, only to find it came at an unforeseeable cost.
 Once, on the night of Bush's State of the Union address, while I was waiting in his office lobby, an aide told me that the senator wanted to see me right away. When I entered his office, Frist was leaning over his desk, his face slightly flushed. ''The White House just called,'' he said. The president, he explained, was going to champion in his speech a proposal that Frist had been working on for years -- to triple financing to $15 billion over five years for the fight against AIDS in Africa. ''This is big,'' Frist said. He started to pace in the room. ''This is big,'' he said again. Later, after the speech, he said, ''I told the president, 'You just saved hundreds of thousands of lives,' and he looked at me and said, 'We just saved a lot more than that.''' 
 It was after midnight, but Frist lingered in his empty office. ''This is why I went into politics,'' he said. ''This is it! This is it!''
 But within days it emerged that the White House had found the money for the proposal, in part, by slashing other health financing. And after Frist bowed to many of Bush's conditions that caused the various financing proposals to founder in Congress, a leading AIDS organization put out a news release saying, ''Senator Frist Sabotages Key AIDS Initiatives.'' Protesters soon appeared outside Frist's Washington home at 6 a.m., blaring sirens, while others stormed into his Senate office hours later, yelling, ''Frist is being a doctor of rhetoric instead of a doctor of action.''
 When a photo of Frist appeared in the paper, looking ashen, his friend Reinhardt told me: ''Poor Billy. I've never seen him look so beleaguered.''
 Recently, just before his 51st birthday, Frist took a break from the Senate and visited his alma mater, Princeton. He had composed a speech called ''The Floor of the U.S. Senate: Is Transplanting Ideas Any Different From Transplanting Hearts?'' Addressing the packed auditorium, he talked about his vision of merging medicine and politics, of saving lives, an ideal that still seemed to captivate him. Then Frist paused and looked out at the crowd. ''Majority leader sounds good, . . .'' he said. ''But people assume you've got a lot of power. . . . There is no power to it. You learn quickly that there's no power.''

Why Hollywood Loves to Repeat Itself

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
"EVERYBODY liked it once."
 That's the way a Hollywood executive, who of course didn't want his name used, explained why he and his colleagues prefer signing off on sequels to gambling on new material. 
 But the fact that everybody liked it once doesn't always guarantee that everybody will like it again, as filmmakers learned last year with the disappointing "Halloween: Resurrection," "Stuart Little 2" and "Analyze That," the sequel to "Analyze This."
"Like everything, there are exceptions," said the co-chairman of Miramax Films, Bob Weinstein. The company's Dimension Films division, which he runs, is releasing "Spy Kids 3: Game Over" in July and recently announced plans to make "Scary Movie 4." 
"Remember 'Species'?" Mr. Weinstein asked, recalling the science fiction thriller that earned $60 million at the domestic box office in 1995. "Remember 'Species II'?" It bombed, taking in only $19 million after its release in April 1998.
Still, moviegoers can expect to see 16 sequels, prequels or franchise installments this year between May and August, among them "Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blue" on July 2, and "Bad Boys II" on July 18. That's more than twice the number that appeared in 2002, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box-office sales. Nine more are slated for the fall. They liked it once, and the corporate upheaval at many media conglomerates has left movie executives looking for what they perceive will be sure bets.
One reason is that the cost of making and marketing a movie has soared from an average of $38.8 million in 1990 to $89.4 million last year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Some studios are finding financing partners to defray the expense. Others are passing on risky projects they might have jumped at two years ago. But all are betting on sequels.
Moviegoers can expect to see two distinct types this year, according to Toby Emmerich, chief executive of production at New Line, a division of AOL Time Warner. There are installments in series that were conceived as such: the "Lord of the Rings" films, the "Matrix" series and the "Harry Potter" films. Dawn Taubin, president for theatrical marketing at Warner Brothers Pictures, which is releasing "The Matrix Reloaded" in May and "The Matrix Revolutions" in November, says the two movies, which were filmed at the same time, are really one story. "You have to have movies that keep the same spirit," she said. "If not, it would be confusing to the audience."
The second type of sequel is created only after a movie becomes a hit -- this summer's examples include "Barbershop 2," "X2: X-Men United" and "2 Fast 2 Furious," all of which became hot properties after their predecessors scored.
"They are harder to do," Mr. Emmerich said. "The magic there is that it has to feel like there was meant to be a sequel even if there wasn't." That was the case with "X2," which took in $85 million in its first weekend.
"Charlie's Angels" was released in 2000 and earned $125 million at the domestic box office. That movie, about three unlikely crime fighters with supermodel looks, was a hit despite its flimsy script. Since the biggest draw was undoubtedly watching sexy and athletic actresses prance around, the challenge for the sequel, "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," is recapturing the original's "joie de vivre," to quote Amy Pascal, chairman of Columbia Pictures, which is releasing the film on June 27 .
Columbia wasn't so lucky with "Stuart Little 2," which was released last year and earned $65 million, less than half of what it had earned in 1999 with the first "Stuart Little." "It breaks my heart," Ms. Pascal said, "because there are many more Stuart Littles to be made. I just need to figure out how to do it economically."
In other words: Everybody liked it once.

HEADLINE: AMERICAN CITIES; 
Los Angeles Clubs of the Moment

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS; NEIL STRAUSS is a cultural correspondent for The New York Times in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
LA BREA TAR PITS, a bunch of fossil-filled gooey puddles smack in the middle of cosmopolitan Los Angeles, exist as a reminder of the manifold mysteries of the land and our species. But they are not the only such wonder of nature in Los Angeles. The other is its night life.
 Every weekday, hundreds of Hollywood's young and beautiful progeny come together at one of the night's preselected hot spots, which are recognizable by the throng of indignant people outside the velvet ropes and, beyond them, the autograph hunters and paparazzi waiting to pounce on any celebrity leaving the club. These nights are not advertised. They are simply known. And this is where the mystery part comes in: overnight, one club that was trendy on a certain night will no longer be cool, and the crowd will move to a new club. And all these clubs are within a few miles of one another, either in Hollywood (around Hollywood Boulevard) or in West Hollywood (around Sunset Boulevard).This migratory pattern is much like that of a monarch butterfly: it is a beautiful sight, but no one knows exactly how the destinations are chosen. 
Before we begin exploring this geographical conundrum, it is necessary to learn a few facts that may be a bit hard for the working man or woman to fathom. The first is that Monday night is the new Friday night. The second is that Tuesday night is the new Saturday night.
 In Hollywood, the word unemployed seems to have become synonymous with the word actor. And the unemployed are under the delusion that when they are in a club drinking, socializing and finding out at which rich guy's house the after-party will be, they are in fact working, though no actual salary is drawn. They call it networking. Thus, night life in Los Angeles is predicated on the idea that day jobs are for the unambitious, and therefore staying out all night on Monday and Tuesday to party can be accomplished guilt free.
 "Most people are in this town to work," said Jenifer Rosero, a co-owner of Supermarket Events and Brent Bolthouse Productions, the longest-running promoter of in-crowd club nights in Los Angeles. "They want to be famous, they want to act, they want to model, they want to be in a music video, or, let's face it, they want the opportunity to have sex with someone famous. And they have the chance to do that in my nightclubs."
 For the sake of convenience, we will lump these aspirants together with the young and broke, the old and rich, and the attractive and confused. Add to these the famous, the wannabe famous, the friends of the famous, the pretending-to-be-famous, the pretending-to-be-friends-of-the-famous and anyone who says, thinks or tells people he can make them famous, and you have the main cast of Hollywood night-life players. In any other city, this is a small group of people. In Hollywood, it is its own universe. And this universe moves in mysterious ways.
 When asked in a telephone interview if this scene had a name, Hartwell, who plays host to a notoriously hard-to-get-into party on Tuesdays at Bar Deluxe, consulted a friend. "What do you call the scene that moves from party to party, event to event, club to club?" he asked. The answer: "The scene."
 According to Dean May, a Los Angeles scene staple who can be spotted at all of the right parties: "As long as you know it's going to be hard to get into, it's going to be good. But nothing really lasts more than six months here. Things just kind of die. First, people in the circle know about it and it's good. Then people from the Valley start coming in. And if the promoters need to make money, and start charging them and letting them in, that's when it gets bad and people move on."
 No matter which party one attends, the entertainment is in the people watching and eavesdropping, especially in the women's bathroom. It is not a cut-loose-and-get-drunk atmosphere. It is a see-and-be-seen scene. After all, the gene pool in these clubs is astounding. These are the places frequented by Britney Spears, Vin Diesel, Christina Aguilera, Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicolas Cage, Hugh Hefner (and his gaggle of blond Playmates) and any other singer, actor, supermodel or Hollywood power broker with an expense account. 
 One can also see just about anyone who has had his or her 15 minutes of fame in the last decade. In past years, when the Whiskey Bar at the Sunset Marquis was in its heyday one could see Verne Troyer (who played Mini Me in the Austin Powers movies) or John Bryan (famous for appearing on tabloid front pages sucking Fergie's toes) mingling with rock singers like Robert Plant and Billy Corgan. Beyond celebrity, young bands just signed to major labels, aspiring actresses who should be resting for the next day's audition, and models with purses full of comp cards are all craning their heads at these parties, straining to see if they should be meeting someone more useful than the person they are currently talking with.
 In some of these clubs the greeting "Hello" has been replaced by "What do you do?" or "What are you working on?" In fact, some people don't even have actual names; they are simply known as "the guy who's friends with Leonardo DiCaprio" or "the girl who was on 'Survivor."'
 "It's a terribly small scene, and it only takes you a few months of going out to notice how small it is," said Zen Freeman of Truth Be Told P.R., which has been trying to draw the Thursday crowd to a new party it plays host to at the restaurant and club White Lotus. "As long as you know Hartwell, and the doorperson Allison at Nacional, and the guys at White Lotus, you can go straight in and see the same old faces. It's definitely set in stone where to go each night in Hollywood."
 FOR a closer examination of the migratory pattern of the scene, take a look at the Lounge at the Standard hotel on Sunset Boulevard. On a Wednesday night, the purple-light-bathed room is jammed, while outside gorgeous and hip men and women -- whom any other club would be glad to have on its guest list -- wait futilely behind the velvet ropes. Inside, one can spot rock stars, pro football players, famous actors, powerful film executives and a former child star or two. On a Friday night, the club has pretty much the exact same doormen, D.J., staff, manager and ambience, but the lounge is nearly empty. Why does the scene choose Wednesday -- and only Wednesday -- to be at the Standard?
 Wendell Green, who is the general manager of the Lounge at the Standard in Hollywood (as well as the Roof Lounge at the Standard's downtown hotel), has a few theories. One is that on weekends, the Hollywood crowd avoids Sunset Boulevard, which is overrun by drunken, "yo, baby"-yelling revelers from the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. "My girlfriend always quotes 'Ghostbusters,"' Mr. Green said. "'Don't cross the streams, it would be bad.' Here, the crowds don't intermingle."
 Mr. Green originally started Wednesday nights as a small underground party, with no intention of competing with bigger clubs. He booked two musicians, Danny Saber and Twiggy Ramirez, as disc jockeys. But, Mr. Green said, the night "caught like wildfire, and it got so popular that Twiggy and Danny stopped doing it because their friends couldn't get in."
 Hartwell, at Bar Deluxe, has occasionally moved his parties to different clubs. When he does, there are no advertisements or announcements. He just tells 100 of his friends, and the rest of the crowd hears through word of mouth. 
 The people at Bolthouse Productions, which holds regular club parties three nights a week, figure that the scene flourishes wherever the famous decide to plant themselves. In fact, one of the company's greatest coups was turning the top floor of Dublin's, one of the most populist meat-market bars on the Sunset Strip, into a party with the tightest list on Monday nights (which was actually mentioned in a hit by the rapper Jay-Z). Of course, the party has already moved elsewhere, to a Greek restaurant called Joseph's Cafe, on Mondays. 
 "We live in a celebrity, entertainment-driven town, and we've never exposed anyone or let press come in or talked about anyone," said Ms. Rosero of Bolthouse Productions. "And therefore the celebrities keep coming back, which drives a lot of other people. I think it has to do with letting these people have peace of mind and seclusion when they're inside."
 One of the great attractions and mysteries of the Bolthouse parties is where the ever-changing array of young gorgeous girls come from. 
 "The Bolthouse parties in particular are a hunting ground," Mr. Green of the Standard said. "Female celebrities don't go out. Male celebrities go out. So the parties became known for having the male celebrities, like Shaq and Justin Murdoch and Brandon Davis and Leonardo DiCaprio. They used to all hunt in a pack." 
 As for atmosphere, most of the clubs are lounges with a small area set aside for dancing. The Standard is more of a rock 'n' roll scene, the Bolthouse parties have a predilection for hip-hop, and Hartwell's events are a little smaller and more laid-back. Then there is the question of getting in. Unless you know or are with someone who knows the doorperson, the best approach is to call in advance. Otherwise, show up early, keep your cool if the doorperson doesn't let you in at first and, as shallow as this is, include as many attractive women in your group as possible. 
 "The rest comes down to your accouterments, the way you finish yourself off," said one club promoter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In New York, it was easier. You could look at people's shoes. In Los Angeles, you can wear Adidas and Levi's, but be driving a Porsche." 

Getting past the velvet rope
 Here is a glimpse of the weekly club circuit for the Hollywood scene. For each night of the week, the available parties are listed in order of popularity. Be forewarned that showing up may not necessarily guarantee admittance, especially if you are part of a pack of males. It is advisable to call the promoter or the club in advance to try to get on the guest list, though names are added at the promoter's discretion. Showing up early (around 10 p.m.) and dressing fashionably (but at the same time not overdressing) will also improve chances of admission. 
 All nightclubs are for ages 21 and over; cover charges vary by club and clientele, from free admission to $20. In addition, most of these clubs, all within a few miles of one another in Hollywood and West Hollywood, are open most other nights of the week and are much easier to get into then.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
The Grand Tour In a Rental Car

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO; SUSAN CATTO contributes to The Times from Toronto.

 BODY:
EAGER to attract United States customers at a time of slow bookings, companies with cars to rent in Europe are sweetening the deal with extras like upgrades and free cellphone rentals. One company will even throw in a half-dozen live lobsters -- not waving their claws in the back seat when you pick up your car, as I imagined, but sensibly delivered to your home in the United States. 
 Since most rentals come with a sheaf of add-ons and insurance options that can be hard to comprehend even if you haven't just stumbled off an eight-hour flight, here are some factors to keep in mind. 
 For the best deals, it's essential to book your car from the United States. You'll qualify for prices and promotions available only to visitors, and you can prepay most charges in dollars. Many offers, like the free cellphone, are available only with advance bookings. (Typically you will be directed to a United States-based company that provides a phone, a number and even business cards. Renters are responsible for the cost of calls, incoming as well as outgoing.)

Getting an Automatic
If you need a car with automatic transmission -- a foreign country is not the place to learn to use a stick shift -- try to book in advance. Automatics are more expensive and harder to find in Europe, particularly outside airports. When my mother and I rented a car in Oxford, England, in the mid-1990's, the only automatic available was a giant luxury vehicle that could barely fit on the tiny Cotswolds roads we planned to explore. We spent a day driving on the muddy shoulder, wincing every time another car squeezed past. After clipping the side mirror of a parked car we returned the behemoth a day early and did the rest of our exploring by bus. 
Bear in mind that European compact car models are typically smaller -- sometimes much smaller -- than North American models. "If you book the smallest car in Los Angeles, you probably can get in it," said Mariana Field Hoppin, a spokesperson for Avis Europe. "If you book the smallest car in Rome, you haven't got a chance of getting in it -- and neither does your suitcase and neither do your wife or your children." Unless you are traveling light, it may be wise to book a midsize or larger car; a European midsize is the equivalent of an American compact, Ms. Field Hoppin said.
If you're under 25 or over 65, be sure to ask about age restrictions. In Ireland, for example, some companies won't rent to drivers over 75, and drivers over 65 may not be allowed to rent the more expensive cars. Younger drivers may also be limited to cheaper cars. In Germany, for example, you can rent nearly any car from Avis from the age of 21 -- but forget about getting that Porsche if you're under 30. 
Know the driving conditions you're likely to face in a particular country. While driving from Pamukkale to Marmaris in Turkey seven or eight years ago, my mother and I were pulled over by police, who made it clear they wanted cash, immediately. I assumed it was a shakedown (and having seen "Midnight Express," was prepared to offer the entire contents of my wallet) until a bilingual Turkish driver who had also been pulled over explained that we had committed some minor traffic infraction and had to pay the equivalent of about $35.
Had I done some research, I would have known to expect both the police checkpoint and the on-the-spot fine. 
Britain's Automobile Association offers a download of a country-by-country summary of driving information like fines, unusual policies (like the on-the-spot fines in Turkey), speed limits, and seatbelt and drunk driving laws. The site, www.theaa.com/allaboutcars/overseas/Europe--advice. html, also has information on road tolls. 
Despite the relatively open borders of the European Union, "don't necessarily assume it's going to be a seamless trip from John o'Groats to Milan," said Luke Bosdet, a spokesman for the British association. Some companies won't let you take your car from Britain to the Continent, and you may not be allowed to take luxury cars into countries where theft is known to be a problem. 
When comparing prices, be aware of add-ons. "Bargain" rates may not include unlimited mileage or airport fees. And value-added tax, which will add 16 percent in Germany, 17.5 percent in Britain and 25 percent in Sweden, for example, also may not be included. If you don't mind the bother, you can avoid airport fees by arranging to pick up a rental in town. Many European countries have rental kiosks at major train stations. If you're planning to use your credit card's insurance in lieu of the rental company's collision damage waiver, be sure your insurance is valid for every country you plan to visit. 
While plenty of Web sites promise cheap rentals, Mr. Bosdet from the British auto association suggests considering some of the bigger companies first. "Although you'll pay a bit more, at least you'll be able to suss out how much they charge," he said. If there is a problem, Mr. Bosdet warns, "It shouldn't come as a blinding shock if you get to the airport and find that the car that you thought you were going to get isn't available because there's been a mix-up. The larger companies have systems in place to respond to complaints and problems." 
In Britain, many companies belong to the British Vehicle Renting and Leasing Association, www.bvrla.co.uk, which enforces minimum standards and offers a conciliation service to resolve complaints. 
If you need a car for more than two weeks, it may be more economical to lease. Leasing, technically "purchase-repurchase" plans, provide new cars to non-European tourists (the rules say the program is not for business travelers) in some countries for periods ranging from 17 days to six months. 
The deal gets better the longer you drive. Leasing a subcompact Renault Twingo with standard shift from Renault Eurodrive costs $749 for a 17-day lease, and additional days each cost $18. If you keep the car for six weeks, the total works out to about $28.50 a day. These short-term leases are tax-free, and the cars come with unlimited mileage and comprehensive insurance. Another advantage over rentals: the minimum leasing age is 18, and there is no maximum age.

Summer Sampler
Like air fares, car rental rates change frequently, and the most up-to-date specials can be found online. Below are some summer offers. Each includes free cellphone rental. 
In business since 1954, Renault Eurodrive, (800) 221-1052, www.renaultusa.com, has sites in nine European countries, though there's a fee for pickups or drop-offs outside France. The company is offering free upgrades in Spain and Portugal on certain midsize models, and pick-up and drop-off fees have been cut in half. A Barcelona pickup costs $22.50 instead of $55; dropping the car off in Lisbon costs $95 instead of $190.Cars are insured for travel in 26 countries.
New York-based Europe by Car, (800) 223-1516, www.ebctravel.com, offers traditional rentals as well as leases on Peugeots and Renaults. The company is offering the same Renault discounts for Spain and Portugal as Renault Eurodrive. A 30-day lease of the economy-sized Peugeot 206, with manual transmission, for pickup and drop-off in France, costs $875. 
Among companies offering short-term rentals, Alamo, (800) 462-5266, www.alamo.com, is offering 20 percent off online bookings until June 30 on standard rates in Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, and 15 percent off rates in many other European countries. A weeklong economy standard rental in Germany usually starts at $202 (at 0.93 euros to the dollar). The discounted Internet rate is $161, a 20 percent discount.
Customers who book a luxury car (called a Prestige rental) with AutoEurope, (888) 223-5555, www.autoeurope.com, before May 31 get six Maine lobsters delivered to their home as part of the deal. For example, in France those rentals start at $99 a day (that's $693 for a week) for a Mercedes Benz E class with manual transmission, based on a weekly rate with unlimited mileage, tax and insurance not included.
Irish rentals are on sale; prices start at $12.99 a day for rentals of a week or more that begin before June 30. (Airport fees and insurance are extra.) Book online by June 30 for free upgrades in Iceland and Sweden. AutoEurope also leases cars.
Avis, (800) 331-1084, www.avis.com, offers a round-the-clock message center and a series of tour itineraries, Personally Yours. (A sample route covers Gothic cathedrals in England; another traces a route that takes in major attractions on the road from Madrid to Barcelona.) 
Europcar, (877) 940-6900, www.europcaramericas.com, owned by Volkswagen, is offering double miles on American Airlines' frequent-flier program, Aadvantage, on rentals of 5 to 30 days in nine European countries through June 15.
Through Sept. 30, Hertz, (800) 654-3001, www.hertz.com, is offering a Freedom Rate: compact car rentals are $39 a day or less or $195 a week or less in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Britain.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Baldwin; 
Solidly Middle Class, but Still Diverse

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
AT roughly two miles wide and five miles long, Baldwin stretches from mid-Long Island to its southern bayfront shores. "We are not the largest town on Long Island, but we are the longest," said Kevin Kamen, a lifetime resident.
 In the usual and often bewildering Long Island manner, Baldwin is in fact not a town at all, but rather an unincorporated hamlet within Nassau County's town of Hempstead, which with some 729,000 residents is the largest town in terms of population not only on Long Island but also in the whole country. 
 Baldwin, with a current population of nearly 32,000, was an early suburb in flower by the 1920's, a full three decades in advance of the suburban surge that enveloped Nassau beginning in the 1950's.
Early development has left its mark in a housing stock of considerable variety, ranging from older colonials and Tudors to ranches and split-levels. Fully a third of the homes were built before 1939. 
"We have a very wide variety of houses, and the older ones add to the charm," said Arlene Gregory, sales manager of Century 21 American Homes in Baldwin. She said inventory, previously tight, had expanded in recent months. Baldwin is defined by the single-family detached home, but there are also co-ops and condominiums.
Home prices are in the midrange for Nassau County, from the high $200,000's to well into the $600,000's and sometimes considerably higher. While they are typical for South Shore areas, they are substantially below prices in most North Shore Nassau communities.
Real estate professionals say the market is brisk. "Anything decent is gone in a couple of days," said Trevor R. Jones, the owner of Coldwell Banker Trevjon Realty in Baldwin.
But they also say that prices, after a dizzy upward climb, seem to be stabilizing. "With spring, of course, comes a new influx of buyers, and interest rates are still wonderful," said Nancy Scarola, the owner of Nancy Scarola Real Estate in Baldwin. "But the prices have leveled out, and I just don't think the upward trend is there anymore."
Erik C. Mahler, the owner of Mahler Realty in Baldwin, said he expected annual price increases of 5 to 7 percent in years ahead "but not the 20 percent last year and the 26 percent the year before." 
Price stability has also settled over condominiums and co-ops, a niche in the Baldwin market. At the Baldwin Point co-op, a two-bedroom, one-bath unit was recently listed at $84,990. At Helena Gardens, a condominium, a one-bedroom, one-bath unit was listed at $181,000.
Many buyers come to Baldwin because of family ties to the area, Mr. Mahler said. Others value the quick commute to Manhattan, a 40-minute ride from the Long Island Rail Road station in Baldwin. For families with children, a consistent draw is the Baldwin Union Free School District, which holds a place among Nassau's high-performance public school systems.
Baldwin also has one very large, amenity-filled waterfront park, the town of Hempstead's Baldwin Harbor Park, and is about 15 minutes from the acclaimed ocean beaches of Jones Beach State Park. 
The local shopping district along Grand Avenue, the main north-to-south artery, is relatively small, and the Baldwin Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation with local businesses, is trying to attract new businesses. But the Roosevelt Field Mall, the largest regional shopping mall on Long Island, is about 15 minutes away.
The Southern State Parkway runs along Baldwin's northern rim, connecting the area to other major Long Island and New York City arteries. 
Civic groups, sports associations and community boosters abound in Baldwin, where Mr. Kamen said the local catch phrase is, "It's all about Baldwin." 
The hamlet comprises Baldwin proper, the more inland, larger and more populous part where older homes are situated, and Baldwin Harbor, which developed in the 1950's when wetlands were filled where Baldwin's finger of land pokes into Middle Bay, Baldwin Bay and Freeport Bay. 
Once the domain of clammers and bay men, Baldwin Harbor, where rudimentary roads were paved with clamshells, is now a waterfront or near-water community where home prices tend to be higher than in Baldwin proper. Some original "clamming shacks" still survive but have been redone and expanded beyond recognition, sometimes crowding their small lots. 
THE two areas are within the Baldwin school district and share the same ZIP code. Residents consider themselves part of one community. 
Mr. Kamen and other local residents said that Baldwin had lately become more ethnically diverse, an observation upheld by comparisons of recent census figures. 
Some said the trend toward diversity has helped Baldwin to escape the tendency of Long Island communities toward ethnic and economic homogeneity. "It's solidly middle class but still diverse," said Jonann Brady, the editor of The Baldwin Herald, a weekly newspaper. "You don't get a sense that it is a rich or a poor community. There is a spectrum of races and classes."
Mr. Kamen, 45, who said he had "never lived anywhere but Baldwin" and never would, also applauded the trend. "Things have changed for the better because so many different ethnic groups have moved in," said Mr. Kamen, a newspaper and print media appraiser and the president of the board for the Baldwin Public Library. 
Census figures give the details. In the 10-year period from 1990 to 2000, the white population of Baldwin declined from 84.79 percent to 65.84 percent. In the same period the black population doubled from 11.55 percent to 22.89 percent and the Hispanic population (which can be either black or white) doubled from 5.75 percent to 11.6 percent. Asian population grew more modestly, from 2.67 percent to 3.3 percent.
In Baldwin Harbor, the white population declined from 95.61 percent to 82.64 percent. The black population of less than 1 percent was up to 8.90 percent. Hispanics increased from 3.09 percent to 6.89 percent.
The figures also suggest a fairly brisk turnover in residents. In Baldwin Harbor, for example, a third of residents had lived elsewhere in 1995. Meantime, the proportion of Baldwin Harbor residents who arrived before 1969 declined from 42.18 percent in 1990 to 20.27 percent in 2000. Trends were roughly similar in Baldwin. 
The Baldwin Union Free School District encompasses Baldwin, Baldwin Harbor and parts of Freeport, Roosevelt, South Hempstead and Rockville Centre. About 5,400 students attend the district's seven elementary schools, one middle school and Baldwin High School.
Some 68 percent of the 345 graduates in the Class of 2002 enrolled in four-year colleges and universities. Another 25 percent enrolled in two-year colleges. Some 70 percent of graduates received Regents diplomas. High school enrollment was about 1,650. 
The average scores on the SAT reasoning test in 2002 were 509 in verbal and 512 in math. National averages for college-bound seniors were 504 in verbal and 516 in math; New York State averages were 494 in verbal and 506 in math.
Results on standardized state tests for 2001-2002 showed 75 percent of fourth graders scored at or above grade level on English and 81 percent were at those levels on math. County averages were 82 percent and 88 percent respectively. For eighth grade students, 63 percent met or exceeded the standards in English and 61 percent in math. County averages were 63 percent and 68 percent.
BALDWIN was one of 14 Long Island school districts listed among the 100 best communities in the country for music education. The American Music Conference and other music groups based the list on results of an Internet survey.
About 1,400 district students participate in music programs, and many music teachers are also performers. This year the high school concert choir sang at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. 
Beginning in third grade, selected students participate in the Suzuki string program for violin. All students in kindergarten through fifth grade sing or play instruments in school concerts.
This year, 59 student musicians and vocalists were all-county performers in the New York State School Music Association competition; five went on to become all-state winners, and two received eastern United States status.
District residents will vote on June 3 on a proposed 5.45 percent increase in school spending for the 2003-4 school year. The budget could be revised downward to reflect state action lowering retirement-fund contributions for the district. 
The area that is now Baldwin was once within the domain of the Meroke Indians, early inhabitants who left behind stacks of clamshells along Milburn Creek. By the mid-17th century the area was known as Hick's Neck, after an English settler, John Hicks, whose family name lives on more permanently in Hicksville, another Nassau hamlet not far off.
A mill that John Pine built in Baldwin in 1686 marked the first faint beginnings of a hamlet that became known as Milburn. In 1855 residents discarded that name in favor of Baldwinsville, to honor the locally prominent Baldwin family. To avoid postal conflict with Baldwinsville upstate, the name was shortened 1871 to Baldwins. The "s" dropped off in 1892; by the early 1900's a local real estate developer was promoting "beautiful Baldwin" as the place to be. 
The Grumman Corporation opened for business in 1930 in a former automobile showroom and garage near the Long Island Rail Road tracks and Grand Avenue. Begun by Leroy Grumman and a handful of others at the start of the depression, the company, which quickly outgrew the showroom and moved elsewhere, grew to become a major manufacturer of military aircraft and was Long Island's largest private employer until defense contract cutbacks of the 1980's. Today it is part of Northrop Grumman and part of Baldwin lore.

Rolf Mahler, who dug clams in his schoolboy days in Baldwin in the late 1940's, said clam diggers gave themselves away by the way they walked after a day of probing the bay bottom with bare feet for clams. Often, he said, aptly named razor clams left toes filleted. "You had to walk as if on eggs the next day," said Mr. Mahler, a member of the Baldwin Historical Society. The open land in the north and almost all of the clamming grounds are now mostly memories. Map of Nassau highlights Baldwin.

HEADLINE: Apartment Market: Small Is Big 

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL 

 BODY:
THE winds of national economic malaise are but a gentle breeze as they pass beneath the gray canopy and by the small but elegant marble lobby of the Central, a condominium and onetime single room occupancy hotel, at the corner of 88th Street and Broadway.
 They stirred Matthew Levine, an administrator at Cardozo Law School, to give up the small studio apartment he had rented for a decade -- at a steeply increasing rent -- to buy his first condo, a crisp white one-bedroom unit just down the hall with much more space, a better view and a mortgage at rates that would have been unimaginable when he started renting. 
 Downstairs, Lisa Ernst, who runs a small nonprofit organization, became a landlady. She rented out her first condominium, purchased at end of the real estate recession a decade ago, and bought a one-bedroom apartment one floor below Mr. Levine's sixth-floor apartment. 
The ill winds gave a moment of pause to Roberta Petersen, who purchased a studio in the Central when it was first transformed from a seedy hotel into a condominium in 1983 and who has been renting it out since she gave up her job at the New York Public Library a few years later and moved to Atlanta with her husband, an investment banker. 
With high-end rents falling across the city, Ms. Petersen considered selling, especially after Mr. Levine, her tenant, found his dream apartment only days after signing a lease renewal. In the end she decided to rent out her apartment again, at least in part out of a romantic urge to maintain a bond with New York. But she had to settle for a rent of $1,675 a month, $160 less than she had been expecting.
"It probably would have been smart to have sold it," she said. "But I was feeling such a strong connection to New York. It was the most interesting and exciting city I had lived in, and I have lived in Dusseldorf, Nice, Florence and London."
Her new tenant, a Harvard law graduate who is a second-year associate at a law firm, decided to rent the studio on an impulse as soon as he had seen it. He had been renting a one-bedroom in the neighborhood for $2,450 a month and found that with an 80-hour work week he did not have much time to enjoy the extra space.
The ebb and flow of humanity in and out of the building at 250 West 88th Street, where half of the 59 apartments are one-bedrooms or studios, is in some ways perfectly ordinary, but it illuminates some basic facts about the city's apartment market these days.
While figures for Manhattan show that sales of the largest and most luxurious apartments softened last year, for the second year in a row, sales and prices of small apartments have remained strong. Sales of studios and one-bedrooms increased 25 percent last year over 2001, when transactions all but stopped after the Sept. 11 attacks. Sales of other apartments increased 7 percent from the year earlier.
The strength of the market for smaller apartments is also measurable in another way: the gap in price, measured in dollars per square foot, between them and the larger and generally more luxurious apartments is narrowing.
In the real estate recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, the market for these small and smaller apartments virtually collapsed. Some banks would not even issue mortgages for studios, while others, brokers recall, sold off foreclosed Manhattan studios for as little as $15,000.
But this time around, as New York and the nation struggle with a stagnating economy, sales of these smaller apartments have remained strong. 
Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal company, recalled that much of his business in the early 1990's consisted of appraising properties in foreclosure. "I remember thinking you could buy a studio in Tudor City and put the entire purchase price on a credit card," he said. 
The market shift can be seen by comparing the prices of studios, square foot by square foot, with larger apartments during the last decade. For a generation, larger apartments have commanded a premium over smaller ones, leading many people looking for large family size apartments to buy smaller adjacent ones to combine.
But as the prices of larger apartments have fallen, the gap between studios and larger apartments has narrowed. 
In 1993, for example, two-bedroom co-ops sold on average for 79 percent more per square foot than co-op studios ($251 per square foot versus $140). Last year that gap narrowed to 33 percent ($595 for the two-bedroom versus $446 for the studio), based on an analysis of figures compiled by Mr. Miller for a market report for Douglas Elliman, the residential brokerage. The gap for condos of those apartment sizes also declined, but by less, from a 40 percent premium in 1993 ($337 a square foot for the two-bedroom, $241 for the studio) to 23 percent in 2002 ($740 for the two-bedroom, $601 for the studio). 
There are seemingly as many forces driving the market for these lower-priced apartments as there are buyers and sellers at the Central and other co-op and condo buildings.
This market is stronger than it was a decade ago, some real estate analysts say, because there was a glut of new construction and conversions in the late 1980's -- more than 22,000 condominium units came on the market between 1985 and 1990, according to an industry group, the Real Estate Board of New York -- and very little has been added in recent years.
Then there has been the sharp declinein interest rates, from more than 10 percent on a 30-year mortgage in 1990 to less than 6 percent this year, lowering the cost of owning an apartment.
Others emphasize the decline of stock prices, which have led investors to seek a safe haven in real estate, which they believe can provide long-term gains. And if real-estate prices drop, at least they have a place to live.
Another theory links the strength in the condo and co-op market to weakened demand in the rental market. The uncertainties of war and peace and terrorism are said to be leading some renters to shop around and look for a more permanent abode.
"Something has happened in the world that makes people much more home oriented," said Ruth McCoy, an executive vice president at Brown Harris Stevens. "They want that security of owning. With interest rates as low as they are, it just makes sense to buy."
David Michonski, chief executive of Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy, said he had found buyers at all market levels -- including foreign buyers looking for a New York place and parents looking for college apartments for their children -- shifting money from stocks and bonds into real estate.
"There are people saying, 'You know, hon, we lost $200,000 in our portfolio; let's go buy a pied-a-terre in New York,' " he said.
Hy Rosen has seen the downs and ups of the market for smaller apartments. In 1987, he and his wife, Myrna, bought a 309-square-foot studio at 320 East 54th Street from the sponsor of its condominium conversion for $110,000. Their plan was to use it during the week, weekending in Rockland County.
He watched the value of his new apartment plummet as the market for studio apartments faltered in the recession in the early 1990's. But when they decided to rent it out, they were gradually able to negotiate rent increases to $1,900 a month from $1,300. 
Then as the New York economy suffered, their tenant, who was on a month to month lease, called attention to the lower rental prices in the classified ads, and they dropped the rent to $1,700. Now the apartment is in contract for about $240,000, more than double what they paid for it. 
"I bought if for $110,000 and a year later it was worth $85,000 -- but it came back," he said. "I have some stocks that I bought that will never come back because the companies don't exist anymore."
Studios have always been an important part of the real estate market in Manhattan, where high land costs over the years led landlords to pack smaller apartments into their buildings. While Manhattan has 42 percent of New York City's co-ops and condos, it has 62 percent of the 45,700 studio units, according to the 1999 New York City Housing Vacancy Survey.

Beyond Manhattan
Greater Demand For Studios
In the other boroughs, and across the Hudson in New Jersey, brokers have noted some similar patterns. Sales of very expensive apartments have slowed, with prices remaining at their recent highs or slightly below them. At the same time the market for less expensive apartments -- including studios, one-bedrooms and some lower-price larger units -- remains strong, as renters, taking advantage of low interest rates are stepping up to buy.
"Studios are good investment properties," said Randy Lyn Ketive, a broker in Fort Lee and a principal in the Classic Realty Group. "The rental market has gone down the drain in the last six months now that it is cheaper to own than to rent. The customer who rented here two or three years ago is now buying."
Jean Austin, owner of Brooklyn Bridge Realty on Court Street in Cobble Hill, said, "The very high end is moving slower, but still moving." But most of her sales lately have been not to the legendary Manhattan exiles lured to Brooklyn by lower prices and more space. "To tell you the truth," she said, "our sales are to people already renting in the neighborhood."
In lower-priced areas, like the Bronx and along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, low interest rates have spurred sales in all apartment sizes. "We have a general shortage of housing in all categories; everything is flying out of here," said Joe Hasselt of Hasselt Realty on East Tremont Avenue in Westchester Square in the Bronx. "It is quite surprising considering that the unemployment rate in the Bronx in now 10 percent."
And at the Fairview, a 424-apartment cooperative at 61-20 Grand Central Parkway in Forest Hills, Queens, a studio apartment is setting a local record: the highest price yet paid for a studio there, $135,000. 
Gregory J. Carlson, executive director the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives and Condominiums, who lives in the building, said the buyers, a young couple, were moving to escape the high cost of living in Chinatown in Manhattan. At 720 square feet, the studio was larger than many one-bedrooms in Manhattan, he said.
Another factor in the strength of the small apartment market is the supply of new apartments. During the last few years, almost no new studio apartments have been built, while hundreds of larger apartments have been completed. 
Louise Sunshine, head of the Sunshine Group and a marketing consultant for luxury condominium developments, said that while most new condos were studios or one-bedrooms in 1990, the studios developed in the last few years have been largely confined to condominium hotel projects. 
In 1990, one of five new condominium apartments was a studio, but by 2000, only one of 50 new condo apartments was a studio, Ms. Sunshine said. One-bedroom apartments made up half of new condominiums in 1990, but only 20 percent in 2000.
The Central was built in an earlier era of space and elegance, though it was never among the most exclusive West Side addresses. In 1915, annual leases were advertised at $1,400 to $1,600, but by 1933, a seven-room apartment could be leased for "a bargain rental" of "$1,200 a year and up." 
But by the the 1960's, the building had gone through many changes, riding the ups and downs of the economy and achieving a certain notoriety. Its apartments had been stripped and converted into the 180-room Central Apartment Hotel. It occasionally drew police attention, as when a $25-a-week guest killed the hotel manager with a hatchet in 1966. It was reborn as the Central condominium in 1983, with a lobby of white marble, a domed ceiling and polished brass, and a new glass-walled eighth floor.
Roberta Petersen was one of the first new owners. An art and history major in college, she had come to New York to study library science at Pratt and stayed 15 years, working at an auction house, the Metropolitan Museum and finally the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue.
She had lived in a one-bedroom apartment at East 69th Street in the 1970's and immediately sold it for under $100,000 after the building was converted to a co-op. She realized she had made a mistake when the apartment doubled in price in two years. "Once you sell something in New York, you can never get it back again," she said, wistfully. 
So she bought a new studio condo in the Central with hardwood floors and no original details for $72,500 and another $7,500 for built-ins and joined the condo board. After she moved to Atlanta, she stayed on the board for a while for the chance to go to New York for meetings, and she still comes back, buying art for Atlanta clients.

At the Central
A Renter Becomes An Apartment Owner
In 1993, Matthew Levine was looking for a new apartment, his third studio since moving to New York a few years earlier. He found what he wanted in Apartment 208. 
A couple was planning on pulling up stakes in New York and moving to New Zealand. He would build a boat, and she would write a book. They wanted to sell, but buyers were scarce because banks were leery of writing mortgages on studios in the depressed market, they told him, and were prepared to rent instead.
Mr. Levine was ready to sign, but then a buyer stepped forward. Lisa Ernst had been looking to rent but found that every apartment she saw "was a shoe box and they wanted $1,000 a month for it." So by the time she got to the Central, she was ready to buy. The sellers wanted $135,000. They settled on $124,000.
"I was buying my first place, and ignorance was bliss," Ms. Ernst said. "I wasn't doing it for investment purposes -- I wanted to find a place where I could live. I had to borrow from everyone I knew. For three or four years I was barely making ends meet, but after that it totally paid off for me."
Mr. Levine was left out. But the sellers of Apartment 208 introduced Mr. Levine to Ms. Petersen, the owner of No. 608, who was looking for a tenant, and he rented instead for just under $1,200 a month. 
Ms. Ernst, who now runs ThinkQuest New York City, a group that sponsors a computer competition for New York City students, gradually began a "three-year plan" to save enough money to buy a larger apartment. 
Mr. Levine continued to pay rent to Ms. Petersen, year after year, a rent that gradually rose to $1,835. But the market was tight, and finding a better rental was difficult.
He was busy with his work as associate dean for business affairs at Cardozo Law School and performing with the Blue Hill Troupe, a light opera company on the Upper East Side. Every time he renewed his lease he thought about buying, but then didn't. "Prices rose," he said. "Two years later, I wished I had bought two years ago." 
But for Mr. Levine, buying an apartment was caught up with other more complicated issues, like growing up and settling down. "I was always hoping that when I got married I would get a bigger apartment and I thought that then, I wouldn't buy anything smaller than a two bedroom," he said.
Then as his latest lease renewal date approached, Mr. Levine, still single, began to get serious about buying his own apartment. "It was partly that I was 44 years old, living in studio apartments for 15 years," Mr. Levine said. "I thought it was about time I got a real apartment that had light and had a bedroom and where I was making an investment."
But he just could not find the right apartment at the right price and signed a renewal lease for his studio. The next day his broker called and said a one-bedroom was on the market on his floor. After a hectic week of negotiating, he made a deal for $440,000, about 10 percent above the asking price. 
Mr. Levine calculated that with his new mortgage and maintenance, property taxes and tax deductions, his monthly housing costs would rise from $1,835 to $2,200 in exchange for a much larger space.
The deal gave Mr. Levine a new perspective on the rental market when he began holding open houses and working with his landlord, Ms. Petersen, to rent her studio. During the summer, Ms. Ernst had moved into her new one-bedroom apartment and rented her studio for $2,000. But by October, Mr. Levine and Ms. Petersen had found little interest at that price and eventually rented it out for $1,675 a month.
Mr. Levine provided some compensation to Ms. Petersen for the broken lease, but his purchase had compensation of its own. He bought his first dining room table. Some condo owners in the building began greeting him by name. And perhaps because of his M.B.A. degree, he was asked if he wanted to serve on the condo board.

HEADLINE: Giving a Car to Charity May Aid Giver the Most 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HOW much of a tax deduction can you safely claim on the old junker you gave to a charity that advertised on the radio for car donations?
 Quite a bit, according to a new study by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Research by the office, which raised eyebrows in Congress, found that 733,000 taxpayers claimed they donated cars in 2000 worth a total of $2.5 billion. That reduced their tax bills by an average of $892 each, or a total of $654 million. 
 Yet "no data exist on whether these deductions were appropriately claimed," the auditors said. The Internal Revenue Service has a program for identifying whether deductions of $5,000 or more for donated goods, including cars, have been overstated, but was unable to tell the auditors "whether cases referred for further review by this program are ever pursued," the G.A.O. said.
Many tax experts suspect that the real value was much lower than the $3,400 average, and that few taxpayers donate a car worth that much; such a vehicle is more likely to be traded in, sold or passed on to a relative, they say.
"It's likely that only a small percentage of valuable cars are being donated," said a Republican staff member for the Senate Finance Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Cathleen A. Berrick, a financial expert with the General Accounting Office who testified before the committee, offered an example, a 1983 truck donated to a tax-deductible charity in 2000. The owner claimed a deduction of $2,400, but the truck brought just $375 at auction.
Of that amount, $312 went for expenses, like advertising, cleaning and repairs, leaving net proceeds of $63. The charity, which was not identified, split that amount with its fund-raiser, so it received only $31.50.
How much this deduction cost the Treasury is not clear, but people who donate cars are typically among the 30 percent of taxpayers who itemize on their tax returns, experts say. The Republican staff member, said such donors are "easily in the 28 percent bracket." In the case of the 1983 truck, that would mean a reduction in the tax bill of $672. So the deduction cost the Treasury $21 for each $1 the charity received.
The G.A.O. study found that sometimes charities do worse. One group told the auditors that it would accept vehicles that might not yield a profit, after towing and other expenses, because accepting the junker generates "good will for future donations."
And even when the vehicle is worth something, the charity may not get much of the value. A survey of 187 California charities found that 72 received less than 40 percent of a car's value after accounting for expenses, including payments to auction houses and professional fund-raisers.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said: "It's really surprising that charities sometimes get pennies on the dollar from vehicle donations. With all of the ads encouraging vehicle donation, reasonable consumers assume charities always get the lion's share from those transactions. Unfortunately, that's not the case."
Many of the charities let fund-raising companies -- some of them for-profit enterprises -- handle picking up and selling such vehicles.
Mr. Grassley, who said he was considering how to clean up the system, said: "We need to make sure Uncle Sam isn't being taken for a ride by people overstating the value of their donated cars. It isn't really fair to take a $5,000 tax deduction for a car that sells for $400 at auction and nets $40 for a charity."
One possibility, tax experts say, would be to require the charity to report back to the taxpayer on what the vehicle sold for, and limit the taxpayer's deduction to that amount. At the moment, however, charities have no interest in how much the taxpayer claims on his or her return. The process, according to the committee staff member, is in the hands of "a whole host of people who have no driving interest in assuring an accurate statement."
In fact, the General Accounting Office studied 117 advertisements placed by charities seeking donations, and found that 38 specified that donors could claim fair market value, "while 8 identified that a donor could claim full or maximum market value." Other ads referred donors to used-car guides like the Kelley Blue Book, although using such a guide fairly would require the donor to make a realistic assessment of the vehicle's condition.
Indeed, many charities that advertise seeking donations promise free towing. If the car has to be hauled away, how much can it be worth?

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Frank James And Barry James; 
Golden Rainbow Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE father-and-son team of Frank and Barry James, co-managers of the $63 million Golden Rainbow fund, have begun to shift some of the fund's money from bonds into stocks.
 "We've had a negative view of the stock market," Frank James, the father, said from their office in Alpha, Ohio, near Dayton. "Now we're getting indications that the stock market is in for a rally." 
 They see the biggest values in cyclical and industrial stocks, his son said. "These aren't stocks that we're going to buy and hold forever," he said, "but many of them are big bargains now and we can make big profits." About 50 percent of the fund's assets are now in stocks, with the balance in bonds. At the start of 2003, the mix was 40 percent stocks, 60 percent bonds. 
The fund returned 2.8 percent a year, on average, in the three years through Thursday, placing in the top 12 percent of all domestic hybrid funds, which own a mix of stocks and bonds. That category lost 2.7 percent, annualized, in that time, according to Morningstar Inc., versus a loss of 12.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The fund fell 2.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with declines of 5.3 percent for its group and 13.9 percent for the S.& P. 500.
Frank James, 72, is president of James Investment Research, the fund's adviser, which manages about $500 million for individuals and institutions. He has run Golden Rainbow since it was started in 1984 by Citizens Federal Bank as a bank common fund, run for trust clients; Golden Rainbow converted to a mutual fund in July 1991. The name, he said, reflected a bank goal of providing "the gold at the end of the rainbow." Barry James, 46, joined the adviser in December 1986 and is now its executive vice president.
Preserving capital is an important goal of the fund, Frank James said. The managers aim to accomplish that by finding undervalued companies that are neglected by Wall Street but that they believe have strong futures.
They use a computer model that screens mostly American stocks with market capitalizations of at least $200 million, ranking them based on ratios of price to earnings and price to book value, as well as earnings in the previous 12 months. Then they review the top 10 percent of companies identified by the model.
The managers say that they expect the stock market to be relatively stable in the first half of 2003 but that it may be more volatile in the second half if the economy weakens.
Under these circumstances, they have been seeking companies with strong cash flow. "Companies live and die by cash flow," said Barry James, "especially in economic environments like this one."
They are also avoiding debt-laden companies. "It's not just the accounting scandals that have pulled down some companies recently," Frank James said. "It was their heavy debt loads as well."
The managers review stocks for sale when companies fall into the bottom half of the computer ranking model or when their prices start lagging.
The bond portion of the portfolio is invested mostly in Treasury bonds with small stakes in high-quality corporate and mortgage-backed bonds.
The managers began buying shares of Pharmaceutical Resources, of Spring Valley, N.Y., in October 2002 and have paid $24.53, on average, for the entire position; the shares now trade at $40.05.
The company, which makes and is a wholesale seller of generic drugs, has strong relationships with health maintenance organizations and retail drug chains, Frank James said. Its earnings are rising rapidly, he said, adding that "retail chains are looking to cut their costs, and buying generic is one way to do that." The company has very little debt, he said, and a return on assets of 28 percent.
THE Ball Corporation, the food and beverage container company based in Broomfield, Colo., has also had rapidly growing earnings, Barry James said. The managers began buying shares in May 2002, paying $45.39, on average; the stock is now at $55.99. Ball is known for producing goods used in home canning. "With the economy slowing and unemployment rising," he said, "people are looking for things to do themselves to save money." 
In the corporate bond category, the managers like a 7.787 percent coupon bond issued in December 1991 by GE Capital and due in December 2006. The bond is rated triple-A by S.& P.
"This is the type of high-quality bond that we like to hold to maturity," Frank James said. In September 2001, the fund paid $114.35 for each $100 in face value of the bonds; they now trade at $117.47.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
This Time, Bonds and Stocks May Prosper Together

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve's surprising announcement last week that it was concerned about falling inflation -- and the threat of deflation -- has improved the outlook for bonds. 
 "The bond market has found another reason for bullishness," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup. 
 Bonds may not outperform stocks for a fourth consecutive year. But the Fed indicatedlast week that it would keep interest rates low even in the face of economic recovery. That suggests that bonds can perform well for a longer time than has been expected, because they are not likely to face a big sell-off, even if the stock market rallies in tandem with the economy. 
In the last several years, bonds regularly declined when stocks rallied, and rose when stocks fell. Now the Fed has effectively severed that link. "We are in that sweet spot in the cycle where bonds and stocks can rally together," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig.
The Fed's surprise announcement came on Tuesday, after policy makers decided not to cut their benchmark short-term interest rate, now 1.25 percent.
Without using the word, Fed officials signaled a concern about deflation when they said in their statement: "The probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level."
That language means that the central bank is concerned that prolonged economic weakness could transform a big slowdown in price increases into a broad decline in prices. Such deflation could bring falling incomes, declining asset values and the kind of economic doldrums that have plagued Japan for more than a decade.
Although Fed officials said that this threat was minor, there is reason to take notice. The core rate of inflation, excluding the cost of food and energy, is already very low. It was down to an annual rate of 1.5 percent in March, as measured by a broad indicator based on the personal consumption expenditures included in the gross domestic product.
The Fed's apparent strategy for defending against this threat is to keep interest rates low or reduce them even more, even if the economy picks up speed later this year and the beginning of next year.
Analysts say the central bank is therefore not likely to raise interest rates until the spring of 2004 -- or later. It is also possible that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate again, to less than 1.25 percent, as soon as the June meeting.
"If you thought the Fed would raise interest rates when the economy started to recover, then this does change things," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan.
Low interest rates bode well for stocks as well as bonds because lower rates can spur growth, increase profits and push share prices higher. But people who have been thinking of shifting some money from bonds into stocks may hold off now, especially if they prefer the relative safety of fixed-income investments.
The best sectors for longer-lasting fixed-income returns are high-yield and investment-grade corporate bonds. Treasuries, while safer, are much less attractive. So far this year, the total return on Treasuries is 2.4 percent, and yields are near their recent lows. Because there is little room for Treasury yields to drop, there is less chance for prices, which move in the opposite direction, to rise. 
CORPORATE bonds are another matter. Investment grade bonds have returned 5.9 percent so far this year, beating the Dow Jones industrial average and not far behind the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and they now have room to improve further. High-yield bonds have returned 14.2 percent, beating the Nasdaq. The Fed's worry about deflation ought to help this good performance continue.
"A bond investor is near the end of the game, but it is not the bottom of the ninth," said Paul A. McCulley, a portfolio manager and economist at Pimco in Newport Beach, Calif. "They are in an earlier inning.Before Tuesday they were in a later inning."

 The C.I.A.'s Bad Trip

Q. I read recently that the C.I.A. conducted drug experiments in the 1950's in New York. Any idea where?

A. In the cold war 1950's, the spy game between the United States and Russia was afoot. In hopes of developing a truth serum, C.I.A. scientists began experimenting with the hallucinogenic LSD. At first the work was conducted at the university level in a program called MK-Ultra, but the experiment eventually moved off campus, to an apartment at 81 Bedford Street in Greenwich Village.
 In 1953 the apartment was rented to a man named on the lease as Morgan Hall. In reality, Morgan Hall was George Hunter White, who had conducted LSD experiments for the C.I.A. in a program called Operation Midnight Climax.
White transformed the apartment into a safe house complete with two-way mirrors and surveillance equipment. Posing as Morgan Hall, artist and seaman, he used to lure people back to the apartment and give them LSD -- sometimes with consent, sometimes without -- and recorded the drug-induced behavior.
In 1955 White and Operation Midnight Climax were moved to Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, where the operation used prostitutes to lure men to the safe house for experiments. The entire project is described in the 1985 book "Acid Dreams: The C.I.A., LSD and the Sixties Rebellion" by Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain (Grove Press). 
In 1965, the C.I.A. pulled the plug on Operation Midnight Climax and admitted it was unethical. Possession of LSD was made illegal in 1966.

4 Fares in 4 Days

Q. Hmm, city in fiscal crisis, subway fares go up. Haven't I seen this movie before?

A. It was playing back in 1975 when subway fares jumped to 50 cents from 35 cents, during New York's most famous fiscal crisis, when the city neared bankruptcy. This sequel, however, has different producers.
The situations are fundamentally different, said Stephen Berger, who helped shepherd New York through the 1970's crisis as executive director of the New York State Emergency Financial Control Board for the city. In the 1970's the city subsidized the Metropolitan Transportation Authority more than it does today. So any depression in the city economy affected the M.T.A. Since then, the role of city subsidies in the M.T.A. budget has been reduced to the point where there is "no direct correlation," said Mr. Berger, who is now chairman of Odyssey Investments.
Despite pledging to "hold the fare" in the 1973 mayoral campaign, Mayor Abraham D. Beame had little choice in 1975 but to acquiesce to the M.T.A. decision to raise fares. The 43 percent increase was met with demonstrations, and civic groups encouraged passengers to enter through exit gates without paying.
The increase caused an odd pricing situation. At the time, half-price fares were offered on Sundays and holidays. The fare on Saturday, Aug. 30, was 35 cents; on Sunday it was 17 cents. On Monday, Sept. 1, the fares went up but because it was Labor Day, the price was 25 cents. The next day, the fare rose to 50 cents. Four different subway fares in four consecutive days was unprecedented.

I on the Aisle

Q. Although an avid theatergoer, I just noticed there is no "Row I" in any Broadway theaters. Why is that?

A. According to Ken Mandelbaum, a Broadway historian, theaters omit the row "I" to avoid confusion with the number 1. There's already enough confusion with people sitting in the wrong seats, which, if you're an avid theatergoer, you've probably noticed happens a lot.

HEADLINE: Years of the Dragons 

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
THE night of Aug. 29, 1978, a lean, neatly dressed 23-year-old stumbled into the Fifth Precinct station house in the heart of Chinatown, bleeding from bullet wounds to his head and back. The victim was immediately recognized as the founder of the Ghost Shadows, one of Chinatown's most notorious gangs. But he refused to cooperate with the police, except to confirm that the shooting had taken place around the corner, at a mah-jongg parlor hidden beneath a restaurant on Mott Street. 
 One afternoon a few weeks ago, the same man, now 48 and graying, strode confidently into the Chinatown Day Care Center, a community-run nursery on Division Street. A 4-year-old in a purple down jacket darted from her seat to give her father a hug. 
 "Chinatown is not like before," the man remarked to a visitor as he returned the child's hug. "Chinatown is peaceful now. And there are no more gangs." 
Of all the changes that have taken place in Chinatown in the last decade -- the new wave of Fujianese immigrants, the shrinking of neighboring Little Italy, the gentrification of once squalid tenements -- none has been as dramatic, or as historic, as its disappearing gang culture. Yin, who agreed to discuss his past on the condition that only his first name be used, played a pivotal role in this culture before serving 10 years in prison. But it is fast becoming a thing of the past. 
Last year, for the first time in recent memory, not a single homicide was reported in the Fifth Precinct. The bullet-ridden alleyways of Mott and Pell Streets, the site of so many bloody turf wars, are as safe as the new Times Square. Local merchants who once coughed up thousands of dollars a year for protection money now use that money for mortgages. The cliques of menacing gang members who once recruited outside schoolyards have vanished without a trace. 
"The heyday of youth gangs hanging out at different buildings and gambling houses, protecting businesses, going to restaurants for 'tiger meals' and not paying -- that has pretty much disappeared from Chinatown," said Peter Kwong, director of the Asian-American studies program at Hunter College and the author of "The New Chinatown" (Hill & Wang, 1996).
The Jade Squad, a now-defunct special police unit formed in the 70's to tackle the gangs, attributed the change to arrests and racketeering convictions. The reasons are more complex, touching upon such diverse factors as changing international drug routes, cultural shifts, assimilation, even the crush of buses bound for Atlantic City. 
But whatever the explanation, few will forget the screams of kidnapping victims and the crackle of bullets flying through crowded Chinese restaurants that marked the era of gang domination in the neighborhood. For better or worse, gangs were embedded in Chinatown's fabric. 
"It's a part of our history that we need to remember," another former gang member said. "Gangs were a major part of Chinatown's soul."

The Ghosts of Mott Street
Yin, the gang member who stumbled into the Fifth Precinct station that violent night, was 15 when he started hanging out with the wrong crowd. With his lanky frame and boyish good looks, he looked like a model child, but his charismatic smile and intense manner made him a natural leader for disaffected Chinatown youths. 
By that year, 1970, Chinatown was home to five gangs: Chung Yee, Liang Shan, the Flying Dragons, the White Eagles and the Black Eagles. At first, they coexisted in relative peace, their memberships small, the spoils meager. But as boundaries were drawn, giving each gang a slice of Chinatown from which to profit, turf wars flared.
Rather than join an existing gang, Yin started his own. According to a federal indictment brought against him in 1985, Yin was the founding chairman of the Ghost Shadows, a gang that terrorized Chinatown for more than two decades. His role was so critical and his influence so great, in certain circles he is still considered a legend. 
With no reputation or territory of his own, Yin set his sights on Mott Street, Chinatown's spiritual heart and a strip to which the White Eagles had already laid claim. To gain notoriety and prestige, the Ghost Shadows committed dozens of high-profile crimes, ranging from the murder of rival gang members to the armed robbery of a local newspaper. The emergence of the Ghost Shadows signified a bloody new chapter in Chinatown history. 
"There was a tremendous amount of street violence," said Nancy Ryan, who founded the Asian gang unit of the Manhattan District Attorney's office and whose prosecution of Yin and others earned her the nickname Dragon Lady. "Nobody had seen such a thing before in Chinatown."
In one grisly incident, Yin and other Shadows were patrolling Mott Street when they spotted a White Eagle walking alone. They forced him into a car, "drove him to a pier at the East River, bound his hands behind his back with wire, and tied his feet together with twine," the indictment said. "They then threw him into the river to drown." 
"If you couldn't beat them, you had to join them," Yin said the other day during an informal tour of old gang landmarks that offered a rare, firsthand glimpse into a world normally seen through the eyes of the police. "If I didn't fight, I wouldn't have survived."
The takeover of Mott Street, however, was not complete until the Shadows got the official nod from the tong, or fraternal association, of the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association. Founded in 1893, On Leong is ensconced in a building with a pagoda roof at the corner of Mott and Canal Streets. From its red-lacquered balcony on which the Taiwanese flag flies proudly, one can survey the entirety of Mott Street as if from a castle on a hill. 
Like most Chinatown tongs, On Leong was on the surface a legitimate enterprise, serving as a business collective, a crutch for immigrants, even a loan company. But as Chinatown knew all too well, the largest tongs were also the brains behind the gangs. In 1974, relations between On Leong and its street muscle, the White Eagles, soured. On Leong sanctioned a takeover by the 200-member Shadows, and after a quick blood bath, Mott Street was firmly identified as Ghost Shadows territory. 

ABC's and FOB's
The takeover of Mott Street by the Shadows culminated a life of crime that began before the gang's leader was in high school. Yin came to New York in 1966 at the age of 11, the son of parents who were among the tidal wave of Chinese immigrants who flooded Lower Manhattan just after restrictive quotas against Asians ended in 1965. Chinatown was both new frontier and emerging ghetto. Like many of his peers, Yin lived in a cramped tenement apartment on Eldridge Street as his parents struggled to make a living. 
"My parents were garment workers and didn't have time to focus on their children," said Yin, who speaks in a whispery voice and still struggles with English. "A normal job here is like 70 hours, even now. I had to make my own judgments, my own money."
As Chinatown's population exploded, so did crime. But contrary to myth, the neighborhood's gangs were not imported wholesale from Asia. The violent Chinatown underworld, vividly sketched in the 1985 Mickey Rourke film "Year of the Dragon," and in countless television cop shows, did not spread from Hong Kong like some virulent strain. A strictly American byproduct, it embodied the modern history of Chinatown. 
The first gangs were formed in the early 1960's by American-born Chinese -- ABC's, as they were called -- to fend off attacks from non-Asian outsiders known as lo fans, and members rarely committed crimes involving their own people. 
That changed around 1970 as new immigrants "fresh off the boat," or FOB's, began forming their own street gangs for more nefarious purposes. Like Yin, the younger generation came from impoverished homes, spoke little English and saw few opportunities in their adopted country except to band together socially and criminally. In this they mirrored the youth of earlier immigrant groups for whom a life of crime was often a crucial first step up the economic ladder.
"It was never my intention to come to the U.S. and get into trouble," Yin said. "My parents and I just wanted better prosperity. I just fell into the situation."
Chinese gangsters were never hard to spot. There was an unspoken uniform of tight black jeans that tapered around bare ankles, white Keds, spiky hair with dyed highlights and a beeper. Some wore black nylon bomber jackets with a colorful dragon stitched on the back.
Clouds of cigarette smoke hovered over certain basements where the tongs had set up illegal gambling parlors for poker, mah-jongg, fan-tan and pai gow. More than 15 major parlors hid in plain sight, some raking in $2 million a month. 
For most of the 80's and 90's, shopkeepers regarded protection money as a cost of doing business in Chinatown. Gang members knew to dance around the topic, the better to avoid self-incrimination; some arrived bearing a mandarin orange tree, with a reciprocal donation implied.
"All the store owners knew that before their store opened, they would have to pay," said Ko-Lin Chin, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University and the author of "Chinatown Gangs: Extortion, Enterprise and Ethnicity" (Oxford University Press, 1996). "They would always sit down and negotiate a price over tea. It was very polite."
Bonuses came on the Chinese New Year, in late winter, when a half-dozen lion dances, sponsored by various tongs, snaked through Chinatown to offer blessings amid the deafening pop of firecrackers. While tourists snapped pictures, the dancers collected wads of cash stuffed in red envelopes. 
Wherever large sums of money exchanged hands, the gangs sought a slice of the action. Counterfeit handbags did not originate with the gangs, but they soon began getting a cut. Massage parlors and prostitution rings offered another revenue stream. By the mid-80's, "China White" was added to the list. The gangs served as the final leg of a heroin distribution network that started in Thailand, Burma and Laos, the so-called Golden Triangle. In the early 90's, as much as half the heroin bought in the United States passed through Chinatown. 

The RICO Years
Before federal authorities began clamping down on the gangs, Yin had been arrested 20 times but convicted only twice, once as a youth for homicide, which landed him in juvenile detention for 18 months, and once for disorderly conduct after refusing to pay for a movie ticket. But as the gangs expanded their operations and became more brazen, with children and non-Asians mowed down by shootouts in broad daylight, a local menace turned, literally, into a federal case. In 1985, capping a 10-year investigation, federal authorities announced their first prosecution of Chinese gangs. 
Under the federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, 25 members of the Shadows were charged with 85 separate crimes, including 13 murders. As the ringleader, Yin was singled out for two dozen crimes, including two homicides and seven attempted murders. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.
Over the next decade, a string of RICO indictments stripped every Chinatown gang and tong of their top brass. Prosecutors stepped up their efforts in 1993 when a freighter called the Golden Venture ran aground off Queens with nearly 300 Chinese immigrants aboard, underscoring in sickening fashion the link between the gangs and human smuggling.
Even as the RICO convictions ushered a regime change in Chinatown, law enforcement officials worried that the seeds for a new generation of gang warlords were being planted. Waves of new immigrants from Fujian Province were settling in Chinatown and its two new offshoots, Sunset Park in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens, both of which seemed ripe for the picking. What happened instead, said Mr. Chin of Rutgers, was that "Chinatown itself had changed." 
Unlike Cantonese immigrants from Hong Kong and other urban centers who once dominated the social hierarchy, the Fujianese and other recent immigrants were generally rural people. "They were farmers," Mr. Chin said. "They're going to school rather than getting involved with gangs."
The criminal enterprises that begot the gangs, like gambling and heroin, had lost their economic life. Atlantic City casinos offered cheap bus rides, Asian pop stars and more glitz than any smoke-filled basement. Meanwhile, Colombian heroin traffickers had undercut Asian suppliers with lower prices and purer grades. 
At the same time, new blood to replenish gang ranks had become scarce. Like Italians, Jews and Irish before them, the children and grandchildren of Cantonese immigrants had set their sights beyond the street corner. "All the gangsters I used to know are stockbrokers now," said Joe G.M. Chan, a filmmaker in his early 30's who still lives in Chinatown, his native home. 
Former gang members take pains to avoid the old neighborhood. "I rarely go to Chinatown these days," said Lawrence Wu, 27, a former Tung On gang member who, in a remarkable turnaround, earned his high school equivalency degree, graduated from Queens College and became editor in chief of The Columbia Law Review. 
"The one thing that sticks in my head is how tiny this world felt," said Mr. Wu, who now practices corporate law at a major firm near Grand Central Terminal. "You lived in this subculture of a subculture of a subculture. The idea of going to an arcade in Midtown was a really big deal." 

A Reborn Lion
Chinatown still has a criminal underworld. Although reports of kidnapping are now rare, smuggling of illegal immigrants remains a problem. Extortion has not been eliminated; Fujianese tour bus operators, for example, recently had their tires slashed for refusing to pay up. 
But these are not the old days.
"It's more like three guys who come together to commit a burglary or extortion," said Carla Freedman, the current head of the Manhattan District Attorney's Asian gang unit. "Gambling still exists, but it's more like poker night than a gambling parlor." 
Yin would be happy if the Shadows were also forgotten. After 10 years behind bars, he returned to Chinatown in 1994 a different man in a different world. Today, Yin is nearly bald, his face appears gaunt, and there is little trace of his charismatic swagger. He comes across as tentative and wiser, like a man who has had too much time to think. 
"I lost a lot of time," he said with regret. "I started my family when I was 45." 
After trying his hand as an electrician, a travel agent and a restaurant manager, he has embarked on a new life as a real estate developer; his first building, a two-story cinder-block structure in Chinatown, is nearly complete. Paradoxically, the arm-twisting and interference-running that is emblematic of New York construction reminds him of the old days. "It's very similar," he said, "except one is positive, and one is negative."
In an effort to help his daughter to retain a strong Chinese identity, Yin lives on the outskirts of Chinatown with his wife of five years, a recent immigrant who manages a Chinese restaurant.
Yin grew silent as he walked past old gang apartments, former gambling parlors, the restaurant where he was shot and the pagoda roof of On Leong, as imposing as ever at Mott and Canal Streets.
Several weeks earlier, on the first day of the Chinese New Year, On Leong had resurrected its lion dance after a long absence. In a moment heavy with symbolism, the dancers turned onto Pell Street, the territory of On Leong's longtime archrival, Hip Sing. The young dancers were led upstairs into Hip Sing's inner sanctum, where secret meetings were once held to plot against On Leong and the Shadows. As far as anyone could recall, Hip Sing had never before been host to an On Leong lion dance. 
For a few minutes, the lion gyrated before a ceremonial altar, beautifully arranged with incense, oranges and cabbage. As old men in suits shook hands, the lion swallowed a head of green cabbage, a symbol of wealth, and tossed it back in a show of respect. The hatchet was officially buried.

Stocks Rise for Fourth Week as Bonds Surge

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
The three main stock market indexes rose for the fourth consecutive week, while the bond market had its best performance in years.
 The Federal Reserve on Tuesday indicated that it would keep interest rates down to prevent low inflation from turning into deflation. 
Bond prices soared, and the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.68 percent from 3.93 percent a week earlier, the biggest weekly percentage decline since 1998. 
 The Fed's comments emphasized the weakness of the economy, and investors drove down prices on Wednesday and Thursday. But the market rallied on Friday, led by technology stocks.
 Nvidia, which makes chips for Microsoft's Xbox, gained 34 percent for the week, after reporting a sharp sales gain. Apple Computer, which announced that it had sold more than one million songs in the first week of its online music store's operations, gained almost 27 percent.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,604.60. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 17.27 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,520.15. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.33 points, or 0.4 percent, to 933.41. JEFF SOMMER

By Any Other Name, It's Usually a Rosa

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
 Many American's celebrate Mothers Day with flowers. Chances are, though, the blooms were grown in South America. 
Nearly 90 percent of the so-called traditional flowers -- roses, carnations, miniature carnations and chrysanthemums -- sold in the United States last year came from Colombia and Ecuador, where warm weather and low labor costs have made flower-growing cheap, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Just 7 percent were grown in the United States, it said. 
 William Carlson, executive director of the Floral Trade Council in Ovid, Mich., says American flower growers have been shifting to more exotic breeds like snapdragons and gerbera daisies. "It's basically trying to be one step ahead of the imports," he said. VIVIAN MARINO

HEADLINE: More 'Can I Help You?' Jobs Migrate From U.S. to India 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: BOMBAY 

 BODY:
In the early morning hours of May 1, American welfare recipients reached for their phones, dialing toll-free to check on their next infusion of funds.
 On a steamy Indian late afternoon in her air-conditioned cubicle here, Manisha Martin was waiting for them. 
 Without a break, the display panel on her phone lit up. Kansas calling. Arizona. Alabama. Tennessee.
"Hi, this is Megan," she said to each caller. "How can I help you?" 
In mostly southern drawls she had once struggled to understand, they asked about the balances on their electronic benefit cards, which work much like those used at A.T.M.'s. "Your food stamp balance is 48 cents," she told one caller.
She activated new cards, or told callers to speak to their caseworker. If they unleashed angry tirades, she tried to understand. When young single mothers cried, she listened.
Her accent, pleasant and neutral, was hard to place. When callers asked her location, she demurred. If they knew where she was, said Ms. Martin, 27, "they would drop off their seat."
Some New Jersey officials say they just about did that when they learned that a contractor had arranged for Bombay operators to handle calls from the state's welfare recipients. County welfare directors complained. A state legislator, Shirley Turner, proposed a bill requiring that workers hired under state contracts be American citizens or legal aliens, or fill a specialty niche Americans could not, prompting at least four other states to consider similar bills.
Much as the exodus of manufacturing jobs abroad did in decades past, sending service or knowledge-intensive jobs to countries like India is causing fears of displacement in the United States and elsewhere.
A study by Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., estimated that this type of labor migration, generally referred to as outsourcing if contracted to another company, or offshoring if run by a company itself, could send 3.3 million American jobs overseas by 2015. India, with its large pool of English-speakers and more than two million college graduates every year, is expected to get 70 percent of them.
American companies say a weak economy is pushing them to find new ways to cut costs. American workers say the same economy is the reason they need the jobs to stay home.
"There is a feeling of unease," said Kiran Karnik, the president of India's National Association of Software and Service Companies. "Unless the U.S. economy picks up there's going to be a continuing issue about job loss, and also migration."
Ultimately, Ms. Martin's company, the eFunds Corporation, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., reached an agreement with New Jersey's Department of Human Services to move the work to the state. It created 12 jobs in New Jersey -- at an additional cost to the state of $1.2 million until the contract ends in August 2004.
"For us it was about the consistency of the message," said Andy Williams, a department spokesman. The department is telling welfare recipients that they have to work or try to, he noted, "so to have a contract where you're exporting service-sector jobs -- it just seemed we were working against our clients' interests."
But few corporations will make similar accommodations. "Even though the government of New Jersey doesn't want to manage costs, companies do," observed Pradeep Saxena, the president of eFunds International.
American companies are using Indian labor -- often working around the clock -- to do research and development, prepare tax returns, evaluate health insurance claims, transcribe doctors' medical notes, analyze financial data, dun for overdue bills, read CAT scans, create presentations for Manhattan investment banks and much more.
Seeking both to increase senior analysts' productivity and to lower costs, J. P. Morgan Chase & Company is planning to hire 40 junior analysts and support staff in Bombay to set up an equity research department there. It also plans to increase the several hundred employees doing back-office workat its Technopolis office park in Bombay to 1,100 by the end of the year. 
Delta Air Lines has contracted two Indian companies to handle some of its customer reservations, the first airline to make such an arrangement. "The main reason is to save us money," $12 million over the next two years, said Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for the airline, although she added that allowing Indians to handle simpler reservations would also free American agents for more complex calls.
The move had not prompted any layoffs, she added, although a company news release announcing the arrangement said it would not affect domestic employment "at this time."
The Bombay operations of eFunds include selling thousands of products to American infomercial viewers, back-office work for a British telecom company, and providing customers' bounced-check records to American retailers. It provides customer service help to welfare and food-stamp recipients in 19 American states, using agents who -- said Dinesh Bhatia, the head of eFunds sales in India -- "are trained in empathy."
Ms. Martin and others like her earn just over $200 a month, less than the American welfare recipients receive but well over the $500 per capita annual income in India. For more challenging jobs, the savings to the American companies are even greater.
Despite the New Jersey bill, the threat is less legal than political. "You can't really outlaw outsourcing," said Jagdish N. Bhagwati, a professor of economics and political science at Columbia University. "Outsourcing is just trade."
But American unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America, have begun a campaign against the practice. When high-tech offshoring began, said Marcus Courtney, the president of the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, he and others thought it would be confined to technical support. "People never imagined you would literally be able to export the entire production process overseas," he said.
Similar protests have come from the Communication Workers Union in Britain against the British Telecom Group's deal with an Indian software technology company.
At the same time, in the face of rising unemployment in the West, resistance has also grown to importing high-tech professionals from India. In the short term, that may actually prompt moving more work to India to reduce public resentment.
But over time, Professor Bhagwati predicts, visa restrictions may actually loosen as countries decide it is preferable to have foreigners come in to work rather than see jobs migrate abroad. Either way, the movement of work and labor in both directions is likely to continue.
"We don't see the competitive pressures declining, so the notion of being able to cut costs and get quality is only going to grow," said Vivek Paul, the chief executive of the software company Wipro Technologies. 
Executives in India, which was long fearful of opening its economy, are now lecturing Americans about the virtues of free trade and contending that visa restrictions effectively constitute trade barriers. "If it takes six months to process a visa, it's like making a fruit shipment sit for six months," said Mr. Karnik of the National Association of Software and Service Companies.
But in the end, the most effective pressure will come from the companies that benefit.
Doing a tax return in India brings savings as high as 50 percent, said Kishore H. Mirchandani, president of Outsource Partners International, which has its headquarters in New York but had about 10,000 American tax returns prepared in Bangalore, India, this year.
To ease security concerns, he said, the Indian accountants have no e-mail, Internet or printer access, or even pens and papers at their work stations to prevent copying data.
More American companies, like American Express, are setting up their own processing centers in India. Some are finding that with lower labor costs they can afford to chase smaller outstanding payments.
The presence of these American operations here is driving salaries up. Still, attrition remains far lower in India than in the United States, where the jobs, aspirational here, are often seen as dead-end.
EFunds' call centers are in a new suburban development called Mind Space that houses only "knowledge intensive" companies. It is already home to eight call centers, with more on the way. Chattering young people are everywhere.
In an eFunds classroom, eager new employees learn to pronounce both R's in Mastercard, what a frat party is, what a Wal-Mart looks like -- preparation for interacting with far-flung customers. On the board, the instructor has written, with the second syllable underlined: A-me-ri-ca.

HEADLINE: OUTDOORS; 
Two Sides Are Struggling to Gain Control of Water Policy

BYLINE:  By Pete Bodo 

 BODY:
Marine Protection Areas have emerged in just a few years as the shiniest new tool in the oceanic conservation kit, but the battle to define just how these marine sanctuary zones and parklands should function has exposed some fundamental differences between two ostensibly allied interest groups: environmentalists and recreational anglers.
 As a result, the considerably older tools of legislation and lawsuits have been employed, and accusations and defamatory epithets -- like ecofascist and industry front man -- are being lobbed like grenades across a divide that, ultimately, may be more philosophical than scientific, but none the less real for it. 
 The stakes in this struggle range from the health and the future of marine fish stocks to how open the ocean ought to be and an individual's presumed right to fish. Two related bills are making their way through the New York State Assembly. One would authorize the state to create coastal M.P.A.'s, while the other -- the Freedom to Fish Act -- would protect the public's basic right to fish when stocks are adequate. Other coastal states are also grappling with these issues. 
 "Many of us feel that for many years the people who cared the most about fish stocks were the recreational people," said Kate Wing, referring to anglers. Wing, an ocean policy analyst for the National Resources Defense Council, added: "This newest break is frustrating and alarming, and we need to address it because we have the same goal of increased fish stocks. And with very few exceptions, we don't have the fish we once did."
Broadly, an M.P.A. is a designated area of ocean that is subject to user restrictions as diverse as boating speed limits, prohibitions against picking coral, and curbs on bag limits and certain fishing techniques. The United States has over 300 M.P.A.s, and almost all users -- including anglers -- embrace them as useful conservation tools.
 But some M.P.A.'s, generally known as reserves, prohibit all fishing outright, for reasons ranging from a paucity of fish stocks to the desire to eliminate all extractive or intrusive human activities. Reserve-style M.P.A.'s have become a flash point, with anglers fearing that some environmental groups have slipped into the costumes of sheep to do the work of wolves, attacking the national tradition of virtually unrestricted public access to marine fishing. In reserves, even catch-and-release angling with its negligible mortality rate is forbidden.
 "We've been at the forefront of restricting recreational as well as commercial fishing when the science supported it, even when no environmental groups stood at our side," Ted Venker, a spokesman for the Coastal Conservation Alliance, said. "Our feeling is that excluding the public from a public resource should always be the very last management tool used. 
 The spark that ignited the controversy over M.P.A.'s was struck in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary off Santa Barbara, Calif. In 2002, California created no-fishing reserves that include about 20 percent of the 900 square miles of sanctuary that falls under the state's jurisdiction because of the threat posed by overfishing to a number of sedentary, bottom-dwelling species, including cowcod and rockfish. These fish are not helped by catch-and-release regulations, because the act of reeling them up through 200 feet of water kills them. 
 But large numbers of highly desirable, migratory game fish including yellowtail and wahoo freely roam the surface layer in reserve waters, where they can be caught using techniques so unrelated to fishing for bottom-dwellers that there is no incidental by-catch of the threatened species at all. Yet fishing for the free-ranging species is still forbidden. While the one-size-fits-all policy makes regulation and enforcement of reserve laws easier, it also highlights complex problems embedded in the reserve approach.
 "A big part of this problem is that many environmentalists don't talk to fishermen and don't understand fish," Ted Williams, a conservation writer, said. "But they hate being called stupid, so now they're at least engaging people on this issue." 
 The size and placement of reserves is the source of bitter controversy, because the ocean is essentially a vast, wet, barren blue desert, containing relatively small oases where the food chain flourishes and fish of every kind congregate. So, although the Channel Islands sanctuary occupies a relatively small portion of the sea, anglers estimate that placing it off limits may have eliminated as much as 60 percent of the areas worth fishing. As usual, that percentage varies greatly with the group citing it, but the core issue is real.
 Mostly, user-based conservation groups rely on the twin mantras: "It's all about the management" and "Let the science decide." They argue that if lawmakers and federal and state fisheries managers applied themselves, the problems of overfishing could be solved in a heartbeat without eliminating or significantly restricting recreational fishing. For example, bottom-trawling (the technique that is to the ocean what clear-cutting is to forest) remains one of the most common commercial fishing techniques, despite the great damage it causes. 
 "We could solve 90 percent of the fish stock problems instantly by eliminating bottom-trawling," Rip Cunningham, editor of Salt Water Sportsman, said. "I have no problem with M.P.A.s. I learned to fish in one -- Buzzards Bay, near Rhode Island. 
 Sanctuary advocates maintain that having extensive, untouched areas where fish can be studied as they live, undisturbed, is a critical benefit of reserves. Skeptics say, however, that taking significant portions of ocean out of use is not a necessity but a luxury. They also argue that still allowing ecotourism, surfing and scuba diving while eliminating properly regulated fishing is, simply, an unfair blow aimed at a group that helped shape the concept of environmentalism, a group that annually ploughs staggering sums of money into the economy and fisheries management programs that exist only because of special taxes levied on fishing gear.
"There's a whole ethic we need to instill here," said Greg Helms, a Channel Islands program manager for the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group at the forefront of the movement to create reserve M.P.A.'s. "We need to have these places just for themselves. We also have growing numbers of people who want to see fish and other marine animals in a natural state. These people deserve a place at the table, too. In terrestrial management, 5 percent of our land is in wilderness. We don't have the equivalent in the oceans."
 Advocates for recreational user groups dismiss that argument on the grounds that wilderness areas generally are open for camping, hiking, hunting and fishing, and that sportsmen dating back to President Theodore Roosevelt have spearheaded the drive to protect and appreciate wilderness. And they are disturbed by the injection of ethical and philosophical positions into a debate that, they say, should be driven and decided by science. 
 Speaking for most anglers, Cunningham said, "We believe that just because you believe something philosophically, that's not quite enough to keep the public out of a public resource."

 CORRECTION:
The Outdoors column in the sports pages on Sunday about the sanctuaries known as Marine Protection Areas, and the debate over how they should function, misstated the name of the organization for which Kate Wing works as an ocean policy analyst. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not National Resources.

HEADLINE: Plan to Harness Power of Waste Draws Interest in a Valley Crowded With Cows 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHINO, Calif. 

 BODY:
This Southern California valley is at an epochal stage in the ancient and deeply ambivalent relationship between man and cow manure.
 The milk flows richly here, thanks to 350,000 dairy cows, one of the world's densest concentrations of cows. But with these animals comes their waste: 1.5 million tons a year. 
 "Manure is becoming a bigger problem," said Mark Lambooy, 41, one of 260 dairy farmers in this valley of 50 square miles, known as the Chino Basin. 
That is because a half-million people and counting live here, too. Downtown Los Angeles is a mere 35 miles away, and Orange County a stone's throw. With this kind of geography in its favor, people will build houses here, no matter how much it smells or how many flies strafe their barbecues.
Not that they are without complaint. The dairy farmers here are already a beleaguered lot, coping with falling milk prices and environmental lawsuits over seepage from unlined waste ponds, among other serious problems. And then there are the new residents who call the local Milk Producers Council from tract homes abutting dairies to ask if it is fly season or if anything can be done about the odor.
One answer, at least for 90,000 of the cows, could be the Harper Dry Lake Energy Park, which seeks to transform manure from bane to blessing, in the form of nearly 50 megawatts of electricity.
Buck Johns, 61, president of Inland Energy Inc., a developer of energy plants based in Newport Beach, Calif., heard about the Chino Basin situation and proposed building a methane digester on 1,900 acres in the high desert country just west of Barstow, in San Bernardino County. 
The plant uses technology that heats the cow manure, releasing methane in sufficient quantities to fuel a gas turbine and create electricity. The solid waste remains are used for fertilizer, and the waste water is mostly recirculated, with some used to grow alfalfa around the plant to help feed the cows and provide greenery.
The technology is used worldwide, with animal wastes and with rotting garbage, but nothing close to this scale has been done using livestock manure, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and the International Energy Agency, a Paris organization with 26 member countries.
"This park would allow an economy of scale that makes it profitable to the dairymen," said Robert Feenstra, executive director of the local Milk Producers Council in the Chino Basin. "It would address environmental exposure. Even the barns will be cooled with solar power. Everything the dairyman needs will be there, and he doesn't need to live on site. It's a win for everybody. Once this hits, I think we'll see it everywhere."
Mr. Lambooy is one of a dozen dairy farmers giving serious consideration to Harper Lake. There is a strong temptation, from the flip side of development pressure: escalating land values. Mr. Feenstra said owners of dairy properties were getting offers of $150,000 to $250,000 an acre.
But those who like dairy life say they are not so sure they want to live in an isolated area after having the amenities of the Chino Basin.
"I would consider Harper Lake -- the perks are getting the manure converted into electricity," said Art Marquez, 26, a third-generation dairyman. "But living there is better for the cows than it is for me."
The Harper Lake developers plan to build housing for each dairy unit, and have hired Eric Lloyd Wright, an architect who is Frank Lloyd Wright's grandson, to design the project.
Mr. Johns said he hoped to have permits to begin construction in six months, and to have the first cows in place in about a year.
Chino Basin dairies are a billion-dollar industry, responsible for 23 percent of milk production in California, the biggest milk-producing state. This makes them attractive pickings for others states. Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas are trying to lure these dairy farmers to their less populated farmland.
Other dairy farmers are looking north to the San Joaquin Valley, but environmental lawsuits are delaying the process and making it very costly, which is discouraging some from starting the process. For their part, the environmentalists say their objective is not to chase dairy farmers out of California. Indeed, they hope and expect dairies to remain in the Chino Basin for a long time to come.
"Our interest isn't in shifting them from place to place, but in improving their operation," said David Beckman, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's great that they want to make investments in macro solutions to dairy pollution, like Harper Lake, but that doesn't excuse individual dairymen from polluting their facilities."
Mr. Feenstra finds it ironic that the very concentration of dairy cows that he considers a mistake in the Chino Basin is exactly what is needed to make Harper Lake an economic and environmental coup.
"I used to say to people, someday you're going to love us for our manure," he said, "and now it's true."

HEADLINE: Berkeley Campus Eases SARS Curbs on Some Asian Students 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., May 10 

 BODY:
Officials at the University of California, Berkeley, relaxed SARS-related restrictions today on the summer enrollment of some students from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 The change is expected to allow about 80 of the 500 or so students barred under the original restrictions to attend the university this summer. University officials left open the possibility of further relaxations in the policy by July, when most of the other students were scheduled to enroll. 
 "This is a quickly changing situation," said the university's chancellor, Robert M. Berdahl.
The university announced earlier this week that it would turn away summer students from Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Singapore because of the large number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome reported in those regions. Singapore was later removed from the list when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted travel restrictions to that country.
University officials had been under pressure to reconsider the restrictions, which were by far the toughest on summer attendance at any university in the country, even exceeding the general guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control. 
Some Asian student groups and faculty members had complained that the ban was too sweeping, and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in San Francisco had been working to have it changed.
At a news conference today, Mr. Berdahl acknowledged that the policy had created an impression that the university no longer welcomed students from Asia. "Nothing could be further from the truth," he said.
University officials said the restrictions were based largely on the advice of local health officials and medical experts, who said the university was not equipped to deal with the medical needs of students who might develop symptoms of SARS. In particular, they said, the university did not have the facilities to isolate sick students. 
The new rules will permit the roughly 80 students enrolled in regular academic programs to attend summer classes. Still barred are the hundreds of students who would have taken courses offered by the university's extension service, mostly English-language classes.
The new policy, Mr. Berdahl said, would ensure that students in credit-earning courses would not have their studies disrupted, while reducing the flow of students from the affected regions to a manageable number. He said that since announcing the original policy, the university had found limited quarters where some sick students could be safely isolated.
In China, where SARS is believed to have originated, officials reported 85 new cases and 5 deaths today, raising the mainland's official death toll to 235. Hong Kong reported 7 new cases and 2 deaths, for a total of 212 fatalities in the autonomous Chinese territory.
Taiwan reported 23 new cases today, its biggest one-day jump since the outbreak began there two months ago. So far, the island has reported 172 cases and 18 deaths.
Worldwide, SARS has killed at least 526 people and infected 7,200 others in more than 25 countries.

3 Show That the System Works

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
WITH their dark hair and dark eyes, the three volleyball players would walk around campus and people would ask: "Are you sisters? Are you triplets?" In a way, they are.
 When their coach told them to hit the floor, they hit the floor. When it was time to do their homework, they did their homework. They didn't talk much at first. Today all three will graduate from C. W. Post College, all of them in four years, all of them planning on graduate school. 
 "I'm losing my three Navajos," said Susan Cassidy, the coach, who recruited the three women from a reservation in Arizona to suburban Long Island. 
Christie Cooke, Luauna Nez and Wendolyn Begay are the embodiment of "student-athlete," a description too often applied to the semiprofessional itinerants of college football and basketball. 
These three scholarship athletes remind us that the system works: there are students who play less prominent sports and gain an education.
The three women grew up playing volleyball on the reservation in Window Rock and Ganado, Ariz. "Talk about nothing to do," Cooke said. "On the rez, we can't get a day job, so we play a lot of basketball and volleyball."
They were stars in high school and in the extensive national club system, but did not know where volleyball could take them. 
"People get paid to go to college?" Cooke remembers thinking. "I didn't know that."
They came to Post by coincidence. Cassidy, also a captain in the New York Police Department, recruited a player named Sybil DiLucchio, whose parents worked on the reservation. In turn, DiLucchio said she had three Navajo friends who could play. Cassidy was impressed with them at a tournament in Las Vegas, but wondered if they could make the huge cultural leap.
"We come from, I guess you could say, lower-class families," Nez said, referring to economic status.
"We were not starving, but it was always a struggle," Cooke said. "Which of the six sisters gets a pair of sneakers with this week's paycheck?"
All three earned partial athletic scholarships and financial aid and funds earmarked for American Indians. Then they traveled to New York, gawking at Manhattan right below their airplane, staring at the size and apparent menace of the big city, marveling at the lush trees and lawns of Long Island.
"People were so different," Cooke said. "Nobody smiled. Everybody kept to themselves. We came straight from knowing everybody on the rez to thinking that nobody cared about you.
"And there was a lot of materialism," she added. "This nonsense of brand names. Prada. You weren't cool unless you had Gucci. Tell me how ridiculous these big homes are. I bet nobody sleeps in those 40 rooms."
At the very least, they said, they felt prepared for college volleyball.
"When you play against the 'white' high schools, you have to compete," Cooke said. "We are hard workers. When I got here, some girls were so laid-back. They'd say, 'I'm doing my own thing.' They complained about things. We were shy, but we worked. These girls saw us work hard and they followed our lead."
But, they admit, they had things to learn.
"We didn't know the concept of time," Cooke said, as her two friends nodded in agreement. They learned to catch naps in the team van. They learned to study while exhausted. They learned to prepare their clothing. 
"They had each other," said Cassidy. "They came from nongambling, nonsmoking, nonparty backgrounds. They struggled at first. But athletically, they had a better work ethic than anybody.
"They're not big," said Cassidy, once an academic all-American at Molloy College on Long Island. "They're 5-2, 5-4, 5-6, but these kids would dive, and it became contagious. The other kids would say, 'Oh, I can do that.' " 
Post had three straight seasons of 20 victories or more before slumping last season. The three women from Arizona were often on the all-tournament teams, but that was the least of it. They learned. They taught.
"I run a program for international students," said Dr. Pamela Lennox, the associate provost for campus services. "A lot of them come with their own ideas. They say, 'You killed all the Indians.' I say, 'Actually, we have three right here.' " 
She invited the three athletes to her classes, then she invited them into her kitchen. Lennox, who comes from California, admits she makes "a terrible tortilla soup." The young women showed her how to make fry bread, the Southwest specialty. 
"She is our biligaana," Nez said, explaining that the word means "white mother." In a culture in which women are strong and spiritual, that is no small honor.
Sometimes fellow students would start speaking Spanish, assuming they were Mexican, only to be surprised there were three Navajos in their midst. All three say they never once felt prejudice or stereotyped. 
Dr. Norbert Krapf, a poet whom Cooke calls "my mentor," invited the other two women to sit in on a class about Indian poetry. All three began to discover their academic strengths. 
Begay, who is graduating with a bachelor of science in biology, plans to take the examination for medical school and hopes to become a surgeon back home. 
"Doctors come and go," she said. "You go to a doctor and six months later you go back for a checkup and that doctor isn't there anymore."
Nez, who is graduating with a Bachelor of Science in elementary education, will study for a master's degree in literacy education at Post. She did her student teaching at Waldorf, a private school in Garden City, and she dreams of opening a similar school at her reservation. 
Cooke, who will be graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English, has been writing her memoirs. She recently chose a master's program at the University of Arizona over Columbia University. 
Lennox is trying to cope with seeing two of her surrogate daughters moving away. "My life is better because they are part of it," she said, adding that after many sessions in the kitchen, "They tell me my tortilla soup is up to a B."
Their families are coming up for today's graduation. The three athletes acknowledge that their relatives still think of them as 18-year-olds rather than college graduates, but that is normal. Their sense of home is deep and strong. 
"There are people who come back and 'act American,' " Nez said. "I still speak our language. I love going home and wear sweatpants and go barefoot in the dirt. I'll never change."
They have changed, of course. They speak a bit faster than they did. They can wear the makeup and clothing of young college women. And they have degrees. They are student-athletes who bring dignity and meaning to that phrase.

HEADLINE: Pataki Admits He May Not Be Able to Head Off Legislature 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
As hopes for a compromise to stave off a veto-override battle dimmed, Gov. George E. Pataki took his antitax message to Westchester County yesterday and, as he has in five speeches this week, assailed the Legislature's budget as a fiscal train wreck.
 After a short talk to about 80 business leaders from the Westchester County Association at the Hilton Hotel in Rye Brook, Mr. Pataki acknowledged that he had made little or no progress in gathering the votes he needed to stop the Legislature from overriding his threatened veto. Yet he said he intended to go ahead and veto large parts of the $92.8 billion spending plan, which the Legislature passed on May 2. 
 And the governor, a three-term Republican, appealed to the business leaders to lobby the lawmakers over the next few days. "I'm here to ask you to get involved," the governor told the audience. "Let your voices be heard."
At the heart of the debate in Albany is a disagreement over taxes. Mr. Pataki proposed a zero-growth $90 billion spending plan that avoided raising income taxes by cutting about $1.4 billion from education aid, raising tuition at public universities and reducing government-financed medical services by $1 billion.
The deep cuts to education and medical services caused a revolt not only among the Assembly's Democratic majority, which can be counted on to oppose most cuts in spending, but also among most of the governor's Republican allies in the Senate majority, led by Joseph L. Bruno. In the view of most lawmakers, the governor's plan would simply force local governments and school districts to raise property taxes to offset the loss of state aid.
Frustrated by the governor's unwillingness to compromise, Senator Bruno joined forces with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and passed a spending plan that restores about $2 billion of the governor's cuts to education and health care. To pay for those restorations, the Legislature imposed an income tax surcharge on people in higher income brackets and raised the state sales tax a quarter of a percentage point.
Like the governor, the Legislature relied on about $4.2 billion in borrowing to help close an $11.5 billion gap between expected revenues and the planned growth in expenses this year. But using borrowed money to pay for operating expenses will not solve the state's future fiscal problems. Both plans would leave the state with a deficit next year of at least $5 billion. 
In recent weeks, the governor has told legislative leaders in private meetings that he was willing to restore some spending and raise the state sales tax by 1.25 percentage points, the leaders said. Once the lawmakers passed their budget in defiance of his veto threat, however, the governor went on the warpath, saying their budget is unbalanced and will cause deficits in future years.
A recent poll by Quinnipiac College of Connecticut showed that a majority of New York taxpayers would prefer higher income and sales taxes over property taxes, confirming what many lawmakers say they have been hearing from voters in their districts and from private polls.
The governor, however, has decided to stand on principle and protect his record as a tax-cutting executive, his aides say. He has toured the state since Wednesday, delivering essentially the same address to business groups from Buffalo to Long Island.
Yesterday, Mr. Pataki exuded a hurried urgency as he told the business leaders that the Legislature's budget would produce a shortfall of $1.5 billion this year and of $13 billion over the next two fiscal years. He asserted that Westchester and Rockland Counties would end up paying at least $400 million in extra taxes over that time.
Mr. Pataki took issue with the assertion that local property taxes would rise if he cut aid to schools and hospitals. "The argument is this budget is going to keep down property tax; that is not true," the governor said.
He maintained that county governments would face $175 billion more in Medicaid costs under the Legislature's plans. Legislative leaders have disputed that figure, saying county governments will get more state aid overall under their budget than under the governor's.
So far, Mr. Pataki's efforts to sway Senate Republicans and conservative Assembly Democrats have been unsuccessful, according to several leading lawmakers in both houses. The governor himself acknowledged yesterday that the chance of a compromise with the Legislature before he issued his vetoes were slim. 
After the luncheon, several business leaders said they found Mr. Pataki persuasive. Tom Kadala, who manages a market survey company, said higher taxes would not only discourage businesses from staying in New York but also drive talented people out of the state.
"We are very close to that line where business will move out of New York because of taxes," he said. "Westchester County is not made up of business entities, it's individuals. We are talent-oriented in this county. Real estate consultants, software designers, engineers -- brilliant people are doing work here. They'll decide it isn't worth it." 
Lawrence E. Dwyer Jr. president of the Westchester County Association, said after the luncheon that he doubted that the new taxes imposed in the Legislature's plan would be lifted within three years, as legislators have mandated. 
"Once taxes are in place, it takes forever to reduce them," he said. "Spending money to make people feel good is not what we need. These increases will affect the growth of the economy."
In a sense, however, Mr. Pataki was preaching to the choir. At the entrance to the hotel's driveway, about two dozen protesters, including many parents and their children, held up signs to cars arriving at the event. They urged Mr. Pataki to protect education spending. "Sign the bill," one sign said.

HEADLINE: DINING; 
Friendly Spot for Seafood Hits the Scene

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
IF you have any doubts about today's quirky economy, just check out the current restaurant scene, as so many places open with fanfare and disappear with nary a trace a short time later. 
 At least with the Front Street Fish House & Cranky Fish Saloon in Bethel, part of the name remained from the restaurant (One Front Street) that was open for less than a year before changing its ownership, chef and menu. 
 From standard modern fare, the new chef's menu has headed straight to the sea. In some instances, the staff seems to be at sea, too. 
As soon as we sat down, our smiling young waiter asked if he could help us choose a wine. It turned out that the wine list was a total of five reds, five whites and a blush wine, all noted on a wine card on the table. 
The wines are moderately priced, but unfamiliar. Asked if a particular Shiraz was Australian, the waiter didn't know. Nor did he know the source of Whale's Tale pale ale on draft or volunteer to find out. (Later the bartender guessed it was from Rhode Island.)
Our waiter's blissful inexperience also showed when he was asked about the menu, though there was little to inquire about on such a short one.
The "fish house" name pretty well telegraphs what to expect in this friendly place: a lot of seafood reasonably well-priced and prepared in a straight-forward manner, broiled, grilled and deep fried. The exceptions are the grilled 14-ounce premium choice aged New York sirloin steak (delicious and perfectly cooked), an Angus burger, a steak sandwich and chicken pot pie.
Don't look for subtlety and you might have an enjoyable meal. Each one begins with an unusual touch: instead of bread we were served a basket full of piping hot, golf-ball-size herbed hush puppies, along with a maple syrup dip. 
I began one dinner with a surprisingly tasty Cranky white clam chowder. I say "surprisingly" because I usually approach restaurant New England clam chowder with misgivings, as all too often it could more aptly be called potato chowder.
 This chowder was quite good: smooth and creamy, well-seasoned and packed full of tender clam bits and finely chopped celery. There were three egg-size whole potatoes, but they were easy to remove.
Maryland blue crab cake was another pleasant revelation. Instead of being wadded with bready filler, it was a well-browned ball -- the size of a tennis ball -- loosely packed with fresh, flavorful crab meat and served on shredded lettuce with chunks of tomato.
My advice would be to go with the grilled dishes, such as the grilled Atlantic salmon or swordfish steak; both were moist, fresh and flavorful. Cajun tilapia, one night's special, was moist and appropriately spicy, in tune with the fish's own juices. Well- seasoned jasmine rice came with the fish, as well as steamed broccoli and carrots.
On the other hand, the menu description of "giant sweet fried clam strips" was only half right. They were deep fried, but the clams were mere nubbins (not giant strips), tough and anything but sweet.
A side order of "hand-cut onion tanglers" consisted of a mountainous mound of deep-fried onion clumps. Though there was more batter than vegetable, the onions were delightfully sweet. 
Orange sorbet in a frozen orange cup on a plate dribbled with mango and raspberry sauce designs was the best of the four desserts available, but the oreo cookie brownie sundae was impressive enough -- except for the canister whipped cream -- to please any child at heart.
In fact, Front Street Fish House is especially suited to serve children. There is a special menu, crayons on each white paper-covered table and cardboard bowls in which the hush puppies and side dishes are served.
It isn't fancy dining, but the price is right and the seafood is fresh.

HEADLINE: Coming to America, No Matter What 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
BRIGITTE EMILIA CROCOS had been a little concerned. Before she arrived in the United States recently to embark on her adventure as an au pair, Ms. Crocos, a 22-year-old German college student, called her host family in Bridgewater, N.J., to find out whether Germans are still welcome in the United States. She had also look up information about SARS on the Web site of the World Health Organization.
 "My house mom said Germans are still treated well here," said Ms. Crocos, who is in the United States for the first time. As about SARS, And SARS? "There are not so many cases in America, and nobody has died from it," she said. 
 Despite the war in Iraq, which strained the United States' relation with many parts of the world, the economic woes and the galloping fear of SARS, au pairs from around the globe are still steadily arriving in the New York metropolitan area to experience a new culture. 
The au pair program at InterExchange, a Manhattan-based organization sponsoring international exchange programs including summer trips and camps, said that although their applications from au pairs dipped by 10 percent during the war, it has already picked up again. The organization receives more than 1,000 applications for au pair positions a year.
"We saw some hesitation," said Paul Christianson, the director of InterExchange. "It was more of wait and see. But we are now seeing a surge in au pair applications."
Applications from families requesting au pairs have remained constant, he said, explaining that the sagging economy can both deflate and inflate the demand for au pairs.
Since the beginning of the year, InterExchange has received roughly 500 applications from families, a normal year, Mr. Christianson said.
It is true that some parents have become unemployed and thus no longer need au pairs to take care of their children, Mr. Christianson said, but some mothers have returned to the work force to maintain family income and now need live-in child care. Moreover, hiring an au pair is significantly less expensive than employing a full-time nanny.
While having a full-time nanny can cost up to $500 a week, a host family pays an au pair $140 a week -- an amount set by the State Department, which regulates the au pair industry -- and a onetime fee of roughly $5,000 to cover the au pair's transportation to and from her home country, health insurance and orientation in the United States.
Other major players in the au pair business in the New York metropolitan area, like the Boston-based Cultural Care and Stamford-based Au Pair in America, also said they have seen little fluctuation in the volume of their applications this spring.
"For the most part, our au pairs know that the war is quite separate from their experience here," said Samantha Janney, a spokeswoman for Cultural Care, which receives about 4,200 au pair applications a year. "We haven't seen any unhappy au pair who wants to go home early."
Dabeth Faure, a 21-year-old French au pair living in Briarcliff Manor, was aware that French fries had become freedom fries and French toast freedom toast at some places in the nation. But for her, the war felt perceptible only when neighbors, half teasing, half serious, gave her well-meaning advice.
"People say: 'Don't say you are from France. Say you are from Italy,"' she recalled, chuckling. "I was, like, 'Sure, I'll say I am from Italy.' Nobody has asked me my opinions."
 Ms. Faure said she supported the position her country took, but describing herself as rather apolitical, said she hasn't discussed the war with anyone, including her host family.
Florence Helin, another French au pair, has. "I agree with Chirac," said Ms. Helin, who lives with a family at Oyster Bay in Nassau, referring to President Jacques Chirac of France, "and my host family agrees with Chirac. The war felt far away."
But Ms. Crocos, the newly arrived German au pair, is not among those opposed to the war in Iraq. "Saddam had been a dictator for 20 years, and you simply had to do something," she said. "In the Second World War, if the Americans didn't do something, maybe Hitler would still be around."
When she called her host family to find out whether there is any backlash against French and Germans, Debbie Kulak, her host, gave the question serious thought.
"When I talk to people, I find there are some people who really don't like the French right now," she said. "I would have some question about whether a French au pair would feel entirely comfortable here. But Germany? No. It doesn't come up at all.
 "I am not real pleased with what the French did," she added. "But I would not like a French au pair because of that. Absolutely not. We are not prejudiced people."
For her part, Ms. Crocos, blonde with an easy smile, is making an effort not to hold any prejudice against Americans. She has brought with her a printout about erroneous stereotypes about Americans she found on the Internet. What's on the list?
 "Americans are snobbish, superficial and wealthy."
Ms. Crocos chuckled, and upon discovering that she is a loyal fan of "Sex and the City," the series on HBO, the coordinators from InterExchange warned her that not all Manhattan women have many boyfriends at the same time.
But on the warm spring day when Ms. Crocos arrived among two dozen au pairs -- most from Europe and a few from South America -- at the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan where they stayed for the first night, the war and SARS were not what was on their minds. Instead, it was which channel shows "Felicity," another television show, and whether any of the protagonists in "Sex and the City" eventually gets married.
It was only when a reporter asked the group whether they were scared of SARS that the au pairs seemed to remember the contagious disease commandeering the news media around the globe.
"I am not afraid," Anne-Claire Roset, a French girl who will become an au pair with a family in Cheshire, said in hesitant English. "I have confidence in life."
 Then, slowly but earnestly, she added, "I am a fatalist, so I am not afraid."
Most of her companions seemed to share her confidence, and Mr. Christianson, who has met thousands of au pairs, commented: "We deal with 20-, 21-year olds. When you are 21, you think you are indestructible."

HEADLINE: The Fresh Air Fund; 
Idyll of Summer Revisited For Boy and a 2nd Family

BYLINE:  By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA 

 BODY:
LOUIS RAMIREZ doesn't mince words when it comes to describing the Lindau family.
 "They treat me like I'm their own kid," he said recently. "I've got a lot of love and respect for them. I love my own mom and dad of course, but I also love Jane Lindau like another mom and Dan Lindau like another dad and their son Ned like he was my own brother." 
 Louis, who is 13, lives in an apartment building in the South Bronx with his mother, Caroline Diaz, a home health aide, and his stepfather, Juan Cepeda, who works in a store. Dan Lindau, co-owner of a film and video production company; his wife, Jane; their son, Ned, 13; and two daughters, Julia, 16, and Annabel, 9, live in a turn-of-the-century Victorian home here. The house was once a country inn, and looks it, with its long tree-lined driveway, front porch with hanging swing and high-ceilinged rooms with wide planked floors.
Every summer for three weeks the Lindaus are hosts to Louis, who visits as part of the Fresh Air Fund program. The activity schedule sounds like the archetypal American summer idyll: softball in the backyard, basketball in the driveway, swimming in the town pool. Then there are the two weeks spent at the Lindaus' cottage on Block Island Sound in Charlestown, R.I. "I love to ride the ocean waves," Louis said, describing afternoons at the beach, which are bracketed by day camp and twilight runs to the ice cream stand.
Louis has been visiting the Lindaus for four summers; this will be his fifth. He also comes up some weekends in fall, winter and spring. Before becoming hosts, Mr. and Mrs. Lindau had long talks with each other, considering the issues: Would their children accept a newcomer? Would the visitor feel comfortable in an environment so different from the one he was used to? Would they really be doing something good? The answers, then and now, were resounding yesses. Mr. and Mrs. Lindau's philosophy: they can't change the world, with its harsh economic realities for some and privilege for others, but they can give Louis some wonderful experiences, lots of love and, not incidentally, plenty of fun.
"We don't kid ourselves -- it would be naive to think we could guarantee Louis's future," Mr. Lindau said. "But we can give him wonderful vacations."
Mrs. Lindau added: "You look for what the kids have in common despite their differences. Yes, Louis's daily life is very different from Ned's. At his school in the Bronx the kids have knife fights. It hurts us to think about it. But we look at what they share. Louis, for example, knows the words to every hip-hop song on the planet. Ned loves that. They listen to music on the computer for hours."
Providing a change in environment and a chance for new friendships is what the Fresh Air Fund has always been about. The nonprofit agency has arranged free summer vacations for more than one and a half million disadvantaged New York City children since 1877. That year, the Rev. Willard Parsons, a minister in rural Sherman, Pa., asked members of his congregation to act as volunteer host families for children from New York City tenements. Manhattan newspapers picked up the story and the Fund grew rapidly.
In 2002, more than 11,000 children were beneficiaries of the Fund's various programs. Six thousand participated in the Friendly Towns project; 3,000 went to Fresh Air camps in Fishkill, N.Y. In the Friendly Towns program, financially disadvantaged urban boys and girls, 6 to 18 years old, are matched with host families in suburban and rural areas in 13 states and Canada. First-time visitors stay two weeks. Reinvited youngsters can spend up to eight weeks. An additional 2,000 went to year-round camping programs. in addition to time during the rest of the year. The Lindaus decided to take in a Fresh Air child after reading about the Fund in The New York Times. Both had enjoyed summers many children would envy. Mr. Lindau grew up in the Edgemont in Greenburgh and went to day and sleepaway camps. Mrs. Lindau lived on Long Island's South Shore, where her parents belonged to town beach clubs.
Both the Lindaus' families always made sure that their children were aware that other children, scant miles away in the boroughs and Manhattan, were hoping for the cooling spray of a fire hydrant to take the sting out of the sizzling pavement. After the Lindaus were married and had children of their own, the Fresh Air Fund seemed a natural step to take, and it has turned out just as they had hoped. Louis and Ned got along from the moment they met. The Landau siblings and parents liked Louis immediately. They started focusing on Louis's special talents, taking him to basketball camp taught by a pro at the Chappaqua Middle School. They played baseball, softball, and whiffleball day and night, and got him lessons at the town pool; it turned out he was an excellent swimmer even though he had never been in a pool before.
In Rhode Island they introduced him to surfing the chilly breakers on a boogie board, and to fishing and clamming. One photo shows Louis holding a silvery shad that is almost as big as his torso. Mrs. Lindau is the only one of the whole bunch who actually likes to eat the slippery clams she steams, but she keeps the rest of the group happy with Louis's favorites, fried or barbecue chicken. If Louis wants to read a book or discuss schoolwork he is likely to encounter in the coming year, that's fine but it is equally acceptable to revel in the simple joys of a summer.
Ned perhaps summed it up best. "I've never looked at this like we're doing Louis a favor," he said. "He is doing something great for us, for me, as well. Like when I first went to day camp in Charlestown. I didn't know anyone, and having Louis there with me really helped. He's been a good friend to me. Sometimes we talk seriously. I tell him to study hard, so he can get a scholarship to college. But he's got things to teach me, too. I just speak a tiny bit of Spanish, but Louis is completely bilingual, so he can teach me. We've got stuff we can give each other."
Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 633 Third Ave., 14th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017. Host families are not reimbursed, nor are there any financial requirements for housing a Fresh Air child. Hosts are always needed; call (212)897-8900 to inquire about volunteering.

Selling Spas and Castle Views

BYLINE:  By TANYA MOHN 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
STAINED-GLASS windows by Matisse and Chagall. Spas. Formal gardens. Sweeping river views amid sculptures by Picasso and Brancusi. Castles.
No, these aren't stops on a grand tour of Europe. They are some of the local attractions that Margo Jones, the director of tourism for Westchester County, promotes to entice the public to visit as the summer tourism season approaches. 
 "When people think of us, we want to give them a creative image," Ms. Jones said. 
 That's the strategy she used to plan a new poster portraying nine castles that look like they would be more at home in the Irish countryside or the Loire Valley than in Westchester.
"Gee, I didn't know you had so many castles. I want to go there, I want to see that" -- that is the response Ms. Jones said she wants to provoke. 
The castles offer everything from overnight accommodations to afternoon tea. The Castle at Tarrytown, a Norman-style structure, now a 31-room inn, graces the highest point in the county. Whitby Castle in Rye, containing stones from the original Whitby Abbey in England, is a restaurant. Caramoor, a Mediterranean-style mansion in Katonah, has rooms filled with furniture from European palaces and villas.
Travel is essential to the county where more than 30,000 jobs are affected by local tourism. And in Westchester, as in the country, tourism is off, dropping from $1.7 billion in 2000 to $1.4 billion in 2001. 
To promote travel, the county has a tourism budget of $770,000 annually, most of it raised by a tax on hotel rooms in the county. 
The push on local tourism began in 2000, during County Executive Andrew J. Spano's first term. Richard K. Gsottschneider, president of RKG Associates, a consulting firm based in Durham, N.H., was hired to develop an economic plan for the county. 
His study found that tourism was responsible for about 10 percent of the county's employment base and was tied in to the many corporate headquarters clustered in the county. 
The Office of Tourism, which had been in the private sector as part of the County Chamber of Commerce, becamepart of county government Jan. 1, 2001, when Ms. Jones was hired.
Earlier in her career, Ms. Jones ran the statewide "I Love New York" campaign from February 1992 to January 1995. 
One of the first things Ms. Jones did was to move the tourism office from the basement to a more prominent location on Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains. She made an official tourism map and streamlined the distribution of other material. 
"Some of the basic tools needed to sell Westchester as a destination, we didn't have," she said. 
But it was a tough economic time, compounded by Sept. 11, 2001, and its aftermath.
The travel industry was "really pushed off a cliff" said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association of America, based in Washington. Domestic travel before 2000 was a $570 billion industry nationally. It has since dropped to $537 billion.
National Tourism Week, which this year runs from May 10 to 18, was created 20 years ago as a way to impress upon local communities how much tourism can contribute to their economies. This summer, "there is less interest in big cities and more interest in smaller towns and rural villages," she said.
"The areas a couple of hours from major cities are most likely to do quite well." 
Part of Ms. Jones' strategy is to locate niche markets. A brochure "Antiques the Westchester Way," touting close to 50 shops and auction houses, a detailed map and a calendar of shows and events, has a been sent out.
A brochure featuring Westchester's gardens was recently completed, and another on "soft adventures," like bird watching, hiking and Rollerblading, is planned. Two fall driving tours were produced last year, and another is in the works.
A tourism information center is being built in an abandoned gas station on the northbound side of the Bronx River Parkway, at exit 9 near Scarsdale, with the opening planned for June 27. It will be packed with brochures and fliers, a book of menus from area restaurants and information about tickets for shows. Pay phones as well as courtesy phones provided by the county will be available to book dinner and hotel reservations. Hotels, sites and restaurants will pay to have their information available, which will contribute to the costs of running the center. Ms. Jones estimates the center's budget at $8,000 to $10,000 a year. 
It isn't only the leisure tourist the county is after. Tonya Inman, the director of sales and marketing for the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains, said that traditionally many professional groups have held conventions and meetings in upstate New York, where the rates are lower. But the tourism office now sends representatives to about a dozen travel and industry trade shows a year, and the increased marketing has helped local hotels and organizations find one another. "It's like having a satellite sales office," Ms. Inman said.

Day-Tripping In Young Suburbia
TOURISM born of economic necessity is not new for Westchester County.
In the early 19th century, hotels began springing up along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River for the masses who couldn't afford country homes but who wanted to escape the humid and muggy New York City summers for the weekend. After the Civil War, steamboat excursions became a popular means of escape. Day-trippers would come up to visit picnic groves dotting the county's coastline. John Starin, owner of a steamboat line, bought Glen Island in New Rochelle in 1879, to make a picnic grove. It quickly became one of the most popular resorts of its day, operating for close to a quarter century with thousands of visitors flocking to see its aviary with exotic birds, tropical gardens, wild animals, even a natural history museum with specimens from around the world, including the mummified body of an 18-year-old Egyptian princess. Authentic Indian war dances and villages transplanted from the Philippines added to the allure. 
"It was a 19th-century Disney World on the Sound," said Marilyn Weigold, a history professor at Pace University, who wrote a two-part article in 2001 for The Westchester Historian, a publication of the Westchester County Historical Society. 
By the early part of the 20th century, the county became less of a tourist destination, as more people moved to the suburbs. TANYA MOHN

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 11 about efforts to increase tourism in Westchester referred incorrectly to the altitude of the Castle at Tarrytown, an inn. At 450 feet, it is not the highest point in the county. Bailey Mountain, in North Salem, is 980 feet above sea level.

HEADLINE: Back to the Future In Transportation 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It is good to read that New Jersey Transit and the Department of Transportation are placing a great deal of focus on restoring train station buildings across the state ("Trains, Porches and History," By the Way, May 4). 
 Actually, an increasing number of public and private transportation professionals around the country are seeing the benefit of going back to the future by making train stations centers of community activity in towns that grew up around them. Through public agency programs known as Context Sensitive Design and Transit-Friendly Communities, transportation facilities are being developed that preserve scenic, aesthetic and historic resources while maintaining safety and mobility for all involved.
 As in Oradell, such efforts enable New Jersey Transit to work with towns that have visions of an economically successful, vibrant and friendly downtown. On the Morris and Essex Line's Gladstone branch, South Orange, now a transit-friendly community, has given its station attractive pedestrian and retail features to make it fit better within the town's character. As a result, the train station, no longer just a barren place used only by commuters, has been "reclaimed" into the community and is a more pleasant experience for other residents who can use it as a gathering point. The new Union Station across from Kean College on the Raritan Valley Line is another example of a commitment to meeting transportation needs through transit-friendly investments and efficient use of public resources.

HEADLINE: The Business of Education 

BYLINE:  By KEN STIER 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
FORTY years after watching Stevens Institute of Technology miss out on revolutionary advances in aerospace, Frank Fernandez is back at his alma mater to try to make sure the 133-year old institution does not miss out on the next wave.
 "When I was there in the late 1950's and early 1960's aerospace was the technology," said Mr. Fernandez, who was the Pentagon's research director in the Clinton administration. "I mean, Kennedy, we were going to go the moon, the Russians, the space race, all that, and Stevens would not start a strong fluid mechanics program because a lot of the faculty in mechanical engineering thought this was another passing fancy. That frustrated the hell out of me." 
 It also sent him packing. After earning an undergraduate degree at Stevens, he moved to California to pursue his passion for what became known as aerospace engineering, earning a doctorate at the California Institute of Technology and then burrowing ever deeper into the belly of the military-industrial complex. 
 These days Mr. Fernandez is director of Stevens's office of technology initiatives, where he is responsible for boosting "research revenues" and for managing any resulting intellectual property. He seems to be delivering. The Defense Department has increased its research contracts with Stevens to $8.8 million, from $4.8 million in 2000. Overall, the school's current billed research is $11.3 million, all but asmall fraction from Washington. 
 Compared with university behemoths like Johns Hopkins -- which in 2000 received close to gets $800 million from the federal government -- it is modest. But in its own universe of small private technical institutes, Stevens has set ambitious goals. 
 Even while he was establishing three research companies in California, Mr. Fernandez kept an eye half-cocked across the continent. He watched with some dismay as a flat-footed Stevens failed to catch later technological waves -- in semiconductors and then information technology. And he remembered how a school in Cleveland that "we used to play in lacrosse" -- Case Western Reserve University -- "grew into the powerhouse it is today."
 Now Stevens, which has a remarkably low profile, even in its hometown, has another chance to break into the ranks of internationally recognized research institutes. 
 This time the school has even created its own trademark -- Technogenesis -- which it defines as a process by which students, faculty and industry jointly nurture new technologies from concept to the marketplace. While some critics scoff at its originality, few schools have committed themselves as zealously as Stevens to injecting an entrepreneurial edge throughout the educational process.

'Special Time' at Stevens
 The proof of Technogenesis lies years off, in the successes of graduates and the companies they may help to create. Both are critically dependent on revving up the institute's research role.
 "Stevens is at that kind of special time when one of those waves has been building having to do with research needed for meeting our country's new strategic needs as result of the war on terrorism and the crash of the telecom industry," Mr. Fernandez said. "Stevens can grab this one and it can take it a long ways, or if it doesn't, this will just right go by it and Stevens can go back to the way it was 10 years ago."
 For now, Stevens mostly radiates readiness to seize the opportunity and, at least among administrators and some faculty, Technogenesis is invoked as a mantra -- sometimes to an odd degree. For instance, the annual report even contends Technogenesis takes place in its theatrical productions. The institute's president, Harold Raveche, is the prime booster, and he has a weekly television program called -- not surprisingly -- "Technogenesis," which is broadcast every Sunday night on CN8.
 A more solid indication of Stevens's commitment to practice what it preaches is its redoubled efforts to launch institute-generated technology companies, even at the expense of current programs. For instance, many were puzzled by a recent decision to close the school's state-financed program that for 11 years has nurtured dozens of start-up businesses -- even before the financing was expected to dry up in June with the planned elimination of the state science and technology commission. But the school says that closing the incubator will allow it to focus on institute-affiliated companies, in which it has an undisclosed equity stake.
 "To me they are very brave in being as aggressive as they are in that technology transfer operation, putting as much into it as they have," Michael Breton, an associate vice president for research at Rutgers, said in a recent interview. "It's a great experiment. Given the size of their research base, I really have to hand it to them for having that kind of confidence."
 Stevens is not shy about letting on that it has sprouted companies with billion-dollar possibilities. Most promising are two companies based on a fundamental breakthrough in the physics of plasma -- a form of energized gas -- achieved by Erich Kunhardt, dean of the school of arts and sciences, who has taught at Texas Tech University and at the Polytechnic Institute of New York.
 Two other companies derive from the expertise of a Russian-born physicist, Dimitri Donskoy, who once had a career hunting American submarines before defecting just ahead of the collapse of the Soviet Union. These days, he is applying those skills to help locate other things -- from underground land mines for the Army to termites for victimized homeowners.
 A fifth company, Hydroglobe, is bringing to the world market the expertise it developed helping to clean up water at Picatinny Arsenal, a weapons testing center near Dover. 
 As promising as these companies are, however, making billions -- at least for now --remains a long shot. Good technology is no guarantee for making a good business, and most of these fledging companies are still taking their first baby steps. 
 One of the firms that grew out of Dr. Kunhardt's technology, Plasmion, recently signed a $2.25 million partnership with a South Korean firm (Hanwha L&C Corporation), though Stevens officials concede major "liquidity events" -- like the Holy Grail of an IPO -- are nowhere in sight.
 In the meantime, Stevens is focused on expanding its research base, which is essential for keeping its pipeline full of new technologies. With swelling budget shortfalls and a corporate sector still licking its wounds in New Jersey, financing for expanded research can only come from the federal government. Tapping into those lucrative pools is largely Mr. Fernandez's responsibility -- with the help of several other recent administrative and faculty appointments.
 For instance, the new dean of the institutes' school of technology management is Jerry Hultin, a former under secretary of the Navy in the Clinton administration, and Paul Kolodzy, director of a new wireless communication security center, oversaw allocation of the airwaves for the Federal Communications Commission.
 As with previous advances in technology, the federal government is the primary engine fueling the huge expenditures in research and development. Historically, these breakthroughs have been largely motivated by national security challenges. 
 These days, the federal government is spending billions of dollars to meet military challenges and to bolster homeland security. And Mr. Fernandez is in a position to help tap into those funds. 
 Before leaving the government, he was director of the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency, which functions as the Pentagon's venture capital arm. This year alone, the agency had a budget of $3 billiion, with as sizeable percentage going toward university research.
 With the aim of bolstering Stevens's role in that effort, Mr. Fernandez says he is on track to bring in $35 million in research money by 2007, and the plan is to level off around $40 million annually. 
 These targets were set after an analysis of the country's top 50 research institutions showed that faculty members were receiving about $300,000 in federal research money. But until recently, the faculty at Stevens -- made up of about 100 fulltime professors -- was supported by an average of less than $100,000 a year for research, including the pay for doctoral students, who do most of the actual lab work. In the next few years, Stevens hopes to hire 50 0r 60 more fulltime professors, using these new sources of money to lure new professors.

Drawing Top Students
 "You are going to be hearing from us," said Dr. Kunhardt, who says that the physics, chemistry and computer science departments can rival any in the country. 
 His boast seems to be reinforced by the caliber of students drawn to Stevens, where the average combined College Board scores are more than 1,300 and whose steep tuition comes close to Ivy League colleges. Tuituion for a full-time undergraduate can run as high as $24,500 a year.
 Full-time undergraduates are approaching a proposed cap of 2,000, and there are several hundred full-time graduate students and more than 2,000 more part-time students doing graduate-level work. 
 As a small, private institution, Stevens has always been a niche player and when on its game, this has allowed it to play a high-level research role. The school's Davidson Laboratory, with its world-renowed wave-testing tank, has done small ship design for the United States Navy for decades --and more recently for foreign governments -- building on the work of Edwin Stevens, a founding family member, who played a major role in developing America's ironclad vessels in the 19th century. 
 Stevens -- situated on a 55-acre riverside promontory with a commanding view of Manhattan --was cited in the log of Henry Hudson's navigator in 1609, and later became the estate of the Stevens' family, English landed gentry who settled here in 1699.
 Because of its attraction as a terrorist target, New York City is a key focus for security research, particularly for ports and wireless communications -- making Stevens an ideal test site. After nearly falling off the Navy's radar, Stevens recently won initial financing from the Office of Naval Research to lead an Anglo-American consortia to work on micro-oceanographic modeling, which will help predict dispersal patterns of water or airborne contaminants. Other work will be directed at surveillance systems -- partly by unmanned ships -- of traffic on, below or above water miles out from the harbor. The research, to be financed by about $6 million a year, will be the focus of the school's new center for maritime systems.
 Successful spin-offs of Stevens-affiliated technology will be an important barometer of the institute's Technogenesis approach, which aims to teach engineers -- still the school's core student constituency -- what it takes to bring new products to market. Until now, the record of schools succeeding in this area is not particularly good, and most university-generated intellectual property ends up sitting on shelves or not selling much. Less than one percent of the roughly 21,000 university patents currently yield royalty payments of more than a million dollars a year, according to the Association of University Technology Managers.
 But that record seems to be improving. It was only with the passage of federal legislation in 1980 known as the Bayh-Dole Act -- named afters its two sponsors, Senators Birch Bayh and Bob Dole -- that universities were allowed, and even encouraged, to profit from government-financed research.
 Today, states are looking more and more to research institutes as critical components of their local economies, particularly in a high-tech states like New Jersey.
 For this reason, many regard as short-sighted Governor McGreevey's decision to cut off financing for the state's Commission for Science and Technology, which provides seed money for researchers to submit more competitive grants application to Washington. As it is, New Jersey is taking in a disproportionately small share of federally financed research, and without any improvement the state will eventually become less attractive as place for high-tech facilities or as source of employment. The state is already falling behind a number of other key rivals -- including Michigan and North Carolina -- that continue to aggressively finance research and development, says Dr. Saul Fenster, the former president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
 With traditional sources of money pinched, universities have new incentive to try to improve their own record of commercialization, though this is a kind of alchemy is not so well understood.
 "I may have a Ph.D. in physics," says Dr. Donskoy, the Rusian acous5tics expert, "but I am probably still in second grade when comes to business." 
 Dr. Kunhardt, the dean of arts and sciences at Stevens and the intellectual, if not spiritual, founder of Technogenesis, largely agrees.
 "To be nice," he said, "I will say that this is as difficult to do as the creation of the technology."
 He speaks from experience. After his invention of cold fire plasma, he formed three companies to devise commercial applications. He brought his students along for the ride, having them sit in on presentations before financial backers. He likened the process to apprentice doctors gathering around an operating table to watch older doctors perform surgery.

Companies Become Classrooms
 Dr. Kundhardt stands to make a fortune if any of his companies take off, but he insists his primary interests lie elsewhere. 
 "Its done as much for the instructional value of it as it is for the introduction of technology into society, and that is where I think we have introduced our own little twist to the whole story," he says. "The companies essentially become a classroom and the whole process becomes a classroom - its like a seamless world."
 In some important ways the new Stevens approach is a return to its roots, since the institute -- the country's first mechanical egineering school -- likes to call the Stevens family the "first family of American inventors." The family patriarch, John Stevens, a Revolutionary War colonel, was a railroad and steamboat pioneer and was instrumental in establishing the country's first patent commission. Indeed, documents from the institute's founding in 1871 -- with its talk of "liberal technical" education -- sound remarkably similar to the descriptions of Technogenesis. 
 "We are trying to reintroduce a kind of Edisonian, Yankee ingenuity", explains Louis Laucirica, the vice dean of Stevens's school of technology management, who spent most of his career in the corporate world. "We are promoting this concept that managing technology is different from management in general. Stevens has the ability to bring both technology and hopefully business to the table -- and that is somewhat unique." 
 Yet there is also a danger that Technongenesis can be taken too far, with research eventually eclipsing teaching or introducing distracting pressure to come up with a blockbuster company. 
 "Most universities presidents focus on their educational and research programs and the commercialization is an activity that they support," said Daryl Boudreaux, who once worked at Stevens and now directs Rice University's office of technology transfer, "but not as a tail wagging the dog but as the tail of a dog that can have significant value in terms of visibility and the earnings it can bring." I think if I were a university president that I would not make it my priority to become a commercialization engine because that seems to me to be changing the nature of the entity."
 Stevens officials say they are well aware of this, and Dr. Kunhardt admits there was considerable resistance among the faculty to Technogenesis at first. But he says that any lingering resistance is due misunderstanding the concept.
 "Most professors, certainly most American professors, would say their job is only to create knowledge," he said. "I say, of course, our job is to create knowledge, but there is also a niche for a university that not only creates knowledge but also creates from that knowledge new technologies that benefit society."

Palmeiro Provides Consistent Power

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Once upon a time, Major League Baseball had an official statistic called the game-winning run batted in. It lived a relatively short life because it was a flawed statistic, but while it existed Rafael Palmeiro was not good at it. In fact, in 152 games in 1988, Palmeiro had 0, that's zero, game-winning R.B.I.
 Little wonder that people said Palmeiro could not drive in big runs. The thought that Palmeiro ever had any hitting deficiencies seems preposterous now, but the Chicago Cubs traded him after that season, and his lack of offensive production has long been believed to have been the reason. 
 "I've gotten a kick over the years that Palmeiro has taken a couple of shots at me," said Jim Frey, who traded Palmeiro to the Texas Rangers. "Most of the time when people take shots, they're doing it with limited information. He had limited information. It wasn't a case of me thinking he wasn't a good hitter. But he seems to take pleasure out of it. If it gives him pleasure, it's good with me." 
Frey, retired and playing golf and gin rummy in southwest Florida, was the Cubs general manager who traded Palmeiro, who entering last night's game against Cleveland was one home run from becoming the 19th to hit 500 home runs.
At the age of 23, Palmeiro hit 8 home runs and drove in 53 runs in 580 at-bats in 1988, his first full season in the majors. Two months after the season, Frey sent him to the Rangers in a nine-player trade that brought the Cubs a closer.
"We found out that the infamous Mitch Williams was available," Frey related. "The fact that he had saved around 30 games or so and he was a hard thrower appealed to us. We also had a chance to acquire Curtis Wilkerson, a utility infielder, which we needed."
The Rangers, Frey recalled, wanted a first baseman, and the Cubs had two, Palmeiro and Mark Grace, a rookie that season. "We thought they were both going to be good offensive players," Frey said, "but we didn't think that either Grace or Palmeiro would have been a good defensive left fielder, so the question was, which one would we trade?"
The Rangers emphatically provided the answer. "It wasn't our choice to peddle Palmeiro, although I'm sure Rafael thinks I just shipped him off to Texas," Frey said. "They chose him. I said how about Grace; they said they wanted Palmeiro."
Tom Grieve, then the Rangers' general manager, confirmed that Palmeiro was his No. 1 target. "We identified our major need as a couple good hitters," Grieve said. "We had an all or nothing lineup. We struck out or hit home runs against secondary pitching, but against good pitching we got shut down regularly. We identified Raffy and Julio Franco."
Grieve said he didn't remember the Cubs offering Grace but said, "If it did come up, we dismissed it quickly because Raffy was the guy we wanted. We would not have made the trade for Grace."
Frey and Grieve agreed on another matter regarding Palmeiro.
"I don't think anyone, including him, thought he would hit 500 home runs," Frey said.
Grieve, a Rangers television analyst, said: "No one can say he thought Raffy would become this kind of player. You just can't do that. We thought Raffy was a .300, 40 doubles, 25 to 30 home runs and 100 R.B.I. guy. No one in his wildest dreams would have thought he could hit 500 home runs."
Fifteen years after the trade, as remarkable as Palmeiro's home run output is, so is the fact that he has never won a league home run championship. Some critics cite that failure as a hole in Palmeiro's Hall of Fame resume, but Grieve disagrees. 
"He doesn't win home run championships," Grieve said, "but the record that's amazing is he's the only hitter in the history of Major League Baseball, including Babe Ruth, to hit 38 home runs eight straight years. That streak negates the argument that he never won a home run title."
The streak lives. In the past eight seasons, Palmeiro hit 39, 39, 38, 43, 47, 39, 47 and 43 home runs. In six of those seasons, some American League hitter (Alex Rodriguez the last two years) hit 50 or more home runs. The closest Palmeiro came to a title in that span was in 1999 when he slugged 47, but Ken Griffey hit 48.
Nevertheless, as Grieve said, no other player has matched Palmeiro's streak. Ruth hit 38 or more in seven successive seasons, Willie Mays, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa in five each. Eddie Murray, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in July, didn't reach 38 once. 
Home run inflation can be cited as a factor that has helped Palmeiro, but not one of his contemporaries, including McGwire, Sosa and Barry Bonds, has matched his achievement. As for run poduction, baseball no longer tracks game-winning R.B.I., but Palmiero has done all right with R.B.I. generally. He has driven in more than 100 runs each of the last eight seasons, and ranked 25th on the career list with 1,597.
Frey does not begrudge Palmeiro his achievements. But he did mention one development in his and the Cubs' favor. "In 1989 we won our division," he said. "In Chicago, when you win your division, you can pretty much justify anything you do."

Sweep Is Not End of the World
Last season the Baltimore Orioles struggled for more than three months, from May 14 to Aug. 23, to get back to a .500 won-lost record. Five times they were a victory away from it but lost each time. Finally they beat Toronto on Aug. 23, making their record 63-63.
But that was the last day they stood at .500. They lost 32 of their last 36 games and finished 67-95. 
If that was woeful, how about the Orioles' act last week? They were swept in a three-game series by the Detroit Tigers, who had won only 4 of their first 29 games, had not won two in a row and had not defeated any team more than once.
"We didn't pitch well, at all," Manager Mike Hargrove said. 
Was the sweep embarrassing?
"You may be embarrassed by the way you play," he said. "But Detroit has a major league ball club. They have some talented people on the ball club. The Yankees they're not, but they have some talent."
The Tigers' sweep also raised that old .500 ghost, dropping the Orioles' record from 16-14 to 16-17. But the Orioles remained undaunted. They came back Friday, their next night of play, and took a doubleheader from Kansas City.

Mussina's Mark of Longevity
The Yankees right-hander Mike Mussina reached a career total of 2,500 innings pitched last week and was pleased with the milestone. Only nine active pitchers, all older than Mussina, have worked more innings, with John Burkett of Boston only a third of an inning ahead of him. 
Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Randy Johnson are the only active pitchers who have attained 3,000 innings, with the Yankees' Clemens the only one above 4,000. Another Mussina teammate, David Wells, is sixth on the list.
Mussina, however, has a considerable distance to go to make a dent on the career innings list. Twelve pitchers, for example, pitched more than twice the number of innings that Mussina has. For another example, Clemens, with more than 4,100 innings, is only 35th on the list. No. 1 is Cy Young with 7,354 2/3.

Time Does Not Tell Much
In their quest to speed up games, baseball officials should study the first game of the doubleheader Baltimore and Kansas City played Friday night. The Orioles and the Royals scored a total of 20 runs but needed only 2 hours 35 minutes to do it. 
Seven other games consumed less time Friday, but no more than nine runs were scored in any of those games. One game, Tampa Bay against Detroit, was only eight minutes shorter even though only two runs were scored. The Orioles and the Royals, however, quickly forgot how to play quickly. They scored nine runs in the second game of the doubleheader and took 2:46.
The second game was longer even though pitchers threw 276 pitches in the second game compared with 290 in the first, and the teams put 29 runners on base (seven on walks) in the second after having 39 reach base (eight on walks) in the first. Two pitching changes were made during an inning in the second game, compared with one in the first, but that difference was hardly the reason for playing 11 extra minutes while scoring 11 fewer runs.

HEADLINE: Harder Times, Even When the Living Is Easy; 
Summer Means Travel Cutbacks and Trading the Hotel Suite for a Tent

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The never-ending winter has finally drooped to a close, and thoughts should be turning to the time of year when the stress and drudgery of home and office are left behind for the splurge of a summer holiday. Perhaps a week or two abroad, culminating at a restaurant with three Michelin stars? Eight languid weeks of sleep-away camp for the children?
 Maybe next year. With the economy still flat on its back and everything from taxes to rent to subway and bus fares climbing, this is shaping up as a year when even summer is being handed a pink slip. 
 No, children in Scarsdale won't spend the summer playing stickball, and don't expect to see fire hydrants gushing on the Upper East Side. 
But across the New York region, people seem to be scrimping on their summer vacations for the first time in years. They are planning shorter sojourns or scrapping them altogether. They are opting for car trips over air travel. And they are dropping hints with far-flung friends in the hope of avoiding the expense of hotels.
Many are rediscovering the romance (and bargain) of camping; New York State reports that campsite reservations are way up for the summer. The Catskills for $10 a night? Try finding that on priceline.com.
Some are sacrificing their own getaways so children can go to sleep-away camp, while others have crossed camp off the list completely. Lochearn Camp for Girls in Post Mills, Vt., which charges $3,950 for a four-week session, still has a number of open slots. "Usually, we're full by Nov. 1," said Betty Duncklee, the office manager.
In three dozen interviews, more than a third of the respondents said they were going to scale back on summer vacations this year, citing the anemic economy and their own precarious finances. Even those who have seen no drop in personal income said they were watching their spending.
In recent years, summer vacation for T. Sean Herbert, a producer at CBS News, meant a cruise to Nova Scotia and trips to Los Angeles and Florida. Before their first child was born, in 1997, he and his wife, Taryn Grimes-Herbert, went to Ireland for three weeks. "We take big vacations," he said. 
But this summer, despite a secure job, Mr. Herbert will spend July at home in Wyckoff, N.J., tackling home-improvement projects "without paying someone else to do it." He and his wife will make one foray up to Maine, as they do every summer for a family reunion. But instead of spending a week or two at the hotel, they will go for only four days.
Mr. Herbert called his approach a "pre-emptive strike."
"We really are trying to be cost-conscious at every level," he said. "I don't care how much money you have in the bank. There's no reason to waste it when everything is in flux and uncertain." 
Some parents whose older children are accustomed to going to sleep-away camp are canceling their own vacations. Denise and Dean Kupfer of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., are typical. Ordinarily, they sneak off to Florida or California after packing their daughters off to camp. 
This year, they are staying put. "Times have changed, and I'm the first to admit it," said Mrs. Kupfer, who works for a company that makes high-end cabinets. Last year, her husband closed his ailing sportswear factory in the South Bronx, a family business that had spanned three generations, and is now looking for a new profession, she said. Their daughters, Amanda, 11, and Samantha, 14, will still have their camp experience. But Samantha, who is bound for a snowboarding camp in Oregon, will go for only three weeks this year, compared with eight last summer. 
"Where I live, 90 percent of the kids go away, and they would be home alone," said Mrs. Kupfer, shopping at the Westchester mall in White Plains. "It's worth the sacrifice."
Some families may eliminate their summer vacations altogether. Amy Levine-Kennedy, a freelance writer, knows it is summer when she finally gets to poke her toes in the pristine sands of Cape Cod. This year she and her husband, Kostya Kennedy, and their daughter, Sonya, will instead plant their feet on the bottom of their swim club pool on Long Island Sound.
For the past four summers, the family rented a house for a week in Wellfleet, a picturesque village. But they have not signed a lease this time. Ms. Levine-Kennedy lost her job last year when her company, a health-care publisher, folded. And the couple just bought a new house in Larchmont and are expecting a baby any minute. (She is due today.)
"It's the one thing you can decide not to do," she said of summer vacation. "We contemplated not joining our pool for the summer, because that's pretty expensive, too. But if you don't do the pool, that affects your entire summer."
Of course, there are those who are not tweaking their plans a bit and, yes, even a few who are raising the ante. Patrick Daly, who does voice-overs for television and radio, said he and his family were headed to the Netherlands for two weeks in June, in addition to their annual trip to a working farm in New Hampshire.
But Mr. Daly, a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said the extra trip would not be a financial drain. They got a great deal on the air fare, he said, and they plan to stay with friends. "Since 9/11, we have looked at what's really important to us: whether we're enjoying our lives or not," he said. "You don't want to look back and say, 'Gee, I wish I had gone to Holland.' "
Lydia Sigelakis, a mother on the Upper West Side, said her family would also make a point of staying with friends and relatives when they go to Washington and Vermont this summer. "We're not going to travel anywhere that we have to spend money," she said. "My husband's not getting raises anymore, and we've had to dip into his retirement fund."
A number of people who typically fly to their vacation destinations said they planned to stay on the ground this year. Some cited the emergence of SARS; others blamed terrorism. But for many, the bottom line was, well, the bottom line. 
Harry and Rita Corradi of New Milford, Conn., will most likely take a series of day trips to Massachusetts. In recent summers, the couple, who are retired, traveled to Bermuda and St. Thomas. "It's the uncertainty of the stock market -- the fear factor," Mr. Corradi said.
Travel agents say plane reservations are off sharply this spring, but they caution that it is hard to tease out the exact reasons. Raymond Peter Kane, president of Pisa Brothers Travel Service in Manhattan, said the firm's air travel business was down 35 percent from two years ago. "It might be the economy, but there's no way to tell until the war and the SARS thing is out of the way," Mr. Kane said.
The trend toward a low-key, close-to-home summer is making this a banner year for New York State's campgrounds. From the Adirondacks to the Finger Lakes, campsites and cabins are being snapped up. The 270 sites at Letchworth State Park in Castile, about 45 miles south of Rochester, are mostly booked for weekends in July and August.
With cabins starting at $115 a week and campsites running $10 to $16 a night, a week under the stars costs less than dinner for two at a better Manhattan restaurant. Reservations edged up modestly in recent years, but this year they spiked. Through late April, New York State, with 14,608 campsites and 744 cabins, had taken reservations for 76,359 camping stays, up from 66,585 at the same time last year.
By contrast, high-priced vacation rental properties in places like the Hamptons are gathering dust. This year, many more second-home owners have decided to rent their properties, and that has caused something of a glut, brokers say. "It's been a very grim rental season," said Elaine Stimmel, an associate broker at Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East Hampton.
Even affluent families who are fortunate enough to own a second house in a sought-after resort area are taking a parsimonious approach to the months ahead. "The state of the economy is certainly scary to us as a family," said Allyson Felix of Irvington, N.Y., who has a house in Cape Cod.
This summer, only her children -- ages 3, 6 and 8 -- will get new summer wardrobes. (Ms. Felix will make do with what's in her closet.) Forget about carefree nights at breezy waterfront restaurants, she said. "We'll cook in."

HEADLINE: So What's Not to Like? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
LONG ISLANDERS are most concerned about jobs and traffic congestion, but they're happier with where and how they live than residents of New York City or its other suburban regions, according to a poll of Long Islanders that its organizers say is the most comprehensive ever conducted.
 The poll, commissioned by the Rauch Foundation, a Garden City-based philanthropic group, explored the perceptions of 1,387 Long Island residents about their quality of life and issues of concern. For comparison, 600 residents of New York City, 400 in its northern suburbs, and 300 in suburban New Jersey were also sampled, and Long Islanders appeared to be the group most pleased with life in their community. 
 While 67 percent of those polled in New Jersey and an equal percentage in the northern suburbs (including Orange, Rockland, Westchester and Fairfield counties) rated their quality of life as good or excellent, 74 percent of Long Islanders rated their quality of life the same way.
Long Islanders had a more pronounced sense of regional identity than the other groups surveyed, with 86 percent of Long Islanders saying they identified very or fairly strongly with their region. The equivalent figure for New York City residents was only 77 percent. 
Long Island also was the only region of the four sampled where a majority of respondents said that, generally speaking, most people can be trusted. 
But the goal of the Rauch survey, the first of three it plans to conduct, was not to help the Island blow its own horn but to identify community concerns and help foster regional thinking to address them. "If we can put some good information out there, we could be a catalyst for all the other civic groups to solve the problems we face," said Nancy Douzinas, foundation president. 
Edward Blakely, dean of the Milano Institute at the New School University in Manhattan, and a consultant on the Rauch poll, said no previous polling efforts covered quality-of-life policy issues on Long Island in such depth.
Respondents to the telephone survey, conducted in December and January and released in mid-April, identified jobs as the biggest problem facing all of New York's suburban regions. But more Long Islanders cited traffic than crime as a problem, reversing the ranking in the city and the other suburbs.
The most serious environmental issue for all three suburban regions was uncontrolled development, although suburban residents also appear to be happy with their parks and beaches, according to poll results. At least 75 percent of Long Islanders rated their police protection, sanitation and public schools good or excellent. But most Long Islanders called their public transportation fair to poor, because it doesn't go where they are headed.
The poll results were welcomed by Mitchell Pally, a vice president for government affairs for the Long Island Association. "Surveying Long Islanders, having town meetings helps us identify the problems and understand the ramifications of the issues," Mr. Pally said. "It could be very valuable."
Mr. Pally said he was not surprised that jobs were mentioned most often given the stagnant state of the economy. But he also pointed out that the poll results showed that people are staying here longer. "Most people who have moved to Long Island find it's not only a great place to live, but a great place to stay and retire in," he said.
Neal Lewis, executive director for the Long Island Neighborhood Network, said the poll would help to bring important concerns to the forefront, and indicated a change in the public's attitudes. "There is a growing agreement on what the priority issues are on Long Island," Mr. Lewis said. "Years ago, you couldn't bring up affordable housing, no politician would touch it. Now even business leaders are talking about it."
According to the survey, only 5 percent of Long Islanders said housing was the biggest problem facing their community, but 92 percent said "housing for working people" was fairly or very important. The affordability issue, though not labeled specifically, is a thread found throughout the responses, said Eric Alexander, director of Vision Long Island. "Jobs, the economy, and housing are all tied together with affordability," he said.
The median rent for housing on Long Island ($964 in Nassau and $945 in Suffolk) is the highest of any of the counties within and around New York City, according to foundation statistics. One out of three renters on the Island, and one out of four homeowners, spend more than 35 percent of their household income for a place to live.
Mr. Alexander said he was not surprised that uncontrolled development made the top of the environmental complaint list. "People don't mind certain kinds of development within our communities," he said. "But when they see new homes taking up a farm field, those become emotional images."
Mr. Alexander, whose group promotes a re-emphasis on village downtowns as shopping and cultural centers, also suggested that some Long Island respondents took a decidedly rose-colored view of where they live. He scoffed at the survey's finding that 84 percent of Long Islanders agreed that they had a walkable and bikeable community. "That is not matched with our reality," he said.
Craig Charney of Charney Research Institute in Manhattan, which conducted the poll, said the discrepancy could have come from a misunderstanding of the question or the way it was asked. He defended the general methodology, saying the sampling of Long Islanders closely matched the area's demographics from 2000 census figures.
But some contend that doesn't include everyone in the community. In his job as a public safety supervisor for the town of Huntington, John Ramirez said the biggest community problem where he works is immigration, which was cited by only 2 percent of respondents to the Rauch survey. 
"They are not counting correctly," he said. "It's not accurate. I know what's there."
The documented Hispanic population is growing faster than any other group on Long Island, increasing almost 80 percent from the 1990 census to the 2000 census.
While 72 percent of Long Islanders polled said there was racial diversity in their communities, Long Island is still 76 percent white, and has fewer minorities than the New Jersey or northern suburbs.
The poll found that 69 percent of Long Islanders said race relations in their community were good or excellent. Surprisingly, black and Hispanic Long Islanders were slightly more likely to have a favorable impression of local race relations. But at the same time, lower-income blacks were the only group on the Island to rank police brutality as one of the three biggest local problems. 
Some people were surprised by what wasn't mentioned in the poll. "I'm surprised that taxes were not considered one of the major problems," said Jeff Lipman, 49, a dentist from Huntington. (He did not participate in the poll; Charney Research did not identify respondents willing to grant followup interviews.) 
Mr. Charney said that although some respondents might have complained about taxes, a perennial Long Island lament, the question was never asked directly. But he suggested that later surveys in the Rauch Foundation series were addressing the issue, saying, "I have seen more recent polling that asks about problems facing government where taxes and budgets came out very high." 
The tax issue shows up in other ways, however. Although Long Island respondents said education ranked sixth on the local problem list, after the economy, traffic, crime, sprawl and housing, Beverly Wayne, 49, from Huntington, said education was the most important issue because "the biggest problem is finding a way to meet the needs of all the students with the limited resources available."
The poll showed that 86 percent of Long Islanders belong to some kind of organization, like churches, neighborhood associations or labor unions, and 96 percent said a strong sense of community was fairly or very important. But almost none of those questioned said they worked as volunteers and very few were active in civic groups.
"People are not involved enough in what's going on in their community," said Steven Landis, 56, of Hampton Bays. "They live in ignorant bliss." Mr. Landis said the "threat of the casino being built in the next couple of weeks" was the biggest problem in his neighborhood, an allusion to plans by the Shinnecock Indians to build a gambling hall on tribal lands just west of the Shinnecock Canal.
Another example of a tendency among Long Islanders to be disconnected from their surroundings was the 21 percent who said they didn't know about the condition of their waterfront. "Many people here aren't aware of the water, which is ironic because we are the largest island contiguous to the U.S. mainland," said Jay Tanski, a marine environmentalist with the New York Sea Grant program at Stony Brook University. Some of the ignorance has to do with lack of access, Mr. Tanski said, since a lot of Long Island waterfront, especially on the North Shore, is private. 
Mr. Tanski agreed with the 54 percent of Long Island respondents who rated their waterfront good or excellent. "Given the level of development in this area, the quality of the waterfront is very high," he said, adding that upland sources of pollution were the newest focus in maintaining a pristine shoreline.
The next Rauch poll, currently underway, focuses on children and families. The third is to address the economy. The three polls and an accompanying demographic study cost about $350,000, Ms. Douzinas said.
The Rauch Foundation was founded by Louis and Philip Rauch in 1961. The two brothers made their fortunes in the auto parts business in Brooklyn. Now the foundation helps fund civic, family and environmental causes throughout the Island.

JOB LOSSES PREDICTED

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 New Jersey will lose 13,500 jobs in five years because of increases last year in corporate business taxes, according to a Rutgers University study conducted for the Center for Policy Research of New Jersey. 
Most of the jobs will be lost this year and next, said Gregg Edwards, president of the research center and former Republican executive director of the state Senate. The tax increases are expected to bring in $1 billion a year to the state treasury. But Mr. Edwards said that, coming amid a slow economy, they mean that New Jersey lost businesses to other states and some businesses canceled plans for expansion. Karen DeMasters

GOODE, WILLIAM JOSIAH

 BODY:
 GOODE-William Josiah. The former Franklin H. Giddings Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, and former President of the American Sociological Association, died unexpectedly on May 4, 2003. The author of 20 books and over 80 articles on a wide range of topics, ranging from "Religion Among the Primitives" (1951) to "World Changes in Divorce Patterns" (1993), he was an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Stanford University at the time of his death. William J. Goode was best known for his pioneering cross-cultural analysis of marriage and divorce. Drawing on his knowledge of nine languages, his pathbreaking monograph World Revolution and Family Patterns (The Free Press, 1963) analyzed data from over 50 countries to reveal the critical impact of family systems on what was previously assumed to be purely economic forces. Born in Houston TX in 1917, and encouraged by his high school debating coach Lyndon B. Johnson, he attended Rice Institute and the University of Texas, Austin. He served in World War II as a radarman on an attack transport ship in the Pacific. He joined the Columbia University faculty in 1950 where he taught for 27 years (1950-1977). In 1977 he became a Professor of Sociology at Stanford University, and in 1986 he joined the Sociology Department at Harvard University. He was a distinguished quest lecturer in China for the Chinese Academy of Science in 1986, and a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1992. Known as Si to his friends, he was often referred to as a "Renaissance man" excelling in a wide range of activities including painting, sculpting, sailing, mycology, tennis, and birding. 
In the past 5 years he won several tennis trophies and published an article on "bird watching with your ears." He is survived by his wife, Lenore J. Weitzman, Robinson Professor of Sociology and Law at George Mason University; three children, Erich Goode, Visiting Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland and an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the State University of New York at Stonybrook, Barbara Baldwin, Women's Health coordinator for the Washington DC Department of Heath; and Andrew Josiah Goode, an architect in Shingle Springs, CA; and a sister Rosalie Grizzle of Magnolia, TX. His family is planning a ceremony with military honors at the Columbarium of Arlington National Cemetery (date to be announced.) They would welcome contributions to the William J. Goode international fellowship which is being established in his honor by the American Sociological Ass'n in Washington, DC.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Joys of a Workplace Seen the Second Time Around 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
AFTER six years at the same company, Scott Breckenridge, 28, decided it was time for a change. He says he felt that he had gone as far as he could as a consultant at the New York information technology business Kraft, Kennedy & Lesser, so in spring 2000, he jumped at an offer from an Internet start-up called Hostcentric for a job with the fancy-sounding title of vice president for provisioning.
 Last May, Hostcentric laid him off as part of a reduction of its New York staff. 
 On March 31, Kraft Kennedy hired him back.
There has come to be a name for people like Mr. Breckenridge: boomerang employees. These are workers who grow restless at a job they have been doing for years, or even decades, and set out for greener pastures, only to become disenchanted with their new career, or to have the industry disappear out from under them. 
So, they go back home.
It is an increasingly common phenomenon, workplace experts say, as attitudes of both employers and employees have adapted to the ups and downs of the economy over the last decade. Companies, realizing that worker loyalty has all but vanished, are more willing to rehire people they know to be honest and competent, no longer considering them turncoats. Likewise, ambitious employees who once might have regarded a move back to their old place of employment as a step down in their careers are today more likely to take whatever they can get.
"The landscape has changed quite a bit; many of the old rules no longer apply," said S. Joanne Murray, director of the Center for Work and Service at Wellesley College and a management consultant. "I advise my clients to always keep strong, positive relationships with their former employers. It's quite common for people to go back."
Mr. Breckenridge says his return to Kraft Kennedy has gone smoothly. In addition to his previous responsibilities as a consultant who set up information systems for law firms, he is now also in charge of training new employees. He says he has spoken with his bosses about a future promotion to management.
There is good reason for the favorable treatment he has received. When he left Kraft Kennedy, he was determined not to burn bridges, and so he stayed in touch with his old managers and colleagues. He even played in a band with a former officemate.
He knew he would have a good shot at getting a job with Kraft Kennedy again, but when he was laid off by Hostcentric, he was hesitant about going back unless he could gain more responsibility than he had in the past. After some negotiating, he got it.
Joyce L. Gioia, a management consultant and president of the Herman Group in Greensboro, N.C., says she believes that boomerang employees will become even more common as linear career paths give way to what she calls hopscotch patterns. She thinks employers are coming to understand that returning employees like Mr. Breckenridge possess an important set of qualifications: a proven track record; new skills acquired since leaving; and familiarity with the company and its culture.
Plus, Ms. Gioia says, these employees usually have a new appreciation of the workplace they once left. "Employees leave because they think the grass is greener elsewhere," she said. "But what they discover is often crabgrass or even grass that's infected with chiggers."
As companies learn to value reconnecting with former employees, some have begun referring to them as company alumni to foster a sense of collegiality. Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, has even created the position of Americas alumni relations leader to establish a communications network for former employees -- at least partly in hope of luring some of them back.
Madge Nimocks, who was named the alumni relations leader at the company two years ago, says that from March 2002 to March 2003, Ernst & Young filled 96 management positions -- more than a forth of the total openings -- with boomerang employees. Last summer, the company created a Web site for alumni that allows users to view job listings in and out of the organization and provides access to career counseling and mentoring, Ms. Nimocks said. She said thatabout 15,000 alumni have registered.
Ms. Nimocks acknowledged that some in the company considered it unwise to provide resources that would make it easier for current employees to leave. But ultimately, management supported the site. 
"There's a recognition that people are going to come into the firm and they're going to leave the firm," she said. "While in the past, this might have been perceived as abandoning ship, now, it's, 'Stay in touch, down the road we might need you or you might need us.' It's a change of corporate culture that we want to embed in our employees."
SelectMinds, a company that specializes in building and maintaining Web-based alumni networks for corporations like Ernst & Young, Bank One and Accenture, promotes these networks as sound business moves. The New York law firm of Schulte, Roth & Zabel has its own network of alumni and organizes reunions about every 18 months.
Ms. Murray, the management consultant, while agreeing that returning to a former employer can often pay dividends, also warns of potential difficulties. If, for example, it is a move of last resort by someone who never really liked his old workplace but is desperate for a paycheck, she says, it can breed resentment on both sides.
"Going back for the wrong reasons can be poisonous," she said. "There's nothing worse than feeling stuck."
On the other hand, being thrust back into old terrain can come as a pleasant surprise. One New York-based technology executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had mixed feelings when the division he worked for at J. P. Morgan Chase was transferred to I.B.M. in a seven-year, $5 billion outsourcing deal. The executive began his career with I.B.M. more than a decade ago, then left when it was struggling and now finds himself back as it has managed to right itself.
"I've boomeranged by default; we were sold into slavery," the executive said. "On the bright side, I.B.M., which was a dinosaur when I left, is now one of the best tech companies around. There's a lot of opportunity. They're not treating me as anything less of a corporate citizen."
More typical is the case of Robert Goode, 48, who returned to the Glazier Group of restaurants in New York in March as a catering sales manager 14 years after he left the company in frustration over what he viewed as too much competition among sales managers for too little business.
He went on to a series of corporate catering jobs in Lower Manhattan, including five years at the Windows on the World restaurant. After it was destroyed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he got a job in Westchester County but returned to Glazier because he wanted to be in Lower Manhattan.
"Early in my career I was eaten up and spit out," Mr. Goode said. "I didn't have the client base then that I have now. My confidence level is much higher. The organization has a greater understanding of me and my reputation in the marketplace."

Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work

 BODY:
 Following is an accounting of the articles in which falsification, plagiarism and similar problems were discovered in a review of articles written by Jayson Blair, a reporter for The New York Times who resigned May 1. The review, conducted by a team of Times reporters and researchers, concentrated on the 73 articles Mr. Blair wrote since late October, when he was given roving national assignments and began covering major news events including the Washington-area sniper attacks and the rescue of Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch. Spot checks of his previous stories also found errors of fact and possible fabrications.

Detective Says Sniper SuspectWas Interrogated After He Requested Lawyer
APRIL 29, 2003

DENIED REPORTS -- Michael S. Arif, a lawyer for Lee Malvo, the younger of two men charged in the Washington-area sniper attacks last fall, was quoted as saying: "Not one of Mr. Malvo's five attorneys who had been appointed by the court to represent him was given any information about the action taken." Through a law partner, Thomas B. Walsh, Mr. Arif said he had not spoken to Mr. Blair that day or uttered the quoted words to anyone.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- The first sentence of the article stated that Detective June Boyle, the lead Fairfax County investigator in the sniper case, testified that she continued to interrogate Mr. Malvo without a lawyer after he had requested one. While Detective Boyle acknowledged in her testimony that Mr. Malvo had asked a question -- "Do I get to see my attorneys?" -- she did not say that he had invoked his right to counsel. In a later ruling, the judge in the case found that Mr. Malvo's question was not an unambiguous request for the assistance of counsel.

In Military Wards, Questions And Fears From the Wounded
APRIL 19, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- The scenes described in the article took place ostensibly inside a ward of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. But Lt. Cmdr. Jerry Rostad, the public affairs officer for the center, said there was no record that Mr. Blair had visited or interviewed patients there.

DENIED REPORTS -- Of the six wounded soldiers quoted in what Mr. Blair described as "long conversations" at the medical center, one, Lance Cpl. James Klingel, said he was interviewed by Mr. Blair, but by telephone from his home in Lodi, Ohio, after he had been discharged. Telephone records described by Times officials suggest that Mr. Blair made this 27-minute call from his desk at the paper in New York on April 17. Three men -- Staff Sgt. Eric Alva, Lt. Col. Jonathan Ewers and Hospitalman Brian Alaniz -- said they had not spoken to Mr. Blair, Commander Rostad said. (Two others could not be reached.)
In a telephone interview, Corporal Klingel said that Mr. Blair had manufactured or embellished parts of the article. He said that, for example, the following quotation attributed to him by Mr. Blair had been made up: "I am still looking over my shoulder. I am sure I will be standing on the back porch and worry about who might come shooting at me out of the bush."
Corporal Klingel also disputed the portion of the article that described him as "disheartened because he will most likely limp the rest of his life and need to use a cane." He said he was neither limping nor using a cane now. 
In addition, he denied he had told Mr. Blair he was having nightmares about his tour in Iraq. And he said he had not spoken to Mr. Blair about "his mind wandering from images of his girlfriend back in Ohio to the sight of an exploding fireball to the sounds of twisting metal," as Mr. Blair described.
Because he interviewed Corporal Klingel by phone, Mr. Blair was not in a position to describe him as he did in his article: speaking from a hospital bed and contemplating a visit to a chaplain, as Sergeant Alva lay in the bed next to him. 
Reached by phone, Sergeant Alva's mother, Lois, declined to comment. But Commander Rostad said that Sergeant Alva contended that he did not say any of the comments attributed to him by Mr. Blair. These included the following: "But in more private moments last week in the hospital, Sergeant Alva acknowledged that he had anger that he directed inward and toward the news media that he said were too hard on soldiers and a public that he said did not really understand the costs of war. 'There is no point in explaining how I feel,' he said, 'because no one really is going to be able to understand it.' " 
Later in the article, Mr. Blair wrote: "Sergeant Alva, who has had 10 operations since stepping on the mine on March 22, blames himself for the injuries of Seaman Alaniz, who is 28. If he had not been dumb enough to step on the mine, Sergeant Alva concluded, his friend would have never been injured."

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair erroneously described Hospitalman Alaniz as a seaman and as being "down the hall" from Sergeant Alva and Corporal Klingel at the medical center. Hospitalman Alaniz was discharged on April 9, five days before Corporal Klingel's arrival, Commander Rostad said. In addition, the article stated that Sergeant Alva had lost his right leg; his right leg had been amputated below the knee.

A Couple Separated by War While United in Their Fears
APRIL 15, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- The article's dateline -- the label of the place and, ordinarily, the time where the reporting was done -- was given as Jacksonville, N.C., April 11. According to The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, "Because believable firsthand news gathering is The Times's hallmark, datelines must scrupulously specify when and where the reporting took place."
But in a telephone interview, Sarai Thompson, whose husband is a marine stationed in Iraq, said she had been interviewed by Mr. Blair by phone, not in person.

Former P.O.W. Returns Home for Treatment At Army Hospital
APRIL 13, 2003

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair wrote that while waiting for Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch to arrive back in the United States, her family stayed at the Melrose House, an Army hotel in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. There is no hotel of that name in the complex.

For One Pastor, The War Hits Home
APRIL 7, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- It does not appear that Mr. Blair was at the church service in Cleveland on April 6 that he described. The associate minister described in the piece, the Rev. Tandy Sloan, said in a telephone interview that he did not recall meeting, seeing or being interviewed by him. A Times official recently checked with the hotel that Mr. Blair said he had stayed at, but it had no record of his stay.

PLAGIARISM -- Mr. Blair appears to have borrowed substantial portions of his article from an article in The Washington Post, which appeared March 29 under the byline of Tamara Jones. For example, Mr. Blair wrote: "The senior pastor, the Rev. Larry Howard, opened the prayer service by reminding the several hundred people who had gathered that God was 'bigger than Hussein.' Mr. Sloan bowed his head and closed his eyes. He could hear the women, mostly family members, weeping behind him, and, as he recalls, he started to cry. 'We still have hope,' Mr. Sloan said after taking the pulpit. 'Hope hasn't gone anywhere.' " He also described Mr. Sloan "with his head slumped."
Ms. Jones wrote: "Now, as the Rev. Larry Howard opened the prayer service for Brandy Sloan, reminding several hundred congregants that 'God is bigger than Hussein,' Tandy Sloan closed his eyes and bowed his head." She later wrote: "His broad shoulders slumped, and in four pews filled with his extended family, he could hear the women softly weeping. Then Howard invited Sloan to speak, and he climbed behind the pulpit." She also described: " 'We still have hope,' he began. 'Hope hasn't gone anywhere.' "
Mr. Blair also used, without attribution, quotations that had appeared in articles by The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Daily News in New York.

DENIED REPORTS -- Mr. Blair described Mr. Sloan, at the April 6 service, as "gazing at a photograph" of his son inside his Bible. Mr. Sloan said he did not have a photograph of his son inside his Bible at the service.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair referred to Mr. Sloan's church at one point as "Historical Greater Friendship Baptist Church." It is "Historic Greater Friendship Baptist Church," which he rendered correctly later in the article.

Family Begins Trip To Rejoin Freed Soldier
APRIL 6, 2003

WHEREABOUTS: -- An article about the decision by the parents of Private Lynch to fly to Germany to meet her while she was undergoing treatment there carried a dateline of Charleston, W.Va., April 5. But the hotels in the area have no record of Mr. Blair's checking in. And an editor in the national department of The Times said he saw Mr. Blair in the newsroom in New York shortly after 4 that afternoon. The editor, who had been under the impression Mr. Blair was in Charleston when he spoke to him late that morning, asked Mr. Blair how he had returned to New York so quickly. Mr. Blair said he had taken a 2:30 p.m. flight. There does not appear to have been such a flight that day. And there are calls made from his desk extension to towns in West Virginia beginning at 2:20 p.m., phone records indicated.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- The article stated that Private Lynch's family had flown to Germany on a commercial flight; Brandi Lynch, Private Lynch's sister, said in a telephone interview that the H.J. Heinz Company's private jet had been made available to the family.

Gifts and Offers for Book Deals Arrive at Rescued Private's House as She Has Surgery
APRIL 5, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- For this article, Mr. Blair reported ostensibly from Palestine, W.Va., on April 4. But local hotels have no record of Mr. Blair's visiting around that time. Mr. Blair filed an article the same day with a dateline of Fairfax, Va., reporting on the legal proceedings against the Washington-area sniper suspects.

PLAGIARISM -- Mr. Blair quoted Private Lynch's father, Gregory Lynch Sr., as saying that he was "truly grateful" to the Iraqi lawyer who led United States forces to his daughter, and that the lawyer "would get a world of hugs out of that heroic deal." Mr. Lynch made those statements to other news organizations, not in an interview with Mr. Blair, a review of other publications showed. Mr. Lynch told The Washington Post that he never spoke to Mr. Blair. And Brandi Lynch told The Times that her father never spoke to Mr. Blair.

Tapes Hint at Possible Flaws In Sniper Suspect Confession
APRIL 5, 2003

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Detective Boyle is described as a 21-year veteran of the Fairfax County Police Department. She is a 26-year veteran, according to Lt. Amy Lubas, the commander of the department's public information office.

Freed Soldier Is in Better Condition Than First Thought, Father Says
APRIL 4, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- As with all articles Mr. Blair filed from Palestine, W.Va., no hotels in Mineral Wells, the nearby town where many reporters covering the Lynch family stayed, have records of Mr. Blair's reserving or paying for a room.

PLAGIARISM -- Quotations appear to have come from an Associated Press article by Allison Barker that was written on April 3. For example, Ms. Barker related the following quotation and description of Mr. Lynch: " 'They have successfully done one surgery on her,' he said, smiling as he joked about pink casts for her broken limbs. 'There will be other surgeries, and it's going to take time and patience. She's in real good spirits.' "
Mr. Blair used most of the quotation verbatim, but slightly changed the description of Mr. Lynch, writing that he "smiled as he joked about her getting pink casts for her broken legs." Mr. Blair also wrote of Private Lynch, "She's in really good spirits."

Rescue in Iraq And A 'Big Stir' in West Virginia
APRIL 3, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Hotels in the vicinity of Palestine, W.Va., had no record of Mr. Blair. His co-writer, as well as a photographer who was stationed at the Lynch home for The Times, said they did not see Mr. Blair. Mr. Blair gave his editors and his co-writer a number where he could be reached on April 2, the day the article was written. The number belonged to Glenda and Donald Nelson, friends of the Lynch family; the Nelsons said that they never met or spoke to Mr. Blair. The Nelsons live in Marmet, W.Va., about a two-hour drive from Palestine.

PLAGIARISM -- Mr. Blair described the Nelsons' talking about Private Lynch and a letter they had received from her: "Ms. Nelson and her husband, Donald, sat in their kitchen today, staring at their own letter from Private Lynch, which arrived on Monday. In the time it took the letter, dated March 18, to make its way from Kuwait, Private Lynch's unit, the 507th Maintenance Company, was attacked during some of the first fighting in Nasiriya, she was declared missing in action for five days and yellow ribbons began to pop up all over town.
" 'We just bawled like babies when we got the letter,' Mr. Nelson said today. 'It just tore us apart to think of how scared she was or what might have happened to her.' "
In an Associated Press article that ran on April 2, Ms. Barker wrote: "Before the war started, Private Lynch wrote a letter to family friends Glenda and Don Nelson. The letter, dated March 18, arrived on Monday. 'She said she was ready to go to war and was just waiting on President Bush's word, but I could tell she was scared,' said Don Nelson. 'We bawled like babies when we read it. It tore us up.' "
Mr. Blair also used details and quotations about a shopping trip to Charleston that was recounted in an Associated Press article from March 25. 
In addition, Mr. Nelson's quotation about Private Lynch being "a wholesome West Virginia country girl" appears to have been adapted from a comment in the April 2 Associated Press article made by Lorene Cumbridge, a cousin of Private Lynch. "She's just a West Virginia country girl. Warm-hearted. Outgoing," Ms Cumbridge said.

The Last Stop On the Journey Home
APRIL 1, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair's article, about the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, took place ostensibly at the base on March 31. Second Lt. Cathy L. Milhoan, a spokeswoman for the 512th Airlift Wing at the base, whom Mr. Blair interviewed by phone around that time, said in a telephone interview that she was "100 percent" sure that Mr. Blair had not visited the base to interview people for this article.

DENIED REPORTS -- Mr. Blair quoted Lieutenant Milhoan as saying of the reservists who staff the military mortuary: "They have really been taxed both logistically and emotionally."
Lieutenant Milhoan said that Mr. Blair had inserted the reference to logistics into her comment and that she had spent considerable time during the interview explaining that the Iraq operation presented no logistical challenge to the reservists working at the mortuary. "There were plenty of people," she said. "This is our mission. This is what we do." She said she called Mr. Blair on April 1 to discuss her concern with him, after he had e-mailed her a link to the article on The New York Times Web site. Lieutenant Milhoan said he had apologized. 

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair wrote that the base, to assist in the handling of soldiers' remains, "brought in 58 reservists from a local wing in Delaware and eight more from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland." Shortly after the article appeared, Lieutenant Milhoan told Mr. Blair that the correct figures were 42 Dover reservists and 16 Andrews Air Force Base reservists, according to an e-mail message that a Times official described.

For Families of the Dead, A Fateful Knock on the Door
MARCH 31, 2003

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair embellished certain details while incorporating notes from a co-author into the article. He wrote that Stacy L. Menusa and her 3-year-old son were "standing in the driveway of her parents' home" when two marines arrived with news of her husband's death. Ms. Menusa, in a recent interview, said that she and her son were inside the house at the time.

Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News
MARCH 27, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Although this article about the relatives of soldiers missing in combat in Iraq carried a March 26 dateline from Palestine, W.Va., Mr. Blair's cellphone records, described to reporters by William E. Schmidt, an associate managing editor of The Times, indicate that he was in New York. In addition, several people at the Lynch home -- including photographers and other reporters -- said they had not met or seen Mr. Blair there. And the hotels nearest to Palestine have no record of Mr. Blair's staying there.

PLAGIARISM -- In the article, Mr. Blair described the anguish of the Estrella family whose son was one of the eight members of the 507th Maintenance Company listed by the Pentagon as whereabouts unknown. " 'We don't know anything. Not knowing anything is so hard,' said Ruben Estrella, whose 18-year-old son, Pvt. Ruben Estrella-Soto of El Paso, is among the members of the 507th listed as missing. 'I can't take this waiting.' " An Associated Press article, written from El Paso on March 26, quoted Ruben Estrella as saying, "We don't know anything, not knowing anything. It's been three days of waiting."

DENIED REPORTS -- Mr. Blair quoted Kimberly Cieslak, whose brother, Sgt. Donald Walters, was missing. Ms. Cieslak said she did not recall speaking to Mr. Blair, although she did remember speaking to a different reporter for The Times for a later story.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair wrote that tobacco fields and cattle pastures were visible from the porch of the Lynch home. Brandi Lynch said there is no such view. Mr. Blair wrote that Private Lynch's brother was in the National Guard in West Virginia. He is actually in the Army. Mr. Blair described a dream of Private Lynch's mother, Deadra Lynch; Brandi Lynch said her mother had not described any such dream. Mr. Blair also misspelled Deadra Lynch's first name.

Watching, and Praying, As a Son's Fate Unfolds
MARCH 25, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair does not appear to have traveled to Hunt Valley, Md., on March 24, as the article indicated. The article included interviews with the members of only one family -- Martha and Michael Gardner, the parents of Cpl. Michael P. Gardner II, a marine in Iraq, and his sister Cara. Martha Gardner said that he did not visit their home and that she spoke to him only by phone. Phone and other records suggest that Mr. Blair was in New York from 10:09 a.m. to 3:59 p.m. that day, and again the following morning.

DENIED REPORTS -- Mr. Blair described Ms. Gardner speaking as she was "turning swiftly in her chair to listen to an anchor report on a marine unit that had suffered heavy casualties in southern Iraq and about a group of soldiers that had been captured nearby." He also recounted other scenes, which a photographer for The Times did not recall describing to him.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- The sister of Corporal Gardner is named Cara, not Kara.

Chief in Sniper Case Considers a Job Change
MARCH 22, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair filed this profile of Charles A. Moose, the police chief in Montgomery County, Md., ostensibly from Gaithersburg, Md., on March 21, 2003. Mr. Blair's cellphone records did not indicate that any calls originated from or were received in Maryland that day.

DENIED REPORTS -- The article described Chief Moose as speaking "in an interview here in the apartment he shares with his wife, Sandy." A spokeswoman for Chief Moose said the quotations in the story were accurate but that the interview had been conducted over the phone, not in his apartment.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Chief Moose's annual salary was listed as $120,000 inthe article; it is $160,619. Joseph D. McNamara is a former police chief in San Jose, Calif., not San Diego. And the article misstated the name of a public body. It is the Montgomery County Council's public safety committee, not public safety commission.

Bearing the Worst News, Then Helping the Healing
MARCH 22, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair purported to write this article about the work of military officers assigned to notify families of soldiers killed on duty from Norfolk, Va. on March 21. A Times official said cellphone and other records indicated that Mr. Blair was in New York that day.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Four people were quoted by name in this article concerning military officials who deliver the news of soldiers' deaths to their relatives, and two of those names were misspelled. Lt. Asha Fotos's surname was rendered as Potos on five occasions. And Chief Petty Officer Glen Gaynor's first name was given as Glenn.

Sniper Suspect Is Disciplined For Cell Graffiti
MARCH 8, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Phone records described to reporters by Times officials indicated there were calls made from Mr. Blair's desk in New York to Virginia at 11:46 a.m. on March 7, when the article was ostensibly written, and cellphone and computer records indicated that he remained in New York through the rest of the afternoon.

Judge in Sniper Case Bars Cameras From Trial
MARCH 4, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Cellphone records, which Mr. Blair had submitted for reimbursement, indicate that calls were made from New York between 2:16 p.m. and 10:50 p.m. on March 3, when the article was supposedly written. At 5:19 p.m., he sent an e-mail message to his editors, saying that he was in the Washington bureau and was about to send a draft of his story.

Making Sniper Suspect Talk Puts Detective in Spotlight
MARCH 3, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- The article was written ostensibly in Fairfax, Va., on March 1. Mr. Blair's cellphone records indicated that no calls originated from outside New York between Feb. 27 and March 26. Phone and other computer records indicate that he was at his desk in New York.

DENIED REPORTS -- The article reported that statements made by Lee Malvo, the younger defendant in the Washington-area sniper shootings, during questioning by Detective Boyle on Nov. 7, 2002, had been videotaped. There is no videotape of the questioning, according to Lt. Amy Lubas, the commander of the public information office at the Fairfax County Police Department; there is only an audiotape. In addition, a quotation from one law enforcement official who had supposedly seen parts of the videotape described him as being in awe of Detective Boyle's performance. "To watch her is to watch a master," the official was quoted as saying. The quotation appears to be manufactured, because law enforcement officials said there was no videotape to be watched.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair wrote that Detective Boyle, while investigating the death of a young woman in 1995, had noticed blood on the jeans of the woman's brother. According to the article, the detective was then able to build a circumstantial case that led to the man's confession. Lieutenant Lubas said that Detective Boyle did not notice the blood and that the brother did not confess. In addition, Detective Boyle was described as being dressed in her trademark combination of a blazer and black shirt. Lieutenant Lubas said that Detective Boyle did not have a trademark combination and preferred bright colors, not black.

Peace and Answers Eluding Victims of the Sniper Attacks
FEB. 10, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- This Page 1 article carried a Feb. 8 dateline from Washington. Cellphone and other Times records indicate that Mr. Blair was in New York that day.

PLAGIARISM -- Mr. Blair quoted Mrytha Cinada, the daughter of a sniper victim who died, as saying, "That is a big hole in my life that will never be filled by anyone else." The quotation appears to have come from a story in The Washington Post that ran on Oct. 10, 2002, by two reporters, Sylvia Moreno and Darragh Johnson. Ms. Cinada said of Mr. Blair, "I never heard of him and I've never spoken to him."

DENIED REPORTS -- Penny Hannum, also quoted in the story, said she did not speak to Mr. Blair. It is not clear where her quotation came from. Kellie Adams, who was shot in a liquor store robbery in Montgomery, Ala., said she did not compare her background to those of the suspected snipers when she was quoted as saying, "There are similarities in our backgrounds, and I see bits and pieces of myself in even them."

FACTUAL ERRORS -- James Ballenger III said in a telephone interview that he is not a part-time preacher or any kind of preacher. Mr. Ballenger did not volunteer at the local prison; it was a paid position. He had not "relied heavily" on donations from others; he said he accepts them but does not rely on them. The article said that he took "a message of forgiveness to church pulpits and television programs across Louisiana, arguing ferociously that Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo should not be executed," referring to the two suspects arrested in the sniper shootings. Mr. Ballenger said he never addressed this topic from a church pulpit and that he made his points "peacefully." Ms. Adams did not suffer from back pain; she said she suffered from shoulder and neck pain.

OTHER ISSUES -- Mr. Ballenger said that he discussed the fact that his son, James IV, had dropped out of college on the condition that it not be published, and that he was upset to see it in the paper.

Cellphone records indicate that Mr. Blair was making calls from New York between 9:31 a.m. until nearly midnight.

Teenager's Role Tangles Case Against Older Sniper Suspect
DEC. 22, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- The article about how Mr. Malvo's supposed role in the sniper shooting was affecting the case against the older defendant, John Muhammad, carried a dateline of Centreville, Va., Dec. 19. Calls were made that day from Mr. Blair's desk and cellphone in New York beginning at 12:17 p.m. and ending at 11:59 p.m., records indicated.

DENIED REPORTS -- The article reported on supposed evidence from unnamed law enforcement officials showing that Mr. Malvo was the likely triggerman in most of the shootings. The commonwealth attorney in Fairfax County, Va., said in a recent interview that at least two of the five pieces of evidence cited in the article do not exist. The first is a videotape said to have been recovered from a security camera near the Home Depot parking lot in Falls Church, Va., where Linda Franklin was killed on Oct. 14, 2002, showing someone who appears to be Mr. Muhammad in the driver's seat. The second is a grape stem bearing Mr. Malvo's saliva said to have been found near the site of another shooting.

Acquittal in Shooting Of Priest Splits a City
DEC. 18, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- This article about divisions in Baltimore following the acquittal of a man who, claiming he had been molested by a priest as a child, shot the priest, was ostensibly reported and written in that city on Dec. 17. Records indicate that calls originating in New York on that date were made from Mr. Blair's desk phone, including calls to Baltimore. Calls were made from Mr. Blair's office extension as late as 10:06 p.m. In addition, Mr. Blair did not submit a train ticket receipt or ask to be reimbursed for other travel expenses.

OTHER ISSUES -- Mr. Blair used comments by Lee Gardner, editor of The Baltimore City Paper, that Mr. Gardner said he had stipulated could not be used with his name attached. Donna Jones Stanley, the executive director of the Associated Black Charities of Maryland, said Mr. Blair had used her comments out of context. Mr. Blair wrote that Ms. Stanley said that blacks were "happy that this young man did not have to pay the price for a broken system." Ms. Stanley said she had been speaking only for herself and did not say anything about the views of blacks in general.

Man Who Shot Priest In An Abuse Case Wins Acquittal
DEC. 17, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Cellphone and office phone records indicate that calls were made from New York throughout the day of Dec. 16, until 9:40 p.m., while the article was supposedly being written and reported in Baltimore.

Sniper Case Will Be First Test Of Virginia Antiterrorism Law
DEC. 17, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Cellphone records indicate that Mr. Blair was in New York from 9:37 a.m. to 7:36 p.m. on Dec. 9, ostensibly when the article was written with a Washington dateline. There are no records of travel to Washington, and he appears to have been in the New York office the next day as phone calls to Virginia were made from his extension.

Laura Bush Visits The Youngest Sniper Victim
DEC. 13, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Cellphone bills that Mr. Blair submitted for reimbursement indicate that calls were made from New York beginning at 11:07 a.m. on Dec. 12 and continuing past midnight. He was supposedly in Washington that day to report and write this article.

Questions Over Reward For Tips in the Sniper Case
NOV. 27, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair was supposedly in Rockville, Md., on Nov. 26 to write the article. But receipts submitted for reimbursement include one from a Marshalls store in Brooklyn at 5:12 p.m. that day. On his expense form, he wrote that the purchase was for blankets for his hotel-room bed in Washington.

Attendance Requirement Leaves Colleges Sweating
NOV. 23, 2002

DENIED REPORTS -- An article about efforts by college football teams to increase attendance to comply with a new requirement of the National Collegiate Athletic Association quoted Pete Mahoney, the associate athletic director at Kent State. In a telephone interview, Mr. Mahoney denied making the quoted statement or speaking with Mr. Blair.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- The article said that the new N.C.A.A. rule setting minimum home-game attendance requirements "went into effect this season." In fact, the rule will go into effect in 2004.

OTHER ISSUES -- The article used a quotation from The San Jose Mercury News of Sept. 26, 2002, without attribution. Robert Caret, the president of San Jose State University, told that newspaper: "You can like it or not like it, but the fact of the matter is, of the institutions we want in our peer group, Division I football is one of our defining characteristics." Mr. Blair wrote only that Mr. Caret had made the comment earlier in the year.
In addition, The Daily Kent Stater, a student newspaper, published an article in December in which school officials took issue with Mr. Blair's reporting. The writer of the article, who said that he could not reach Mr. Blair because his voice-mail in box was full, then left detailed messages for The Times's sports department. No one at the paper responded to the messages. 

Statements by Teenager May Muddy Sniper Case
NOV. 11, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Expense records, as described by Times officials, suggest that Mr. Blair traveled to New York from Washington on the weekend of Nov. 9 and did not not return to Washington until Nov. 11, the day after this article was filed with a Washington dateline. A receipt submitted with his expenses indicated that he bought $11.46 worth of cigarettes and magazines at Penn Station in New York on the morning of Nov. 11.

DENIED REPORTS -- In this article, Mr. Blair quoted Toby Vick, a former state and federal prosecutor in Virginia, about the dangers that the inclusion of Mr. Malvo's statements could have on Mr. Muhammad's trial. "It helps him with one of the statutes, the capital murder charge, but it does not help him on the terrorism charge," Mr. Vick said. "If you bring it in to prove he was not the shooter, prosecutors could bring it in to prove the terrorism charge, where you don't have to show the defendant fired the shot."
Mr. Vick has said that while he has spoken to Mr. Blair about the sniper case for previous articles, he is "fairly confident" that he did not make this statement.

Officials Link Most Killings To Teenager
NOV. 10, 2002

WHEREABOUTS -- Mr. Blair used The Times's travel agent to book a train ticket from Washington to New York on the evening of Nov. 8. Cellphone records indicate that he was in New York later that same night as well as the next day, at least between 11 a.m. and 4:46 p.m. While it is possible that Mr. Blair could have returned to Washington later that day, hotel records at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington show no additional charges to the room tariff. Food and phone charges were incurred between Nov. 4 and Nov. 8.

Sniper Suspects Linked To Yet Another Shooting
NOV. 2, 2002

FACTUAL ERRORS -- In an article about how investigators linked the Washington-area snipers to earlier shootings in other states, Mr. Blair described the recovery of a handgun used in a shooting in Montgomery, Ala. Mr. Blair wrote that "John Wilson, the chief of the Montgomery police, said a .22-caliber Magnum handgun that was stolen in Oklahoma was found on Wednesday in an area where an officer said he had chased Mr. Muhammad," one of the sniper suspects. In a telephone interview, Mr. Wilson said that the handgun was found in an area where a civilian said he had chased Mr. Malvo after a fatal shooting in the area on Sept. 21.

U.S. Sniper Case Seen As a Barrier to a Confession
OCT. 30, 2002

FACTUAL ERRORS -- In this article, Mr. Blair wrote about the way a dispute between local and federal prosecutors affected the interrogation of John Muhammad, a suspect in the sniper case. Mr. Blair wrote that two assistant United States attorneys from Maryland, James M. Trusty and A. David Copperthite, participated in discussions about whether the suspects should be charged by local or federal authorities. Neither official participated in the discussions, according to Thomas M. DiBiagio, the United States attorney for Maryland, whose account was confirmed by other law enforcement officials who participated in the meeting. The article also suggested -- inaccurately, Mr. DiBiagio said -- that Mr. Trusty and Mr. Copperthite were among the officials who had gathered to watch the interrogation of Mr. Muhammad.

OTHER ISSUES -- In the first sentence of the article, Mr. Blair wrote that Mr. Muhammad had been talking to investigators for more than an hour, "explaining the roots of his anger," when a federal prosecutor interrupted the interrogation and told investigators to deliver Mr. Muhammad to Baltimore. In the third paragraph of the article, he also quoted an anonymous law enforcement official as saying that "it looked like Muhammed was ready to share everything." The article drew a conclusion unwarranted by the reporting. According to local and federal law enforcement officials who monitored the interrogation, the conversations were aimed at building a rapport with Mr. Muhammad and he was not on the verge of a confession. The officials said that the interrogation had not yet broached any of the shootings, and that Mr. Muhammad was not discussing the "roots of his anger." Editors who worked on the article said that the story should have also acknowledged more promptly information from other Times reporters that contradicted Mr. Blair's account of the interrogation.

Cultural Groups Need Help
OCT. 20, 2001

FABRICATIONS -- A brief article concerning the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York cultural institutions said that the American Craft Museum was "already in serious financial trouble before Sept. 11." The assertion was not attributed. A correction published on Oct. 30, 2001, stated that "while lower-level staff members spoke of financial troubles that existed before Sept. 11, the director, Holly Hotchner, says the museum's finances are strong."
In defending his original reporting to his editors, Mr. Blair relied primarily on what he said were conversationswith the museum's chief financial officer, who was said to have acted as a confidential source. 
In a recent interview, the museum's chief financial officer then and now, Robert J. Salemo, said he never spoke with Mr. Blair. There is no evidence that Mr. Blair spoke with "lower-level staff members." Mr. Salemo said that the museum broke even that year.

Fighting Words: Whose Icon Is It?
SEPT. 29, 2001

FACTUAL ERRORS -- In an article about the effort by some family members of passengers on one of the aircraft hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, to trademark the phrase "let's roll," Mr. Blair quoted John F. Delaney, a lawyer, on what a trademark is. Mr. Blair quoted Mr. Delaney accurately but failed to identify him or his law firm correctly. Mr. Delaney's first name is John, not Jonathan, and he is a lawyer in the New York office of Morrison & Foerster, not Morrison & Forester.

In Side Effect of Economic Prosperity, White-Collar Crime Flourishes
MARCH 13, 2000

FACTUAL ERRORS -- An article about white-collar crime discussed the experiences of Gary Ahlert, who was said to have lost $400,000 on a plan to market a material to cover artificial limbs. That loss, the article added, made him eager to listen to a sales pitch concerning an investment in a mine in Arizona. In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Ahlert said he had not lost money on a marketing plan, though he did fail to collect a licensing fee of some $200,000 in connection with it. He added that the investment involved ore in a warehouse and not in a mine.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Ten days ago, Jayson Blair resigned as a reporter for The New York Times after the discovery that he had plagiarized parts of an article on April 26 about the Texas family of a soldier missing in Iraq. An article on Page 1 today recounts a chain of falsifications and plagiarism that unraveled when The Times began an inquiry into that Texas article. At least 36 more articles written by Mr. Blair since October reflected plagiarism, misstatements, misrepresentation of the reporter's whereabouts or a combination of those. An accounting of the flaws will be found today on Pages 22 and 23.
Today's article and the accounting result from a weeklong investigation by five Times reporters and a team of researchers. The newspaper organized it in the belief that the appropriate corrective for flawed journalism is better journalism -- accurate journalism. 
The reporters have telephoned news sources cited by Mr. Blair and have interviewed other journalists who worked with him. Executives have read them summaries of telephone records and expense documents. To examine the newsroom processes that went awry, they have had unrestricted access to other Times staff members, including top editors, involved with Mr. Blair's copy and the management of his career. Within the limits of laws and ethical codes governing health and employment records, Times managers have described documents for the reporting team. 
The reporters' examination has centered on the last seven months, a period in which Mr. Blair increasingly received assignments distant from the newsroom, which allowed him wider independence. His earlier work, done under closer supervision, will be spot-checked. If another major examination appears warranted, it will be carried out. Readers and news sources who know of defects in additional articles should send e-mail to The Times: retrace@nytimes.com.
In online databases that include copy from The Times, cautionary notices will be attached to the faulty articles in coming days.
The Times regrets that it did not detect the journalistic deceptions sooner. A separate internal inquiry, by the management, will examine the newsroom's processes for training, assignment and accountability.
For all of the falsifications and plagiarism, The Times apologizes to its readers in the first instance, and to those who have figured in improper coverage. It apologizes, too, to those whose work was purloined and to all conscientious journalists whose professional trust has been betrayed by this episode.
Readers with information about other articles by Jayson Blair that may be false wholly or in part are asked to e-mail The Times: retrace@nytimes.com.
On May 11 The Times published an extensive report about plagiarism and fabrications by Jayson Blair before his resignation as a reporter for The Times a week earlier. The detailed account centered on articles written during and after October, when Mr. Blair began receiving national assignments. An editors' note with that account said The Times would continue spot-checking Mr. Blair's earlier articles and invited readers to report any discrepancies to retrace@nytimes.com.
Ten additional articles by Mr. Blair have since been found to include misstatements or possibly borrowed passages, or quotations that have been denied by the speaker to whom they were attributed. The list is online today at nytimes.com/corrections.html, where it will remain accessible for the next week. The corrective notes will be appended to the affected articles in The Times's online databases.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Rev. Tandy Sloan, shown last month in Cleveland, said he did not recall meeting or talking to Jayson Blair, who wrote an article on Mr. Sloan that appeared on April 7.

Henry Schein Reports Record First Quarter
Henry Schein (Nasdaq: HSIC) of Melville said Tuesday that European sales paced record first-quarter sales and profits for the company.
 International sales for the company, which distributes health-care products and services to doctors and dentists in North America and Europe, improved 22.5 percent over the same quarter last year, Henry Schein said. Medical sales worldwide grew nearly 20 percent, and sales of technology and management services grew 19 percent. Dental sales increased 6.3 percent. 
 Net sales for the quarter were $738 million, up 14 percent over the same quarter last year. Profits were $24.8 million, up 25.5 percent over the same quarter last year.

Delta Financial and Amex
 The Delta Financial Corporation (OTC: DLTO) of Woodbury said Wednesday that it has applied to list its common stock on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol DFC. 

American Technical Loss
 American Technical Ceramics Corporation (Amex: AMK) of Huntington Station said Tuesday that it narrowed its net loss for its fiscal third quarter.
The company, which manufactures telecommunications hardware for commercial and military customers, said that it posted a net loss of $299,000 for the quarter, as compared with $1.06 million for the same quarter last year. 
Victor Instetta, president and chief executive of the company, said: "The telecommunications industry remains depressed and the news of the world has put the timing of an economic recovery in question. The outlook remains cloudy and our current thinking is that the next few quarters will be comparable to the last few quarters." 

Reckson Records Drop
 Reckson Associates Realty Corporation (NYSE: RA) of Melville said Monday that net income dropped to $14 million for the first quarter, down from $21.5 million for the same quarter last year. Scott Rechler, the company's co-chief executive, said that lower occupancy rates, a major lease termination and generally weak market conditions were factors in the quarter's performance. Reckson is a real estate investment trust that buys, develops and manages office and industrial properties in New York City and surrounding suburbs.

HEADLINE: EXECUTIVE LIFE: THE BOSS; 
Little Campaign That Could

BYLINE:  By TOMMY G. THOMPSON; Written with Elizabeth Olson. 

 BODY:
I GREW up in a rural community, Elroy, Wis., population 1,600. My father ran the grocery store and my mother taught school. Since my father believed that everybody should earn their way, I was working at age 5. The farmers would bring in eggs and other produce to swap for groceries. My job was to clean and sandpaper the eggs to ready them for sale. To this day, I can't stand eggs. 
 When people were unemployed, my father gave them groceries. When he went out of business, there was more money on the books than in the cash register. We were relatively poor, but I didn't realize it until I went to the University of Wisconsin with my one sweater and two shirts. 
 I put myself through college. Working in a cannery and a foundry were the hardest jobs. Then, as a senior, I won a scholarship to study politics in Washington. That summer, in 1963, I worked for a congressman and thought to myself: "I could do this. This isn't heavy lifting."
I decided I needed a law degree to enter politics, and started law school that fall. When school was nearly over, I asked my local legislator for a job, but he wouldn't hire me. I learned he was afraid I would run against him. And I did. Nobody gave me a chance to win. I campaigned between Aug. 9, when I got out of school, and Sept. 9, the date of the Republican primary. I borrowed $500 and, for $100, bought a green Ford that was so beat up you could see the pavement through the floorboards.
My father gave me $10 a day for food and gas. I hit every farm, every house and, in the evenings, the bars and bowling alleys. I ran on the issue of highway safety, though my car was a wreck. I turned 24 before I got sworn in.
In 20 years as a legislator, I worked on education, health care and welfare, but my proposals never passed because Republicans were in the minority. The only chance to get things done was to run for governor, or get out and be a lawyer. I took a year off from my law practice, and won the primary.I was the only Republican that year, 1986, to beat a Democratic governor. I've been underestimated my whole life. I outworked everybody; I learned it from my father.
When I took over, I did things out of the ordinary. I went to union halls, and to African-American churches in cities that probably had not ever seen a Republican.
Since both houses of the Legislature were controlled by Democrats, I knew I had to do something dramatic. So I appointed the Democratic majority leader to my cabinet to be in charge of health and human services.
It was one of the smartest moves I made because it took away, and demoralized, the opposition, and gave me a strong Democrat to get things through.
One of my best-known initiatives was welfare reform. I got a lot of my ideas by inviting welfare mothers over for lunch. I'd ask them to tell me their stories, why they were on welfare and how the state could help them get off it. I stay in touch with one of them, who now works for the state helping people find jobs.

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
Private Accounts Don't Have to Disturb Social Security

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MOST political analysts think the fight to privatize Social Security won't really get going until after the 2004 presidential election. President Bush, if re-elected, would provide further ammunition to those who favor some blending of Social Security and the stock markets.
 The big problem for privatization, however, is the huge deficit that would be created in Social Security, a pay-as-you-go system, if even part of current payroll taxes are shunted into private accounts. One proposal, for example, would put a third of an individual's taxes into private accounts. This partial privatization would drain around $200 billion a year from the system. How would it be made up? By borrowing, raising taxes or cutting benefits -- not exactly pleasant solutions. 
 But there may be a compromise, a third way, that could satisfy a broad swath of privatization proponents and those who want to keep the system as it is.
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, has introduced legislation that would establish separate, government-funded private accounts for workers that would be invested in stocks and high-grade corporate bonds. When a worker retired, the money in the account would be used to offset his or her promised monthly benefits from Social Security, thus taking some financial pressure off the system. The Shaw plan, called Social Security Guarantee Plus, would not basically change the current system but would bolster its trust fund.
"I do not favor privatizing any of the wage taxes currently going into Social Security," Mr. Shaw said in a recent interview. "I do not favor taking a dime out of the existing system or raising Social Security taxes. That would only make things more difficult."
Mr. Shaw, 64, is chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security. His district encompasses Palm Beach and Broward Counties, including Fort Lauderdale.
Elements of the Shaw plan are similar to one proposed by former Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 campaign. Mr. Gore wanted to create individual, government-funded private accounts, but the money they accumulated would be paid to retirees in addition to Social Security benefits. The Gore plan, however, was formed in a time of budget surpluses and was his way of returning money to the people in lieu of a tax cut.
Now, of course, we face growing deficits; they would force the government to borrow to finance the Shaw proposal, at least initially. But Mr. Shaw points to studies by the Social Security Administration projecting that his plan, over the next 75 years, would repay all its debt and save the system almost $5 trillion. That's based on the reasonable assumption that the accounts would earn an average annual return of 5.2 percent, after inflation.
"My plan is not going to be sucking money out of the economy, because it's going to go right back in," Mr. Shaw said.
According to the Social Security trustees' report for 2002, tax revenues will fall below expenses in 2018, forcing the system to dip into its trust fund to pay benefits; in 2042, the trust fund is expected to be exhausted, leaving the system able to pay only 73 percent of benefits. To fill the gap created by the expiration of the trust fund and keep the system going for 75 years -- until 2077 -- would require an additional $3.5 trillion, the trustees said. So Mr. Shaw's promised $5 trillion looks pretty sweet.
UNDER the Shaw plan, each year the government would deposit 4 percent of a worker's salary, to a maximum of $1,000, into an account that he or she could invest in one of three funds blending stocks and corporate bonds in various proportions. This 4 percent would be separate from the current Social Security tax of 12.4 percent, half paid by workers and half by employers. The $1,000 limit would be indexed to annual wage growth. A government board would oversee the accounts and select investment firms to handle them; fees would be limited to one-quarter of 1 percent, or 25 cents for every $100 invested. 
When a worker retired, he or she would receive an immediate payout of 5 percent of the money in the account. The rest would be spread out over the worker's life to help pay promised Social Security benefits. Mr. Shaw gives an example of a worker who retires at age 62 in 2045, using 2002 dollars. His private-account balance is $149,801. He receives 5 percent, or $7,490, in a lump sum. Under a Social Security-like formula, his account then pays $932 a month into Social Security to offset his monthly benefit of $1,357. If the retiree lives long enough to use up the money in the private account, he will continue to collect full benefits.
If the account's monthly benefits were more than the Social Security payment, the worker would get the higher amount. Workers who died before collecting benefits could leave their accounts to heirs free of taxes. The Shaw plan would also phase out the current earnings penalty on those who retire early and take reduced Social Security benefits. 
Could this bill turn out to be the Great Compromise on Social Security? For the Republicans, it offers a degree of privatization. For the Democrats, it leaves the current system intact. It does not create a system of winners and losers in which old-age security is based on stock-picking skills. Ideologues on each side may object, but it could appeal to the broad center of the political spectrum.
Mr. Shaw thinks that this is a real possibility. "My selling point is that I'm letting Social Security alone," he said. I'm not trying to privatize it. I'm not touching the current system. You have to remember the district I represent. There are a lot of retirees there. I have to be cautious about this."
Does Mr. Shaw have any indication that President Bush, who strongly favors privatization, would support such a compromise?
"The president goes from center to right, and I'm just not sure where he's going to come down on this," he said. "Those at the White House have been very careful not to box themselves in on the issue. But I don't think this would be out of the question for them; it goes in their direction. You don't get everything you want in this life."
Would he continue to fight for his proposal if the White House opposed it?
"Absolutely," he said. "If the far right is driving the agenda, I might find myself at odds with the White House."

A Bet on Textiles, Despite the Doomsayers

BYLINE:  By JANE TANNER 

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C. 

 BODY:
PINCHED by a retail sales slump, low-cost imports and the prospect that import quotas will be lifted at the end of next year, the dwindling number of American textile and clothes makers could easily be written off as another dinosaur industry waiting to die.
 But the domestic textile industry's demise may be exaggerated. Certainly, Asian and Latin American suppliers of clothing have trounced domestic apparel makers in all but a few niches. On the other hand, many American textile makers, with their technologically sophisticated factories, innovative fabrics and robust operations outside of garments, have staying power. 
A few investors are singling out winners from losers and are moving in despite the doom and gloom. Sometimes, investors have offered to buy uncompetitive giants just for their specialty products units. 
Warren E. Buffett, the investor behind Berkshire Hathaway, recently offered to pay $579 million for Burlington Industries, which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Burlington's chief attractions are divisions that make carpets and highly engineered fabric finish that resists stains.
A judge rejected Berkshire's offer, in part because Mr. Buffett had asked to be paid $14 million if the deal fell apart after his bid was accepted. But Berkshire is likely to be among the bidders again when Burlington, based in Greensboro, goes on the block this summer, analysts and others said.
Early last year, Berkshire completed a $2.1 billion purchase of the world's largest residential carpet maker, Shaw Industries of Dalton, Ga. Last spring, Berkshire took over Fruit of the Loom, which was in bankruptcy, for $835 million.
Mr. Buffett is not the only bullish investor. Heartland Industrial Partners, a private equity firm based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and run by David A. Stockman, a budget director in the Reagan administration, put up $225 million a year and a half ago for 44 percent of Springs Industries of Fort Mill, S.C. The founding Close family holds the other 56 percent of the company, which makes bed and bath linens and window dressings under labels like Springmaid and Wamsutta.
Heartland Industrial focuses on undervalued American manufacturers that it considers to be in industries ripe for consolidation. Springs has been buying up weaker rivals for the last 18 months, including the window and bedding division of Burlington. Last week, Springs bought one of the world's largest blanket makers, Charles D. Owen Manufacturing of Swannanoa, N.C., and is expected to pursue Pillowtex of Kannapolis, N.C., whose brands include Cannon and Fieldcrest.
"There are a lot of companies who are not rolling over and playing dead," said A. Blanton Godfrey, dean of the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University.
An industry shakeout peaked in 2001, when 116 American textile plants closed, wiping out 67,000 jobs, about 13 percent of the sector's work force, according to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. In five months starting in November 2001, at least five major companies filed for bankruptcy: -- Burlington; Malden Mills Industries of Lawrence, Mass.; CMI Industries of Columbia, S.C.; Guilford Mills of Greensboro; and Galey & Lord of New York.
Burlington expects to emerge from Chapter 11 protection after it is auctioned off on July 21. Creditors led by G.E. Capital took over Malden Mills in March; the chairman, Aaron M. Feuerstein, said he hoped to raise $92 million to regain control of the company, which makes the Polartec clothes brand. 
CMI is liquidating its woven and elasticized fabrics operations. Guilford Mills jettisoned all apparel plants and emerged last fall as an automotive upholstery maker owned by its senior lenders. Citigroup Venture Capital now owns 47 percent of Galey & Lord, a leading maker of corduroy, denim and other fabrics that continues to operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Skeptics say textile and apparel makers may stagger on until the start of 2005, when international trade agreements are scheduled to eliminate all import quotas, opening the way for even more inexpensive imports. Many say they expect China to swallow the domestic industry whole.
But David Weil, an economist and researcher with the Center for Textile and Apparel Research at Harvard, rejects that conclusion. "So many people are acting like everything that has not yet gone to China will the minute the quota protection comes off," he said. "We continue to find this an implausible reading of what is going on."
The future is more nuanced, Mr. Weil said: Some segments will depart the United States on one-way tickets. Many will rely on a mix of domestic and international sources. And some innovations will play out their initial stages on American soil.
Part of Burlington's appeal, for example, is its 51 percent stake in Nano-Tex, a company in Emeryville, Calif., that has developed a fabric finish that repels water and stains. Burlington sells the process to Eddie Bauer, Lands' End, Levi Strauss and the Gap, among others. Simmons applies the finish to children's bedding.
Burlington expects to take Nano-Tex public before long, said Renee DeLack Hultin, who is in charge of business development at Nano-Tex.
Other so-called smart fabrics are heading for the market. Among them, according to the trade journal Textile News, are car seats to wake up drowsy drivers, bed sheets that monitor health, and cold-weather vests with emergency beacons that trigger if a wearer is suffering from exposure.
Engineered fibers are widely used in products like tires, fiber optic cable and human artery reinforcements. Only a third of textile products made in the United States are for clothing. "The stealth bomber is a textile product," said Mr. Godfrey of North Carolina State. "It's made out of carbon fiber."
American companies lead in the number of fiber patents and earn royalties when they are licensed overseas, said David Brookstein, dean of the School of Textiles and Materials Technology at Philadelphia University.
Yet this area is not immune to what Mr. Weil of Harvard calls "one of the most ancient dangers of this industry": the knockoff. Malden Mills lost steam, he said, after others figured out how to make Polartec-like fleece at lower cost.
Textile executives have been spending an extraordinary amount of time handicapping their options. In addition to businesses that make Jetsons-style products like stain-repellent pants, more conventional operations can also have promise.
Burlington's chairman, George W. Henderson III, and his top executives sorted out the company's businesses along these lines six years ago by plotting them on a color-coded chart: from green for the least sensitive to imports to a red zone designating the most vulnerable. "It helped us decide what businesses we would sell or close and where we would make our investments," he said in an interview at the company's headquarters.
Lees Carpet, the world's largest commercial carpet maker and Burlington's only profitable operation, went into the green zone. Carpet's bulk and weight make shipping expensive, and its production is highly mechanized, eliminating a vulnerability to low-cost labor.
Springs and other makers of draperies, bedspreads and towels also enjoy a measure of protection from imports because of shipping costs and because production is automated.
MR. HENDERSON, meanwhile, put Burlington's spun-yarn operations in a red zone, tantamount to a pink slip. Spinning yarns into cotton fibers and converting them into clothing fabric is labor-intensive. This business is likely to move overseas, following the even more labor-intensive job of sewing fabric into clothes.
United States law has kept some fabric production in the country even as the sewing trade -- the needle, in industry parlance -- has largely moved abroad. But that situation is unlikely to persist, say people who follow the industry.
"As the needle goes overseas," Mr. Brookstein said, "it doesn't make sense to have fabric made in the U.S. to be shipped to China."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the prospects of the American textile industry misstated the financial situation of Malden Mills Industries, based in Lawrence, Mass. It is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, and its owner, Aaron M. Feuerstein, is trying to keep control of the company; it was not taken over in March by creditors led by GE Capital.
The article also referred incorrectly to a Malden Mills product. The company makes Polartec fleece fabric that is made into clothes by other companies; it does not make the clothes.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Sizing UpThe Spark From the Tax Plan

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
FISCAL policy, to borrow a metaphor, is a game of two halves.
 In the first half, President Bush and his cabinet have been trying hard to sell his tax-relief package. The first half will end when some version of his plan, originally envisioned to cost the government $726 billion, makes it to his desk for signing. 
 Then the second half begins, and that half is all about accountability. The White House has made some strong claims about the power of tax relief to create jobs and stimulate the economy. It's everyone else's job to see whether the predictions come true. 
There's just enough information to go on. In February, the Council of Economic Advisers released estimates of the original plan's impact, based on a computer model of the economy. The council predicted that the economy by itself would add 4.1 million jobs from July to the end of next year. With the president's plan, the council estimated, another 1.4 million jobs might be added to payrolls, for a total of 5.5 million.
Since then, the political odds have shifted to favor a smaller plan. President Bush has been pushing for tax cuts worth at least $550 billion. On Friday, the House passed a package of that size, but no one knows what the final plan will include. Nevertheless, the president has said that a plan worth $550 billion will create more than a million jobs.
Reviewing the numbers, it appears that his claim rests on a simple assumption. To scale down $726 billion to $550 billion, you subtract about a quarter of the total. Do the same with the figure of 1.4 million jobs, and you're left with almost 1.1 million -- roughly the president's figure. Thus, if everything goes according to the White House's latest plan, the economy might add about 5.2 million jobs by the end of next year.
Say the White House's package makes it through Congress. Then fast-forward to election time -- November 2004. How will we be able to tell if the plan has fulfilled its promises?
There's no easy way to tell whether a specific job was created as a result of fiscal policy or the underlying trend in the economy. But it won't be too difficult to get some idea of whether this package worked.
The first step is to consider the underlying economic trend. The Council of Economic Advisers assumed that without the White House plan, the economy would grow 2.9 percent in 2003 and 3.6 percent in 2004. With the plan, the council estimated that the economy would expand 3.6 percent this year and 4.8 percent next year.
At election time, say only 4 million jobs -- not the 5.2 million suggested by the White House estimates -- have been created. If the economy had expanded by about 3 percent, the council's own estimates would suggest that the fiscal package had virtually no effect. The onus would fall on the White House to prove otherwise. 
Alternatively, say payrolls have grown by 7 million jobs by November 2004. If the economy had also grown faster than expected, even with the fiscal package, the White House might have a harder time asserting that its policies were responsible for millions of new jobs. More likely, it would contend that its initial forecasts were too conservative.
But what if only 2 million or so new jobs appear? If economic growth had continued to lag behind normal rates -- experts place it at 1 to 2 percent now -- the White House might be able to take a lot of credit. On its own, the economy might not have created any jobs. In fact, several economists have suggested that the fiscal package would be most potent in a slack economy. (If the economy grew by closer to 4 or 5 percent, without creating many jobs, then the council's assumptions about the links between jobs and growth would come into question.)
OF course, many factors besides fiscal policy could lead to changes in employment in the next year and a half.
In February, the council predicted that 131.41 million Americans would be on nonfarm payrolls by the end of the first quarter. Expectations about fiscal policy probably changed little during that period. But as of early April, according to the Labor Department, only 130.35 million people had jobs.
So, employment is starting from a lower base than the council forecast. And Congress looks likely to pare back the White House's fiscal package. Still, the council's estimates offer enough guidelines to make a reasonable assessment of the link between new policy and new jobs.
That assessment would become a lot more reasonable if the council updated its estimates. Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said the council was unlikely to offer new figures.
But if President Bush truly believes in his policies, perhaps he won't mind giving the American public a useful yardstick for grading their effectiveness.

HEADLINE: Give-and-Take F.C.C. Aims to Redraw Media Map 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN a few weeks, the Federal Communications Commission will vote on what could be the most significant change in the rules governing media ownership in a generation, greatly expanding the reach of the nation's largest broadcast and newspaper companies. With that vote, the commission's chairman, Michael K. Powell, may finally find himself back in control.
 Before he became chairman of the five-member commission in 2001, Mr. Powell expressed deep skepticism of many media ownership restrictions, calling them unnecessary impediments in a changing marketplace, and the current review is perhaps the single most important procedure of his tenure. But his ability to execute his agenda came into question three months ago when he lost a commission vote that changed the nation's telephone-rate rules. One of the other Republicans, Kevin J. Martin, voted with the Democrats on some issues, undercutting Mr. Powell. The vote effectively gave policy authority to Mr. Martin, his junior rival. 
 Officials say Mr. Powell learned from that experience and has negotiated intensively with Mr. Martin in recent weeks to reshape Mr. Powell's media-ownership rule plan, which has led to a tentative accord. If it holds, it will give Mr. Powell the bare 3-to-2 majority he needs, although it will also mean that the final plan will be somewhat different from his original. 
All sides agree that if the Powell-Martin coalition holds, the commission will adopt rules that enable the largest media companies to grow -- by entering new markets and taking greater market shares in some cities by owning more stations, as well as newspapers, in the same markets.
But the battle is not over. Some companies, unhappy with elements of the plan, have important allies in Congress and are lobbying to change it. And a campaign has been undertaken by consumer groups, artists, musicians and academics to stop the proposed rules, arguing that further media consolidation is dangerous. They have been led by Michael J. Copps, the senior Democrat on the commission, who has held hearings around the country. The commission's newest member, Jonathan S. Adelstein, a Democrat, has not publicly expressed his views on many of the issues but is widely expected to join Mr. Copps.
The package negotiated largely by the three Republican commissioners -- Mr. Powell, Mr. Martin and Kathleen Q. Abernathy -- will be delivered formally to all commissioners in draft form on Monday and voted upon on June 2. Further modifications are inevitable, but officials say the broad outlines are already clear. 
"We will not be eliminating any of the rules in total," Mr. Powell said in an interview on Thursday. "One or maybe two will likely be retained. Others will be modified." 
To win Mr. Martin's support, for instance, Mr. Powell agreed to allow a company to own both a broadcaster and a newspaper in more concentrated and smaller markets than Mr. Powell had proposed. Mr. Powell also agreed to make less use of a so-called diversity index, a tool his staff had developed to measure whether a city has a diverse-enough range of media outlets to permit further ownership concentration.
If approved, the plan would be a huge victory for the nation's most prominent newspaper and broadcast chains, including Gannett, the Tribune Company and Belo. (The New York Times Company, which owns 19 newspapers, eight television stations and two radio stations, has supported repeal of the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule.)
FOR his part, Mr. Martin has tentatively agreed to a modest increase in the maximum size of the nation's largest broadcasters, as measured by the percentage of the national audience they reach. While Mr. Powell had considered a virtual elimination of the limit, the compromise is to raise it to about 45 percent, from the current 35 percent. 
Critics have called the increase unjustified and dangerous because it would give the networks and media conglomerates even greater control. But officials say Mr. Powell and Mr. Martin concluded that the increase was incremental, considering that two companies, Viacom and the News Corporation, are now hovering at around 40 percent because of their successful court challenge to the current cap. Both Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls Fox, and top executives of Viacom, which owns CBS, have pushed for elimination of the cap so they can make further acquisitions.
Although the rule changes, in their final form, may be more modest than some big media companies had sought -- the networks have already threatened to bring litigation even before they are announced -- the deregulatory trend has some critics deeply concerned.
They say more mergers will diminish the quality of news, including coverage of local events, and will eliminate diverse voices, promote greater uniformity of entertainment and reduce competition over the airwaves.
"There has already been a tremendous amount of consolidation and that has had some severe consequences," Mr. Copps said last week. He noted that fewer cities now had two newspapers and said entertainment was becoming homogenized, artists and musicians were often finding it more difficult to get on the airwaves, and media outlets were increasingly failing to respond to community concerns. "These are changes of terrible importance to the future of the country, and it is hard to see how further deregulation promotes diversity, competition and localism," he said.
But Mr. Powell has his own parade of horribles that he fears may occur if the commission fails to act. He contends that the future of free over-the-air television is in jeopardy because of the growing popularity of cable and satellite TV. He says the economics of the news business are such that consolidation may help combined television-newspaper companies do a better job. Finally, he says that he has little choice because both a federal appeals court and Congress have directed the commission to re-examine the rules, and that further delay serves no one.
"This isn't like wine," he said. "It doesn't get better with age."
In his attempt to avoid a repeat of his failure to win the telephone-rate debate, Mr. Powell says he has reached out to industry and other groups about their concerns. He denies the accusation by some executives who say that in the process, he has engaged in a form of regulatory log-rolling -- bargaining to help them in one set of proceedings to gain their support in another.
In one disputed episode on April 7, a group of broadcast executives met with Mr. Powell at a Las Vegas hotel near the National Association of Broadcasters convention. The executives -- from Post-Newsweek Stations, Scripps Howard Broadcasting, Hearst-Argyle Television, Cox Television and Belo -- had tried unsuccessfully for more than a year to meet with him to discuss a petition they had filed against the networks. The petition accused the networks of imposing anticompetitive conditions.
According to participants in that meeting, Mr. Powell listened to the group's opposition to changing the national ownership cap and then posed what he called a hypothetical question: Would the group support an increase in the ownership cap to 45 percent if the F.C.C. ruled favorably on some aspects of their petition?
Participants and others who were briefed about the meeting said the group, known as the Network Affiliated Stations Alliance, refused to budge, even though top aides to Mr. Powell made more direct bargaining requests to the alliance at other meetings.
Mr. Powell said he never mentioned the idea of a trade of one rule for another. He said he raised the two issues, as he has in other meetings, to see how to relate the concerns of any group as part of broader rule making. 
BUT there is evidence that Mr. Powell's hypothetical, and other comments from his aides to executives, were read differently by at least one company and had an impact on the debate.
According to documents on file with the commission, Mr. Powell and his aides held further meetings that week with senior executives from Belo, which has good ties to the Bush administration and owns The Dallas Morning News, The Providence Journal in Rhode Island, two other daily newspapers and 19 TV stations that reach nearly 14 percent of the nationwide market. After those meetings, the company reversed itself and no longer opposed an increase in the cap.
In an April 16 letter to Mr. Powell, the company's chief executive, Robert W. Decherd, said that it had agreed to an increase in the cap "in return for favorable commission action" on a petition on a different issue now before the commission.
"Mr. Chairman, this position represents something of a departure from Belo's comments previously filed in this proceeding," Mr. Decherd wrote. "But, as stated above, all parties need to make reasonable concessions in support of your effort to complete the rule making."
Both Mr. Powell and Belo executives said that he had never asked them to write the letter and had never pressed the company to change its views. On Thursday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, posed a series of written questions to Mr. Powell about Belo. The Belo letter and the meetings the company had with the commission before the letter was issued also prompted complaints from other companies that have opposed Mr. Powell's proposals.
In a recent letter to Mr. Powell, James F. Goodmon, the president of Capitol Broadcasting, which owns a group of TV and radio stations in the Carolinas, derided what he called a climate of "Let's Make a Deal."
"This ownership review will change what citizens in every community in America receive on their local news, sports, weather and public affairs programs, as well as how they receive it, and it will determine the kind of national network programming that ultimately is available in their homes," Mr. Goodmon wrote in a letter to Mr. Powell. "This debate should not take place with deal making and concessions between a few major media companies and a government agency with appointed, not elected, officials."
Mr. Powell denied that there had been any deal with Belo. "This isn't 'Let's Make a Deal,' he said. "I don't make deals like that."
The original federal limits on broadcast size in the 1930's reflected a desire to avoid the experience in Europe, where totalitarian governments controlled media outlets and stifled diversity and dissent. The predecessors to the current rules were upheld against repeated challenge from the media industry by Supreme Court rulings that deferred to regulators and broadly found restrictions to be in "the public interest." Rejecting the industry's view that it should be regulatedsolely by antitrust principles, the court said the F.C.C. rules were a justified deterrent to "monopolistic domination in the broadcasting field."
The rules evolved over the years. In the early 1940's, the F.C.C. adopted rules prohibiting ownership or control of more than one radio or TV station in the same market. In 1953, limits were placed on the total number of stations a company could own or control in each market. And in 1975, the commission adopted a rule prohibiting a company from owning a station and a newspaper in the same market, though it exempted some companies that already held both. The Supreme Court upheld the new rules three years later.
But the tide began to change in the 1990's, as the nation's largest companies looked to expand. A wave of consolidation began. In the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress both raised the national ownership cap to 35 percent, and in a largely unnoticed but crucial provision, greatly helped the biggest companies by ordering the F.C.C. to conduct comprehensive reviews every two years to justify the rules. 
Then the networks and some sectors of the broadcast industry began to find allies at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In the last two years, the court, in a stream of opinions, has heavily criticized the commission's justification for some rules and either struck them down or ordered the commission to reconsider them.
For decades, the three guiding principles of the cumbersome set of restraints on the size of media conglomerates have been the promotion of diversity of views, competition and local news and commentary. All sides in the current debate -- from Mr. Powell and Mr. Martin to Mr. Copps -- say they agree with the goals but then reach significantly different conclusions about how to achieve them.
Mr. Copps says he cannot understand how further consolidation can promote any of these goals. He and the affiliate stations not owned by the networks fear that by shifting the locus of programming decisions to big corporate headquarters in New York and Los Angeles, small and medium-size cities will suffer.
Mr. Powell and Mr. Martin counter that in the case of the newspaper-broadcast restrictions, the ability of companies to work together and achieve benefits of scale in news presentation will improve the quality of local coverage. They also say that diversity of voices, a difficult thing to measure, is far less a concern in a society where cable and satellite subscribers can now receive hundreds of channels in addition to an unlimited amount of material from the Internet.
Mr. Copps and his allies reply that channels and Web pages are simply pipes, with content supplied by a handful of companies.
THE debate is hardly likely to be settled next month, when the F.C.C. hands down its rules. For one thing, a variety of companies and other interested parties have already vowed to bring a new round of litigation if they lose at the commission. And because Congress now requires the commission to review the new rules every two years, an opportunity to change them will come again in 2005.
By then, Mr. Powell said, "it will be even trickier."
"What are the implications of satellite radio?" he asked. 'What about high-definition-television multicasting? Where will the Internet be?"

HEADLINE: The World; 
No One Is Laughing At Iraq's Exiles Now

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
AS an exiled leader, Chiang Kai-shek finally died after 25 years of waiting for his chance to return to China's mainland to drive out the Communists.
 Yasir Arafat, as an exile from the holy land, rode the tiger of Palestinian terrorism before going mainstream as a political leader, but his return to the West Bank and Gaza has been marked by a decade of miscalculation, corruption and disappointment. 
 Now comes a collection of Iraqi exiles who in varying degrees helped the United States and its coalition overthrow Saddam Hussein. Since the shooting mostly stopped last month, the exiles and their Kurdish allies have landed in Baghdad as if it were Normandy, with the only imperative being to seize and hold a political beachhead.
Before the war, many in Washington dismissed their chances of success. But now, with newly free Iraqis desperate for a restoration of order, the former exiles may yet surprise the doubters. 
The Iraqi National Congress, the onetime umbrella organization for the outside opposition, already boasts 23 offices around the country with a half-dozen in Baghdad. Iraq's northern Kurdish leaders have come south to politic, and are offering to bring their police forces from the free Kurdish zone to secure the streets of Baghdad.
Grass-roots political support is now everything in a country that is about to go democratic, a concept that still takes getting used to. Just last summer, the big worry was that Iraq was about to go nuclear.
So Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, is also sending 100 trucks and 300 workers from Sulaimaniya, his stronghold in the north, to Baghdad to clean the capital. Mr. Talabani has long been the most charismatic Kurdish leader, and last week he was looking more and more like a ward boss dispensing favors.
The Iraqis themselves are watching like spectators in the theater of the surreal, since they have so little control over anything in their lives. They are effectively under martial law, the specter of Saddam Hussein still stalks the land, men with guns are everywhere, crime is rampant, the police are missing, the clockwork of the national economy is frozen and the information highway is closed.
Yet in this pre-ballot-box phase of getting an interim government up and running, Iraqis are also very attentive to the exiles, even as the average man or woman on Saddoun Street exudes a mixture of resentment, awe and admiration for these foreign cousins who helped to foment an anti-Saddam war and brought the American army to the Euphrates.
A typical sneer goes like this: "Everyday we hear about democracy from these people who come from the outside, but we hear nothing about bread." So said Miklif Al-Dulaimi, a Baath Party holdover on the faculty of Baghdad University, last week.
For years, the conventional wisdom in Washington, at least at the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency, has been that exiled leaders like Ahmad Chalabi, the driving force behind the Iraqi National Congress, had no base of support inside Iraq and therefore were not likely to be players in postwar politics.
On the opening night of the war, coalition cruise missiles struck one of Mr. Hussein's compounds -- a roll of the dice to decapitate the government. Had it succeeded, it would have put the Sunni generals and Baath Party potentates of central Iraq in the catbird's seat to surrender the country and offer to manage the transition to a new state. It would have been Saddam Lite, but it had a certain appeal to some Bush administration insiders and military chiefs.
Their view assumed that outsiders like Mr. Chalabi, a secular Shiite whose father was a prominent political figure here in the 1950's, would quickly be eclipsed by Sunni Muslim generals and central Iraqi tribal leaders who would emerge as a new political dynasty.
Some continue to argue that this is the only formula for ruling Iraq: a strong Sunni center that keeps the Shiite Muslim majority under control. This view has yet to be proved wrong, but in these earliest weeks of political organizing, it has also yet to be proved correct. As of now, Mr. Chalabi has as good a chance as anyone to become prime minister of an interim government.
"Mr. Chalabi played a very important role in the liberation of Iraq," Mr. Talabani said last week. "But let us have elections and see who the people will support."
In the early 1990's, the C.I.A. and State Department invested heavily in Mr. Chalabi and his alliance, which included Kurdish chieftains and other exiles. But that marriage foundered as the exiles undertook a decade of sincere but hapless scheming against Mr. Hussein.
So while it may now be counterintuitive, the exiles suddenly are the only game in town. With American help (they still have backers at the Pentagon), they are dominating the early organization of an interim national assembly of 350 or more delegates from around Iraq who will represent big clans, tribes, professional organizations and religious communities.
If the Iraqis feel as if the outsiders are hijacking politics, they are not complaining loudly, and some clearly feel that the exiles, who struggled against Mr. Hussein from the outside and convinced much of the world that something had to be done about his brutal rule, deserve some gratitude.
The free-for-all politics that has taken hold in Iraq thus far suggests that the Iraqis are not so quick to judge. As Mr. Chalabi says, the "mythical" indigenous leader has yet to arise to challenge the upstarts from outside. And the outsiders are trying to pull in locals as new members.
Still, the first rule of politics should be: don't get cocky. A schoolteacher took over the city administration of Umm Qasr. Shiite sheiks who stuck out the Hussein years in Iraq have been becoming selfless mayors even as another exile, a Shiite cleric named Ayatollah Muhammad Baqr al-Hakim, was preparing for his own return from Iran. A university professor is toppling the Baath Party overseers of Baghdad University and thinking about moving into politics next. Plenty of clever Iraqis will rush into politics when given the chance.
W HEN exiles return, everything depends on how locals view the interlopers. An example is what happened in Lithuania and Latvia, which chose returnees -- from the United States and Canada, respectively -- to shake up the post-Soviet nomenklatura.
In general, though, a "return" for exile movements is a difficult political dream to fulfill. Europe is filled with monarchs and potentates pushed aside in the upheavals of the last century. And until a few years ago, some of Chiang's old soldiers on Taiwan were still living in the shacks they built in 1949 when the generalissimo retreated across the Taiwan Strait. Though they remained ever ready to return to the mainland, Taiwan had moved on to become one of Asia's tiger economies, leaving thoughts of war and "return" behind.
Nearly a century ago, Vladimir I. Lenin was luckier. He made that now famous train ride back to St. Petersburg, where he and the Bolsheviks rolled into the power vacuum and the rest is (catastrophic) history. In 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran from Paris to take over a revolution inspired as much by the shah's failings as by Khomeini's exhortations to purge his homeland of the unholy.
Now the "young" shah of Iran, a teenager in 1979, is the exile. He has been circling the airport for so many years that he is no longer so young. Time being what it is, national priorities have changed, and today's younger generation in Iran lights its candles before lesser, or just different, gods.
In Iran, too, they want democracy, but who could rule out that the young shah, like the last Afghan king, might make an appearance in some future national reconciliation?

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: The Koala Effect; 
New York and Wall Street: Binging and Starving Together

BYLINE:  By CHARLES R. MORRIS; Charles R. Morris's books include "Money, Greed, and Risk" (1999), and "The Cost of Good Intentions" (1980), an analysis of New York's 1970's fiscal crisis.

 BODY:
Overspecialized species tend to be the most fragile. Consider the plight of the koala bear, which can feed only on eucalyptus leaves. For decades, pundits have worried that the New York City economy has been dangerously dependent on financial services. When Wall Street has a run of rainy weather, city businesses start to drown.
 Just a few years ago, with a boom in business services, it looked as if the city economy was finally achieving a modicum of healthy diversification. It now appears that was an illusion. As Marcia Van Wagner, an economist at the the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission in New York, points out, growth in business services was driven by the dot.com bubble in lower Manhattan's Silicon Alley. 
 "Silicon Alley turned out to be a Wall Street phenomenon, after all," says Ms. Van Wagner. "It was just the spillover from the tech stock boom instead of a new business sector with a self-sustaining growth dynamic of its own."
The problem with Wall Street money is that it acts more like cocaine than eucalyptus leaves. Ever since New York City emerged as an international financial center in the decades after the Civil War, the ups and downs of city finances have looked like an amplified fever chart of the stock market. No mayor has ever resisted the temptation to let spending rip in the late stages of a market boom. When the market corrects, and revenues crash, the atmosphere is redolent of the cigarette butts and stale beer from last night's wild party.
New York City is now facing one of the most severe financial crises in its history, one that is arguably worse than any except the one in the Depression -- worse even than the devastating financial collapse of the mid-1970's, when the city teetered on the edge of insolvency and actually defaulted on some of its bonds and notes. Proportionally the mid-1970's deficit was a bit bigger than the current one, but back then the city only needed to balance its budgets over a multiyear cycle and had ready resort to temporary borrowing. Now the budget has to be balanced every year, so Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has to make all the cuts in a single swallow.
The crisis is so deep in part because former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani used almost all the accumulated surpluses from the years of the market boom to keep increasing spending in his last year in office, even in the face of collapsing revenues. 
Over all, during his last term, Mr. Giuliani pushed up educational spending by more than 20 percent, police spending by 18 percent, and accepted large across-the-board wage increases for municipal workers. At the same time, Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature made the problem much worse by eliminating the city's tax on commuter income and mandating pension increases for city workers. The built-in operating deficit facing the new Bloomberg administration was more than $4 billion and the city's coffers were empty.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki perfectly illustrate the cocaine effect of Wall Street. They both built reputations as tight-fisted budget managers, but could not resist the temptation to spend down boom-time surpluses. 
It has been ever thus. It is often forgotten that Mayor John V. Lindsay took office on a platform of fiscal rectitude, and actually balanced the budget in his first term, before letting spending soar with the stock market in the late 1960's. The very first modern Wall Street boom -- the railroad stock craze of the early 1870's -- fed a huge run-up in city spending that came to tears when the market crashed in 1873. 
Fiscal gurus uniformly recommend that the city shake the Wall Street habit, but the dependence on the financial sector has actually been increasing in recent years. The so-called FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate) accounted for about 23 percent of wages in 1990, which most experts regarded as dangerously high. But by 2002, the sector accounted for more than a third of all wage packets.
A strong Wall Street increases income, which drives up income tax revenue. But jobs in financial services also have a powerful spinoff effect, each one generating about 4.5 jobs in other city businesses -- the restaurants, printing services, limousine fleets, shirtmakers and others that feed on the underbelly of a rising market. 
But that process also works in reverse. The bloodletting in financial services over the past year has been savage. Tens of thousands of jobs have been eliminated, with a spinoff effect of two, three or four times that many in the rest of the economy. Since the market peak in 2000, the city's unemployment rate has almost doubled to 9.2 percent today.
There is no obvious reason the city has been so resistant to economic diversification. No one expects a reprise of the 1950's and early 1960's, when New York City was a booming center for small manufacturers.
The large open spaces and convenient truck access required by modern manufacturing plants are too hard to assemble within City limits.
But analysts remain puzzled at the city's failure to compete in industries like biotechnology. Just a few miles away, northern New Jersey is home to one of the greatest concentration of pharmaceutical companies in the world. On the New York side of the river, the city's teaching hospitals represent one of the world's greatest medical research complexes. Yet the biotechnology boom has passed New York by, concentrating instead in areas like Cambridge, Mass., and Palo Alto, Calif.
Maybe it is the taxes. Some local taxes in New York are already among the highest in the country, and the budget deal hammered out by state officials and Mayor Bloomberg over the past week -- which is still under veto threat by the governor -- will push them higher. Last year, real estate taxes jumped by a jolting 18.5 percent, on average, and residents and workers are facing a mixture of new taxes on sales and income and a string of fee increases on everything from parking tickets to zoo admissions.
Karl Marx famously said that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce.
But one laughs at a farce. For almost a century and a half, it might be argued, the boom and bust lockstep of Wall Street and the city's finances has generated only one tragedy after the other.

HEADLINE: Bush's Drive for Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
Two weeks into the Congressional debate on taxes, and with at least two more weeks to go, it is clear that Congress will eventually approve a big tax cut, smaller than the $726 billion, 10-year reduction President Bush proposed but still the third largest in history, on top of the largest, enacted just two years ago this month.
 The linchpin of the president's plan, the elimination of taxes on most stock dividends, will be whittled down considerably, but the president will still be able to claim victory. After all, his philosophy is that lowering taxes is the best policy whether the economy is strong or weak, whether the budget is showing a surplus or a deficit. 
 And he will have persuaded Congress to adopt that philosophy in the face of the largest budget deficits ever, uncertain costs growing out of the war in Iraq, the fiscal cloud on the horizon from the retirement of the baby boom generation, the nearly unanimous opposition of Democrats and the qualms of moderate Republicans. 
The question is whether he will want to claim victory, and that will depend on what he and his advisers think the state of the economy will be as he begins his re-election campaign. If they think the economy will be weak and the stock market down, they might prefer to blame the Democrats in Congress for a smaller tax cut undercutting the energy the market would have received from the abolition of taxes on dividends.
But a Republican lobbyist close to the White House said he had no doubt the president would take a victory lap.
"His strategy is always to shoot way up here," the lobbyist said, holding his right hand as high as he could reach with his palm parallel to the ground.
"That way he can count on hitting here," he said, his flat palm at eye level.
"When this bill is finally done," the lobbyist said, his palm still in front of his face, "he will have hit here."
This is how matters stand now: The House approved its version of the tax cut on Friday. The Senate plans to vote on its version next week, probably on Thursday, after the Finance Committee's approval of a measure this week. The House bill would cost $550 billion in revenue; the Senate measure, $350 billion.
The final bill will be written in a House-Senate conference committee by Republican leaders and representatives of the president -- possibly the week before Memorial Day, but later if all the snags take longer to untangle.
Republican leaders in the House say they will be pressing in conference for the full $550 billion or as close to that as they can get. But to get a budget through the Senate last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who will be chairman of the conference committee, promised that he would not bring a bill before the Senate with a price tag higher than $350 billion. Mr. Grassley is known as a man of his word.
But the difference in the 10-year size of the package may not be as great as it appears. That is because lawmakers, including Mr. Grassley, have discovered a budget tool called a sunset.
This is a device in which a popular tax benefit is put into place and then allowed to expire abruptly to save money. The 2001 tax bill, for instance, repeals the estate tax in 2010 and then puts it back on the books in 2011.
This and other sunsets made the 10-year cost of the 2001 bill hundreds of billions of dollars lower than it would otherwise have been.
The proponents, mostly Republicans, know that the pressure will be intense on future Congresses to retain tax breaks about to lapse, and they accuse politicians who want to let the breaks expire of advocating raising taxes.
Under the House bill, the child tax credit would increase to $1,000 per child until 2005, when it would revert to the $700 in the current law. Similarly, the tax break for married couples in the bill and a tax reduction for low-income people would also expire that year.
This week, Mr. Grassley offered a proposal, which he subsequently abandoned for lack of support, that would have eliminated taxes on stock dividends, but then would have reinstated them after three years.
It is a safe bet that the 10-year cost of the bill that emerges from the House-Senate conference committee will be held artificially low because of sunsets.
The policy differences could be harder to resolve in the conference. President Bush and Republicans in the House are determined to get a meaningful reduction in the tax on dividends, and the House conferees will fight for their measure to reduce the tax on capital gains.
But no tax bill can pass the Senate without the support of a few moderate Republicans, because almost all Democrats will vote against it. These Republicans, like Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who forced Mr. Grassley to make his $350 billion pledge, will stand for only so many generous tax breaks that help the wealthy almost exclusively.
Test votes are likely to come next week in the Senate. The bill that came out of the Finance Committee would exclude from taxes each year the first $500 in dividends an investor receives and exclude part of dividends above $500 -- 10 percent through 2007 and 20 percent thereafter.
This is too paltry to affect the economy or the stock market and would be of little help to the wealthy investors in the Republican camp. So Republican senators say they will try to expand the exclusion in amendments on the Senate floor. If they do not succeed next week, it is unlikely they will fare better when the bill comes out of conference.
Some elements of the tax bill are so similar in the various versions that they are almost sure to become law. One is an expansion of the child credit this year that would give families a $400 rebate for each child soon after the bill becomes law.
Others are almost equally sure to fall by the wayside. An example is the provision of the Senate Finance Committee's bill to repeal the law that excludes from income taxes $80,000 a year of the income of Americans working abroad.
But these are not the matters that engage the president and the Congressional leaders who will write the final bill. They want in it every last drop of the president's initial proposal that can win a majority in the Senate, especially a big reduction in the tax on dividends. By the end of next week, the drafting of the final bill will not have begun, but they may have a better idea of how far they can go.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE REGION; 
Hezbollah Seen Making Subtle Changes After War in Iraq

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 10 

 BODY:
With President Saddam Hussein's government a thing of the past, the United States has turned to putting pressure on one of its most persistent foes, Hezbollah, the militant group entrenched in Lebanon. But the organization insists that nothing has changed in its implacable opposition to Israel and its ally, the United States. 
 In an interview on Thursday, a top Hezbollah official, Hajji Hussein al-Khalil, rejected American demands that it cease military operations and leave the area in southern Lebanon bordering Israel. Mr. Khalil, responding to statements here last week by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, said Washington was merely doing Israel's bidding. 
 "I look at Colin Powell as if he is an official spokesman for Israel," said Mr. Khalil, who is the chief aide to Hezbollah's general secretary, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. "Colin Powell is asking Hezbollah to withdraw from the south, and this cannot be applied to us. Hezbollah are the sons of these towns and villages. So where would they withdraw to?" 
The United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization that caused the deaths of hundreds of Americans in the 1980's and carried out a wave of kidnappings of Westerners. It later emerged as a relentless antagonist of Israeli troops in southern Lebanon and took credit for the Israeli departure in May 2000. 
"We have emphasized strongly our concern about continuing terrorist activities of Hezbollah in the region and around the world," Mr. Powell said last week after talks with Syrian and Lebanese leaders. He asked Syria, whose domination of Lebanon gives it ultimate control over Hezbollah, to crack down on the group and called on Lebanon to send its army to the border with Israel to "end armed Hezbollah militia incursions." Lebanon said its troops were close enough.
Mr. Khalil rejected the notion of a new strategic situation in the Middle East with the fall of Mr. Hussein and an Iraq occupied by more than 100,000 American soldiers. "If the United States wants to put military pressure on us, of course we will defend ourselves," he said. "We hope they will not fall into this stupidity." 
Mr. Khalil spoke in the offices of the party's central information office, an apartment in a nondescript building in a rundown area of southern Beirut dominated by Shiite Muslims. Huge portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the current Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, hung from the wall in a waiting room. The Romance lingerie shop incongruously occupied the ground floor, while on the streets outside many women wore head scarves.
Nevertheless, there were some indications that Hezbollah was making subtle adjustments to react to the United States pressure. One sign was the tempering of Hezbollah rhetoric. Hezbollah officials in recent days have said Mr. Powell's remarks were no surprise and stressed that Israel was their only foe. This contrasted with a speech to supporters just before the Iraq war by Sheik Nasrallah, in which he warned the Americans not to expect a warm welcome in Iraq. "The people of this region will receive you with rifles, blood, arms, martyrdom and martyrdom operations," he said. " 'Death to America' was, is and will stay our slogan." 
Sheik Nasrallah kept a low profile after the Iraq war. But in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday night, he said that a disarmed Hezbollah would be "useless," adding, "are we going to resist occupation with words and poems?" 
He also said that after the attacks on New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, the United States sent "messages" offering to remove the group from its terrorist list and provide economic aid. 
"In return, they wanted us to drop out of the struggle and they wanted us to secretly cooperate with them against the so-called terrorist groups," he said. "This was not acceptable to us and still isn't." 
The United States denies any such contact. 
The sheik also said, when asked about support for an Iraqi resistance to American troops, that "our position in principle is to support any oppressed people that is subjected to tyranny and occupation," but he stopped short of offering specific help. 
In recent days, Hezbollah fighters have fired anti-aircraft rounds at Israeli warplanes they say violate Lebanese air space. But few here expect the group to stir up trouble. "Hezbollah is a local institution," said Timur Goksel, the spokesman for the United Nations monitoring force in southern Lebanon. "All those guys have families in those villages. They would be the biggest victims if Hezbollah started something." 
Mr. Goksel credits Hezbollah with keeping the border relatively calm in recent months. He also said that, contrary to Mr. Powell's concerns, the Lebanese military presence in the area is strong enough, with up to 7,000 troops deployed some five miles from the border. Hezbollah, he said, has about a dozen small observation points along the border. 
In the analysis of Mr. Khalil, Hezbollah and Israel did not clash during the Iraq war because Israel feared attacking its enemy and because Hezbollah had no desire to help Saddam Hussein, who had persecuted Shiites in Iraq and whom Mr. Khalil termed a past tool of Washington who was discarded when he became an inconvenience. 
But observers of the situation here suggested other reasons, among them orders from Hezbollah's sponsors, Syria and Iran, to stay quiet. "They just don't want to escalate tensions with the United States," said Tewfik Mishlawi, editor of The Middle East Reporter newsletter. 
Hezbollah has become entrenched in Lebanese society. It has a network of social services financed by donations and the profits from gas stations and other businesses. It appears to have given up the idea of an Islamic state, and says it welcomes coexistence with Lebanon's other religions. "I think Hezbollah has come down to earth," Mr. Goksel said. "There is a strong sense of realism."
While Hezbollah does not discuss military matters, Waddah Sharara, a columnist for the pan-Arab newspaper Al Hayat and a descendant of Shiite clerics, said it has 3,000 regular fighters and up to 12,000 irregulars. Its arsenal includes artillery pieces and thousands of Katyusha rockets. Iran has 300 or 400 Revolutionary Guards in the area, he said. 
In the rugged hills of southern Lebanon, the group has created what amounts to a theme park of anti-Israeli resistance. Pictures of young men "martyred" in attacks on Israelis line the road, like macabre political campaign posters. Images of Shiite clerics abound, including a larger-than-life, double-sided cutout of Ayatollah Khomeini standing on top of a captured Israeli tank. 
The former prison in Khiam, run by Israel's Lebanese proxies during the Israeli occupation, is now a museum run by Hezbollah under government sponsorship where the flame of suffering is tenderly maintained. The 3-by-3 isolation cells, the post on which prisoners were said to be tied during torture sessions, the rusting barbed wire, are all preserved. "The American Administration Is the Mother of International Terrorism" reads a yellow banner put up on a wall last week.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption on May 11 about the resilience of Hezbollah, the militant group based in Lebanon, referred incorrectly to one of many popular public images dotting the country's south and intended as signals of Shiite might. It shows a cutout of a larger-than-life Ayatollah Khomeini standing on top of a tank, but the vehicle is one of those that were left behind when the Southern Lebanon Army, Israel's ally in the region, withdrew; it was not a captured Israeli tank.

PERSON: Russell B. Long 

HEADLINE: Russell B. Long, 84, Senator Who Influenced Tax Laws 

BYLINE:  By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
Russell B. Long, who carried the legacy of his powerful Louisiana family through four decades as a United States senator, died in Washington on Friday. He was 84.
 The cause of death was apparently a heart attack, his family said. 
 The son of Huey P. Long, the legendary populist known as Kingfish who as governor of Louisiana and a senator ran the state's political machinery with almost dictatorial power until he was assassinated in 1935, Russell Long was elected to the Senate in 1948, just days before reaching the constitutional minimum age of 30. 
A Democrat, he exercised great influence as chairman of the Committee on Finance. The Wall Street Journal once called him the fourth branch of government.
President John F. Kennedy, when he proposed a major tax reduction to stimulate the economy, chose Mr. Long, then the Finance Committee's vice chairman, to manage the bill on the floor since the committee's chairman was not enthusiastic about the bill. Mr. Long's success in maneuvering it forward in early 1964 cemented his reputation as a rising leader.
His influence over tax laws lasted to the end of his career, when he helped write a major simplification of income tax laws in 1986. He decided not to run for re-election that year.
His concentration on reshaping the tax code and expanding Social Security was his way of continuing the populist mission of his father, according to Robert Mann, author of "Legacy to Power: Senator Russell Long of Louisiana" (Paragon House, 1992).
"He was his father's son, always concerned about the concentration of wealth in the upper levels of society," Mr. Mann said. "But while his father was a revolutionary politician, Senator Long considered himself, quite accurately, as an evolutionary figure."
When Hubert H. Humphrey was nominated for vice president in 1964, Mr. Long became the Democratic whip in the Senate, one of the most powerful posts in Congress.
"In the heyday of the Southern chairmen, Russell was at the top of the list of big, strong figures representing the South who were national leaders that every president had to deal with," said Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "Nothing could happen without them."
He was also one of the great storytellers, with a family history that provided an anecdote to match any mood. When tempers flared during especially bitter debates on the Finance Committee, Mr. Long would break the mood with a story of the escapades of his father or his equally colorful uncle, the former governor Earl Long. 
He was also a master of political aphorism whose most memorable line, skewering his colleagues when they sought changes in his tax bills, is a perennial favorite in Washington: "Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that man behind the tree."
But that was just one of his many insouciances that still seem timely.
"The distinction between a campaign contribution and a bribe is almost a hairline's difference," he said in 1971.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, in a statement on Friday night said that "it was his kind manner and his quiet charisma that endeared so many people to him."
Russell Long was considered quiet by family standards.
"He was a cleaned-up version of Huey Long," said John Maginnis, publisher of the Louisiana Political Fax Weekly of Baton Rouge. "Russell was seen as the next generation, with the rough edges smoothed out."
In midcareer, though, his reputation as a heavy drinker tarnished that image. One evening at the end of the 1963 Senate session, reporters in the press gallery were startled to see him marched onto the floor, propped up by two other senators, when his presence was needed for a quorum call so that legislative business could proceed. The Senate clerk, just beginning to call the roll in the usual alphabetical order, called Mr. Long's name out of order so that he could record himself as being present before being hustled out of the chamber.
"He hit the bottle pretty hard in the 1950's and 1960's and that cost him a bigger role in the Senate," Mr. Maginnis said.
Still, Mr. Long was a pioneer in establishing employee stock option plans, and he sometimes said that making them commonplace was one of his most important accomplishments. He also championed the earned income tax credit for the working poor.
He was protective of Louisiana industries, like oil and gas producers and shrimp fishermen. His promotion of the state was legendary. To save Fort Polk, an Army base, he stood down first President Kennedy and then President Lyndon B. Johnson, refusing to cooperate on critical legislation unless each in his turn agreed to keep it open.
In the 1960's, opposing what he called "forced integration," he voted against a motion in 1964 that was needed to enact civil rights legislation that southerners were blocking with a filibuster. But he may not have been a segregationist at heart, voting before other southerners to abolish the poll tax.
He said later that he usually voted with the Southern bloc because he knew that to do otherwise would have cost him his seat. The country was better off, he acknowledged later in his career, for having moved ahead on civil rights.
By the 1970's, with the security that comes from seniority, he could vote against the popular opinion in his home state, as he did when he cast a vote to ratify the treaty giving up United States control over the Panama Canal. He said on the floor that while his constituents might disagree with him, the framers of the Constitution would have expected him to vote for the treaty on principle.
Russell Billiu Long was born in Shreveport, La., on Nov. 3, 1918. His mother, Rose McConnell Long, held the Senate seat after her husband's death in 1935.
Mr. Long graduated from Louisiana State University in 1941 and received his law degree there in 1942. He served as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve from 1942 to 1945. He opened a law practice in Baton Rouge in 1946, and was elected to the Senate two years later, filling the vacancy left by the death of John H. Overton.
He was re-elected in 1950 and five more times, the last in 1980.
His first marriage, to Katherine Mae Hattic, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the former Carolyn Bason; two daughters, Rita Katherine Mosely and Pamela Prescott McCardell; a brother, Palmer; and a sister, Rose Long MacFarland.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: ASIAN ARENA; 
U.S. Aides Remain Divided As They Weigh Korea Risks

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
As President Bush enters two weeks of intense diplomacy over disarming North Korea, American and Asian officials say the nature of the threat it poses to the world has changed significantly in recent years -- and with it, so have the bitter arguments over how to prevent a starving, desperate nation from lashing out.
 When South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, arrives in New York on Sunday and Washington later in the week, he will discover an administration that remains divided about North Korea, as it debates what may prove to be one of the biggest strategic changes toward the Communist government since the Korean War ended 50 years ago this summer. 
 Mr. Bush's advisers are engaged in a running argument over whether to continue negotiating with a country that says it is building nuclear weapons, or to organize an international economic blockade meant to leave North Korea's leadership with a stark choice between collapse and dismantling its nuclear programs.
But just as Mr. Bush's senior advisers are divided over the right mix of inducements and penalties, the governments of both South Korea and Japan are increasingly viewing the North Korean problem through their own domestic political prisms, further complicating the task of drafting a unified strategy. 
Mr. Roh -- who has never before visited the United States -- is an untested leader who fears that Washington is headed toward a repeat of its confrontation with Iraq, and was elected on a platform of conciliation with the North that is intended to keep South Korea from being caught in the cross-fire, quite literally.
His visit will be followed the next week with one to Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, whose own efforts at reconciliation with North Korea ended badly last year, and whose government is now talking publicly, for the first time in two generations, about expanding its definition of self-defense to embrace active containment of North Korea.
After decades of worrying primarily about how to protect South Korea from a military strike from the North, Washington now believes that if the North Korean leadership lashes out, its wrath could be directed first at Japan -- and at the American forces based there.
American officials and Korea experts point to evidence that North Korea is investing heavily in medium- and long-range missiles that would be able to reach Tokyo and other major Japanese cities -- and eventually even the West Coast of the United States.
There is growing fear here that the new North Korean threat may also include the sale of nuclear material to terrorists or states like Iran and Syria -- longtime buyers of North Korean missiles and other weapons.
"You've got two sets of challenges here," said one senior administration official who has been deeply involved in the Korea debate. "One is the challenge of maintaining a common front" with South Korea and Japan, he said, "given that people list the priorities in the different order: deterring war on the peninsula, preventing nuclear transfer to terrorists and preventing missile development."
The second challenge, he said, is "coming up with the right mixture of a willingness to negotiate with a willingness to confront."
The missiles that are of concern to Japan, American and Japanese officials say, have a political purpose far beyond their military capacity. They are increasingly viewed as a calculated effort to intimidate Japan and strike fear into its population to drive a wedge between Tokyo and Washington. One former Japanese intelligence official compared the North Korean strategy to the Soviet deployment two decades ago of SS-20 medium-range missiles able to reach Western Europe in an effort to pull NATO allies away from the United States, a comparison echoed within the Bush administration.
The North Koreans know that "Japan has the potential to be a large logistics base for anything coming against them," said one American intelligence official. "From a military planning perspective, it's a rational decision to want to be able to deter or influence Japanese willingness to support a conflict, or even to attack U.S. military bases in Japan."
But rather than dividing Japan from the United States, the missiles appear to have had the reverse effect. The combination of the missile threat and North Korea's admission that it kidnapped Japanese citizens for intelligence training has opened a discussion in Japan about whether to join any American effort to strangle North Korea economically, and even to deploy its own version of an American-designed missile defense.
But the biggest challenge for Mr. Bush will be to find common ground with Mr. Roh. The South Korean president took office saying he was shocked to learn that some in the Bush administration had considered a pre-emptive strike against North Korea's nuclear facilities, an option that Bush administration officials have recently played down but not ruled out.
Reflecting the views of his postwar generation, Mr. Roh has promised to continue trade and investment in North Korea in an effort to draw out its isolated leader, Kim Jong Il. The question now is how he will handle an American president who has publicly said he "loathes" Mr. Kim and has vowed never to allow what he considers a rogue state to develop nuclear weapons. 
"Roh Moo Hyun and the president will get along well as people," said Donald Gregg, who served as the C.I.A.'s station chief in South Korea and then as ambassador under President Bush's father. "The problem is, how will they get along when they start talking about North Korea."
The Bush administration came to office deeply divided over how to handle North Korea, and Mr. Bush's first meeting with South Korea's previous president, Kim Dae Jung, was considered a diplomatic disaster, because the administration had not settled on a strategy.
Yet the administration's debate over how to offer North Korea inducements to give up its weapons, and whether to back that up with the threat of economic strangulation, continues. Last Wednesday, Mr. Bush's top advisers met by video teleconference for another inconclusive discussion on whether to enter a second round of negotiations with North Korea and how to handle the back-to-back visits.
The first negotiations, in Beijing last month, ended with North Korean declarations that the country had already turned 8,000 spent nuclear-fuel rods into plutonium -- a boast American intelligence officials discount. But there is satellite evidence suggesting that some small-scale reprocessing may be under way, which puts enormous pressure on Mr. Bush to decide in the next few weeks whether the problem can be solved diplomatically, or may require economic sanctions or military force.
"We think that the president really does have all the options on the table," one senior South Korean official said this week, speaking of Mr. Bush. Mr. Roh's task, he said, would be to persuade Mr. Bush to let the negotiations play out, which the president seems willing to consider.
American officials say they expect that after the meetings with Mr. Roh and Mr. Koizumi of Japan, Mr. Bush will authorize a limited set of talks with North Korea. But those talks may be intended primarily to convince China and allies like South Korea that the North will never give up its nuclear program on reasonable terms, and to win their support. 
Mr. Bush wants to do more than dismantle the nuclear program; he says North Korea must also give up its missile exports and production, something the Clinton administration never tried to negotiate.
North Korea has fielded more than 100 Nodong missiles and has sold that type to Pakistan, which is redesigning it to carry a nuclear warhead, officials say. Iran, which is developing its own nuclear arms program, has also purchased the missile, American officials say.
Although the Nodong can easily reach Japan, it is highly inaccurate, and would be militarily useful only with a biological, chemical or nuclear warhead, according to Pentagon and intelligence officials -- which only increases the potential threat to Japan. The missile is considered an effort at intimidation, playing on the fears of the Japanese public that they would be hit if they sided with the United States in confronting the North.
But "it represents a fundamental miscalculation on the part of the North Koreans," said a senior Defense Department official. "What they have done is almost single-handedly overturned a very deep-seated, third-generation pacifism."
In contrast, the South Korean government is barely concerned about the missile threat. It has declined to take part in the American-led antimissile program because it does not view the Nodong as a serious new threat. For decades, the South Korean capital has been within easy range of thousands of conventional artillery pieces and short-range bombardment rockets that could destroy it in a matter of hours.
"Because that threat looms so large, and that hostage situation looms so large, it really allows the South Korean military and South Korean defense thinkers to not even address the Nodong issue," the senior Defense Department official said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 11 about divisions within the Bush administration over North Korea referred incorrectly to Clinton administration efforts to curb North Korean missile exports and production. Missiles were not covered in the 1994 accord signed with North Korea; the Clinton Administration tried in later years, and failed, to reach a separate agreement on missiles.

 ART HELD HOSTAGE
The Battle Over the Barnes Collection.
By John Anderson.
Illustrated. 237 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.
 The Barnes Collection is a private museum outside Philadelphia established by the industrialist Alfred Barnes in 1925. Barnes was a bellicose visionary who acquired works of modern art to uplift workers in his pharmaceutical factories, giving them art appreciation classes and building a collection now valued at more than $6 billion, which includes some 180 Renoirs, 69 Cezannes, 60 Matisses, 44 Picassos and thousands of other works by similar artists. It may well be the most important collection in the world of such material. The Barnes Collection was not originally open to the general public; one could visit only by invitation, and such invitations were not always forthcoming. As John Anderson's "Art Held Hostage" makes clear, the place is the brilliant creation of a roughshod eccentric who ruled his dominion with equal measures of snobbery and democratic ideals.
Barnes always had an interest in African-American culture, and what, by the standards of his time, seemed an extraordinary number of black friends. When he died in 1951, he left an indenture with specific instructions about how his collection was to be handled -- giving the power to make new board appointments to Lincoln University, the oldest black college in America. 
Immediately after Barnes's death, Lincoln had no say. Barnes's widow, his assistant (Violette de Mazia, who may have been his mistress as well) and a coterie of friends with life terms on the Barnes board ran the operation. They did so in a secretive and autocratic fashion; opening the collection by appointment only and refusing to lend any of its contents to any other institution or to allow anyone to publish color reproductions of the work. Lincoln made its first board appointment in 1967, when one of the life trustees died, but it was not until 1989, when Barnes's assistant died, that Lincoln took effective ownership of the collection. And then the trouble began. 
In 1951, the endowment of the Barnes Foundation was $9 million, equivalent to about $62 million today. Corruption, bungling, greed and changing financial standards have depleted it; now, there is no endowment left. "Art Held Hostage" -- a morality play masquerading as a legal thriller -- tells us what went wrong. Part of the problem was Barnes's indenture, which mandated investment only in government securities; its terms were responsible for the endowment's contraction by about 80 percent (in inflation-adjusted terms). But the total depletion of the museum's coffers owes much to the interplay of racial, local and personal politics. 
Telling the story presents an acutely uncomfortable predicament: because much of the trouble came from African-Americans associated with Lincoln, the narrative tends to sound racist. Anderson, a contributing editor for The American Lawyer, makes an unrepentant case against those who ran Lincoln University and the Barnes Foundation, whom he depicts as generally disagreeable, grandiose and incompetent. His arguments are persuasive, though he sometimes veers rather far; the evidence he mounts is not always horrifying enough to back up his tone of voice; and some of this reads as overprotested character assassination. 
The two primary figures here are Niara Sudarkasa, president of Lincoln University from 1986 to 1998 and for a time a Barnes board member, and Richard Glanton, a member of the Lincoln board and president of the Barnes board from 1990 to 1998. Sudarkasa is presented by Anderson as weak, acquisitive and commanding, and Glanton as blunt, dissimulating, profligate and charismatic. Sudarkasa was constantly in trouble, fighting accusations of misappropriating Lincoln funds to completely renovate the university president's house and buy herself a fancy car, and of allowing her husband, the university's plant manager, to award work contracts virtually unsupervised. Eventually the Internal Revenue Service conducted an extensive audit of her.
But Glanton, a lawyer in a prestigious Philadelphia firm, is the villain of the piece. In Anderson's account, Glanton swept onto the Barnes board like Genghis Khan, throwing out the established procedures of the institution and setting up a new order that served his interests entirely. Some of what he did was overt: in 1995, for example, he was accused of running up personal expenses on the Barnes account of "almost $57,000." Other activities were not so open. He fired the long-term security provider for the Barnes and hired another, without telling his board, allowing his enemies to accuse him of doing it to strengthen his hand in local politics. He chose a lawyer for one of the Barnes's legal actions (to the tune of $448,127.01) who would later become one of his major supporters at his law firm. He regularly acted without board approval and failed to heed the letter of Alfred Barnes's indenture. When asked, later on, about his methods, he said, "I was the Barnes Foundation."
To counter arguments, Glanton played the race card. When he had transferred bank funds without board approval and was challenged in writing by a board member, he wrote back, "This acknowledges your memorandum objecting to the Foundation's funds being deposited in the United Bank, the only African-American bank in Philadelphia." When opposition to the diversion of money from the Barnes to Lincoln University mounted, Glanton replied, "They are saying black institutions shouldn't be allowed to benefit from relationships which exist." When a board member questioned the financing of a newsletter, Glanton accused him of "acting in a racist manner." 
He pushed the tactic to its limit in a fight over a parking lot for the Barnes Collection. Glanton wanted to make the Barnes a more profitable institution, which meant he had to accommodate more visitors' cars. Neighbors in the residential suburb where the Barnes is located did not relish having their roads crowded, and invoked a zoning ordinance to block the construction of the parking lot. In turn, Glanton slapped them with a lawsuit under the Ku Klux Klan Act, claiming that the whole dispute erupted because the Barnes board was predominately black and the museum was associated with Lincoln -- a claim, the court found, that was clearly without basis. 
The enormously expensive legal actions Glanton initiated are dizzying. Between 1990 and 1995, the Barnes spent more than $2 million in legal fees. From 1993 to 1995, Glanton took the Barnes Collection on tour, under a legal exception to Barnes's indenture that he had won after much litigation. The tour was highly profitable; it earned Glanton accolades and helped defray the costs of an expensive renovation of the Barnes buildings. But Glanton got into political games with the tour's host cities, and the foundation ended up being sued by the city of Rome, which claimed that Glanton made an oral contract with its representative to bring the Barnes Collection to the Museo Capitolino and at the last moment, without prior notice, sent the work to Munich instead. Although Rome lost its case, little Glanton did seems to have been free of ugly wrangling.
Much of the story hinges on Glanton's relationship with Sudarkasa. With her support, Glanton could just about keep running the show; there were five Barnes trustees, and one other vote could carry the day. Glanton kept bailing out Sudarkasa as she sank into a mess of her own devising at Lincoln; in return, she conceded on many crucial points at the Barnes. But ultimately even she became fed up with his shenanigans, and when she stopped supporting him, he turned on her with a vindictive fury. The denouement was that they both fell from grace. "Art Held Hostage" leaves them roiling in their final obscurity, while the new leaders of the Barnes, Anderson writes, turn to white-dominated foundations to save them.
Sadly, this whole story, though enticingly intricate, is ultimately rather boring. The idea of human pettiness may be shattering, but the details of pettiness are dull at best. The book presents a litany of he-said-she-said arguments and catalogs of depositions and board minutes. Though he is an adequate writer, Anderson seems to have bogged himself down in the mundane and melodramatic, and doesn't have the perspective to treat his tale as poignant allegory. For what did Glanton cause chaos, strife and insolvency? "Richard," Sudarkasa says, "wanted to walk with the big boys." Another trustee explains: "The bottom line was all ego. He loved the spotlight." Glanton clearly had no interest in art and very little knowledge about it. What drew him was the prestige and power he associated with the Barnes. To act in this desperate way out of a lust for power over paintings, even some great paintings, seems ludicrous and sad. This is a bonfire of second-rate vanities, which reads best as a portrait of a man pathetic not only for his aspirations, but also because he is clearly smart enough to have done something better.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A review in the Book Review last Sunday about "Art Held Hostage: The Battle Over the Barnes Collection" misstated the given name of the industrialist who assembled the collection. He was Albert Barnes, not Alfred. 
An article on Dec. 14 about a judge's decision to let the Barnes Foundation move its art holdings from Merion, Pa., to Philadelphia misstated the number of works by Renoir, Cezanne and Picasso in the collection. (Several articles since 1991 have also variously misstated those figures as well as the number of works by Matisse.) There are 181 Renoirs, not 170; 69 Cezannes, not 55; and 46 Picassos, not 20. There are 59 Matisses, not 60. An e-mail message from a reader last week pointed out the errors.

HEADLINE: No Laughing Matter for Networks: A Dearth of Successful Sitcoms 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
There have been three great comedy droughts in the history of network television, and this is one of them.
 For the fourth year in a row, when the television season ends this month, there will be only two comedies among the 10 most-watched network shows in prime time: "Friends" on NBC and "Everybody Loves Raymond" on CBS. 
 Only in the late 1950's and the early 1980's have there been such prolonged periods with so few mass-appeal television comedies. Sitcoms and other comedies have otherwise consistently dominated in the prime-time ratings as other fads have come and gone.
"It's the bleakest the landscape has looked since I've been doing this," said Steve Levitan, who began as a staff writer 12 years ago on "Wings" on NBC and is now the executive producer of "Oliver Beene," a new sitcom on Fox. "I just feel like a comedian about to walk out to the world's most unreceptive audience, to a crowd of horrible, heckling drunks." 
It would be easy to blame the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for television's comedic anemia, to say that because of them American viewers, or television writers, or both, lost their humor. But there are forces that have nothing to do with geopolitics, from economic pressures on the networks to the way the 200-channel world seems to have raised standards for impatient viewers.
Is the old-fashioned sitcom dead? Network executives will surely say no this week as they unveil schedules for advertisers in New York during the spring ritual known as the upfronts. As they do every year, they will offer a new set of comedy contenders. 
But a burial plot is being readied for the traditional sitcom -- with the formula of setup, joke, setup, joke -- that families watched together in large numbers throughout most of television's history.
Despite dozens of attempts, the networks have failed to come up with a new hit comedy since the late 1990's. "Everybody Loves Raymond," with an average audience of 18.3 million people, according to Nielsen Media Research, began in 1996. "Friends" with an average audience of 21.7 million, started in 1994. 
The dry spell began in 1999, with the arrival of so-called nonscripted shows like "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and "Survivor." They were not only cheaper than sitcoms and dramatic series but wildly popular as well, especially with viewers under 35, an age group greatly coveted by advertisers. The trend has continued with the latest generation of reality shows, "American Idol" and "The Bachelor," leaving less room for scripted shows in the networks' prime-time schedules. 
This comedic drought is similar to the one beginning in the late 1950's, when shows like "I Love Lucy" and "December Bride" fell in the ratings to westerns like "Have Gun Will Travel" and "Gunsmoke."
Some producers and executives say viewers fled to reality shows out of boredom with traditional sitcoms. "I think it was a direct response to the sameness of programming," said Peter Tolan, a writer and producer on "The Larry Sanders Show," which ran on HBO, and an executive producer of "The Job," which had a brief life on ABC. "People said: 'Boy, this is such an artificial world I'm being shown. If only I could see something real.' "
Heeding complaints about the stale state of the sitcom, the networks have tried to introduce all sorts of contrivances. But many of those shows failed in the ratings despite raves from critics. Fox tried last year with "Greg the Bunny," an adult-theme show about puppets -- actual puppets -- who work as actors in a children's show but live depraved lives off camera.
ABC experimented with "The Job," which starred the trash-talking comedian Denis Leary as a drugging, carousing police officer as antihero. Despite good reviews, neither show had a big enough audience for renewal, at least as far as executives were concerned.
Longtime producers said that the networks, having grown impatient in the more competitive environment of cable and satellite television, insisted on big ratings immediately, something reality shows could supply. The most successful sitcoms, "Seinfeld," which ran for nine years, and "Everybody Loves Raymond," took time to find their audiences. 
"You don't have the luxury of time anymore," said Brad Grey, of Brad Grey Television, which produces "The Sopranos" on HBO and the comedy "Just Shoot Me!" on NBC, among others. "That's a real burden, it's a handicap, and I don't think it begets the greatest creativity."
But viewers, it seems, have become impatient, too. NBC built its comedy dominance through the 1990's with so-called quality shows like "Seinfeld," "Friends" and "Frasier." But audiences stuck around for less compelling (to be polite) sitcoms that followed them. That is less likely to happen now that digital cable and satellite systems have vastly expanded the number of channels for the average household.
This makes the current network comedy drought far different from the previous two. Despite so few hits, there are several new comedies on cable that have won raves from critics and have small but loyal audiences. "Curb Your Enthusiasm," the HBO show about Larry David's life after being a creator of "Seinfeld," is a critical darling, as is "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart" on Comedy Central.
Researchers at Mindshare, a company that buys commercial time for advertisers, among other things, said they saw a new stratification in comedy, determined by age group. The conventional wisdom in television is that young people do not like comedies. But John Spiropoulos, a Mindshare analyst, said his research showed that many of the top shows among "the hip group" -- ages 25 to 34 -- were comedies. 
These include not only "Friends" and "Will & Grace" -- which attract overall audiences each week of 21.7 million and 16.6 million people, respectively -- but also comedies that fetch smaller overall audiences, like "That 70's Show" and "The Simpsons." Those shows do not have similar appeal with people over 50, he said.
"In a broad measure, comedy is dead," Mr. Spiropoulos said. "The real story is demarcated by age."
But that does not explain the continued, cross-generational success of "Friends," with one season left in it, and "Everybody Loves Raymond." The answer here, executives say, is simply that those shows are, in a word, good, and that maybe there are not many other shows now that are good. "All the stars have to line up to have a hit: the chemistry has to be just right, the writing and time slot have to be good," said Phil Rosenthal, an executive producer of "Raymond." 
In 2001, when the comedy drought was only two years old, network executives were quick to remind television critics who raised the issue that television had been here before, in the 1983-84 season. During that horrible year "Kate & Allie" was the only Top 10 comedy, followed by "AfterM*A*S*H*," the failed "M*A*S*H*" sequel, which ranked 15 in the overall Nielsen ratings.
"The Cosby Show" made its debut the next season on NBC and sparked a major sitcom revival. Network executives are still clinging to the hope that the same will happen this time around.
Lloyd Braun, the ABC Entertainment chairman, said his network saw opportunity in the current environment. It plans to add at least four comedies to its fall lineup, possibly including one that stars Kelly Ripa as a fired soap-opera star, and another about a woman and her two gay fathers.
"Everybody likes to laugh," Mr. Braun said. "The problem with the comedies over the last 20 years is so few of them were funny."

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts yesterday about a dearth of successful sitcoms on network television misstated the popularity of "I Love Lucy" in the late 1950's. When production as a weekly series ended in 1957, it was the top-rated show. It was not passed by "Gunsmoke" and "Have Gun Will Travel."

New efforts are beingmade to keep online merchants from collecting personal information from children.

BYLINE:  By Laurie J. Flynn 

 BODY:
After three years' experience with a federal law meant to protect children's privacy online, privacy-rights groups are trying to expand the number and kinds of commercial Web sites that must comply. 
 A dozen of the groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission accusing Amazon.com of soliciting toy reviews from children without making sure their parents had approved their disclosure of personal information. The complaint, filed last month, says that the Toy Store section of Amazon.com, a joint venture with the retailer Toys "R" Us, includes reviews of products that were written by children who indicated they were under age 13 and who provided their names, e-mail addresses and, in some cases, their street addresses. 
 Amazon.com said the personal information made it through its filtering process by mistake and has since been removed. But company executives also say that their site is not aimed at children and so does not come under the privacy law. "We sell products to children that are purchased by adults," said Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman. For privacy groups, the fact that Amazon.com defends itself by saying it does not sell to children is a point that the groups would like the F.T.C. to examine. 
"Amazon has directed the site toward children and so must comply with Coppa," said Chris Hoofnagle, a lawyer for one of the groups, using the acronym for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Mr. Hoofnagle said he thinks many Web sites may be illegally skirting it.
Coppa went into effect in April 2000 and was meant to ensure that no children's Web site allowed children to reveal information about themselves without evidence -- like a confirming e-mail message from a parent -- that an adult had authorized the disclosure. "The standard is not whether a person can purchase but whether the site is directed at children," said Mr. Hoofnagle, who is deputy general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington.
Until now, all the F.T.C.'s settlements related to the law have been with Web sites that were explicitly aimed at children. The F.T.C., for example, recently penalized two retailers, Mrs. Fields' Original Cookies and Hershey Foods, for violating the privacy law by failing to seek parental permission before gathering online information from children visiting the child-oriented sections of the companies' Web sites. And the commission settled similar charges in April 2002 with the Ohio Art Company, maker of Etch A Sketch toys, whose Web site had collected the names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, age and dates of birth from children who wanted to qualify to win an Etch A Sketch toy on their birthdays.
The privacy groups view the complaint against Amazon.com as something of a test case because the portion of the Amazon.com site in question, Toy Store, is not explicitly a children's Web site. Rather, the complaint says, the Toy Store is directed at children because it uses child-like fonts, employs child models and uses child-oriented cartoon characters.
Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert, one the dozen privacy groups signing the complaint, said he hoped the Amazon case would compel the F.T.C. to investigate other online shopping sites that may be similarly violating Coppa.
Perhaps elevating critics' concerns about possible violations of the privacy law is a recent survey indicating that children may not be as careful about protecting their online privacy as they were a few years ago. The study, by the market research company Harris Interactive, found only 37 percent of the respondents age 13 and younger said they worried about giving out personal information on the Web, compared with 54 percent in April 2000. One reason, of course, may be that the sites they are visiting are complying with the privacy law -- and so do not ask them to reveal personal information.
Older children appear to be warier, perhaps because the sites they are visiting do not have to abide by the children's privacy rules. Among teenagers age 13 to 15, more than 60 percent in the survey said they worried about their online privacy, compared with 54 percent three years ago. And only one in five recently said they thought the Web was a safe place for young people -- down from more than a third three years ago.
Furthermore, nearly half of those 13 to 15 said they had met someone online whom they thought was pretending to be someone else.
Congress passed the children's privacy law in 1998 after an F.T.C. survey showed that nearly 80 percent of Web sites collected personal information from children, but only 1 percent asked children to get their parents' permission before sharing such information. 
Since the law took effect, the F.T.C. has settled eight cases, issuing fines as high as $100,000. The F.T.C. also says it is continually issuing warnings to Web sites it suspects are inappropriately collecting data from children. Elizabeth Delaney, a commission spokeswoman, said it recently sent more than 50 warning letters.
It may be some time, if ever, before the commission makes any substantive public comment about the Amazon case. The agency does not reveal publicly when or if it decides to investigate a complaint. 
For the most part, though, Ms. Delaney said the law was working. "Children's Web sites have reduced the kind of information they're asking from children," she said. "The level of compliance has been good."

More Chief Executives Shown the Door, Study Says
Around the world, chief executives were forced to leave their jobs in record numbers in 2002, a study of chief executive turnover by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton shows.
 Nearly 100 of the chief executives of the world's 2,500 largest companies were replaced last year for performance reasons, almost four times the number forced to leave in 1995, the study found. The trend has spread quickly from the United States to Europe and Japan, the study shows. Page C2. 

Airport Devices Scan for Fevers
Authorities in Singapore have adapted devices originally developed for a military purpose -- seeing enemies in the dark -- to help combat the spread of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The infrared fever sensing system detects passengers' body temperatures, spotting those with the fever associated with SARS without having to touch them or even make them stop walking. C4.

American executives are finding that teleconferencing is sometimes the only way to get things done, with SARS in places like China, Singapore and Taiwan making actual visits inadvisable. C4.

Behind the Noisy Clashes, 2 Chambers That Don't Understand Each Other

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Forget Republicans and Democrats. The lawmakers who seem least to understand each other are senators and representatives -- no matter the party.
Senators feel maligned and misunderstood by House members who do not grasp the complexities of the upper chamber. "They never really understand until some of them come over here and become good senators," said Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska. 
 On the other side of the Capitol Rotunda, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois complained the other day that he was tired of trying to fit the House to the Senate. 
 Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, said he realized the Senate was not going away, though he sounded as if he wished it would.
Even with one-party control, the vast differences in the way the House and the Senate operate make policy blowups inevitable. Throughout history, the House and the Senate have clashed. But lately those clashes have been frequent -- and loud.
The House is insisting on oil drilling in Alaska; the Senate has rejected the idea. The Senate blocked a Bush administration proposal to give public money to religious groups, compelling the House to go along. The House is ready to advance a Medicare overhaul; the Senate is taking it slower. And the latest dispute was on Friday. House Republicans pushed through a tax-cut package substantially at odds in size and content with the measure emerging in the Senate, setting up a nasty negotiation to reconcile the two.
"We expedite, they obstruct," a top House Republican aide said.
While differences in policy goals certainly exist, the problem can often be found in the very nature of the institutions. House rules severely restrain the power of the opposition, giving Mr. Hastert and Mr. DeLay iron-fisted control so they can -- and do -- rapidly ram through almost anything they want.
In the Senate, every member wields tremendous power through the ability to put blind "holds" on legislation, raise procedural obstacles on the floor and generally gum things up. That makes the Senate a place where the majority does not always rule.
The House leadership uses a Rules Committee to limit debate; the Senate routinely engages in interminable debates without limits.
"It is an entirely different legislative body from the House, literally," said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia and a recent arrival from the House who is still adjusting to the style of business.
The differences are as old as the Constitution. But even the new Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, seemed taken aback by the House response after he made a side deal to pass a budget recently. Given that two Republicans were threatening to bolt from his 51-49 majority, Dr. Frist felt that he did not have much choice. But House leaders were outraged.
"Bill Frist is learning what it is to be the leader of a majority with 51 votes," said the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, who has ample experience in this area. "You have to earn that majority every day with every bill and every amendment and every vote. That learning process can be excruciating."
The power of the individual in the Senate was on vivid display again last week as Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, single-handedly forced the Finance Committee to compromise on a tax-cutting plan that raised some taxes to pay for tax cuts elsewhere. That idea did not go down well in the House.
"I think the Capitol Police better check to see if someone's slipped something into the water over there," said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, adding that the Senate tax-writers were "not acting like Republicans."
Indeed. They were acting like senators.
"It is frustrating to them that we can't always perform as the House Republicans do," said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, a former House member. "I understand that frustration. But it is the nature of the Senate."
The framers of the Constitution envisioned the Senate as a legislative bulwark against the more populist House, and Washington famously and perhaps apocryphally described it to Jefferson as the saucer to "cool" the passions of the House members.
To Al Swift, a lobbyist and former Democratic representative from Washington who often poked fun at the stodginess of the Senate, that formulation was a huge mistake. "I think you can make an awfully good argument that the Senate is the least democratic democratic institution on the face of the earth," Mr. Swift said. "You are able to prevent the majority from working its will well beyond anything that should be allowed."
In the early years of the nation, the House was where the action was, with the Senate a sleepy chamber caught up in confirmations. The Senate historian Richard A. Baker said that balance of power changed with the rising emphasis on slavery issues in the 19th century. With the Senate split between slave states and free states, politicians quickly realized that one lawmaker in the Senate could wield significant power.
"That is where the political talent of the nation went, where a single member could make a difference if only to stand up and say no," Mr. Baker said.
Tension between the House and the Senate even when both are controlled by the same party is hardly new. Some House Republicans are still angry at the Senate for what they contend was a perfunctory trial of the impeachment case against President Bill Clinton in 1999 and for slighting the Republican "Contract with America" in 1995. House Democrats said they were left holding the bag in 1993 when they passed a new energy tax as part of Mr. Clinton's economic plan only to see it jettisoned by Senate Democrats.
Because Senators represent entire states, they often are less ideological and unyielding than House members, who are often elected from safe partisan districts and can afford to be less willing to compromise.
Things could well get worse before they get better in the current Congress, with coming negotiations over the tax bill, drug coverage under Medicare, energy policy and the usual list of spending measures.
But not everyone is complaining. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he was quickly discovering the joys of the Senate after his days as one of 435 members of the House.
"I like it over here," Mr. Graham said. "One person or a couple of people really do matter."

HEADLINE: An Empty Energy Bill 

 BODY:
The Senate is showing no more enlightenment on the subject of energy than the House. Except for a few modest incentives for energy efficiency, a bill now awaiting action on the Senate floor would do next to nothing to ease America's dependence on foreign oil. Apart from making an expensive and chancy bet on nuclear power, it would do next to nothing to address the problem of global warming. All in all, this bill represents a serious failure of Congressional leadership, aided and abetted by an administration that had asked for little in the way of imaginative ideas and is getting even less. 
 The energy bill is in fact two measures, a subsidy bill and a tax relief bill, which will be joined on the Senate floor and can thus be treated as one. Like a House version approved last month, the bill is essentially a compendium of tired ideas favoring the coal, oil and and gas industries, including one or two ideas the House hadn't thought of -- notably a provision that would authorize oil and gas exploration in coastal waters that have been faithfully protected since the first Bush administration. 
 The biggest addition to this dreary lineup is a huge $30 billion subsidy for nuclear power, a favorite of the new chairman of the Senate energy committee, Pete Domenici of New Mexico. For many reasons, not least the fact that nuclear energy is economically uncompetitive with most other forms of power, the nuclear industry has not licensed and built a new plant for nearly 30 years. Mr. Domenici seeks to jump-start a new generation of plants with federal guarantees that even his pro-nuclear allies regard as excessively generous.
On the plus side, the bill provides $7.2 billion in various tax incentives for energy efficiency, for renewable fuels like wind and solar power and for research into President Bush's proposed hydrogen-powered fuel-cell car. But these are baby steps, which will do little to diversify the nation's energy base and are dwarfed by the bill's failure to require improvements in automobile fuel economy -- the quickest and surest way to ease America's dependence on foreign oil.
This failure is all the more glaring in view of a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency showing that the average fuel economy of the nation's cars and trucks dropped in 2002 to its lowest level in 22 years, largely because of increasing sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans. The automakers continue to argue that consumers want the bigger vehicles, and that the companies' economic survival depends on them. But it seems to us that neither the American manufacturers nor, for that matter, the Japanese are making much of an effort to market more efficient vehicles. The engineering leaps of the last two decades have produced much in the way of power and acceleration, little in terms of better mileage.
Various senators will try to improve this bill on the floor. John McCain and Joseph Lieberman will offer their bold plan to limit emissions of global warming gases and to establish a market-based system for helping industry reduce these emissions at the lowest possible cost. Max Baucus will try to protect parts of the Northern Rockies from the administration's headlong efforts to open up fragile wilderness to oil and gas exploration. James Jeffords will push for much more investment in renewable energy sources. One can only wish them well. Without significant change, this bill is not worth passing.

HEADLINE: Amid Standoff In Legislature, Toxic Dumps Remain Dirty 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
The Rev. Darius Pridgen leads a 3,000-member church in Buffalo that sits across the street from one of the state's most toxic lead dumps. He has prayed for the cleanup of the dump, preached about it, and formed a social action ministry devoted solely to that purpose.
 But the pastor's efforts have been thwarted by something outside his spiritual realm: Albany politics. 
 The Buffalo dump, which is fenced off and posted with warning signs, is one of 800 abandoned industrial sites across New York that are languishing because Albany's political leaders allowed the state Superfund program to run out of money in March 2001. In New York City alone, there are 102 of these highly polluted sites, including 30 in Manhattan and 25 each in Brooklyn and Queens. 
"This is not just about my church," said Mr. Pridgen, who can look out his window at the one-acre dump known only as 858 East Ferry Street. "This is about a community that deserves to live safely in a poor neighborhood that business has turned its back on, that the state has closed its eyes to."
Last week, the State Legislature passed a $92.8 billion budget that once again left out money for new Superfund projects, though it included $28 million to cover salaries and administrative costs for the program. (Gov. George E. Pataki has vowed to veto the Legislature's budget for unrelated reasons, calling it a fiscally irresponsible "train wreck" that spends money the state does not have.)
Hardly anyone was surprised by the omission. While Governor Pataki and state legislators have repeatedly pledged to replenish the Superfund program, they have failed for more than two years to do so. A political standoff over how to clean these industrial sites, and less polluted ones known as brownfields, has brought much of the program to a standstill.
It is a textbook case of Albany dysfunction, many environmentalists and lobbyists say, because two separate issues -- Superfund money and cleanup standards -- have become so inextricably linked that neither one can be resolved without the other. 
The deal-breaker every time has been a division over just how clean is clean enough. As a way to encourage more development, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and the Republican-controlled Senate have advocated less stringent cleanup standards for sites that are to be used for commercial and industrial projects, rather than residential development. Democratic Assembly leaders, however, have pushed for rigorous and costly cleanups of all sites.
But this year, Assembly and Senate leaders have signaled that they are moving closer to a postbudget agreement that would provide at least $90 million a year for the Superfund program, partly by imposing new fees, which had been proposed by the governor, on companies that produce hazardous wastes. 
In separate bills, each chamber has also outlined new cleanup standards for brownfield projects, which under state law do not have to be cleaned up. Although the Assembly's bill has not come up for a vote, the Senate has passed its version.
"We've made progress, and we're moving ahead," said Senator Carl L. Marcellino of Long Island, the chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee. 
Aides to Governor Pataki also said that he remained committed to refinancing the Superfund program, and wanted to reach an agreement as soon as possible with the Legislature so that the toxic waste sites could be cleaned up.
The state Superfund program, which was created in 1979, is one of the oldest in the nation and came about largely as a result of the public outcry over toxic chemicals buried at Love Canal in Niagara Falls. The New York program served as a model for toxic waste cleanup programs financed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and by other states.
In 1986, the Legislature authorized a series of bond sales that raised more than $1.1 billion for the program. That money, which is still being repaid through industry fees and state revenues, has been supplemented with $3.24 billion in payments from private polluters and $632 million in federal money.
New York's program has provided money for cleaning a total of 972 toxic waste sites, and work has been completed at 430 of them, according to the State Department of Environmental Conservation. At the same time, an additional 800 sites have been identified as potential problems.
State environmental officials say the Superfund program is crucial because it pays for the cleanup of "orphan sites," places where the polluter has long ago disappeared or refused to take responsibility. In many cases, the state goes ahead with the cleanup and later sues the polluters, if they can be found, to recover its costs. 
The state environmental conservation commissioner, Erin M. Crotty, said that replenishing the depleted Superfund program was "the biggest environmental issue that the Legislature needs to act on this year."
"These sites continue to pose a threat to public health and the environment," she said. "Without the resources to clean them up, they will continue to pose that threat."
Governor Pataki and Senate Republicans want to set aside a total of $138 million annually for environmental cleanup programs, with $90 million going to Superfund sites and $15 million to brownfields. The money would come partly from state revenues, and partly from increasing industry fees. 
Assembly Democrats, while adopting essentially the same revenue sources, would use the money to back bonds to raise an estimated $200 million for the Superfund.
Even with the recent compromises between the Senate and the Assembly, replenishing the Superfund program still faces obstacles. The Business Council of New York State and other business groups have been lobbying against the bills. Ken Pokalsky, the council's director of environmental programs, said businesses already pay some of the highest fees in the nation for hazardous waste cleanups. 
"Maybe this is a convenient way to raise money, but we think it's illogical and harmful to the state economy," he said.
Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples, a Democrat from Buffalo, has grown so tired of waiting for Superfund money that she plans to introduce legislation this week to remove the lead dump on East Ferry Street from the state Superfund list so she can pursue other ways of paying for the cleanup. She envisions the site transformed into a lighted parking lot, with potted flowers. 
"We can't just continue to let it sit there," she said in a telephone interview. "We need to protect the health of the community, and put it in the kind of condition that it can be developed."
A lead smelting operation once stood next to the overgrown dump, opposite Mr. Pridgen's white cinder-block church. A 400-student charter school operates in the churchcomplex, and a public housing project is a block away. 
Every so often, Mr. Pridgen crosses the street to trim the grass and the weeds that sprout along the chain-link fence at the abandoned lot. He keeps a gas mask at the church just for that purpose, donning it over his ministerial robes.
"We don't care how this gets cleaned up," he said. "Whether it's through the Superfund program, or whether Governor Pataki comes with a shovel and a pail and does it himself."

HEADLINE: 'Huge Black Eye' 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Just about everyone at this newspaper is sick at heart at the way one Times reporter betrayed our readers and all of us with his sustained deceit and plagiarism. 
 The Times team investigating the lies of Jayson Blair -- grimly front-paged and spread over four inside pages of yesterday's paper -- found his phony interviews and faked articles "a low point in the 152-year history of the newspaper." The publisher called it "a huge black eye." 
 How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues. 
Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity. 
The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the "terrible mistake" be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators. 
What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers? 
Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But nowmy right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for "the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.")
First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.
Then to the affirmative-action angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired? Oh, we know your editors insist that "diversity" had nothing to do with it. But remember what Senator Dale Bumpers said about our impeachment of Clinton: "When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex' -- it's about sex." This is about diversity backfiring. 
Here's my reply to their Kulturkampf: For exactly 30 years, I have been supported handsomely for disagreeing with The Times's editorial page, which is dovish on defense, leftist on economics and (with the exception of civil liberties) resolutely wrongheaded. Never have I been silenced, and conservative thinkers have an ever-fairer shake on the Op-Ed page. 
As for news coverage being influenced by editorial policy, I evoke the name of my predecessor: that's a Krock. On occasion, a leftist slant on a story slips through the backfield, but with conservatives boring from within and fulminating from without, the news side soon straightens itself out. What is "fit to print" is the truth as straight as we can tell it, which is why Times people are so furious at this galling breach.
Now about the supposed cost of diversity: A newspaper is free to come down on the side of giving black journalists a break if its owners and editors so choose. What's more, this media world would also benefit from more Hispanics and Asians coming up faster. 
To the 375 Times reporters who make up the greatest assemblage of talent and enterprise in the field of gathering and writing the news, I submit this hard line:
Self-examination is healthy but self-absorption is not; self-correction is a winner but self-flagellation is a sure loser. Let us slap a metaphoric cold steak over our huge black eye and learn from this dismaying example -- so that other journalists in the nation and around the world can continue to learn from ours.

HEADLINE: From China Sea to U.S. Campus, Quarantined 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: NORTHFIELD, Minn., May 9 

 BODY:
It had the makings of a reality television show: "Real World" meets "Survivor," with a dose of "Fear Factor."
 Five students at a small liberal arts college, yanked from their experiential learning seminar in China, quarantined in a dean's house for three days after their roommate's 101-degree fever made him suspect for SARS. One cable modem. Five cellphones. Groceries delivered daily to the back porch. All the mediocre movies they could watch. 
 "There are times in your life when you say, 'I really want to sit on a couch for eight hours and watch TV,' " said one of the five students, Charlie Carstens, a sophomore from Atlanta who is majoring in economics here at Carleton College. 
"But when someone tells you to do that for 72 hours, it's really not as fun."
The five students have since been set free to roam the Carleton campus, barred only from dormitories, but their friend, who started 10 days of total isolation when his symptoms disappeared, remains sequestered until Wednesday in a college duplex with slow, dial-up Internet access and no cable television.
The formerly quarantined, meanwhile, are subject to strange looks from wary classmates and left to interpret the vague guidelines about acting "prudent." Should they or should they not study in the library, eat in dining halls or have parties at their borrowed house?
The situation at this insular, highly selective school tucked into farmland about 40 miles south of the Twin Cities is emblematic of how American campuses, increasingly internationalized with the influx of foreign students and the proliferation of study-abroad programs, have forged a front line in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome. Across the country, academic administrators have become public health watchdogs, as SARS provides a new test in higher education's perennial struggles with town-gown relations and in loco parentis.
 The University of California at Berkeley on Saturday retreated from the tough policy it announced earlier in the week, saying that 80 of 500 students from SARS-affected areas would be allowed to attend summer classes and that the restrictions might be relaxed further in coming weeks. 
Like Carleton, other colleges have taken steps beyond the guidelines of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflecting the paternalistic approach to governing the tight-knit communities of campuses and a fear of public-relations disasters with panicky surrounding communities. They have disinvited parents of foreign students from commencement ceremonies, rerouted research missions and canceled seminars abroad or, in some cases, asked people leaving SARS zones to simply stay away.
"Different institutions have tailored their response to the particular circumstances they were facing," said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, a Washington-based group that represents the nation's colleges and universities. Mr. Ward likened their leaders to the mayors of small towns under siege, and said, "It's always harder when you are trying to deal with it without an official policy, but I've been impressed with this customized response."
Harvard withdrew money for student and faculty travel to China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, and ordered people who "feel that you must travel to these areas for personal reasons" to notify administrators and get "medical clearance" before "re-entering the Harvard community," according to its Web site.
Kalamazoo College in Michigan canceled its field-based Contemporary China class and hopes to reschedule for December; Mercer University in Macon, Ga., is sending 20 M.B.A. candidates to Paris and Geneva instead of to China and Hong Kong. The student health center at the Georgia Institute of Technology has added protective clothing for doctors and nurses.
At Syracuse University, where a student who fell ill on returning from Toronto was monitored for SARS last month, signs listing symptoms of the disease were posted outside commencement events scheduled for this weekend, and administrators today canceled the fall study program in Hong Kong. At Washington University in St. Louis, Case Western Reserve in Cleveland and the University of Rochester in New York, among others, seniors from SARS-affected countries have been strongly discouraged from having relatives from home witness their tassel-switching.
"Some have told their parents not to come," Kathy Steiner-Lang, director of Washington University's international students' office, said of the approximately 75 graduates affected by the policy. "Some have decided it would be problematic to come because they might be stranded, they might not be able to get back. Some people are coming anyway and going through the screening process."
Here at Carleton, with a small but growing number of international students -- 66 -- among the 1,900 undergraduates and a dozen study-abroad programs, the focus has been on the 35 students enrolled in "Comparative Political Economies," an 11-week seminar in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam. SARS delayed the students' departure for Asia by a week and knocked Hanoi off the itinerary; administrators said Carleton was the last American institution to pull out when the students left early on April 30.
Carleton officials met the plane from Shanghai with digital thermometers for each student, asking them to call in their temperatures twice daily to the campus health center. The college bought round-trip tickets home for those who chose not to return to campus; it provided housing and meals for the rest.
The quarantine began the next morning, when one of the students, who refused to discuss the situation and asked that he not be identified, woke up feverish and was instantly exiled, interrogated by doctors and the police and shunted off to a Minneapolis hospital via ambulance. College officials now say he had a simple cold, not SARS.
"We didn't want to treat these students like prisoners, and they really do feel pretty oppressed," said Mark Govoni, the dean of students, who donated his college-owned, red brick three-bedroom home to the cause, moving with his wife into a nearby motel. "We learned that, short of food and water, it's the Internet that is the next and most essential thing in the world."
Unable to concentrate on their assignments -- they have three short papers due May 14 and 24 -- the five quarantined students stared endlessly at movies. They watched "Gladiator," "Ben-Hur," "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," "The Matrix."
Luke Felkey, a junior from Bozeman, Mont., took the helm in the kitchen, frying up tofu squares with pineapple when supplies dwindled.
Mr. Felkey and Mr. Carstens slept on the sectional sofa in the den rather than return to their room adjacent to the bed where their sick classmate had slept. They experimented with the dean's croquet set in the yard.
"When you're confined to a small space," Mr. Carstens said, "more things become interesting."
Northfield residents, and some Carleton students, wrote outraged letters to newspapers about potentially infected people being allowed back in town. Someone threw eggs at Mr. Govoni's house.
"We were more scared of the townies burning our house down while we were inside than we were of getting SARS," Mr. Carstens said.
The low point, Mr. Felkey said, was watching students flock to the annual spring concert, his favorite campus event, and hearing their faraway cheers from the living room.
The quarantine ended May 4, but the students spent the next week in an odd netherworld, fearful of fever at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. temperature checks, and still suspect on campus. 
 Along with 20 other Carleton students recalled from China, who had spent the 10-day caution period at home or in off-campus apartments, the five students moved back into the dorms yesterday, in time to give Mr. Govoni's daughter, returning home from college, her room back. 
"Can I touch you?" one of the five, Yam Ki Chan, 20, of Skokie, Ill., said when he saw a friend off campus this afternoon at an Indian restaurant.
"I have a cold," the friend warned.
"So I should be more afraid of you than you are of me," Mr. Chan said, laughing.
The student who was feverish remains sequestered, talking to visitors behind two screen doors, toggling between e-mail and phone calls and taking frequent naps. Petra Crosby, the director of international student programs, takes him the newspaper each morning and groceries on demand. The first night, she made a midnight run for cough syrup. "My job description goes from mom to immigration lawyer and anything in between," Ms. Crosby said, "so this is not unusual at all for me."
Roy Grow, the political science professor who developed the China course, said that SARS had given the students an excellent case study but that it had ultimately made their observations and other travel unmanageable. The last week of the seminar is a simulation in which each student adopts a specific Chinese persona and the group debates the next five-year plan.
Just as Chinese businesses and politicians are doing in the days of SARS, the scattered students will have to conduct the exercise via teleconference and the Internet.

HEADLINE: What Drove 2 Britons to Bomb a Club in Tel Aviv? 

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: DERBY, England, May 8 

 BODY:
Something changed Omar Khan Sharif, sent him in a new direction, and Derby's older Pakistani population cannot begin to fathom what it was.
 But the radicalization of the well-educated, thoroughly Westernized Mr. Sharif, 27 -- the forces that led him from Derby to Tel Aviv, where he is wanted on charges of helping to carry out a suicide bombing in a beachfront nightclub on April 30 -- make a certain sense to the younger, second-generation immigrants born and raised here. Mr. Sharif was angry, they say, for reasons that would be all too understandable to Muslims everywhere. 
 "In a way, I sympathize," said Mohammed Zahid, 23, an automobile-plant inspector with a broad Midlands accent, who was strolling down Normanton Road, near where Mr. Sharif lived with his wife and two daughters. "When you see what's happening in Israel, something comes into your mind, something just goes." 
On a fine spring day on a pleasantly bustling street, such an explanation seems partial at best. As Sarfraz Bashir, 31, a college graduate in between computer jobs who was helping out at the Jamia Mosque on Rose Hill Street, put it: "In the U.K., you can have a proper job and a proper education. We have everything here -- why ruin it?"
Along with another Briton, Asif Mohammed Hanif, 21, Mr. Sharif is said to have entered Israel as a tourist, via Jordan, using his British passport. There, the two checked into a hotel, donned explosive belts and made their way to Mike's Place, a jazz club next to the United States Embassy. 
Mr. Hanif's explosives detonated, killing him and three others and injuring at least 50 more, the authorities say; Mr. Sharif's explosives failed to go off and he managed to slip away. He and Mr. Hanif now enjoy the dubious notoriety of being the first British suicide bombers to strike within Israel.
Mr. Sharif's wife, sister and brother are under arrest in London, charged under antiterrorism legislation with failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. 
Publicly, what Mr. Sharif is accused of doing has been roundly condemned here. But scratch beneath the surface in Derby, and people begin to talk about Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel and the oppression of Islam.
"Some people take Islam deeper than others," said a young man on Normanton Road, by way of explaining Mr. Sharif's motives. He declined to give his name, but said he was 19 and an unemployed second-generation Pakistani.
"Killing people is wrong, obviously, but if he was doing it for God himself -- then fair enough," said the man, checking his cellphone for the time, so he could get to the bank before it closed. "You have to be pretty brave to do something like that, to hold a bomb in your hand and blow yourself up." 
Across the street, a group of hair-gelled youths in Nike and Reebok sweatsuits perched on a railing and commented on the events involving Mr. Sharif. Inside, the older proprietor of a fast-food restaurant dismissed their comments with contempt, but talk they did.
"What he's done is very good, and they won't ever find him," said Basu Hussain, 18, taking a break from his job at Lick'n Chick'n, a fast-food outlet. "We should all get together and kill all the Jews." 
Derby seems an incongruous crucible for such talk and for a suicide bomber, and Mr. Sharif an unlikely candidate for a position usually filled by young, unmarried men politicized from birth by virtue of growing up in places like Gaza or the West Bank. 
Derby has always prided itself on the good relations between white Britons and Muslims of Pakistani descent, the preponderance of the 8.4 percent of the population identifying themselves as Asian. Although the unemployment rate among young Muslims is disproportionately high, there has been no ethnic violence of the sort that has taken place in other northern and midlands towns in recent years.
The British National Party, a right-wing political group that has gained ground in local governments by capitalizing on Britons' fears of Muslim outsiders, has no presence here. Al Muhajiroun, a Muslim group that advocates overthrowing Western democracies, regularly tries to recruit believers here, but most Derby Muslims -- although by no means all -- dismiss it out of hand.
Mr. Sharif grew up in the heavily Pakistani Normanton district. It is here, in a neat Victorian row house with a large garden in the back, that his father, Mohammed, a prominent businessman originally from Kashmir who owned a laundry, a kebab restaurant, and other shops, moved with his wife and six children about 20 years ago. Both parents have since died.
In a country where many immigrants stick to their native languages at home, the family spoke English among themselves and wore Western clothes, said Hamida Akhtar, 54, who lives down the street on Breedon Hill Road and was a close friend of Mrs. Sharif. "They were very respectable and nice," she said. 
The family emphasized education for their children, and Omar, the youngest, was perhaps particularly privileged. Although he attended state schools (the equivalent of American public schools) in Derby for most of his childhood, between 1986 and 1988 he went to Foremarke Hall Preparatory School, set on acres of woods, fields and ponds about 20 minutes outside the city.
At 18, he enrolled in college in London, and came back transformed. He wore a beard and clothes that identified him as a religious Muslim. He prayed five times a day.
"He used to be dressed like this," Ms. Akhtar said, pointing to her husband, Mohammed, who was wearing a suit and tie. "Suddenly, he was changed." He had a new wife, too, named Tahira Tabassum, who wore a traditional Islamic head scarf.
In recent years, too, Mr. Sharif began spending more time with the local representatives of Al Muhajiroun, a group based at the Finsbury Park mosque in London that has several regional offices around Britain. Its leader, Omar Bakri Mohamed, told the Derby Evening Telegraph that Mr. Sharif had attended regular "ideological discussions" with the group at St. James' Center, a community center on Malcolm Street. "I first noticed him because he could understand Arabic, which he said he had studied in Syria," Mr. Mohamed told the paper.
The group has recently played down its links to violence, modifying public pronouncements in a way that seems aimed at consumption by the Western news organizations. But it has spoken very differently in the past, encouraging Britons to go to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban, for example.
In 2000, it held a rally through the streets of Normanton, with placards urging the killing of Jews. 
Last year, it sponsored a celebratory conference marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11 bombings; a fading notice advertising the event, with a picture of the burning twin towers and the words "a towering day in history," is still stuck to a post outside the Rose Hill Street mosque.
The Finsbury Park mosque, Al Muhajiroun's London base, is well known as a center for espousing anti-Western ideas. Among those who have passed through its doors are Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, convicted in the United States of trying to carry out a suicide attack on a plane in 2001. 
Most Muslims here tend to avoid people from Al Muhajiroun, who regularly waylay them as they leave the mosque after Friday Prayers.
"The literature they put out is embarrassing for mature members of the community, people who have more understanding," said Fareed Hussain, a member of the Derby City Council. "Not only do they they put out propaganda against Jewish people, but also against Indian people, Sikhs and Hindus." 
But there are very real fears that they are offering something that young men, particularly the underemployed and frustrated, want to hear.
It is a hard time to be Muslim in this country. Many Muslims are particularly unhappy about the harsh antiterrorism measures introduced here in 2000 and tightened in 2001, which give broad powers of arrest and detention and have been used too enthusiastically, in the minds of some, by a government eager to demonstrate its antiterrorist credentials.
"We're extremely worried about young people being susceptible to their message," Shokat Lal, general secretary of the Pakistani Community Center, said of Al Muhajiroun. "The people in these groups present themselves as positive role models -- they make you want to participate and be part of something."
Mr. Lal said young men across Britain were at risk. "Muslim, and particularly Pakistani, youth at the moment seem to fall within two categories," he said. "Either they join a fundamentalist group, as Sharif did, or they get involved in drugs and crime." 
One young Derby Muslim who admires what Mr. Sharif is said to have done is Shaban Yasin, 17. He works at a halal fish, chips and kebab shop that caters to all manner of multiethnic culinary tastes. Suicide bombing, he said, is the "wrong way" to kill the Jews, adding that, "We should find out the best way to kill them, and do that." 
Mr. Yasin grew up in Derby, too, and said that his parents, immigrants from Pakistan who settled here happily, had retired and were "living it large" on their British pensions. But, he said, he considers himself a Muslim first and foremost. 
If he were to blow himself up for the cause, he said, "I think my parents would be proud of me."

HEADLINE: Get That Oak An Accountant; 
Study Puts a Dollar Value On Work Done by City's Trees

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
If trees had cocktail parties, the 40-year-old Callery pear that grows on Rivington Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, could certainly hold its own. 
 It might introduce itself by its formal name, Pyrus calleryana, and brag about its trunk diameter (25.4 inches), its height (24 feet) and its impressive shade canopy (1,746 square feet). 
 If the tacky "How much do you make?" question came up, the pear tree could document its net worth at $1,192, and say that some of its earnings come from the 527.67 grams of pollutants it saves from human lungs every year, a value to society that economists put at $2.59. These figures would surely send the out-of-town trees fishing forlornly for the acorns in their martinis. 
Actually, these arboreal achievements are known because the pear tree was one of 322 New York City street trees included in a recent pilot project called the Neighborhood Tree Survey. The count, conducted by community and research organizations, examined trees from the South Bronx, the Lower East Side and northern Staten Island.
Unlike many tree tallies, this one compiled extensive information with an ambitious goal some tree-huggers might consider crudely capitalistic: to break down each tree, its parts and its labor, into dollars and cents. Money has yet to grow on trees, but trees can provide crucial de-pollution services quantifiable in cold, hard cash.
Most broadly, the survey concluded that the 322 trees had an average value of $3,225 per tree and a total value of $1,038,458. The value was said to be the amount the city would have to pay to replace the tree. The most expensive one, a 214-year-old tulip tree on Fillmore Street on Staten Island, came in at $23,069, while a scrawny 6-year-old ginkgo on Hunts Point Avenue in the South Bronx brought up the rear, at $54.
"We hope that the price tags will help people realize the real value of street trees as assets and financial investments, as well as foster a sense of public stewardship," said Steven Romalewski, of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which helped run the survey.
The survey broke down the monetary value of services the trees provided as pollution cleaners through natural respiration.
For example, that Staten Island tulip tree scrubs $34.33 worth of pollutants per year from the air, the survey said. Researchers concluded that all trees in these areas removed $814,000 worth of pollution per year -- 143 tons kept from New York lungs.
According to Mr. Romalewski, New Yorkers need to better acquaint themselves with their street trees, perhaps even care for them. In a city where nothing impresses like cash, the tree price tags help to put the introductions in a language New Yorkers understand. It also may be helpful in getting city government and private groups to invest in maintenance and planting.
Though it did not participate in the survey, the Parks Department may use it as a model for its citywide tree survey planned for 2005, said Fiona S. Watt, the department's chief of forestry and horticulture. "We'd like to see it replicated citywide," she said.
"People always knew there was some vague benefit to trees, but you could never quantify it," Ms. Watt said. "But once you have the methodology to equate trees with dollars, now you're talking. It's no longer about hugging trees because they're good, but because you have hard data in a language more effective in the public dialogue."
The city currently values its estimated 5 million trees at about $1,000 each and credits them with $9.5 million a year in antipollution benefits. But thousands of trees are lost to the city's peculiar stresses each year, including constant assault from pollution, vandalism, dog waste, poor soil in compacted spaces, lack of water and sunlight, and blows from cars and trucks.
Faced with a dwindling tree population in the mid-1990's, the city has planted about 100,000 street trees since 1997 and has removed about 50,000 dead ones, Ms. Watt said. But smaller budgets have slowed this. The city allocated funds for 10,000 tree plantings in fiscal year 2003, compared with 19,000 plantings in 2000, she said. In dollars, the city has budgeted only $3.8 million for tree plantings in fiscal year 2004, compared with $7 million in 2003. The average cost of putting a tree in a sidewalk pit is $590.
But a tree's fiscal worth is not easily quantified. Environmentalists have long argued that their value is far-reaching and often obscure. They cool the city, saving millions of dollars in air-conditioning bills. By buffering rainstorms, they prevent the need for larger, costlier storm-water runoff systems. Leafy blocks mean higher real estate prices and can draw shoppers to commercial areas. And then there are the many aesthetic intangibles. For example, what price a bird's song?
"Trees are working hard for us every day, and this is giving a bit of recognition back to them," said Matthew Arnn, a landscape architect who directs the New York City Metro Initiative, a United States Forest Service program. "Maybe with a real, hard dollar value on street trees, people will see them as more than just street furniture and that they can pay real dividends."
The Neighborhood Tree Survey organizers trained 29 volunteer citizen pruners to examine the trees and log the data on hand-held computers, for compilation in an online mapping system. For balance, organizers chose a lush suburban area on Staten Island, an area in the South Bronx, and a densely populated neighborhood in Lower Manhattan.
They recorded tree dimensions like height and trunk diameter, and the amount of shade produced. From these, researchers calculated the less obvious categories, like the amount of sulfur dioxide each tree absorbs and how much isoprene it emits.
"A healthy, growing tree is essentially a pollution-eating device and a mini air-conditioner," said David J. Nowak, a project leader for the Forest Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. According to Mr. Nowak, who helped analyze and calculate the data, a growing tree, as part of its respiration, takes in carbon dioxide and emits oxygen. It stores carbon and absorbs or catches other gaseous and particle pollution, including the carbon monoxide prevalent in vehicle exhaust, and nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone.
American Forests, a Washington-based advocacy group, has done studies of other United States cities, calculating the values of urban trees. Its executive director, Deborah Gangloff, said that New York's Neighborhood Tree Survey numbers were not surprising.
"The ecological value of America's urban forests are worth $4 billion annually, in terms of clean air and water," Ms. Gangloff said. "A tree does more work for people in a city, so it's worth more in Manhattan. Then again, it's a tough place to be a tree."

Re "Schools Try Integration by Income, Not Race" (front page, May 8): 
 As a college student, I have found that racial and cultural diversity is a vital part of education. 
If public schools segregate themselves by social status, children will rarely have the chance to view the world outside of their "bubble." 
 I attended public school in Washington State, where children are assigned to the schools closest to their homes. Since I was in a classroom of students who basically had the same social background, I was not really aware of children in different economic situations. Now, at Furman University, I am exposed to the cultures of other students on a higher level, which has caused me to look at my life from a different point of view. The transition into this diverse culture might have been easier had I had more interaction with students of various social backgrounds.
I applaud the Cambridge school district for making the changes that will serve the city's children far beyond their reading, writing and arithmetic days.

Re "Schools Try Integration by Income, Not Race" (front page, May 8): Economic integration has long been a hallmark of Roman Catholic schools originally established to serve members of ethnic minorities. 
 Perhaps small districts can integrate economically and racially, but large urban districts cannot without court-ordered redistricting or interdistrict integration to bring majority students into urban schools. 
 An alternative is to recognize the success of Catholic schools in serving our urban poor. Many urban Catholic schools are underenrolled because of rising tuition costs. Vouchers can help provide a quality education to students seeking an educational alternative.
Progressive educators since John Dewey have trumpeted urban public education as engines for social reform and justice. It is time we gave up this fiction. Social stratification by race and income in public education is a fact of life, and inner-city schools are separate and unequal. If we lack the political will to integrate public schools, vouchers seem the least we could do.

HEADLINE: Fight in Taiwan Is Impeded By Resistance to Isolation 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 11 

 BODY:
In theory, Taiwan is the perfect laboratory for quarantines.
 It is separated by a hundred miles of water from the Chinese mainland, the epicenter of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Its vigorous economy produces all the thermal-imaging cameras, cellphones and electronic bracelets that a high-tech health authority might covet. Although martial law is a thing of the past, it still keeps lists of every resident of every apartment on every alley. 
 To control its outbreak, Taiwan has largely cut itself off from the world. Noncitizens may not enter from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong or other affected areas. Citizens who do must stay home for 10 days, wear surgical masks and call in their temperature twice daily. Anyone arriving with a fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is taken away by ambulance.
Yet the authorities here are struggling to keep their citizens in quarantine, especially when almost all the 23,000 people in home quarantine are fine. In response, Taiwan's Interior Ministry said today that it had spent about $350,000 for 2,000 video cameras to be installed in quarantined homes. It may also employ satellite tracking devices, or house offenders in military camps.
In contrast to authoritarian Singapore, Taiwan is a model of how hard it can be to set up an airtight quarantine in a democracy. 
"In Taiwan, a guy who's caught drunk driving will refuse the breath test and curse the policeman to the third generation," said Loh I-cheng, a jovial former deputy ambassador to the United States. "Everyone in Taiwan thinks he's special and smart -- why should he observe the rules? He knows the police won't strike him or arrest him."
Last Monday, the Interior Ministry released figures showing that 42 percent of people arriving at airports who were supposed to register with their local health authorities had not. On Thursday, the figure dropped to 21 percent.
On Saturday, the World Health Organization reclassified Taiwan as a place where the SARS outbreak is spreading in unknown ways, because doctors cannot say how 6 of the 184 people with SARS here became infected. Thus far, 18 have died.
Meanwhile, the institute that serves as the de facto American embassy here said dependents and nonemergency staff could fly home at government expense -- a step that the United States Embassy in Beijing took six weeks ago in response to the growing epidemic there.
"Any case with an unidentified source means there could be more transmissions out there and people could be at risk," said Dr. Cathy Roth, leader of the two-person W.H.O. team advising the government here. "So there's great urgency to clarify how much of a problem there is. It might be a small number, but even if there's only one, it's imperative to determine exactly what the situation is."
Despite alarmist local headlines, the situation here is more reassuring than that in Beijing, where 54 new cases were declared today, and a representative of the World Health Organization said that the source had not been traced for about half of them. The total number of reported cases for the Chinese mainland is now 4,885, with 235 fatalities.
When cases in Taiwan are tracked by the onset of symptoms, rather than by when they are reported, new ones here have been steadily declining since the mid-April outbreak at Hoping Hospital, where a misdiagnosed patient infected at least 35 others.
"The next few days are critical," Dr. Roth said. "Most of the cases from Hoping are out of isolation or almost out. We'll be able to tell if there's a fresh wave of outbreaks."
In and around Taipei, where most cases are, an unknown number of people have broken quarantine. Angry officials warned that they face fines of up to $2,000 a day. A Taipei housing project was closed on Friday after a body and two people suspected of having SARS were found inside. About 200 project residents have disappeared, authorities said.
On television, Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of Taipei ordered everyone not at home when the police swooped in to come back, but some fled. A motorcyclist who asked health workers about fines sped off when they tried to question him. A young resident with two children told reporters at the cordon that she was too frightened to go home.
The Wan Hua district around the housing project is one of Taipei's oldest and poorest. Cab drivers call it "the SARS quarter" because Hoping Hospital is nearby, and because it contains many hard-to-trace homeless people and illegal immigrants smuggled here aboard fishing boats.
In one apartment, a 30-year-old unemployed man who answered his door without a mask was warned to wear it or be fined. A few blocks away, a young woman who normally designs dolls at a mainland toy factory said she was bored of watching TV. But she did not regret fleeing her job. "Transmission was very bad among the factory workers," she said. "Many Taiwanese are dying over there."
Another shut-in, a retired military officer, said he resented being isolated for spending "one day in Macau on private business."
But people often slip away to pursue their professions. A car thief arrested in a parking lot turned out to be one such evader. A missing businessman was closing a deal, though it turned out he had his ward office's permission because he agreed to wear a mask and use his own car rather than the subway. A well-known television journalist who often works in Hong Kong has been accused of dodging the law by flying via non-SARS cities.
Taiwan's most infamous quarantine violator is a high school junior identified only as Hsiao. He is now hospitalized with SARS.
Because his mother was a nurse at Hoping Hospital, and fell ill with a high fever and breathing problems, he was asked to leave the Chien-kuo School, Taipei's most demanding, on April 25 and stay home. But on April 29, worried about his final chemistry exam, he went to his cram school -- private teaching facilities used by many students -- for extra work.
The next day, he too fell ill. As a result, his cram school was closed, and 47 of his Chien-kuo classmates and 14 teachers were sent home into quarantine.
He was "just regular, not a freak, not a troublemaker, a mid-top-level student," said Lu Tseng-tsiang, the school's dean of academic affairs. "Teachers liked him."
Mayor Ma, a graduate of both Chien-kuo and Harvard Law School, said Hsiao, assuming he recovers, will be fined $2,000. "I had to make that decision to make sure everyone obeys the rules," Mayor Ma said.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
Santos Knows How To Handle Adversity As Well as a Whip

BYLINE:  By BILL FINLEY 

 BODY:
One day, Jose Santos was a big part of one of racing's sweetest stories, about how the regular guys with their modestly bred gelding from New York and their jockey whose career had been given up for dead beat a wealthy Arab prince and proved that anyone could win the Kentucky Derby. The next, he was swept up in a maelstrom that threatened to destroy his career and tarnish his sport. 
 His problems began Saturday with an article in The Miami Herald and an accompanying photograph from the Kentucky Derby appearing to show a dark object in his right hand as he crossed the finish line aboard Funny Cide. The article indicated that the object might be a battery, an illegal device used to shock a horse and improve its performance. The situation will enter a new stage today when Santos, his agent and his lawyer meet with Churchill Downs stewards to go over the allegations. 
 The last two days have no doubt been difficult ones for Santos. But few seem better suited to handle adversity. 
Abject poverty, having to beg in the streets as a child, overcoming a 10-year slump and hearing racetrack whispers that he was washed up are the sorts of things that can toughen someone up.
Jose Santos was 17 and making $70 a month as a jockey in his native Chile when he watched 18-year-old Steve Cauthen win the 1978 Kentucky Derby aboard Affirmed. In every way imaginable, he could not have been further removed from Churchill Downs that day, but he was drawn to the similarities between Cauthen and him. Both were young and talented, he thought. Why couldn't he win the Kentucky Derby, too?
It was not the first or last time he believed in the unthinkable. But some 23 years after he watched Cauthen, Santos seemed no closer to fulfilling his ambitions than when he was back in Chile, broke and unknown. Once widely recognized as one of the top jockeys in the United States, his career seemed to be on an inexorable path toward mediocrity. 
That was, at least, the conventional wisdom around the racetrack when Santos, the Eclipse Award winner in 1988 as the nation's outstanding jockey, fell so hard that he could not crack the top 60 in the national standing in 2001 in money won. But he never believed for a second that his days as an elite jockey were over. He had made it to the top out of the streets of Concepcion, Chile, where he had to beg for food as a child. In comparison, reviving his flagging career did not seem so imposing.
"I am not a quitter," he said.
It is that sort of perseverance that has helped make him one of the more popular figures around the New York racetracks.
"If you knew Jose, you would never question his character," the jockey Richard Migliore said. "The fact that he has overcome so much, from his injuries to the times when his business was so slow, tells you something about him. It would have been so easy for him to give up. Instead, he worked so hard to get back to the top. That says a lot about the type of person he is. When I saw the smile on his face after he won the Kentucky Derby, it gave me goose bumps. To see that tainted by this nonsense just isn't right."
There was never any doubt that Santos would be a jockey. After finishing the Chilean equivalent of the fifth grade, he showed up at Club de Concepcion Racecourse to work full time, adding to the part-time duties he undertook when he was only 8. He was a stablehand then, but he was being groomed as a jockey by his father, Manuel, a veteran rider at the Chilean tracks. Manuel Santos was not a very good rider, and the little bit of money he brought in from the minuscule purses was never enough for the 10 children he was raising.
"There were 12 people living in our home and only two rooms to sleep in," Santos said. "We had four small beds and we all gathered together. There'd be four people in some of the beds, two up and two down. I slept in one bed with my handicapped brother.
"We didn't have a floor. It was dirt. We'd take a shower and change our clothes just once a week, on Sunday. When the economy went bad in 1973, when Allende went down and Pinochet took over, we had a little bit of money, but there was nothing to buy. They weren't selling any food. To buy a pound of bread you had to wait in line for four hours. I had to start working pretty young."
During the worst of times, he would knock on doors in the wealthier neighborhoods and beg for bread for his family to eat. 
Santos rode in his first professional race when he was just 15 and immediately showed promise.
"I made $70 a month there, which was good money for a jockey," he said. "Some people from Colombia noticed how well I was doing and offered me a contract to ride there. They gave me $200 a month. I couldn't believeI could make that much money riding horses."
Santos does not, however, have fond memories of his time in Colombia. He was young and reckless and thought he was bulletproof. He would rush off to bars and discos after the races and celebrate his winners with alcohol and cocaine. His binges would last for days.
In 1984, he accepted an offer to ride for the trainer Philip Simms in Florida, where he could earn more in one day than he would in four months in Colombia. Though just 23 at the time, he was mature enough to understand that his drug usage could destroy his opportunity.
"From the day I left for America, I am proud to say that I haven't touched drugs," Santos said. "Thank God, I have been drug free. I have paid attention to my career and worked hard. I don't think even I understood how much potential I had and I could have destroyed it with drugs."
Santos was an immediate hit in Florida. Within a bit more than a year, he had won riding titles at Calder, Gulfstream and Hialeah and was on a fast track to become one of the sport's brightest stars. His ascension accelerated when he moved on to the New York tracks in 1985. He led all riders nationally in money earned each year from 1986 through 1989 and was the leading rider in New York in races won in 1986 through 1988. In 1988, his Eclipse Award-winning year, he won 369 races, including 62 stakes races, and his mounts earned $14,877,298, a record at the time. 
Santos made a tactical blunder when, in 1990, he shifted to a California circuit that has a history of being inhospitable to New York riders. Never able to get a foothold there, he returned to New York less than a year later, but it was too late. His momentum was gone. He had some bad luck in 1992 when he broke his right arm, his collarbone and his hip in a spill and missed five months. 
The setbacks were piling up and the result was a rider caught in a seemingly inescapable tailspin. 
"I'd win on a horse and then somebody else would ride them the next time," he said. "I'd say, 'What's wrong with this picture?' I tried the best that I could and would ride a strong race. I didn't know what else to do. There are popular jockeys out there. I was on the bottom of the list."
He was widely regarded as a jockey who would not take chances and did not have his head in the game. He concedes that a divorce in the early 90's weighed on him emotionally and that his slump started to sap his confidence and morale.
"He seemed depressed," the trainer Phil Johnson said. "I'm sure his marital problems had something to do with that. He didn't have the upbeat attitude that he has now. He was a downer to be around."
Each year would get worse. There were few trainers who would take a chance on him, but a retired New York City police officer turned jockey agent, Mike Sellito, did. Sellito needed a rider after parting ways with Migliore and agreed to work for Santos in March 2002. 
"It was like a good claiming trainer that takes a claiming horse with lots of back class and gets it out of them again," Sellito said. "The people who worked for him prior to me were good people, but there has to be a good chemistry between the rider and the agent. You also have to have the customers. He has a whole lot of talent and always has. It was up to me to put him in the right spots so he could perform."
The Sellito-Santos combination clicked immediately. After he won a career-worst 68 races with his mounts earning just $3,869,854 in 2001, Santos improved his 2002 numbers to 176 victories and $11,917,958 in earnings. By last year's Belmont spring meet he was back fighting elite riders like Jerry Bailey and Edgar Prado for the best mounts.
Off the track, his life had also turned around. He navigated through the divorce and remarried the former Rita Castillo, the sister of the jockey Herb Castillo Jr. He has become a devoted family man and a doting father to his six children. His happiness and contentment shine through in his perpetual smile and gentle and humble demeanor.
It seemed that Santos had reached a zenith when he won last year's $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic aboard Volponi. It turned out to be only the appetizer to a six-month-long feast. He kept winning through the winter months at Gulfstream and scored his greatest career accomplishment in winning this year's Kentucky Derby, his first, aboard Funny Cide.
The events of the past two days may have soured the accomplishment for him, but past performance would suggest Santos may just have the stuff to ride this out.

HEADLINE: How to Hurt Castro 

BYLINE:  By Jeff Flake; Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is a member of the House International Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The long prison terms handed to nearly 80 Cuban dissidents and the summary execution of three hijackers of a Cuban ferry have led to calls for a new get-tough policy with the Castro regime. Which raises the question: short of calling in the Marines, what would constitute a get-tough policy with Cuba?
 We've not had normal diplomatic relations for decades. We've had an economic embargo against the island for more than 40 years. It is illegal for Americans to travel to Cuba without express permission from Washington. 
 Where do we go from here? The options the Bush administration is considering -- ending all flights to Cuba and cutting off family remittances -- would respond to Fidel Castro's latest outrages by penalizing American citizens and Cuban families whose livelihood depends on help from relatives abroad.
The implicit assumption of United States policy on travel to Cuba is that Americans are not intelligent enough to know what constitutes a "good" visit to Cuba as opposed to a "bad" one. License applications to travel to Cuba must be approved by both the Treasury Department and the State Department. And though the administration says it encourages humanitarian aid, Americans who want to make donations to churches in Cuba are required to get two separate federal licenses, one from Treasury and one from Commerce.
To be sure, lifting the ban is not without its risks. Some American travelers will go to Cuba and buy the Cuban government canard about the three "successes" of the Cuban revolution -- education, health care and science. But far more Americans will notice the Cuban revolution's three most obvious failures -- breakfast, lunch and dinner.
A genuine get-tough policy with Cuba would export something Americans know a little about: freedom. Let's get rid of travel license applications altogether. Recently, Oswaldo Paya, Cuba's leading democracy activist, repeated his opposition to the United States embargo and issued an invitation. "We appeal to all foreigners who come to our country as tourists to show solidarity, to take part in demonstrations," he said. "To support the opening up of Cuba."
We should heed this advice and end the American policy of Soviet-style travel controls. All Americans should be free to go to Cuba without government interference. Cuban officials would then have to determine which are the "good" visits and which are the "bad" ones, which Americans are sunbathers and which are pro-democracy demonstrators. Cuba would be flooded with American visitors -- and American ideas. For Fidel Castro, that would be the toughest policy of all.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: POSTWAR POLITICS; 
Iraqis More Bemused Than Enthused by Cleric

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq, May 11 

 BODY:
The ayatollah who could become an Iraqi kingmaker journeyed toward this Shiite Muslim holy city today in a slow-moving convoy that was greeted by Iraqis with more curiosity than exhilaration. 
 Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim, a longtime opponent of Saddam Hussein who spent the last 32 years in exile in Iran, was expected to enter Najaf on Monday and assert his claim to speak for Iraq's long-suppressed Shiites in negotiations for a postwar government. 
 After arriving in the port city of Basra on Saturday, he set out this morning on a journey northward that took him through the bleak flatlands of southern Iraq, past towns and villages where Shiites rose up against the government in 1991 with the help of his Iran-based militia, the Badr Brigade. 
That uprising was crushed with brutal force. Only today, just outside Basra, a grave was uncovered that may contain the remains of eight brothers from one family who had died in the crackdown. 
The Badr Brigade, made up of Iraqis trained and financed by Iran, may become a smaller personal guard for Ayatollah Hakim, under the agreement with Washington that allowed him to return to Iraq. 
His militia had been used, in part, to fight the Mujahedeen Khalq, an anti-Iran group that had been supported by the government of Saddam Hussein. Last week, American forces in Iraq ordered the Iranian opposition group to give up its weapons. 
In Nasiriya, another outpost of the revolt, Ayatollah Hakim wept as he spoke to a few hundred men from the balcony of City Hall, recalling the torture and killings the Shiites had suffered under Mr. Hussein. 
"Nowhere have I been that I didn't pray for you," he told the group. "I am not above saying that I kiss your hands. You are the mujahedeen."
The town was plastered with photographs of the ayatollah, and two busloads of people from Basra, outfitted with banners and posters, accompanied him on his travels. Signposts and walls along the road all the way to Najaf had also been covered with his posters, and clusters of Bedouins and other Iraqis waited under a searing sun to see him pass. 
"He's a moderate man, not an extremist," said Ahmed al-Shikarchi, a schoolteacher whose school had been destroyed in the postwar looting in Nasiriya. "I think he may be the most popular person. Or at least the most revolutionary." 
But Ayatollah Hakim's cavalcade, with all the markings of a political campaign, also appeared to be just a temporary diversion for others. 
The bulk of the audience hurried away after his speech, leaving behind just the people who had been brought in from Basra by the ayatollah's aides. 
A block away, a few tired-looking men in the Arbanayim tea shop skipped the speech, instead spending the morning sipping tiny glasses of sugary tea under a ceiling fan that slowly wafted the hot air over the benches and tables. 
"I don't really understand what's going on," said Kassem Hassan, an unemployed construction worker, when asked his opinion on the new politicking in postwar Iraq.
A few of the opposition parties that used to operate outside Iraq have opened small offices in Nasiriya. But residents said they had drawn little attention except as novelties. 
Many people are especially suspicious of the former exiles who spent years outside the country and have now returned to help organize a transitional government. 
"Let me tell you, I am a poor person, and these are wealthy people," Mr. Hassan said. "Saddam divided us between the rich and the poor. If someone comes along to unite us, I'm for him. But if there's a party and only people in this party get jobs, then I won't accept this again."
Most people have modest expectations that have little to do with politics or religion.
"Let us have enough food to eat each day, a clean shirt, and we'll be fine," said another patron, Akil Khalil, a 40-year-old bus driver who lives in one small room with his wife, five children and parents. 
A few doors down, at another tea shop, the customers were mesmerized by a movie video playing on the television set and expressed no interest in Ayatollah Hakim's appearance a few steps away. 
One patron was a distinguished-looking tribal sheik in a white robe, gauzy black cape and black and white headdress. He identified himself as Sheik al-Khafaja, using just the name of his tribe, and said he saw little difference between the various people making political promises these days. 
"The politicians come and go here, and each time there are these celebrations here and there," he added. "The main thing we want to know, though, is when our economic situation is going to get better." 
Ayatollah Hakim, while one of the best-known clerics, is only one of many religious figures jockeying to represent the interests of the majority Shiite population. Several began sniping at the newcomer before he arrived.
"One who spent the majority of his life comfortably outside the country and did not suffer as the majority of Iraqis suffered -- we can't call him a representative of Iraqis onthe street," said Sheik Adnan al-Shahmani, a spokesman for another ambitious cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.
Ayatollah Hakim, added the sheik, "is only a brigade commander who opposed the regime."

HEADLINE: Clinton Tells Graduating Class That U.S. Has Obligation to Lead 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, N.Y., May 11 

 BODY:
The United States should lead the world in the fight against poverty and infectious disease, just as it has led the fight against terrorism, former President Bill Clinton told the graduating students of Syracuse University today.
 The way to do that, he said, is through international collaboration. 
 "We should have a strong military; sometimes we have to use it," Mr. Clinton said in a 23-minute commencement speech. "But over the long run, the trend line will require us to make a safer world by cooperating with others." 
In his only direct reference to President Bush, Mr. Clinton commended the White House for its commitment to increase financing to combat H.I.V. and AIDS internationally.
"I hope this money will not come at the expense of other global assistance and that more of it will go through the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and malaria, so that we can help all the nations that need it," he said.
Mr. Clinton noted that many dramatic events had occurred while the 5,372 Syracuse graduates were attending college, including the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the wars that have followed and an economic downturn. 
Yet, he said: "The world of 1999 and the world of 2003 are not so very different. In 1999, we had the dangers of terror and weapons of mass destruction -- it's just that they weren't in the headlines because they hadn't happened here. But we were working hard to deal with them."
Mr. Clinton reminded the audience of the 1988 explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 35 Syracuse students were killed.
"It marked the beginning of America's clear vulnerability to global terror, although we had lost people in the 70's and early 80's, too," he said.
But Mr. Clinton cautioned students against living in fear. "I know you've got reasons to be scared," he said. "Fear is not a stupid emotion, and people who live without any fear are often stupid. But people who are paralyzed by fear are unfailingly miserable and unsuccessful."
Human history, he said, has been a contest between the builders and the wreckers.
"Every single time, since people first rose out of the African savanna a hundred thousand years ago, when it came down to it, the builders have prevailed," he said.
"The people who believed in our independence have prevailed, the people who believed in our common humanity have prevailed. I want you to use your education to make sure that in the 21st century, we prevail."

HEADLINE: A DOCTOR'S JOURNAL; 
Navajo Miners Battle a Deadly Legacy of Yellow Dust

BYLINE:  By BEN DAITZ, M.D.; Ben Daitz is a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.

DATELINE: CROWNPOINT, N.M. 

 BODY:
I drove west across an ocher sagebrush plain, past pinto ponies grazing next to a Pentecostal revival tent, past the ribbed, rutted dirt road that leads north to Chaco Canyon, the sacred, ancestral home of the Anasazi, the ancient ones.
 I was on the eastern edge of the vast Navajo Reservation, heading toward Crownpoint, a Navajo community of almost 3,000 people astride the Continental Divide about 100 miles northwest of Albuquerque. It is the administrative and educational hub of the Eastern Navajo Agency and the site of the Indian Health Service Hospital. 
 The Crownpoint I.H.S. hospital serves more than 20,000 Navajo who live in small communities and isolated traditional hogans across the high desert of northwestern New Mexico. I was driving to the Crownpoint Hospital to meet my good friend John Fogarty, a medical officer in the Indian Health Service. The Navajo in these parts call John the uranium doctor. 
The Dine (pronounced dee-NAY) or "the People," as the Navajo call themselves, have many stories about their origins. One says that as they emerged from the fourth world into the fifth and present world, they were given the choice of two yellow powders. One yellow powder was corn pollen, and that was the one they chose.
The other was the color of the dust that seems to give this land its golden hue, dust the color of yellowcake, the uranium oxide that fueled the nuclear age. So much yellowcake lies below the surface that a mining executive called this place the Saudi Arabia of uranium.
The Spirits said it had to be left alone. But from the late 1940's through the mid-80's, yellowcake was picked and shoveled and blasted and hauled in open-bed trucks, and then dried in mountainous piles at multiple sites in the American West. The Navajo, whose lands extend over western New Mexico, eastern Arizona and southern Utah, were at the epicenter of the uranium-mining boom, and thousands of Navajos worked in the mines. More than 1,000 abandoned mine shafts remain on Navajo land.
The consequences are measured today, decades after the mines closed, in continuing health problems and degraded land.
Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, people exposed to radiation through uranium mining and milling or through weapons testing are eligible for government compensation. 
On that recent day, Dr. Fogarty and Dr. Bruce Strumminger were conducting a clinic for former Navajo uranium miners, most in their 70's and 80's. Dr. Strumminger, also a physician for the Indian Health Service, is medical director of the Radiation Exposure Screening Education Program at the health service hospital in Shiprock, N.M., 100 miles northwest of Crownpoint. He told me that four uranium miners' health clinics screened 3,000 to 4,000 miners in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.
More than 500 uranium miners died of lung cancer from 1950 to 1990. Hundreds more will die of lung cancer in the coming years, a study by the Public Health Service predicts. A majority of the deaths stemmed from exposure to radiation from the breakdown of uranium products. These so-called radon daughters attach to dust particles, and when workers inhale the dust, the particles lodge in their lungs, where they release high doses of radiation. 
Navajo uranium miners run a risk of developing lung cancer that is 28 times as great as those Navajos not exposed to uranium, according to a study in The Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
Thomas Desiderio was the first patient of the day. Mr. Desiderio, 75, handsome with short-cropped gray hair, wore jeans, a Western shirt and a big smile. His wife sat by his side in her wide pleated Navajo skirt, her hair coiled in a bun at her neck.
The Desiderios are accompanied by Trudy James, a caseworker with Dr. Strumminger's clinic, who is a patient's advocate and a translator. Like many Navajos in the Eastern Agency, the Desiderios do not speak English well, and the clinic doctors' questions are interpreted and reinterpreted in their complex sonorous language, which was used as a secret code in World War II.
The miners' compensation is determined by their health status and work histories, how long they worked underground and where. They fill out 22-page applications. 
Mr. Desiderio tells us he worked off and on in the mines from 1953 to 1981 in a variety of jobs. Many miners worked in "dog holes," primitive tunnels with no ventilation that men crawled through to dig uranium ore by hand. "Mom-and-pop operations," Dr. Strumminger calls them.
The larger mines were frequently no better, with substandard ventilation, no face masks for workers and little or no information or education about the long-term health risks.
Mr. Desiderio's overall exposure has been calculated at 94 working-level months; 40 is the minimum for compensation. The physicians listened to his heart and lungs, working down his chest with dual stethoscopes. "How far can you walk without getting short of breath?" Dr. Fogarty asked. 
Ms. James translated the question and the reply. Mr. Desiderio said he could walk 30 miles in elk hunting season. His wife said he had to stop every 10 feet to catch his breath.
Mr. Desiderio has not yet qualified for the $150,000 compensation. Although his blood oxygen concentration is low, showing some lung damage, his last chest X-ray did not show enough chronic changes in his lungs to support his claim fully. 
"Why is this taking so long?" Mr. Desiderio finally asked in broken English. "Why haven't we been paid?"
The doctors will order a special X-ray, to be read by a radiologist trained to interpret the subtle changes of pneumoconiosis, the chronic nonmalignant respiratory disease common to underground miners who inhale rock dust. The death rate among Navajo miners from respiratory diseases like pneumoconiosis and emphysema is also extremely high, about the same as the death rate from lung cancer.
The next patient, John James, 67, started mining underground in 1956 in Moab, Utah. Then he went to Ambrosia Lake, N.M., and on to the Homestake mine in Grants, N.M.
"We brought dust home on our clothes," he told the doctors. "We contaminated our families. I saw the yellowcake there. It looked like it was burning." 
"He means glowing," said Ms. James, who is not related.
Mr. James is on home oxygen. He said that two weeks ago he coughed up some blood. Dr. Strumminger ordered a chest X-ray and drew an arterial blood gas to check the oxygen-carrying capacity. He said Mr. James's arterial blood gas result plus the chronic disease changes on his chest X-ray would probably qualify him for compensation.
The doctors saw six patients that morning. Most of the old miners drove at least 100 miles to get there, and they will keep returning for testing, betting that the sad chapter of their past will somehow compensate them for the present, before they die.
No one is mining uranium here now. But Dr. Fogarty and Dr. Strumminger are worried about plans to resume it.
Hydro Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Uranium Resources Inc. of Dallas, wants to begin a new mining effort in Crownpoint and nearby Church Rock using a process called in situ leach mining. In the process, a mixture of water, dissolved oxygen and sodium bicarbonate is pumped deep into underground uranium beds. The mixture dissolves uranium, and when the liquid is pumped back to the surface, the uranium can be removed, dried and processed.
The water for the leaching would come from the Westwater Canyon Aquifer under Crownpoint, the sole source of drinking water for Crownpoint and its surrounding area.
Hydro Resources plans to provide uranium for the nuclear power industry, create jobs and leave the aquifer safe for drinking.
But Dr. Fogarty and Dr. Strumminger are worried. Dr. Fogarty wrote his thesis for his master's in public health on the health risks of uranium mining. Underground mining led to lung disease, he said, but if leach mining pollutes the aquifer, a result may be widespread kidney disease. 
"The Navajo are more vulnerable to the toxic kidney effects of uranium," he said, "because they already have three times the national rates of diabetes and kidney disease."
When he heard about the leaching plan, Mitchell Capitan, a former mining technician, became an opponent. Mr. Capitan is president of the Crownpoint chapter of the Eastern Navajo Agency, the Navajo equivalent of a mayor, and he founded Endaum, Eastern Navajo Dine Against Uranium Mining.
"The aquifer right underneath us provides water for 15,000 people," he said, standing on an outcrop on the western edge of Crownpoint. He pointed to the leaching site and said:
"People come here from all over these parts, from 50 miles away, to truck this water back to their houses, to drink it, because it's the only pure supply. Their own water is bad -- contaminated."
Later, Mr. Capitan made his case to a gathering in the cafeteria of the Crownpoint elementary school. The cafeteria walls were painted with scenes of sheepherders and red rock mesas, with hawks floating above. 
The occasion was the opening of the Water Is Life conference, sponsored by Endaum. A woman gently waving a sage incense bundle circulated through the audience. Old women in traditional velvet skirts and turquoise pendants and young Navajo men and women, about 100 people from all over the reservation, were there to talk about the future of water in their high desert environment.
The unemployment rate in the area is almost 70 percent, but there is little sentiment that mining jobs are worth the risk. Endaum has the support of all 31 chapters in the Eastern Navajo Agency Council, as well as the new president of the Navajo Nation, Joe Shirley Jr.
In alternating Navajo and English, Mr. Capitan explained how Endaum had obtained a moratorium against leach mining -- with the help of the Southwest Research and Information Center, an environmental advocacy group, and the New Mexico Environmental Law Center -- until a hearing has been completed before a judge for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The groups expect a decision soon.
Mr. Capitan stood under an Endaum banner. In Navajo and English, it said, "One Mind, One Voice, One Prayer, One People."
"This uranium impacts on our water, our air and our cultural identity," he said. "We've already had enough uranium."
Dr. Fogarty put it another way: "This decision should not come down to which hydrologist the N.R.C. believes. When you think about the history of uranium here, what it did to these people, the N.R.C. should support the people's health, first and foremost."

HEADLINE: City Workers Know How to Sacrifice 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Missing Share of Sacrifice" (news analysis, May 9) suggests that public employees are the only New Yorkers who are not sacrificing in response to the city's budget crisis. 
 A New York City public employee, I am also a city homeowner and a property-tax payer. 
 Most of my spending is in the city, so I will feel the sales tax increase, water rate increase, transit fare increase and municipal service cuts the same way other New Yorkers will.
The difference is that probably unlike most of those who call for me to sacrifice more, I lived through years of minuscule or nonexistent pay raises while the economy boomed and others' incomes skyrocketed. Because of those years, my pockets are far less deep than those of the people who suggest that I should sacrifice more.
Lower- and middle-income public employees like me, folks who borrow books from the public library rather than buy them; who drive 10-year-old cars and who try hard to keep their neighborhoods in the "outer boroughs" livable, will sacrifice much more than average.
But I'm told that I should volunteer to make more sacrifices. 
I don't think so.

HEADLINE: Russia's Latest Oil and Gas Oasis 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CHAYVO BAY, Russia 

 BODY:
On this desolate shore of Sakhalin Island, where sea ice blurs into treeless tundra, stands a bright blue drilling rig, 22 stories high and fresh from Louisiana.
 The rig, here since early 2003, is now the tallest structure on the island, once a Czarist penal colony, and it is the lance point of a $12 billion oil and gas development project. It is scheduled to begin drilling the first of 10 wells deep below the Sea of Okhotsk on June 11 for a consortium led by Exxon Mobil. 
 A few minutes away by helicopter, pipeline routes are being cleared to serve Russia's first offshore oil production platform, part of another oil and gas development, a $9 billion project led by Shell. Later this year, construction is expected to start on Russia's first plant for liquefying natural gas for export, which will ship gas from the project to light up the neon of the Ginza district in Tokyo. 
A few miles away, BP is prospecting for more oil and gas as the leader of a third consortium, spending three years and $150 million to prepare the way for what it hopes will be a multibillion-dollar project like those of Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon Mobil.
Aggressive investments by the world's three largest oil producers illustrate how this isolated island north of Japan has become a world hot spot for energy development. Sakhalin, roughly equal in area to Maine but with fewer than half as many residents as Maine's 1.2 million people, is on a track to surpass Moscow this year as the top destination for foreign investment in Russia.
"We expect the volume of foreign investments to double this year and to reach $1.3 billion," Igor P. Farkhutdinov, Sakhalin's governor, said in an interview.
Much of the oil giants' work here is concentrated on modernizing the infrastructure of a poor and backward corner of the country, building bridges and piers, paving roads and airport runways, and repairing the narrow-gauge railway that runs north and south on Sakhalin's spine, to make it easier to support the oil field development to follow. 
"If you are in oil and gas, this is the place to be," said Jeffrey Valkar, director of the American Business Center of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a United States-financed investment assistance office in the island's capital. "This is the biggest oil and gas development happening around the world today."
Russia has already made great strides in revamping its oil industry in recent years, stepping up production by 25 percent and becoming the world's No. 2 oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. But that production revival has taken place in the already extensively developed fields of central and western Russia. For the future, Russia's big growth area may be its Far East, especially in the waters around Sakhalin.
It is a hard place to work. "Take Alaska and the North Sea, combine the worst of both and you have Sakhalin -- drifting ice, snow, fog, earthquakes, tsunamis, you name it," said William Dinty Miller, executive vice president of BP Sakhalin. But the rewards are on the same heroic scale as the obstacles, Mr. Miller said, with offshore reserves estimated at 200 trillion cubic feet of gas and 60.5 billion barrels of oil. "The north slope of North Alaska -- that is the Sakhalin shelf," he said.
Russia formally took possession of the island in 1855 and has produced oil onshore since the 1920's, but Moscow has tended to see Sakhalin as far, far away. From the perspective of resource-poor economies like those of Japan and South Korea, though, Sakhalin's energy wealth is conveniently close -- just three days away by tanker, much closer than the Middle East or even Southeast Asia.
But tapping it requires the latest technology and plenty of capital, and to get it done, Russia has turned to foreign companies in a way that it has not elsewhere, and made special legal provisions to attract them. 
On May 15, the Russian Parliament is scheduled to give final approval to a law intended to assure that the Sakhalin operations of the consortiums led by Shell and Exxon Mobil will have stable and consistent tax and royalty treatment. The law is expected to open the way for a cascade of gas purchase agreements by companies in Japan, the world's largest importer and consumer of liquefied natural gas.
"We will supply 15 percent of gas going into Tokyo," said Andy C. Calitz, commercial director of Sakhalin Energy Investment, as the Shell-led consortium is called. "Half of what we produce will flow into Japan."
 The consortium said on Monday that it had reached its first major supply agreement, selling up to 1.1 million tons of liquefied natural gas a year to Tokyo Gas for a period of 24 years, starting in 2007. 
Competing gas projects are expected to come online in the next few years in Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and East Timor. But Northeast Asia increasingly views the Russian Far East as its filling station of the future.
"It is quite obvious that the countries of the Pacific Rim want to diversify their energy sources," Galina N. Pavlova, the Sakhalin regional government's oil and gas director, said in her office, littered with trinkets from visiting energy company delegations. "The political instability of the Middle East and Indonesia has worked for us in selling gas."
In Japan, officials have taken note of the country's growing reliance on oil from the Persian Gulf -- up to 86 percent of imports in 2003 from about 70 percent in the 1991 Persian Gulf war. In April, Japan mounted a lobbying campaign to persuade Russia to build a 2,500-mile pipeline to carry a million barrels of oil a day from eastern Siberia to Nakhodka, a Russian port facing Japan. Tokyo offered to finance the entire $5 billion pipeline, which could meet nearly one-quarter of Japan's oil needs.
The Russian government decided to back a shorter and cheaper rival pipeline proposal instead, to supply northeastern China. The decision effectively gave China first crack at the oil, but it left open the possibility of building a branch later to serve Japan. With oil consumption in China expected to double in this decade, the country will soon overtake Japan as the world's No. 2 consumer after the United States, and could easily swallow all of Russia's East Siberian oil exports, leaving little need to extend the pipeline.
"We lose," Kotaru Tamura, a member of Japan's upper house of Parliament, said in Tokyo about Russia's pipeline decision. Mr. Tamura favors a gas pipeline from Sakhalin to Japan instead, which would be far from any risk of diversion to China. 
Japan needs the gas. Rolling power shortages are expected in Tokyo this summer because 16 of Tokyo Electric Power's 17 nuclear power plants have been shut for safety checks and repairs since mid-April.
"If the nuclear plant situation continues, you will see growth in gas," said Larry G. Smith, vice president of Exxon Neftegas, the Sakhalin subsidiary. 
Japanese investors are also helping finance development. In the case of Sakhalin Energy, Shell's partners are the Mitsui Corporation with 25 percent and the Mitsubishi Corporation with 20 percent; Shell has the remaining 55 percent.
The consortium's project, known as Sakhalin-2, calls for twin 500-mile oil and gas pipelines from near here to Prigorodnye, a bay near the island's southern tip where ships can call year-round. The gas processing plant to be built there would be able to liquefy up to 9.6 million tons a year, equal to about one-sixth of Japan's total needs.
Some of the gas may go to South Korea or Taiwan as well as Japan; together, the three countries account for 70 percent of the world trade in liquefied natural gas. China buys little now, though analysts expect its needs to rise to 10 million to 15 million tons by the end of the decade.
The Exxon Mobil consortium, which is spending $1.2 billion in Sakhalin this year, hopes to start oil production from Chayvo in 18 months, followed by gas production for export to Japan in 2008. Exxon Mobil has 30 percent of the consortium, which also includes a Japanese group of 13 companies; two Russian partners, RN-Astra and SMNG-Shelf; and ONGC Videsh Ltd. of India.
Unlike Shell, Exxon Mobil hopes to skip the sea transportation and build a 1,450-mile, $900 million gas pipeline all the way to Tokyo.
Such a pipeline could yield benefits beyond reliable energy. Japan and Russia have never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II because of a lingering dispute over four small islands near Sakhalin. Building a gas pipeline could bring about the kind of interdependency between Russia and Japan that a gas line to Western Europe fostered between the Soviet Union and West Germany in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- Paris; 
A City of Good Food, Fashion and Corporate Drama

BYLINE:  By MARY A. KELLY 

 BODY:
Probably best known for its high fashion and haute cuisine, Paris is the center of French business, headquarters to companies like L'Oreal, TotalFinaElf and Publicis, and the scene of corporate dramas like Vivendi Universal's struggle to right itself after the ouster of Jean-Marie Messier as chief executive last year. 
The French economy has been hurt by the world slowdown, with unemployment rising to 9.3 percent at the end of March from 8.9 percent a year earlier. It is being further battered by the American boycott of everything from Louis Vuitton handbags to Bordeaux wines. So it is with a sense of relief that Parisians anticipate the permanent return next month of the new-millennium display of 20,000 lights on the Eiffel Tower.

AIRPORT
 A taxi from CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT at Roissy or ORLY AIRPORT takes 30 minutes to an hour and costs $30 to $60. An alternative is the RER B commuter train, which zips into the heart of the city from Roissy for $8, though passengers who land at Orly must take the Orlyval rail shuttle and change to the RER. 
 Both airports are served by reliable airport buses known as Roissybus and Orlybus and by Air France buses that cost $6 to $12. The BLUE SHUTTLES (011-33-1-30-11-11-90) and AIRPORT CONNECTION (1-44-18-36-02) minibus services to and from the main airports and your hotel or office can be reserved at least two days in advance at reasonable prices. (To telephone Paris from the United States, callers must first dial 011-33 and then the number; Paris phone numbers have nine digits. However, if calling from within France, the number must be preceded by a zero.)

HOTELS
The Paris international business scene revolves around a long boulevard whose name changes several times as it shoots northwest from the heart of the city at the Louvre, through the Place de la Concorde, up the Champs-Elysees and out to the suburban business district of La Defense. The many business-class hotels clustered around this artery, particularly those near the city center, are favored for their location, cultural attractions and night life.
The PARK HYATT PARIS-VENDOME (1-58-71-12-34, from $420) off the Place Vendome, designed by the American architect Ed Tuttle and opened last summer, blends mahogany, limestone and bronze with homeyness. "It is definitely French, just a more updated style of French," said Edward Nalbantian, a senior partner at the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
For a more intimate atmosphere, Mr. Nalbantian recommends the HOTEL ASTOR (1-53-05-05-05, from $369), popular with lawyers and bankers doing business on nearby Rue du Faubourg St. Honore. Its two-star restaurant has a "wonderful" $60 prix fixe lunch, he says.
Jean-Marie Snyers, a senior bankerat Credit Agricole Indosuez, steers clients away from hotels near his bank's headquarters in La Defense, "not a fun area at night," he says. Instead, he recommends HOTEL BALZAC (1-44-35-18-00, from $350) and its Pierre Gagnaire restaurant, 15 minutes away near the more lively Arc de Triomphe area.
Sally Katz, a human resources manager with Schlumberger, sends economy-minded people to HOTEL EBER (011-33-1-46-22-60-70, from $143), which she describes as "a charming three-star hotel with only 18 rooms in walking distance of the Champs-Elysees."

RESTAURANTS
Jacques D'Orleans, the duke of Orleans and an adviser to the president of the drinks company Pernod Ricard, likes LA FERRONNERIE on the Left Bank (1-45-49-22-43, $90 to $110 for dinner for two including wine and tip) for its "classic French dishes and excellent selection of Bordeaux wines." Mr. Nalbantian says the two semiprivate alcoves at MARKET (1-56-43-40-90, $90), created by the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, are popular for business meals.
A gathering spot for the business and political elite, including President Jacques Chirac, is BEAUVILLIERS (1-42-54-54-42, $200). "It's a traditionally French restaurant with Napoleon III decor and a sublime terrace in the summer," said Sylvia Javogue, an official with the center-right Union Pour un Mouvement Populaire.
Mr. Snyers also lists LUCAS CARTON, TAILLEVENT, JULES VERNE and LE GRAND VEFOUR as temples of gastronomy where movers and shakers close deals.

ENTERTAINMENT
Hot spots on the restaurant and club scene where the dance floor opens after dinner include TANJIA, CABARET and NIRVANA. For people-watching, nothing beats a cafe, and one of the best is the recently reopened landmark CAFE DE LA PAIX (1-40-07-36-36), with probably the largest terrace in the city.
With cinema a national passion, more than 250 films from all over the world play each week in Paris alone. Pick up a copy of Pariscope for weekly listings. To get some culture after work, visit the MUSEE D'ORSAY, open Thursday evenings, or the LOUVRE, open Monday and Wednesday nights.

BUSINESS LORE
Will American animosity toward France be felt at the Paris Air Show in June? The Pentagon says it is limiting American participation in what is the world's biggest air show, but organizers expect the usual crowd. After all, European companies like Airbus and Dassault Aviation stand to gain a competitive edge if their American rivals stay away.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Smaller U.S. Airports Are Increasingly Popular

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN 

 BODY:
There are many ways to size up the worst or at least the most irritating airports in the country. Some people count the number of delayed flights, others gauge the difficulties of getting in and out, and some critique the amenities. Doctors have even ranked the busiest airports based on the unhealthiness of the food served in them.
 However the list is drawn up, some candidates always seem to make it. Hartsfield in Atlanta and O'Hare in Chicago; Logan in Boston; La Guardia and Kennedy in New York; LAX in Los Angeles; and the aptly coded MIA in Miami. 
 Now, a growing number of business travelers are doing more than making a mental tally of the most annoying airports. They are shunning them and flying out of regional airports instead, thereby not only sparing themselves a lot of aggravation but saving money to boot. Low-cost airlines like Southwest prefer these smaller fields precisely because they are less congested, and because they charge lower landing fees.
"It's a lot easier for me to fly out of White Plains than to fight getting out of La Guardia," said Jessica L. Henry, referring to the Westchester County Airport in the suburbs north of New York City. "It cuts two hours from the whole process." Ms. Henry is a college recruiter for News America Marketing Inc., an advertising company based in Manhattan, and said she spent a third of her time on the road.
Ross Leonard, the director of architecture and design marketing for C&A Floorcoverings, a carpet maker in Dalton, Ga., said that he preferred driving to Tennessee and flying out of the Chattanooga airport to battling his way through Atlanta's vast Hartsfield International. "The security lines at Hartsfield are just dispiriting," he said.
The shift of business travel to regional airports is illustrated by Federal Aviation Administration statistics. They show big gains in passenger traffic at airports just outside some major urban areas from 1996 to 2001 -- the latest year for which statistics are available -- while the traffic at primary airports grew little or actually shrank.
The gains at these suburban airports came even as the weak economy led many airlines to cut service to midsize and small cities. "In an effort to stem losses, airlines have reduced service in the smallest communities by 19 percent in the past five years," Kenneth M. Mead, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, testified before a Senate subcommittee earlier this month.
While passenger volume at Logan International fell 4 percent in that period, to 11.7 million boardings in 2001, for example, traffic at Manchester Airport 50 miles northwest in New Hampshire more than tripled, to 1.6 million boardings, and the number of passengers using T. F. Green Airport about 40 miles southwest in Providence, R.I., more than doubled, to 2.7 million boardings. Boston officials contributed to the trend by encouraging travelers to use regional airports while a downtown highway reconstruction project hampered automobile access to Logan.
In southern Florida, traffic at Miami International fell 8.5 percent in those five years, to 14.9 million boardings, while the number of passengers at nearby Fort Lauderdale Airport jumped 45 percent, to 8 million boardings. In Southern California, traffic at Long Beach Airport increased by almost one-third, to 297,000 boardings, while Los Angeles International gained 2.5 percent, to 29.3 million.
At the other end of the state, traffic at San Jose International expanded 21 percent, to 5.9 million boardings; Oakland International added 17 percent more passengers, rising to 5.5 million; and San Francisco International dropped 11 percent, to 16.4 million boardings, largely as a result of the dot-com bust.
The San Francisco airport is also in the midst of a big construction project, but travelers who navigate it now have at least one reason to celebrate. Last year, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit group that promotes preventive medicine and good nutrition, rated the food in the airport's restaurants the healthiest in the nation. (The Detroit airport placed last.)
Some of the most striking growth at regional airports has been near New York City, which has three contenders on most lists of worst airports: La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International. While traffic at La Guardia rose 9 percent and Newark 7 percent between 1996 and 2001, passenger volume at Kennedy dropped almost 4 percent.
MacArthur Airport in Islip on Long Island, meanwhile, handled 85 percent more passengers in 2001 than it did in 1996, F.A.A. figures show. Bradley International Airport in Hartford, which is an alternative to Boston and New York, experienced a 27 percent jump in that period.
Not coincidentally, many of these airports started or added service by Southwest Airlines and other low-fare carriers. Southwest, for example, began flying into MacArthur early in 1999 and in Hartford later that year. JetBlue began flying into Long Beach in 2001. More than 60 percent of all flights to and from Oakland are operated by Southwest.
As suburban and regional airports grow, offering more frequent flights and more destinations, some consultants said they could begin to act as magnets for businesses seeking to expand or relocate outside of big cities.
"You might see a corporate move to some of these midlevel cities to save on air fare costs," said James Diffley, a managing director of Global Insight, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Stephen R. Elliott, president of SRE Associates, an architectural firm, said that cheap and convenient airline connections were one reason he relocated his business to Chattanooga from Cheyenne, Wyo.
The convenience of smaller airports is not without some cost. Flights are not as frequent, there is less nonstop service and the airports have fewer amenities, like lounges and business centers.
"I often take an early morning flight, and White Plains doesn't have a Starbucks like you have at La Guardia," Ms. Henry said. "It has a diner, but that's not the same."
But she and others say the benefits outweigh such inconveniences.
"You have a three-and-a-half or four-hour wait just to get into Hartsfield, what with traffic and parking and all the security," Mr. Elliott said. "You lose a whole day every time you fly out of there, no matter where you are going." Even with additional layovers sometimes required by flying out of a smaller airport, he said, "you come out ahead."
While some business travelers said fares at smaller airports were marginally higher than those at major cities, they generally said the differences were not enough to outweigh benefits like cheaper parking, shorter waits and quicker departures. Others said that the full-fare, last-minute tickets they tend to buy most often were just as expensive at major airports as at smaller ones.
Ms. Henry, who lives in Darien, Conn., said that when she went on recruiting trips around the country, she would continue to fly out of White Plains as often as possible. "It's worth it," she said, "as long as the difference is not astronomical."

Why Washington Isn't Sweating The Dollar's Drop

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar is weaker, but is it too weak?
 The answer from the Bush administration is no, according to some analysts, who note that a falling dollar could help the American economy rebound by making United States exporters more competitive abroad and foreign companies less competitive here. Private economists agree. 
 A look at history shows that the dollar is not in immediate peril. There is no dollar crisis afoot, as there was when the Carter administration sought to support the dollar in 1978. 
While the dollar is down 9.1 percent against the euro this year and 27.5 percent since the dollar's recent peak in July 2001, it is down only 3.7 percent this year and 6.4 percent since July 2001 based on an index of the currencies of 37 countries compiled by the Federal Reserve. Against this broad index, the dollar is only at its lowest value since July 2000 and is 20.1 percent above its low in 1978.
And to top it off, the decline in the dollar, which normally would bolster inflation by making imports more expensive and push interest rates higher, is coming at a time when inflation is so tame that Fed officials will not worry if prices go higher and interest rates are near lows not seen in more than four decades.
"I really don't see any negatives in a weaker dollar right now," said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities, who noted that a weaker dollar would help improve corporate profits here.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, agreed: "The normal negatives -- rising inflation and rising interest rates -- are nowhere to be seen. This is the optimum time. Let it rip."
There is a downside, however, and that is for Americans traveling abroad, especially in Europe, where the decline in the dollar has made business and vacation trips much more expensive.
Still, those trips are only more expensive than they were four years ago. Trips to Europe are still cheaper than they were for much of the early and mid-1990's.
The dollar's slide has received a lot of attention lately. In trading yesterday, the dollar's fall pushed the euro to $1.1624, just shy of the $1.1667 at which it was introduced on Jan. 1, 1998, before retreating. By the afternoon in New York, the euro was trading at $1.1541. Against the yen, the dollar edged lower, to 116.99 yen from 117.19 on Friday.
The early dollar sell-off yesterday was touched off, currency analysts said, by an apparently innocuous remark on Sunday by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow.
On "This Week" on ABC, Mr. Snow was asked, "Is the dollar now at a level where it can give a significant boost to exports?" Mr. Snow replied: "Well, you know, when the dollar is at a lower level, it helps exports. And I think that exports are getting stronger as a result, yes."
But in a foreign market where traders say the trend is your friend, everyone is looking for any sign that the administration has backed away from its stated strong-dollar policy.
So Mr. Snow's remark provided a reason to sell dollars overnight in Asia and early in Europe. The dollar rebounded a little in the United States as traders realized that the remark was not that significant.
"Snow's comments had a modest impact on what is already an enormous trend," said David Puth, global head of foreign exchange and commodities at J. P. Morgan.
The heavier weights on the dollar include the United States' $500 billion current account deficit with the rest of the world, interest rates here that are lower than in many other countries, lingering doubts about the revival of the American economy and worries about low inflation turning into deflation.
In addition, foreign central banks and finance ministers, who know stronger local currencies could impede their own economic recoveries, have yet to protest against the negative effect of a falling dollar.
"It is my belief that the United States government will continue to suggest that a strong dollar is in the country's best interest," Mr. Puth said.
"On the other hand," he said, "when we have seen a lack of resistance from the Treasury and other central bank officials to the decline, there is a suggestion that they accept the trend as a reflection of the economic realities of the day."
The administration's main concern is that the decline does not turn into a free fall that becomes a crisis by sending both inflation and interest rates up quickly. A free fall can be avoided, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., "as long as foreign investors don't think the administration is going to allow the dollar to collapse."
How much further will the dollar go? Most forecasts for the year have already been surpassed, which means a euro at $1.20, or a dollar decline of almost 13 percent in 2003, is not out of the question.
What could stop the decline? Larry Kantor, the global head of market strategy at Barclays Capital, said he did not think that a rebound in economic growth here would be enough to turn things around. He noted that despite the strong rally in stocks since the end of the main fighting in Iraq -- something that should attract foreign investors -- the dollar's decline has accelerated.
What is needed to stop or slow the decline soon, he said, is protests from Europe about how the rising value of the euro is strangling an economic recovery there. And, he said, if that protest is backed up with cuts in interest rates by the European Central Bank, the dollar could find a bottom.

HEADLINE: Seton Hall Class Recalls 3 Who Died in Fire 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 12 

 BODY:
Three flickering candles stood in front of the almost 2,000 graduates today as Seton Hall University graduated its class of 2003. The candles were a reminder of their freshman year, when three of their fellow students died in an early morning dormitory fire that a grand jury is still investigating.
 Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Frank S. Caltabilota Jr. of West Long Branch, all 18, were killed in the fire, which started on the third floor of the freshman dormitory building, Boland Hall, on Jan. 19, 2000. 
 The fire, which the authorities say was deliberately set, injured 58 other students, left a raft of unresolved questions and robbed many students of a certain innocence.
"The fire helped me to realize that I can't take life for granted and assume that you are going to be alive forever," said Lauren Bakunas, 22, a biology major from Parsippany. "It was really the most important lesson I learned in college. It's important to celebrate, but we also have to remember the lives that were lost."
On the university's campus in South Orange, several memorials, including a bell tower and memorial garden, have been erected to honor the three dead students. And today, before a cheering crowd at the Continental Airlines Arena here, the university gave posthumous diplomas to members of their families.
Mr. Caltabilota, who had planned to become a doctor, was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree. Mr. Giunta, who had aspired to be an elementary school teacher, was awarded a Bachelor of Science in education. Mr. Karol, who had planned to be a profiler for the F.B.I., was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree.
While many students waved to relatives in the audience, chatted with friends on cellphones and tossed beach balls, others, like Michael Alfonzo, said they were thinking about the fire and other events that took place during their four yearsat Seton Hall.
"When you go into college you think about 'Animal House' and crazy times, but we had an experience shrouded in the fire, the war, an attack in New York and the terrible economy," said Mr. Alfonzo, 22, a biology major from Milltown.
Mr. Alfonzo that said he, like many of his friends, was preoccupied by thoughts of employment, graduate school and travel. But the most important question, he said, was finding out what happened on the night of the fire and finding who was responsible.
In the months after the fire, the acting Essex County prosecutor, Donald C. Campolo, began an intense investigation into the fire, and asked a judge to empanel a 12-member grand jury.
Twenty-two months after the fire, Mr. Campolo announced that a task force had determined that someone set the blaze by lighting a paper banner, which ignited a couch in the third-floor lounge of the dorm.
The grand jury continues to meet every Thursday and has interviewed hundreds of students, school officials and law enforcement officers and fire experts. So far, the group has received five deadline extensions and is expected to conclude its work on June 13. Judge Joseph A. Falcone has told the panel that he will grant no more extensions.
In his charge to the graduates, Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the university's president, said the three fallen students would continue to inspire their classmates. "John, Frank and Aaron -- they began the journey with you and they touched us all along the way," he said. "We will always be with them and they will always be us each step of the way."

HEADLINE: New Study Finds 60 Million Uninsured During a Year 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
Nearly 60 million people lack health insurance at some point in the year, the Congressional Budget Office said today, adding that official estimates fail to distinguish between people who lack coverage for a few months and those who are uninsured for a full year or more.
 Members of Congress, administration officials, lobbyists and advocates often cite the Census Bureau when they declare that 41 million people have no health insurance. 
 But in a new report today, the budget office said the bureau's figure "overstates the number of people who are uninsured all year," while significantly understating the number who are insured for only part of the year.
The report said 57 million to 59 million people, "about a quarter of the nonelderly population," lacked insurance at some time in 1998, the most recent year for which reliable comparative figures were available. 
At the same time, the budget office said, government surveys suggest that the number of people uninsured for the entire year was 21 million to 31 million, or 9 percent to 13 percent of nonelderly Americans.
The widely used figure from the Census Bureau is based on interviews conducted by the government, as part of the Current Population Survey, in March of each year. The questions about insurance are meant to identify people who were uninsured for all the prior calendar year.
But the budget office said that many people "report their insurance status as of the time of the interview, rather than for the previous calendar year as requested."
The new research confirms what some economists and health policy experts had suspected for years: that it is difficult to count the uninsured because people are continually losing and gaining coverage, and they do not always understand the questions asked in government surveys.
Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the new director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: "Far from being a static group, the uninsured population is constantly changing. While many people are chronically uninsured, many more are uninsured for shorter periods of time."
In writing legislation to expand coverage, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, members of Congress must "consider the distinction between the short-term and long-term uninsured."
Lawmakers have proposed several approaches. Republicans and some Democrats want to offer tax credits to help individuals or small businesses buy private insurance. Many Democrats want to expand Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, or the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
Some Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, want employers to provide coverage to employees, with government subsidies.
The budget office conducted its study at the request of Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Thomas said the report offered "some good news: fewer individuals are long-term uninsured than previously thought."
But Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, said: "The report underscores how big a crisis our country is facing. On any given day, more than 40 million Americans live with the prospect of facing financial ruin in order to pay for their health care, or going without care altogether."
One question the budget office addressed was how long people go without coverage when they are uninsured. For some, the experience is relatively brief. But others go more than two years without insurance.
The office focused on people who became uninsured from mid-1996 to mid-1997 and tracked them for several years. It found that 45 percent were uninsured for four months or less, 26 percent were uninsured for 5 to 12 months, and 13 percent lacked coverage for 13 to 24 months, while 16 percent were uninsured more than two years.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Rally in Tech Shares Propels Nasdaq to 11-Month High

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed sharply yesterday as investors, betting on better economic times ahead, snapped up shares of technology companies like Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems.
 The rally pulled the Nasdaq composite index to its highest level in about 11 months and lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest close since August. 
 Cisco, the biggest maker of equipment that directs Internet traffic, jumped about 4.5 percent after a positive brokerage firm call. The news helped other stocks in the networking sector. Sun Microsystems surged 8.8 percent. 
"Today we are willing to look on the bright side," said Charles White, president of the investment firm Avatar Associates. With that view, he said, the Federal Reserve does not seem inclined to raise rates too quickly and there are signs the economy is improving.
Traders also said short-covering was fueling some of the market's gains. As the market climbed, short sellers -- investors who sell borrowed stock, hoping to buy it later at lower prices -- were forced to buy back shares to stem losses.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 21.25 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,541.40, its highest close since June. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 122.13 points, or 1.42 percent, to 8,726.73. The broader S.& P. 500 index gained 11.7 points, or 1.25 percent, to 945.11.
Investors may be fearful of missing out on a rally that has driven the S.& P. 500 index up 18 percent since mid-March, analysts said, but some Wall Street experts warned that the market might soon run out of steam.
Cisco rose 72 cents, to $16.67. Lehman Brothers said it raised its rating on Cisco to overweight from equal weight.
The American Stock Exchange networking index rallied 3.45 percent, as Cisco rivals like Juniper Networks, also gained. Juniper rose 53 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $12.53.
Sun Microsystems, the Nasdaq's most actively traded stock, jumped 34 cents, to $4.21. Analysts cited persistent rumors of a possible takeover as part of the reason behind the sharp move.
Retailers were another bright spot as the S.& P. retail index rose 2.28 percent. Prudential Securities raised its rating on clothing retailers as a group and lifted its rating on AnnTaylor, which jumped $1.65, or 7.1 percent, to $24.92.
Among Dow issues, the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris, gained $1.40, or 4.4 percent, to $33.10. A report in Barron's said Altria's stock price could surge more than 26 percent by year-end if it receives favorable legal decisions, resumes its stock buyback program and can show the viability of the domestic tobacco industry.

Treasury Prices Climb
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, driving benchmark 10-year note yields to the lowest level in two months, as some traders speculated that slow inflation would spur the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
The advance, the fifth in six trading days, increased the 10-year note's return this year to 3.7 percent. The Fed said last week that it was concerned about the possibility of a "substantial" decline in the inflation rate.
The 10-year note climbed 10/32, to 99 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.65 percent from 3.68 percent on Friday.
And the 30-year bond rose 10/32, to 111 9/32. Its yield dropped to 4.65 percent from 4.67 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-day cash management bills and three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Poland Upstages, and Irks, European Powerhouses 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: WARSAW, May 12 

 BODY:
For Poland, these have been heady times. Not since this country liberated itself from Soviet control has it adopted so visible a role on the world stage, or one so defiant of the wishes of its most powerful future partners in the European Union, which Poland is scheduled to join next year.
 Last week produced the historically arresting spectacle of a Polish defense minister, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, inviting his German counterpart, Peter Struck, to contribute troops to the Polish-led force that the United States foresees guaranteeing security in Iraq. It was an invitation that the Germans summarily, even angrily, dismissed. 
 But officials say that in joining the United States and Britain in Iraq in the face of French and German pressure not to do so, Poland was making a strategic decision, aimed at cementing ties with the United States at a time when Washington was grateful for international support.
"This is a country that thinks seriously about security," Piotr Ogrodzinski, the director of the American department in the Polish Foreign Ministry, said in an interview. "There's no doubt that for such a country, it's good to be a close ally of the United States."
Clearly, many Poles feel pride in their country's enlarged role and in its enlarged ambition. Poland, after all, was for centuries dominated and at times obliterated by its more powerful neighbors, so irritating Berlin with its invitation to join the Polish security force in Iraq brought a perverse sort of satisfaction.
"It is ironic and perhaps therefore annoying to Berlin that Poland today is playing the role that Germany itself assumed up until recently," the German paper Die Welt wrote at the end of last week. The reference was to Germany's traditional role as the bridge between the United States and European Union members like France.
Symbolizing Poland's new step in its transition from Soviet bloc satellite to important ally of the United States, all the newspapers here published a photo recently showing Polish special forces somewhere in the southern Iraqi oil fields, standing in comradely poses with their American counterparts before a statue of the soon-to-be-deposed Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Szmajdzinski, the defense minister, wanting Polish forces to have a low profile in Iraq, was reportedly unhappy that the photograph had been published at all. To other Poles, the picture seemed to say there was now no turning back from what was being called a bold foreign policy.
In fact, Poland, still emerging from half a century of Communist dictatorship and misrule, is far from a world powerhouse. With an economy pummeled by the global downturn and hit by adjustments needed for European Union membership, Poland's unemployment rate is 20 percent. The left-of-center government has one of the lowest approval ratings of any government in Europe, at around 12 percent. While opposition to the Iraq war was not as widespread or as intense as it was in countries like Germany and France, public opinion polls here nonetheless showed a majority of Poles opposed it.
Poland, with 37 million people, is certainly the largest and most significant of the former Communist countries to join the Western clubs of NATO and the European Union. Yet it is still dwarfed by its historically dominant neighbors, Germany -- population 80 million -- and Russia, which stretches 11 time zones to Poland's east.
For some Poles there seems to be something more than vaguely bizarre in the way this country is suddenly becoming a player on the international scene, sending troops to a corner of the world 2,000 miles away.
The skeptical view of this would be that Washington is so eager to have allies in Iraq that it is raising Poland to a level of importance well beyond the country's size or abilities.
"You've got the full range of opinions about this, from joy and pride to total criticism," said Leszek Jesien, a political scientist and adviser to the former Polish government. "My own opinion is that it's a natural and automatic thing for Poland to do.
"We did take part in the coalition," Mr. Jesien said, "and if we can contribute to stabilizing Iraq, and if we can share our own recent experience of coming back to democracy, then why not?"
Yet Mr. Jesien also acknowledges that Poland has risen to its current prominence as an American ally, not because of its inherent strength, but by a kind of default.
"It's because the others, France and Germany, were absent that Poland became a major player, but when you look at the means of this country, it is a little ironic," he said.
Krzysztof Bobinski, the editor of Unia & Polska, a magazine on the European Union, said the government was "embarking on an adventure abroad when it can't do things well at home." 
"It needs prestige, and Washington, which needs an ally, is treating it very nicely," he said.
"But here you have a country with a general feeling of corruption, with a resentment of the political class, a country not sure of its own institutions, and it's going to administer a Middle Eastern country in a state of transition with so many troubles," Mr. Bobinski said. "Poland doesn't have the capacity to get its own home into shape -- much less run another country like Iraq."
In all, Poland sent just 200 special forces troops to Iraq, where they saw action securing the oil fields in the far south. The contribution, while small, outdid that of any other allied force besides the United States, Britain and Australia.
There were no Polish casualties. Now, officials say, Poland will dispatch 1,500 to 2,000 troops to the division that will be charged with stabilizing one of four occupation sectors to be created in Iraq, with additional forces presumably coming from other countries. 
Polish officials say that they would prefer a United Nations resolution approving the stabilization force, but that they are ready to go ahead even without one.
"The decision has been made," said Mr. Ogrodzinski of the Foreign Ministry. "There is a political will to go ahead, and behind that is the assumption that there is a high degree of acceptance by the Polish public."

HEADLINE: Israel Seals Off Gaza After Brief Opening Meant to Ease Plight of Palestinian Workers 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 12 

 BODY:
Despite a pledge to ease Palestinian hardships, Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip today after partly opening the border to workers from there on Sunday. Israeli soldiers today killed three Palestinians in the southern part of the strip, Palestinians said.
 The weekend visit by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Palestinian officials said, failed to generate any real momentum for the new Middle East peace plan, known as the road map, which envisions the creation of a Palestinian state within three years. 
 "The general impression among Palestinians is one of disappointment," said Ziad Abu Amr, a cabinet minister. "The hope was that both the Israelis and Palestinians would make a public declaration accepting the road map." 
Mr. Powell said he would be satisfied for now if the two sides could begin taking some of the smaller steps outlined in the plan while discussing their differences on larger issues.
Even that limited goal immediately ran into problems.
After the meeting between Mr. Powell and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Sunday, Israel spelled out measures it would take to improve Palestinian living conditions. 
The most immediate was to allow several thousand workers from Gaza into Israel on Sunday. But early today, before Mr. Powell's plane took off for Egypt, Israel again closed the crossing. Israeli military officials cited intelligence information warning of a possiblePalestinian attack.
Israel has closed off the Palestinian areas for much of the 31 months of violence in an effort to prevent attacks by militants. But the closings have also contributed to an economic collapse in Palestinian communities. Before the current conflict began in September 2000, up to 150,000 Palestinians commuted daily from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to work in Israel.
The current closing, which is open-ended, also bars foreigners from entering or leaving Gaza. Only diplomats and journalists who receive advance permission will be allowed through the Erez crossing at the territory's northern end, the Israeli Army said.
The Palestinians said the Israeli measures, even if carried out, were minor gestures that fell far short of the government's obligations under the peace plan, which calls for pulling back troops and halting the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
Israel's decision to let 25,000 Palestinian workers into Israel was made months ago. The number who have made the trip is much smaller, because of Israeli security restrictions. The Gaza crossing was closed to Palestinians for almost a month before its brief reopening on Sunday.
"The reason we continue with these security measures is not just to protect our citizens," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for Mr. Sharon, "but to protect this embryonic process that could be destroyed by one or two suicide bombings."
Israel also says it is releasing up to 200 detained Palestinians. About 100 were freed on Sunday and today, the Defense Ministry said. But Palestinians said most were already within days of their release, and nearly all had been picked up for entering Israel illegally to look for work and were not involved in violence.
Palestinian militants fired one mortar shell at a Jewish settlement in southern Gaza tonight, but it caused no injuries or damage, the Israeli military said. Earlier, an army patrol found and safely detonated a 90-pound roadside bomb outside another settlement in the same area.
On the political front, Mr. Sharon and the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, may meet this week, possibly on Friday, both sides said. Mr. Sharon, who has boycotted the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, has not met openly with such a senior Palestinian figure since taking office more than two years ago.
Palestinians questioned the intentions of Mr. Sharon, who is to meet President Bush in Washington next week.
"I think Sharon wants to use this meeting to his advantage as he heads to the White House," said Mr. Abu Amr, the Palestinian cabinet minister. "Sharon wants to show he is talking to the Palestinians, when in reality nothing is moving forward."
Gerald Steinberg, an Israeli political science professor at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, said the current peace plan, like many before it, was producing inflated expectations of a swift solution.
"The belief that the road map is going to go smoothly enough to create a Palestinian state in three years is very unrealistic in my view," Mr. Steinberg said. "The Israeli and Palestinian publics are still very far apart on core issues."
In the Gaza violence, the Israeli Army said troops had found two tunnels used by weapons smugglers in the town of Rafah, on the border with Egypt. Soldiers in the area spotted two Palestinians trying to plant a an explosive device and shot them, the army said. Palestinians said both were killed.
Israeli troops also shot a Palestinian farmer dead in his fields outside the nearby town of Khan Yunis, according to the Palestinians. The army saidit was checking the report.
Israeli troops were also active in the West Bank, seizing seven suspected militants in the town of Qalqilya, the army said. Soldiers also searched Rafidiya Hospital in Nablus for three hours, but left without making arrests, hospital officials said.

HEADLINE: Iranian Leader Visits Beirut In Show of Shiite Solidarity 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 12 

 BODY:
Sprinkled with rose petals and rice, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran arrived here today to a glowing embrace from the Lebanese government and tens of thousands of chanting and cheering Lebanese Shiites. 
 His visit was the first by an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic revolution. It represents a major diplomatic reaction in Islam to the United States military action in Iraq. 
 Washington will be listening closely to what Mr. Khatami says. The United States says it considers Iran the leading state sponsor of terrorism and has recently raised concerns about whether Tehran is developing nuclear weapons. The United States has demanded that Iran stop supporting militant groups like Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon. 
Nevertheless, Iran and the United States seem to be moving toward a new phase in their often hostile relationship, with Bush administration officials confirming that the two countries have been having secret contacts.
Mr. Khatami moves on to Syria after his three-day visit here.
Many people in the region see his trip as an effort to bolster ties among Mideast countries that appear to be next in line for American wrath. The visit is also a milestone in Iran's growing closeness to Lebanon. The two signed economic agreements today, including provisions for a $50 million loan from Iran.
The visit was yet another tremor to run through the world of the Shiites, a branch of Islam with longstanding grievances that sees the prospect of Iraq being the first Shiite-run Arab nation.
In Iraq today, Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim returned to Najaf, the holy city, after 23 years of exile in Iran. Page A18. 
Ayatollah Hakim has called for an Islamic system of government. Other clerics favor a nontheocratic government, a division of opinion that also exists among Lebanese Shiites, who may be paying some attention to what Mr. Khatami has to say on the subject.
More immediately, it was a day of joy for the Shiites, who identify closely with the leader of a Shiite nation and who welcome Iranian financial aid and moral support in the fight against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, where many Shiites live. 
"I love him," Abbad al-Azim, 31, said in the crowd awaiting Mr. Khatami's motorcade. "My heart beats for him."
Mr. Khatami's visit was a display of power by Hezbollah, which helped force the Israeli withdrawal in 2000. Iran supplies Hezbollah, United States officials say, and Syria allows materials to pass through its territory. Lebanon holds up Hezbollah as a legitimate force to resist Israel, which occupies a scrap of land bordering the Golan Heights that Lebanon claims.
Hezbollah and its related institutions helped ensure that Mr. Khatami received a major turnout in one of the largest welcomes here since Pope John Paul II's visit almost exactly six years ago. Shiites are estimated to number more than a million of the population of 3.5 million, although there are no recent census figures.
"He's not an ordinary president," said Jihan Tarhini, an English teacher who was with third and fourth graders from Al Mustafa school, which is loosely affiliated with Hezbollah. "He's a Shiite president. He supported the Islamic resistance in the south for liberation. This is the main thing that makes us welcome this president."
Another teacher at the school, Samar Akl, said: "We hate the policy of America. She supports Israel, although they are killing innocent people."
Ms. Akl broke off and rushed to the barricade as the motorcade approached. "I have to see him!" she exclaimed.
Later, she added, "If American politicians had the same policies that Iran and Syria had, we would welcome Bush in the same way."
If so, President Bush would have seen the road from the airport lined with Hezbollah, Iranian and Lebanese flags, which were in the minority, along with huge posters of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader; Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the 1979 revolution; and Mr. Khatami. Groups of schoolgirls in blue smocks and black scarves pressed against the barricades. Occasional clumps of Hezbollah security forces were in black. Many women wore the full black chador.
The green flag of Amal, the other main Shiite party, also abounded. As the crowd awaited Mr. Khatami, a loudspeaker at the airport emitted chants, including "Death to Israel." 
Some people cried in unison, "Oh God, oh God, please preserve Nasrallah!" referring to the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, a prominent figure in Lebanon. 
After greeting Lebanon's leaders on the tarmac, Mr. Khatami moved to a Hezbollah delegation in the official reception party, a sign of the party's status. During the motorcade to town, he briefly left his car and waved, smiling and holding his fists up like a victorious boxer. The car of President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon followed and drew little notice.
The crowd, estimated by security officials at 30,000, arrived by special buses or walked from the Shiite neighborhoods that dominate southern Beirut. Officials expect additional tens of thousands at a rally on Tuesday at a stadium. 
Mr. Khatami did little to calm fears about Iran's efforts to influence Baghdad. In an article today in the Lebanese newspaper As Safir, he said Washington was wrong "to impose an immoral and alien regime." Such a policy "will come back to harm the American people in the long run," he added.
Officials said the trip was made final two months ago, when the military action in Iraq appeared imminent. Many in the region view the trip as a response to the visit of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who has returned to the region to work on an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.

HEADLINE: Meadowlands Plan Envisions Central Park 10 Times Over 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: CARLSTADT, N.J., May 11 

 BODY:
The Hackensack Meadowlands, once among the nation's best known trash heaps and a mosquito-infested symbol of environmental degradation, is poised to become something that once would have seemed unimaginable: a watery ecological preserve that would become the region's largest urban park.
 Three months after developers agreed to abandon plans for a shopping center in the heart of the tidal basin that stretches for miles in either direction here, an unlikely coalition of business executives, environmental advocates and mayors has tentatively agreed to back a plan that would turn 8,400 acres of swamp, sewage and orphaned landfills into a sprawling green space 10 times the size of Central Park. 
 The site is two miles from the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel.
In the past week, state officials, fortified with $8.4 million in acquisition funds, have begun contacting property owners to move forward with the next phase, the purchase of 700 acres for the refuge, which has unofficially been christened Meadowlands Preserve. The state already owns 3,400 acres that it plans to devote to the park, and officials say they have enough money to make the preserve a reality. 
"A few years ago, if you had told anyone this collection of toxic dumps and marshes would one day become an environmental park, people would have thought you were crazy," said Representative Steve Rothman, a New Jersey Democrat who helped secure more than $4 million from Congress for the land purchases. Plans for the park, which have percolated for a decade, gained momentum in February, when a Virginia-based company abandoned its efforts to build a two-million-square-foot retail and entertainment center on wetlands here. The company, which spent years trying to win federal approval for the project, has agreed to shift the mall to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and donate the 600-acre site to the state.
Extending from the edges of suburban Ridgefield south to the industrial flank of Kearny, the park will include playing fields, fishing piers, golf links and 35 miles of hiking trails, some of which will skirt above the riverine mud flats.
But just cobbling together patches of soupy earth does not make a wildlife refuge. Large swaths of the Meadowlands have long been cut off from the nourishing flow of the Atlantic, and environmental researchers are still trying to figure out how to clean up a landscape once dominated by scores of towering garbage dumps, many of which still leach brightly colored goo into surrounding waters.
Remediating the most damaged areas could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take a decade or more to complete. Ecologists are unsure how the contamination from heavy metals will play out in the aquatic food chain, which includes more than 260 species of birds that feed, breed and nest in the area. "We're going to have to make the best of what in actuality is a very bad situation," said Bill Sheehan, director of Hackensack Riverkeeper, a group that serves as the Meadowlands's most dogged defender.
Still, as he steered a pontoon boat through the serpentine Saw Mill Creek last week, Mr. Sheehan excitedly pointed out the signs of a thriving habitat. Blue-wing teals and cormorants dipped and dove into the cider-colored waters and diamond-back terrapins sunned themselves on the mud flats. On many days, he said, the brackish Hackensack is now clean enough for swimming. As a boatload of old men cast lines for white perch and striped bass in a nearby cove, Mr. Sheehan and his co-pilot, Hugh Carola, argued over whether the waterfowl reeling overhead were white-fronted geese, a species rarely seen on the East Coast, or simply an escaped pair of barnyard geese.
Mr. Sheehan said that as he was growing up in Secaucus during the 1950's, very few species could survive the industrial effluent and burning trash that fouled the Meadowlands. "In 1995, when I started doing ecocruises, people laughed at me and said, 'What are you going to look at, bits of floating garbage?' " he said. Since then, he has taken more than 16,000 people through the marshes, and on weekends, boaters flock to a newly created county park, Laurel Hill, to rent canoes by the hour.
A dozen kayaks are on the way, Mr. Sheehan said, and during the warmer months his office phones seldom stop ringing. "People are having birthday parties on the river," he said. "They're using the Meadowlands in ways they could never have imagined."
Local business leaders, who more recently viewed the Meadowlands as a place better suited to outlet centers and low-rise warehouses, have begun to see the possibilities of ecotourism. James Kirkos, president of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce, said his group, which spent years butting heads with environmentalists, is planning a marketing effort to promote bird-watching and boating as well as the new golf courses. "We see great promise in it," he said of the park. "We're calling it Meadowlands Miracle Two."
EnCap, a Florida-based company, has already begun preliminary work on a billion dollar effort to transform seven abandoned landfills into four golf courses, a hotel and 2,000 apartments. As part of the project, the company will spend $300 million to seal in the ooze of contamination, which plagues many of the abandoned dumps.
Some local businesses are already trying to cash in on the lure of the place. Later this month, the Red Roof Inn in Secaucus will start putting ecocruise brochures in its rooms. Jim Mastrangelo, the general manager, wants all his employees to take a ride with Mr. Sheehan so they can better pitch the tours to guests. "I think folks will be pleasantly surprised to know they can take a canoe out on a marsh that sits in the shadow of the Empire State Building," he said.
Although the notion of a resuscitated Meadowlands began with the Clean Water Act of 1972 and slowly built over the decades, the biggest turnaround in its fortunes occurred last year, when Gov. James E. McGreevey appointed an environmentalist, Robert R. Ceberio, to lead the state agency that oversees zoning and development in the 30-square-mile Meadowlands district. (A few months earlier, the agency, previously known as the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, changed its name to the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission to reflect its new mission.)
Once largely a vehicle for promoting economic development, which would have included the filling of 2,000 acres of wetlands, the commission has put together a new master plan that virtually eliminates wetlands destruction and steers all future development to brownfields and other upland parcels that have negligible ecological value. Business leaders like Mr. Kirkos said they have been cheered by the plan's growth component, which promises $5 billion in construction and 55,000 new jobs in the broader Meadowlands area outside the park.
He and others, however, want to make sure property owners are fairly compensated for land that is acquired for the park.
So far, the commission has been offering $10,200 per acre, an amount that Tom Bruinooge, a lawyer for several landowners, says is laughably low. He also objects to the use of eminent domain for seizing parcels from unwilling sellers. "I have yet to see how 50 acres of degraded wetland in a mythical park is a true public purpose," he said. Mr. Ceberio, the commission director, said disputed land values will be resolved by independent appraisals.
In some ways, Mr. Ceberio's career trajectory mirrors the changes in the Meadowlands, an area that once covered 21,000 acres. He first came to the agency in 1981, working in its solid waste division, when 3,000 trucks a day came to pour their wretched cargo over man-made hillocks.
One by one, the agency shut down the landfills and today only one dump, a repository for clean construction debris, remains in operation. The dumping fees there, which total about $8 million a year, help fund an environmental center and restored marsh that sit at the edge of an old dump.
"There's been a complete change in culture and philosophy here," Mr. Ceberio said, sitting in an office that provides a quintessential Meadowlands view: wading egrets, grass-covered landfills and the arc of the New Jersey Turnpike, all of it set against a hazy silhouette of the Manhattan skyline. "I can't tell you how exciting times are right now. It's a little scary."
Dennis Elwell, the mayor of Secaucus, agreed. Nearly enveloped by swampland, the town and its well-being have always been tied to the Meadowlands. Mr. Elwell's 88-year-old father can still recall the days before mosquito-eradication campaigns drained thousands of acres of marsh and a dam in Oradell choked off much of the Hackensack's freshwater flow. During the 1970's, the area received 11,000 tons of trash a day from New York City and towns across northern New Jersey. The stench was bad enough, but things became unbearable in the summer, when uncontrolled trash fires burned for weeks on end.
"Some nights," Mr. Elwell said, "you couldn't sit in your backyard it was so bad."

HEADLINE: New York Pays for the Steak, Boston the Cigar 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
New York area residents spend more on meat and poultry than those in other large metropolitan areas in the United States, a new federal survey reports.
 San Franciscans spend more on alcohol and books. 
 Bostonians spend more on tobacco products and smoking supplies, Washingtonians more on entertainment, Chicagoans more on utilities and fuel. 
Those are among the many intriguing findings of a two-year national survey of consumer spending released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- a survey that alternately confirms and confounds well-worn stereotypes about the proclivities and priorities of residents of six of the country's largest metropolitan areas. Los Angeles was the sixth area featured in the report.
Those in the New York area ranked second only to San Franciscans in many categories: household income, average annual household expenditures, spending on housing and spending on food (except for spending on meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products, where the New York region ranked No. 1).
But New Yorkers spent less on household furnishings than the residents of any of five other metropolitan areas studied except for Boston. They spent less on entertainment than people in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, and less on reading than Washingtonians and San Franciscans.
New Yorkers spent more than anyone else on clothes. And only Boston-area residents spent less than New Yorkers on buying cars.
The study was based on interviews with a rotating sample of 7,500 households in 2000 and 2001, and on diaries kept by an additional 7,500 people for two consecutive one-week periods. The interviews covered large purchases, like appliances and cars, and regular payments, such as rent. The diaries tracked small, frequently purchased items like food and household supplies.
"These numbers are the best out there," said Michael L. Dolfman, New York regional commissioner for the bureau, a division of the Department of Labor. "We put our imprimatur on them. "Any time you sample, there's always sampling error. But in terms of the expenditure categories, we believe they accurately reflect the expenditure characteristics of American households."
The survey found that households in the New York metropolitan area spent on average $48,237 a year in 2000 and 2001, a period that Mr. Dolfman said included the beginnings of the current economic downturn and recession.
That figure was 9.6 percent higher than the average for New Yorkers in 1998 and 1999 and 24.3 percent higher than the national average for 2000 and 2001.
Housing was the largest part of the New Yorkers' spending, eating up 37.1 percent of their budget, compared to 32.6 percent nationally.
But New Yorkers spent only 15.1 percent of their budget on transportation -- less than the national average. Their out-of-pocket health care spending was almost equal to the national average, but represented a smaller percentage of New Yorkers' budgets.
"One would have expected the percentage of expenditures for health care to be larger in New York than in the country as a whole," Mr. Dolfman said, pointing to the concentration of academic medical centers and top specialists. "To me, it may be indicative that there is a large percentage of people in New York who don't have health insurance. They're not seeking health care."
San Francisco, with average annual household expenditures of $56,112, ranked No. 1 among the six metropolitan areas in spending for fruits and vegetables, vehicle purchases and education. Chicagoans spent the most on housekeeping supplies. Washingtonians led the list in spending for health care and personal care products and services, followed closely by Angelenos.

The Inverse Of A.T.M. Is V.L.T.

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
IF you are not familiar with the initials V.L.T., this may be as good a time as any to start getting used to them. They will be heard more and more as state and city budget makers look for ways to climb out of their fiscal holes.
 No, V.L.T. is not shorthand for a new sandwich, with veal instead of bacon accompanying the lettuce and tomato. Would that it were that benign. The initials stand for video lottery terminals, a fancy information age way to describe slot machines, souped-up and microchipped. These machines are about to appear by the many thousands across New York State. 
 The first to get them will be racetracks, which are increasingly being reconfigured as casinos. Indeed, a new word has been coined for them: racinos. You may have to start getting used to that one, too.
In New York City, 4,500 V.L.T.'s are to be installed at the doleful Aqueduct track, which will stay open 17 hours a day, thereby maximizing the amount of time that bettors have to throw away their money on the slots.
"You know where Aqueduct is," said State Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican from Queens who has long condemned the readiness, even eagerness, of most elected officials to turn the state into a casino manager and numbers runner.
Mr. Padavan was referring to a corner of southern Queens not noted for Park Avenue prosperity. "Nearly all the people who will be going to this 'racino' will be from the immediate area," he said. "Like any product, the more available it is, the more people will buy it."
And the more people buy it, he added, the more likely it is that some will become hooked on gambling. Several studies in recent years, including one by the New York Council on Problem Gambling, strongly suggest that the spread of state lotteries and casinos has led to significant increases in the incidence of compulsive gambling.
Those who fall prey tend to come from the ranks of those who can least afford it. Very few are like William J. Bennett, the career moralist who is reported to have lost $8 million at casinos, money that he made from his books and lectures on America's crying need for virtue.
THE expansion of state-sponsored gambling is relentless.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who shows an abiding affection for this form of revenue, has struck deals to create new Indian-run casinos. An underlying premise is that economic development for American Indians means turning them into croupiers.
The New York Lottery's Web site says that it ended the last fiscal year, on March 31, with healthy sales of $5.4 billion and net revenue of $1.8 billion. The lottery, a polite word for what in private hands is called a numbers racket, always says that its money goes to support education. Those dollars, however, get mixed in with other state revenue. It is as valid, just not as clever a marketing strategy, to say that lottery revenue supports homeless shelters and welfare programs.
"Government is in the business of adding new kinds of gambling -- they're addicted to the revenue," said Arnie Wexler, a New Jersey-based counselor on compulsive gambling and what he calls "responsible gaming programs." For four decades, Mr. Wexler has wrestled with his own gambling demons, so he knows an addict when he sees one.
"They pencil in how much they expect to come from the lottery," he said of officials, and not just those in New York State. "If they fall short, they start juicing up the game, making the jackpot higher. You get people gambling who normally wouldn't be doing that. So they bring in more money this way. But they also create more problem gamblers."
With V.L.T.'s, the temptation to spread them around seems destined to remain strong, given that lawmakers expect a state profit of $150 million in the coming year, rising the following year to $360 million.
There was talk in Albany of also installing slot machines in OTB parlors in the city, but that idea faded. For the moment.
Even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who wrinkles his nose in distaste at government's reliance on gambling money, is not prepared to just say no. "We need money," the mayor said recently. "And don't get me wrong. It may come down to one of these Hobson's choices, where you say, 'I don't like gambling, but compared to the alternative, we don't have any choice.' "
Mr. Padavan, for one, has no doubt that slots at OTB is an idea that will be revived sooner or later. You can almost say that he's betting on it.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Images of Evil's Flowering Disagree About Its Roots

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
If Jack Bauer, special agent for the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles, had been a passenger on the hijacked Achille Lauro cruise ship in 1985, things might have turned out differently. This grim hero of "24," the Fox television drama, regularly races the clock to vanquish terrorists, block assassinations and stave off catastrophe.
 So in some fantasy universe he might have thwarted the Palestinian hijackers and their murder of Leon Klinghoffer, an American Jew in a wheelchair. Bauer might even have prevented Abu Abbas, the planner of the hijacking, who was finally captured by American forces last month in Iraq, from being released from Italian custody in 1985. 
 But as even the creators of "24" know, matters are rarely so simple. And as recent events have shown, a war on terrorism also involves a war about terrorism: debates about its causes and how it is to be confronted. Now, in this latter war, accidents of scheduling have brought Jack Bauer and Leon Klinghoffer together, though not in the way imagined above and with far less heartening results. 
Tonight a filmed version of John Adams's 1991 opera about the Achille Lauro hijacking, "The Death of Klinghoffer," will receive its New York premiere at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center; it will be released on DVD later this year. Also tonight Jack Bauer will be enmeshed in one of the last two episodes of "24," struggling to bring terrorists to justice. Both the film and the series are haunted by 9/11; both also strain to resist its lessons. 
This season's "24," for example, began with revelations that an Islamic terrorist group supported by various Arab countries had obtained a nuclear weapon that it was going to detonate in Los Angeles. Each episode has chronicled another hour of those 24 as Jack Bauer and the president try to head off apocalypse. 
The "Klinghoffer" opera, of course, predated the terrorist attacks, but the British director Penny Woolcock turns it into an almost realist film, complete with historical film clips as well as 9/11-inspired scenes showing the recent spread of Islamic fundamentalism. The terror attacks may also have tempered the opera's impulse to treat the Jewish characters as banal materialists (in contrast with the more "authentic" Palestinians). One offensive episode from the original opera, in which a bourgeois Jewish family squabbles over souvenirs, bowel movements and matchmaking, was deleted from the 1993 Nonesuch recording and is omitted here. 
But "Klinghoffer," a more serious example than "24," looks far worse in the light of 9/11, which makes its skewed perspective (regularly hailed as even-handed) even more obvious. The opera is based on the idea that the "root cause" of Palestinian terrorism is Jewish sins; it accepts the terrorists' account of grievance and offers no alternative. The opening Palestinian chorus displays an elegiac historical consciousness; the opening Jewish chorus displays nothing more than the perspective of a sentimental tourist and reveals no compelling claims on our attention or sympathy.
The film, affected perhaps by 9/11, makes the terrorists seem more misguided, but paradoxically, it also amplifies their grievances. As the Palestinians sing, a group of young Jews chase innocent Palestinians from a pastoral village on the day after the founding of Israel in 1948, clubbing innocents, shooting rifles. The Achille Lauro terrorists, Ms. Woolcock suggests, have their origins in those brutalized families. Meanwhile the Jews, as victims of the Nazis, are given their own historical vignette in which they are similarly chased from their homes, only to arrive in Palestine. In Ms. Woolcock's invented scenario, a survivor, a tattooed camp number on his arm, viciously attacks the Arabs. 
Thus the film affirms two ideas now commonplace among radical critics of Israel: that Jews acted like Nazis, and that refugees from the Holocaust were instrumental in the founding of the state, visiting upon Palestinians the sins of others. 
But these ideas are both grotesque and mistaken. The Holocaust provided just the final spur in the creation of Israel. Major Jewish immigrations and land purchases in Palestine took place during the preceding half-century. (The majority of Jerusalem's population had been Jewish for hundreds of years.) 
As for Palestinian refugees, historians have shown that after Arab countries rejected the United Nations' partition of Palestine, during months of intense battles in 1947 and 1948, life became difficult for the intermingled populations and for Arab villages. Most of the 700,000 or so refugees left, as refugees have in wars immemorial, because of fear and economic disruption; many left with the encouragement of Arab leaders, many in the midst of war, and some, yes, at Israeli gunpoint. 
But Ms. Woolcock and the opera's creators unquestioningly accept the injustice theory of terrorism: the idea that it is a response to a grievous wrong. But 9/11 showed what should have been clear long before: religious delusion, cultivated hatred and totalitarian ambitions create a terrorist culture; the perception of injustice may or may not be justified. The film resists seeing such complications.
In comparison with this, of course, "24" seems a romp; its ideas must be taken less seriously because of its pop culture "Perils of Pauline" cliff-hanger absurdities. But it is still remarkably telling how uncomfortable the series becomes with the burdens of 9/11: no sooner is the Islamic bomb found and safely exploded, than Americans become the bad guys.
Regardless of what twists have taken place in the final two episodes, the die has already been cast. Americans have rioted, assaulting Arabs. And it is revealed that a conspiracy of right-wing Americans lurks behind the terrorists. These conspirators, who capture and torture Bauer, include a wealthy oil man who wants a war in the Middle East to increase his profits. They forge evidence implicating three Arab countries in the atomic bomb plot. And when the president begins to waffle on war because he thinks that the evidence is indeed fake, the vice president stages a constitutional coup. 
Absurd, yes, but the charge is familiar: the war on terror is a corrupt war waged for oil, in which Americans are the terrorists. The plot of "24," a pop-thriller version of power-drunk war mongers, resembles Noam Chomsky's nightmare version of America. Its origins are also similar: the country's flaws are transformed into exaggerated evils, inspiring sweeping indictments. So recent examples of American fallibility, at most -- a large deal with Halliburton, a document that an intelligence agency faked, scattered incidents of prejudice -- inspire self-disgust, melodrama and apocalyptic warnings of systemic rot. And terrorist guilt is mitigated.
In such a world Jack Bauer would do little good on the deck of the Achille Lauro unless he eliminated such fantastical "root causes." Not likely. But as these works of culture high and low demonstrate, whatever happens now in the war on terror, the war about terror is bound to continue.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Neuffer, 46, Reporter Overseas for The Boston Globe 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Elizabeth Neuffer, the award-winning foreign correspondent for The Boston Globe who died on Friday in in an automobile accident in Iraq, had traveled there to cover the aftermath of the war. She was 46.
 Ms. Neuffer was a passenger in a car that apparently struck a guardrail near Samarra, about halfway between Tikrit and Baghdad, The Globe said in a statement. 
 She was returning from an overnight trip to Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's ancestral home, where she had been reporting on efforts to dismantle the Baath Party apparatus that had helped enforce Mr. Hussein's government. 
Her translator, Waleed Khalifa Hassan al-Dulami, was also killed.
Ms. Neuffer became European correspondent of The Globe, based in Berlin, in 1994, and spent much of her time reporting on fighting in the lands that once made up Yugoslavia. That assignment led to "The Key to My Neighbor's House: Seeking Justice in Bosnia and Rwanda" (Picador, 2002). The book, which was well received, grew out of a 10-part series in The Globe on war crimes in those countries. 
Ms. Neuffer used two case studies, one of a Bosnian Muslim searching for information about his massacred family and the other about a Tutsi who testified about the rapes she endured in Rwanda, to study the meaning of atrocity.
In 1997, the series won the Novartis Prize for Excellence in International Journalism from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Paul D. Wolfowitz, then dean of the school and now deputy defense secretary, said the series demonstrated "exceptional qualities of reportorial perseverance, courage and commitment and brought important, unresolved issues to the public's attention."
In 1998, Ms. Neuffer won a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. In its citation, the foundation referred to a bomb explosion in a marketplace in Sarajevo in 1994 that killed 68 people.
"She helped pick up the bodies and then wrote her story," the citation said.
In 1998 and 1999, Ms. Neuffer was an Edward R. Murrow fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
She was born on June 15, 1956, in Quincy, Mass., and grew up in Wilton, Conn. She graduated from Cornell and received a master's in political philosophy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Then she became deputy press secretary to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
Ms. Neuffer moved to London, where she wrote freelance articles for The New York Times and other publications. She then worked as a reporter trainee at The Times before joining The Globe, where her first beat was federal court in Boston.
Surviving are her brother, Mark, and her companion, Peter S. Canellos, Washington bureau chief of The Globe.

HEADLINE: British Cabinet Minister Quits, Accusing Blair of Betrayal 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12 

 BODY:
Clare Short, Britain's secretary for international development, today became the second person to resign from the cabinet over Iraq, ending her six years in government with a surprisingly personal attack on Prime Minister Tony Blair in an angry speech to the House of Commons.
 The immediate reason for her resignation, she said, was Mr. Blair's "betrayal" of his promise to work for United Nations involvement in postwar Iraq and his cooperation in an American campaign to "bully" the United Nations. 
 But she went beyond those disputes to accuse him of abandoning Labor Party values and the policies of his administration in order to further his own obsessive ambition. 
She assailed Mr. Blair for becoming what she called a "presidential" leader, formulating bad policy in secret with a small group of advisers, forcing it on Parliament by "diktats" straining party loyalty and undermining public trust.
Even given Ms. Short's reputation for outspokenness, legislators who packed the chamber appeared startled at the personal animus in her statement.
"To the prime minister," she said, "I would say that he has achieved great things since 1997, but, paradoxically, he is in danger of destroying his legacy as he becomes increasingly obsessed by his place in history."
Mr. Blair was not in the House to hear her speech, but Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sat in the front row with a grim expression, and there were audible gasps and intakes of breath from the Labor benches at the ferocity of Ms. Short's comments.
By contrast, the resignation speech in March of Robin Cook, the leader of the Commons and a former foreign secretary, drew a standing ovation from the legislators. At Ms. Short's conclusion, there were only murmurs, and they seemed to be as much of astonishment as of approval.
Ms. Short has long been viewed by the restive Labor dissidents in Parliament as their only point of contact within Mr. Blair's tightly controlled Cabinet, but she squandered much of her standing with them in March when she first pledged to resign if Britain joined in the United States-led war without United Nations approval and then stayed on in her post when that occurred.
Mr. Blair was widely reported to be about to remove her in a coming reshuffle of his cabinet, and that notion gained credence today when he was able to appoint her successor within an hour of receiving her telephone call saying she was quitting.
Downing Street announced that Baroness Amos, a Foreign Office minister and the government's international development representative in the House of Lords, would succeed Ms. Short. Born in Guyana, Baroness Amos, 49, becomes the first black woman to serve in a British cabinet.
When word of Ms. Short's stepping down emerged this morning, international aid organizations put out statements praising her work and regretting her departure. A Downing Street spokesman also paid tribute to her accomplishments on behalf of the developing world, saying that her department was one of the "finest if not the finest aid departments in the world."
But by the end of her speech to the Commons this afternoon, the tone had changed. "I am sorry to see Clare go out with such fury," Chris Bryant, a Labor member and Blair loyalist, told the BBC. He called the speech "nasty and brutish."
Ms. Short, 57, had already resigned twice from the Labor front benches in her 20-year parliamentary career, and she was known for her passionately held views and held up by her followers as the conscience of the government.
Representing a Birmingham district, she came to public notice early on by championing feminist causes and drawing attention with a campaign against the daily photographs of nude women in The Sun, Britain's largest daily tabloid.
She has never shied away from confrontation in a government that has made discipline and unity its hallmarks in an effort to drive out the divisive politics that left Labor in opposition to Conservatives for 18 years. Mr. Blair cajoled her to stay in government once the war began with promises to give her and her department a leadership role in the rebuilding of Iraq in conjunction with the United Nations.
In her letter to Mr. Blair today, she said that the current draft of the Security Council resolution on Iraq, one she accused Mr. Blair and Mr. Straw of having "secretly negotiated," had undermined assurances she had been given about the authority of the United Nations. "This makes my position impossible," she wrote.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE KURDS; 
At a Teahouse, News Is Also Served

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: ERBIL, Iraq, May 11 

 BODY:
In the searing heat of the late afternoon, men in this ancient city gather in the Soran Tea House for a daily dose of backgammon, tea and gossip.
 Tea shops are at the heart of life here. They spread news faster than television. They are a place to argue, listen to music and discuss favorite things. In Sulaimaniya, a city two hours to the east, there are a teahouse for bird lovers and another for dog lovers. 
 At the Soran, named for the son of the owner, backgammon is the draw. The city's undisputed champion, Jasim Latif, 60, has been coming here every day for years. He works as a stenographer in the Police Academy in Erbil, a Kurdish city that dates back centuries. There have been many rulers perceived as occupiers by the Kurds here, the most recent Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Latif sometimes sings to the sound of clicking backgammon tiles. He is apple-shaped with an easy smile and wears thick glasses with one very loose lens that often falls out. His playing is so fast that each turn is one fluid motion flowing into the next. 
His game is legendary. He likes to tell the story of when he was younger, during the early days of Mr. Hussein, and four men in fighter uniforms and beards came up to him in a teahouse. They asked him his name. He became very afraid for his life. 
"I said, 'Yes it is me,' " said Mr. Latif, flashing his signature impish grin. 
"They said: 'We heard there was a man named Jasim who plays the best backgammon. We came to play him.' "
As Mr. Latif's game got going today, other friends arrived. A doctor from the United Nations sat down. A boy of 6 brought him tea. An unemployed journalist whose grandfather, Abdulla Ghoran, was a great Kurdish poet from the 1960's, watched the game.
Men come for the gossip as well as the games. A recent rumor in a Baghdad teahouse was that the Americans were strategically shutting off electricity in areas of the city where they wanted to keep control, just like Mr. Hussein had in years before.
"You think we come here just to play games?" the journalist, Ryzgar Azhi, asked a newcomer. "We also like to talk. We have no bars. No discos. This is where we come."
During the war, the shop was packed with men wanting to talk about the news. How far had the Americans advanced? Was Mr. Hussein still alive? Women, according to the culture, do not visit teahouses, though at the Soran today, a shabbily dressed woman sat at a table drinking a Pepsi. The men said she was crazy.
Now the men, predominantly Kurds in this mostly Kurdish but partly Arab city, speculate about why the Americans really came. The conclusions are cleareyed but glad. 
"The Americans did not come just to help the Kurds," Mr. Azhi said. Still, he said, "it's great to be free."
Many here have lost a loved one to war or to the Iraqi secret service. Mr. Azhi said that his brother was tortured and killed and that he later became a Kurdish rebel fighter. In the time of Mr. Hussein, he said, teahouses were not places where one could talk freely.
"If three people are sitting in the tea shop, four are from the Iraqi intelligence," Mr. Azhi said, recalling a wry saying from the day.
An hour later, talk became more frivolous. When, for instance, did teahouses become popular in the area now known as Iraq? Perhaps the tea came from the British, who occupied the territory in 1915 and granted it independence in the early 1930's. 
But the shops, Mr. Latif said, must have been Kurdish in origin.
"The British, you think they have the time for this?" he asked, gesturing broadly to his nearly won backgammon game.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: ASIAN FRONT; 
South Korean Leader Wants U.S. Troops to Stay, for Now

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, said yesterday that he would urge President Bush not to remove American forces from the region just below the demilitarized zone, where they have been stationed for the past half-century, until the North Korean nuclear threat had been dismantled.
 Mr. Roh was responding, in an interview with The New York Times, to plans that South Korean officials say have been discussed informally by the Pentagon. They are likely to be part of a broader discussion about how to contain the North Korean nuclear threat during a meeting and working dinner on Wednesday evening with President Bush, the first time the two leaders have met. 
 Mr. Roh's position appeared to mark something of a reversal. Years ago, he signed a declaration calling for the removal of American troops from the Korean peninsula -- an act he said yesterday was a mistake -- and he was elected late last year after widespread street protests in South Korea against the American military presence.
But since taking office early this year -- in the midst of a rapidly escalating nuclear crisis with the North -- Mr. Roh has come to embrace the status quo, saying he feared that investors would flee if they believed the American commitment to South Korea's security was weakening.
The South Korean leader said that over the long term he expected that the American troop presence in Korea could be safely diminished.
But he said, "my hope is that this plan should be reconsidered when there is no more threat from the North Korean nuclear program and when our people as well as global businessmen would feel no concern about our security." He added later that despite the street protests, there was a "psychological factor for our people" in the continued American presence along the DMZ, a line along the 38th parallel that was drawn in haste at the end of World War II, and stands today as one of few remaining dividing lines of the cold war.
Aides to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld say they believe that the American troops stationed near the border, designed as a "trip wire" against North Korea after the Korean War ended in 1953, serve little purpose in an era when South Korean forces are more capable than ever. Many Pentagon officials now question whether the American presence simply provides a tempting target for North Korean artillery.
Mr. Roh went to some lengths yesterday to emphasize that he and the Bush administration agreed on the broad parameters of how to deal with the North, and last night, in a speech to the Korea Society, he used language similar to Mr. Bush's recent statements. "North Korea has two alternatives," he said. "It can go down a blind alley, or it can open up."
Just a few hours before he spoke, however, the North said that it had "nullified" the 1992 agreement between the two Koreas that committed both nations to keep the peninsula free of all nuclear weapons. In a statement issued on the North's official news agency, the country said the agreement no longer applied "because of a sinister and hostile U.S. policy against North Korea."
Mr. Roh's interview in New York came at the end of the first full day he has ever spent in the United States. During the 30-minute conversation, he said he was "very concerned" about hard-liners in the administration who have been urging confrontation with North Korea. He said he would urge Mr. Bush to continue negotiations with the North, no matter how slow and frustrating.
"Many people are concerned that President Bush's 'peaceful resolution' principle may change in the future despite his assurance otherwise," said Mr. Roh, speaking through a translator.
Mr. Roh's visit to Washington, which begins today, comes at a critical moment in the running arguments within the Bush administration over what mix of diplomacy and threats of sanctions or force to use as North Korea moves toward what appears to be a rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal. 
Mr. Roh mentioned, obliquely, the struggle within the Bush administration over whether to keep negotiating with North Korea or to threaten it with penalties intended to bring the government of Kim Jong Il to collapse. He argued that it was far too early to consider harsh economic penalties. 
"The stronger party can afford to show some flexibility with the weaker party," he said, saying he was confident that the United States could compel North Korea to give up its nuclearprograms. But he said he was not naive about North Korea's record of ignoring agreements. 
"I don't trust North Korea that much," he said, seeming to distance himself a bit from his predecessor, Kim Dae Jung, who visited North Korea three years ago in what was viewed as a moment of reconciliation, but which produced few results.
He quickly added that "there are many ways to make North Korea stick to its agreements." Although pressed, he did not describe in any detail what ways he had in mind.

HEADLINE: Rude Awakening 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 12 

 BODY:
Only a few months ago, in what already feels like a different era, China's leaders were riding high. No one, neither critics nor partisans of the Communist Party, imagined that a viral disease was about to cause the equivalent of a national train wreck.
 The party was transferring supreme power to a younger generation in the most orderly way ever. In its blooming relations with the United States and other great powers and in its successful effort to be selected as the host for the 2008 Olympics, China was gaining the global respect it always craved. 
 After more than two decades of relative stability and speedy growth, the country had joined the World Trade Organization. If problems of inequality and unemployment still nagged, the first quarter of 2003 was enjoying a renewed burst of rapid growth. 
Now, in just a few torturous weeks, the country's politics and international relations have changed hues. The SARS epidemic and its obvious mishandling have badly humbled China's leaders at home and abroad, and jolted the society in many ways, a range of intellectuals and party officials said in interviews.
"SARS has been our country's 9/11," Xu Zhiyuan, a columnist for the Economic Observer, a newsweekly, said in an interview. "It has forced us to pay attention to the real meaning of globalization."
"China's future seemed so dazzling," he said, and that "lulled people into thinking our country was immune from the shocks of history." A recent column he wrote about the subject was titled "Farewell to a Vacation From History."
Just where the unleashed demons will lead is uncertain. But one casualty, welcomed by some scholars, may be the smug complacency many Chinese had developed about the country's political system and future.
"I think this disaster will make China's leaders more modest," said Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai Normal University.
"Everything seemed to be going so smoothly, and that allowed us to neglect our systemic shortcomings," he said in an interview. "This crisis is forcing everyone to reflect on those shortcomings, and it will sharpen people's critical sense."
Not only is SARS a serious threat to lives, but the epidemic has also exposed with embarrassing clarity -- to the Chinese people and to the world -- the costs of China's tight political control over information and bureaucracy. 
It has thrown an equally embarrassing spotlight on the backward and disorganized state of medical care, especially in the countryside, where a majority of China's people live.
Anger overseas about the months of dissembling about the extent of SARS, which almost certainly abetted the global spread of the disease, has put Chinese leaders and diplomats on the defensive. In China, as the virus becomes more entrenched, serious economic damages are looming and Chinese travelers are in danger of becoming international pariahs.
Since the government's remarkable admission of grave mistakes on April 20, accompanied by the firing of two relatively senior officials among the many who must have known about the SARS cover-up, the top leaders have gamely worked to make up for lost time. 
Hu Jintao, the president and party chief, and Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, have moved visibly around the country and filled the airwaves with exhortations to defeat the epidemic, and they appear to be winning back some public faith in the process.
If nothing more, many scholars and political experts think, a new standard of public disclosure has been set.
"For the government to be so open about an ongoing crisis is unprecedented," said Li Dongmin, director of the Social Survey Institute of China. "I hope it's a step forward to a more open society."
Even in routine party meetings, people are speaking out and raising critical questions in a way they never did before, about SARS and other issues, too, said an official of a party research institute.
The epidemic and its inconsistent official handling have been "a huge shock for the entire party," the official said. "You can sense this at internal meetings, where the atmosphere has changed and people are expressing criticisms more freely."
"The SARS epidemic is forcing us to rethink the whole theoretical framework for government that was developed under Jiang Zemin," he said, including the blindered emphasis on social stability and economic growth.
"We're seeing that growth and stability need to be balanced by social development and equity," the official said.
With his vigorous, if belated, counterattack against the disease, Mr. Hu appears to be consolidating his grip on the party and government much more quickly than many experts expected. When he succeeded Jiang Zemin in November, Mr. Jiang packed the ruling council with his proteges and stayed on as chairman of the military, and seemed a genuine rival for supreme authority.
Now, to salvage China's reputation, as well as to protect its health, Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen have brought in highly competent technocrats, previously associated with the former prime minister, Zhu Rongji, and with economic affairs, to run the Health Ministry and Beijing's anti-SARS campaign.
Wu Yi, a deputy prime minister and former trade negotiator, has been put in overall charge of fighting SARS.
Mr. Jiang remains a political force and still seems to control the military, but his near total silence on the SARS threat and that of his proteges on the Politburo have been widely noticed. 
If the epidemic runs wild in coming months, political analysts say, Mr. Hu could yet lose ground. But if the medical and economic problems become too severe, the entire party leadership may be discredited and in peril, some experts say.
So far the worst predictions about the spread of SARS have not come true, at least if current disease reporting is close to accurate. China reported 75 new confirmed SARS cases today, including 48 in Beijing -- lower daily numbers than were being reported a week ago. To some, they were a sign of hope that the epidemic might have crested, at least in Beijing, which is now the epicenter.
But international experts warn that information on where and how the virus has spread through Beijing remains too sketchy. They are also especially worried about the danger to interior cities and provinces, where medical monitoring and care are seriously deficient.
Almost no one expects the SARS challenge alone to force basic changes in one-party rule or to end political controls on the media.
Even the new official candor, while involving an outpouring of facts, has been carefully scripted from above, and the voluminous news reports have been shaped to flatter the leaders and present a society unified in heroic struggle.
Riots in several cities and towns, by fearful populations trying to keep SARS patients out of their neighborhoods, have not been reported in the official media. Whistle-blowers who exposed the now condemned cover-up of cases and deaths have been silenced rather than officially lauded.
The most hopeful view of some party thinkers is that long-discussed proposals to allow a modest increase in press freedom, improve public oversight of officials and promote more democracy inside the ruling party will gain new strength. Others, noting how quickly the propaganda apparatus has moved to extol the leaders' performance and pre-empt any radical critiques, say that is wishful thinking.

HEADLINE: Pataki Defends An Old Budget Despite the Gap In a New One 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 12 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today fiercely defended his handling of last year's budget, even as some prominent Democrats in Albany questioned his truthfulness and called for his budget director, Carole E. Stone, to step down.
 In an unusual display of combativeness, Mr. Pataki said there was no way before the election last year to foresee the magnitude of the $11.5 billion budget gap the state faces this year. At the time, late last October, Ms. Stone said the state would emerge with its $716 million in rainy day money intact, though she predicted revenue would decline. 
 Bombarded by reporters' questions on the issue, the governor denied that he, or members of his administration, had played down the seriousness of the state's looming fiscal crisis in the weeks before the November election. 
"No one knew what to expect, I don't think," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference this afternoon. "Whether or not the financial services industry would continue to be down. Whether or not the stock market would come down. We had very unique circumstances over the last year and a half."
On Dec. 5, five weeks after the polls closed and Mr. Pataki was governor for a third term, his administration revealed a $2 billion hole in last year's budget and a greater problem looming for the next year. That figure grew to nearly $11.5 billion over two years, leading the Legislature to pass a budget that will raise the state sales tax and the personal income taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, as well as borrow $4.2 billion to cover expenses.
In recent days, some opponents of the governor, including Senator David A. Paterson of Harlem, who is the leader of the Senate Democrats, have raised questions about Ms. Stone's performance. Mr. Paterson said that if she worked for him, he would move her out of her current job.
"People have gotten fired for doing less," he said.
But Democratic elected officials have said it is her boss, Mr. Pataki, who should be held accountable.
"There's somebody responsible for the misinformation that comes out, and when you have a leadership position, the buck stops at the governor's office," Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said today. He questioned whether Ms. Stone was directed to put out a message of fiscal calm before the election.
Mr. Pataki said it was sad to see Mr. Paterson engage in a personal attack on Ms. Stone, "one of the finest budget directors this state has ever had." Ms. Stone has worked in the budget division, for Republicans and Democrats, for more than 25 years, aides to the governor said.
Those aides later pointed out that the Pataki administration received additional data between Oct. 30 and early December, showing that the economy was deteriorating and that this would hurt the state's budget more than it had anticipated.
The administration was told that the New York's economy, as measured by employment, was performing worse than expected, the aides said. The securities industry indicated that Wall Street bonuses were going to be lower than anticipated. And, with the continuing decline in the stock market, it became clearer than ever that taxes on capital gains would be dismal.
But others sounded the alarm sooner, including Mr. Pataki's fellow Republican, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, and H. Carl McCall, the former Democratic comptroller who was Mr. Pataki's opponent in the governor's race. Mr. Bruno said in September that the state could be facing a $10 billion deficit, a report that Mr. Pataki disputed at the time. In a series of interviews, a diverse group of budget watchdogs, Wall Street analysts and political scientists concurred that the state's budget problems could have been more thoroughly understood before the fall election, and should have been.
They also said that the response to the current crisis was deeply flawed, with neither the governor's budget nor the one presented by his legislative opponents a model of budgetary responsibility.
The public showdown over the two budgets is expected to peak on Wednesday, when Mr. Pataki is likely to veto large chunks of the Legislature's $92.8 billion budget. The Legislature is expected to override the vetoes quickly.
But even with a state budget in place as soon as this weekend -- still more than 40 days late, but earlier than in the past, when it was as many as 126 days late -- the debate over its merits is likely to linger for months.
One political analyst said the proposed cures to the state's budget ills were tantamount to treating a life-threatening disease with an ice bath.
Neither budget will solve New York's long-term financial imbalance, which will lead to a new budget crisis in just a few months, the analysts said.
Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist who is the dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences at the State University of New York in New Paltz, said both the Legislature and the governor had been guilty of waiting too long to address problems that should be evident.
"Essentially, what both sides are doing is trying to buy time until things get better, and the premise that things will get better fast is problematic," said Mr. Benjamin, a Republican and formerly an elected official in Ulster County. "There also comes a time where that doesn't work; you get into such great difficulty that buying time is not an option."
Mr. Benjamin said that of all the elected officials, the governor is the one from whom voters most demand leadership.
"In the totality of circumstances, the governor is being very disingenuous," he said. "The crisis was there and others pointed it out." He added that he believed the budget problem was not being addressed during the election.
While Mr. Pataki and the state's top two legislative leaders have spent the spring attacking each other on New York's fiscal calamity, its roots go back to mid-2000. As Wall Street peaked midway through the state's fiscal year, the state's spending continued to far outpace inflation, rising by 8.8 percent, according to Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller.
In 2001, after the technology bubble burst, and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks hit the heart of the financial sector, the Legislature and Mr. Pataki added 5.2 percent in tax-supported spending.
Seven months later, in a gubernatorial election year, the Legislature and Mr. Pataki ignored continuing signs that the economy was weakening and approved another budget that increased spending.
All along, as revenue declined, the state paid for its billions of dollars in additional spending with money accumulated in the robust years of the 1990's. It also repeatedly tapped other one-time infusions of cash, like a windfall from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield from a nonprofit insurance company to a profit-making corporation.
Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said that in retrospect, the state's troubles could have been predicted.
In its January budget presentation, the Pataki administration said that high-income taxpayers, who make up 3 percent of all tax filers, paid more than 51 percent of the personal income tax in 2000, making the state particularly vulnerable to any problems in the financial services sector.
"The difference between New York and other states is that, as it went through calendar year 2001, after Sept. 11, into calendar year 2002, that almost every state was taking drastic actions to address this hemorrhaging of their revenue and New York did little to recognize and address the problem," Mr. Kurtter said.

HEADLINE: As Funds Disappear, So Do Orchestras 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

 BODY:
After the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra finished playing Wagner and Tchaikovsky to an audience of 1,300 in Boca Raton on Friday, the orchestra's executive director, Trey Devey, took to the stage to announce that this might be its last concert.
 "If you have the potential to help us and be a hero, then call us," Mr. Devey pleaded. "We need a hero." 
 No one called, at least no one with the necessary resources. Later Mr. Devey issued a statement saying the orchestra was "temporarily suspending operations and terminating the employment of musicians." 
The apparent collapse of the Florida Philharmonic, the only major orchestra in South Florida, is the latest in a series of tremors that have shaken the symphonic world this season. Nearly a dozen orchestras across the country have either closed or are in danger of doing so.
This season's first orchestral casualty was the San Jose Symphony, which shut down in November. The Tulsa Philharmonic, the Colorado Springs Symphony and the San Antonio Symphony followed.
In February the 49-year-old Savannah Symphony Orchestra canceled the rest of its season. It was $1.3 million in debt, had gone through five executive directors in seven years and was unable to meet its payroll.
The musicians of the Houston Symphony went on strike for three weeks in March and April and in the end were forced to settle for a contract that imposed sharp curbs on wages and benefits. Their counterparts at the Baltimore Symphony accepted a similarly harsh contract after what their union leader called "difficult and painful consideration."
The Pittsburgh Symphony, one of the country's major ensembles, is facing a $2 million deficit, and its board has proposed selling its concert hall. It will also begin what are likely to be difficult labor negotiations this summer. 
Earlier this month dozens of musicians from the 66-year-old Louisville Orchestra appeared in formal attire at the city's unemployment office to file for benefits. They had not been paid for three weeks, and their orchestra faces an $800,000 deficit.
Several orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, have recently issued emergency appeals to donors. Although the Philharmonic is in no danger of collapse, some others say they may not reopen next season if their appeals are not successful.
Orchestra administrators blame their woes on the weak economy, but critics say many of them have failed to adapt to changing times.
Ed Wulfe, a Houston real estate developer who helped mediate the dispute in his city, said "a combination of lethargy and 'that's the way it's always been done' thinking" had shaped the culture of the Houston Symphony "and probably a lot of orchestras across the country."
"This is a competitive world, and we've got to find ways to tell the story better, to get out into the community, to reach out to new audiences," Mr. Wulfe said. "It takes people with some imagination." 
The plight of the Houston Symphony reflects the challenges that orchestras are confronting across the country. Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, has had a full-size symphony orchestra since 1972. Mr. Wulfe said the orchestra was vital. "We realize that to attract business, to attract broad-minded, innovative, creative people, we have to offer more than just a job," he said.
Critics of orchestra management are not so sure. They suggest that if a city cannot come up with the money to support a symphony orchestra, perhaps it does not need one.
Some cultural figures say it is hard to sell classical music in places where much of the population has no direct connection to the northern European cultures that produced most of it. Others lament that many universities today emphasize career training over the humanities, allowing students to reach adulthood without any exposure to fine arts. Still others share Mr. Wulfe's view that orchestra administrators are too slow moving and unimaginative.
"I don't think there's a deep systemic problem that's unique to symphony orchestras, since airlines and hotel chains and hockey teams are also suffering from this economic downturn," said Henry Fogel, who is about to leave the top administrative post at the Chicago Symphony to become president of the American Symphony Orchestra League. "During the great economy of the 1990's orchestras perhaps expanded faster than they should have. I believe that in really good economic times orchestras should not spend up to their revenues and should instead go for a surplus and keep a cushion for the future. I wish I'd believed that 10 or 15 years ago."
Mr. Fogel said some orchestras were run by insular groups that did not inspire donor confidence. "Are there enough people in a city who want an orchestra and are willing to support it?" he asked. "That becomes a difficult and tricky question when you ask whether an administration or board has done all that can be done in garnering that support, or if it has not done enough."
Those questions have been raised repeatedly in Houston. Ann Kennedy, who was hired in 2001 as the Houston Symphony's executive director, had never before run an arts organization, and some active in the city's cultural life said she had not managed to energize either the orchestra or donors. Her board is also considered weaker than those guiding the Museum of Fine Arts and other more successful Houston arts institutions.
"Somehow this board didn't become the board to go on in Houston, and that's very difficult to fix," said an arts administrator who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he deals regularly with the Houston Symphony. "When you have the wrong mix, the people of real power don't become interested in joining. It's going to take somebody of importance in the community stepping forward and taking responsibility for reshaping the board, and the board allowing itself to be reshaped."
The musicians' strike in Houston ended with the signing of a contract that calls for the cancellation of 10 concerts in the season, cuts in staff size and salaries, higher health care premiums and mandatory unpaid furloughs for musicians.
Partly because of tensions stemming from the labor dispute, nearly a dozen musicians have left the orchestra in recent months, either permanently or temporarily. A union survey suggested that 80 percent would leave if they had a good offer elsewhere. "The mood has changed," said Houston's music director, Hans Graf.
This season has forced many orchestra administrators to recognize the need for a new approach, but they are uncertain what it should be.
"There has to be a sea change in the way these organizations are run," said Jeffrey B. Early, a banker who is completing a two-year term as president of the Houston Symphony's board. "We have to find ways of putting more people in the seats."
Mr. Early said he hoped the Houston orchestra's new associate conductor, Carlos Miguel Prieto, who was formerly music director of the Xalapa Symphony Orchestra and associate conductor of the Mexico City Philharmonic, would find ways to attract more Hispanic patrons.
"And we've got Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' coming up," he added. "We ought to be able to fill the hall with that."

HEADLINE: Dollar's Neighbors Feeling Uneasy 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 13 

 BODY:
Canadians tend to disparage their dollar, calling it the loonie (after the loon depicted on the one-dollar coin) or, when it was sinking to historic lows against the American dollar in 2001 and early 2002, the northern peso. Now many Canadian businesses find themselves wishing that the currency would live down to its reputation.
 After spending most of 2002 not far above its low of 62 American cents, the Canadian dollar has risen smartly in value this year, reaching 72.12 cents today, its highest level in more than five years. That means Canadian exporters get 14 percent less of their own money for every American dollar they earn. 
 With 85 percent of Canada's exports going to the United States, exporters are feeling the pain. So are many others, from investors, who rely on dividends from American stocks, to the domestic film industry, which has counted on a favorable exchange rate to attract movie and TV productions from Hollywood.
At this time last year, Classic Seafoods of Oyster Pond, Nova Scotia, was selling one-third of its live hard-shell lobsters to supermarkets and restaurants in the United States. Now sales are down about 10 percent, and American customers account for just one-fifth of Classic's business, according to Richard Murphy, the company's general manager.
Mr. Murphy said the rampant Canadian dollar was responsible. "We have to make a certain margin," Mr. Murphy said, and while the company has tried to raise its prices to compensate for the less favorable exchange rate, "in most cases, the customer won't accept that." In the end, he said, "everybody has to take less money, but ultimately it's the fisherman who has to bear the brunt of it."
Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a trade association based in Ottawa, said last week that the jump in the Canadian dollar "is threatening profit margins across Canadian industry and will be a significant drag on economic and employment growth this year."
To make matters worse, Barry M. Wainstein, the head of global foreign exchange and precious metals at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said that the Canadian dollar's appreciation "has been so quick, and the extent so dramatic, that very few exporters have had time to hedge their receivables."
Of course, there are also those who gain from the strong currency, including importers, Canadians traveling abroad, and borrowers whose debts are denominated in American dollars. AT&T Canada cited the effect of a more favorable exchange rate on the cost of repaying its debts as the main reason it was able to post a profit of 229.8 million Canadian dollars ($165.4 million) in the first quarter of 2003; it lost 157.6 million Canadian dollars ($113.4 million) in the comparable period in 2002. 
Cheaper imports can benefit the economy by sharpening competition and by encouraging businesses to invest in the latest foreign-made machinery and software. The trade minister, Pierre S. Pettigrew, told the Canadian Chamber of Commerce last week that the appreciating currency "will be a healthy pressure on our productivity."
Edward Carmichael, the chief economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Canada, predicted that cheaper imported goods, especially food, would reduce Canada's inflation rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent by the autumn, from a high of 4.6 percent in February.
Some of the shift in the loonie's fortunes stem from the American dollar's decline against many currencies around the world, including the Japanese yen, the euro and the Mexican peso. But Canada's relatively high interest rates, stepped up five times in the last 14 months by the Bank of Canada out of concern over inflation, have also lifted the Canadian dollar by making it more attractive to foreign investors. The yield on five-year Canadian government bonds has risen to 4.1 percent; comparable United States Treasuries are yielding about 2.5 percent.
While the United States is running huge trade and current-account deficits, Canada's current account remains in surplus. The national government and several provinces are running budget surpluses as well, in contrast to the worsening budget problems in Washington and many state capitals. 
"In a world that is looking for yield and looking to disinvest from the United States, Canada is attractive," Mr. Wainstein said.
Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters has called on the Bank of Canada to take a more cautious approach to monetary policy, and even to consider lowering interest rates. Analysts differ on whether the central bank will heed the exporters' urgings.
With inflation moderating and the domestic economy showing signs of softness, Mr. Carmichael said he believed that "the Bank of Canada will now go on hold for the rest of the year." But Marc Levesque, a senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, told clients last week that he expected the Canadian dollar to climb above 73 American cents by the end of June, and that two more increases in the Bank of Canada's overnight rate later in the year were "a good bet."

HEADLINE: Once-Weakening Peso Rebounds, Creating Economic Commotion 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 13 

 BODY:
Two months ago, Mexico's financial authorities were worried that the peso was weakening too fast and that too many dollars were piling up in the country's reserves. Now, economists and business people say the government's moves to address those issues have created the opposite problem: the peso has become too strong. 
 The peso hit a low of 11.2300 to the dollar on March 10, and has shot up in value by 10 percent since then, reaching 10.1125 to the dollar today. 
"For every reaction, there is an overreaction," said Edgar Amador, economist for Latin America in Mexico City at Stone & McCarthy, a consulting firm. 
The higher the peso rises in value against the dollar, the more expensive and less competitive Mexican exports become in the United States, by far the country's most important foreign market. America buys nearly 90 percent of Mexico's exports. High oil prices in the spring poured dollars into Mexico's central bank. 
Mexico's foreign-currency reserves, an important bulwark against financial crises, now stand at a healthy $53.7 billion. But the reserves are a mixed blessing for the Bank of Mexico, which is obliged to "sterilize" them by selling peso bonds in offsetting amounts. Because it must pay more interest on the peso bonds than it can earn on its holdings of dollars, kept chiefly in United States Treasury securities, maintaining the reserves costs the bank money.
In March, the bank and the Mexican Finance Ministry said that the reserves were getting too big and expensive to hold, and announced that a predetermined number of dollars would be sold daily to limit the size of the hoard. For the three months ending July 31, the bank is selling $32 million a day for pesos.
Analysts saw in the plan a bid to stem a fall in the peso, which dropped sharply at the beginning of the year after a steady slide from its high of 9 to the dollar in April 2002.
"I suspect that there is a lot of commotion at the Bank of Mexico and Hacienda," said Yianos Kontopoulos, global currency strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York, referring to the central bank and the country's finance ministry. 
The move appeared to coincide with a shift in investor sentiment away from the dollar, because of geopolitical uncertainties, and toward Latin America, where stability was improving and the yields were better. The result was a rapid run-up in the peso, and in some other currencies in the region. 
"Latin currencies are having a rally that appears excessive to me," Mr. Amador said.
There is also an element of speculative fervor in the shift, according to Gray Newman, Latin America economist for Morgan Stanley in New York, who said that the traders who bet on the momentum of changes in the currency had magnified the peso's moves in both directions over the last year.
Market speculation was the only cause Mexican authorities came up with for the fall in the peso early in the year. The central bank, worried that the peso's weakness would translate into inflation as Mexicans would have to pay higher prices in pesos for imports, had tightened monetary policy five times since last September.
The bank does not rely on a benchmark overnight interest rate as many other central banks do; rather, it increases or decreases the amount of cash it makes available to the banking system. At its most recent meeting, on Friday, the bank voted to leave its policy unchanged.
But the money markets have gone the other way as inflation fears have abated. The yield on 28-day bills, the most widely watched Mexican treasury security, has fallen to 4.9 percent from 9.7 percent on March 13.
Major exporters say that they can weather the loss of competitiveness from the peso's rise so far.
"It would be very negative to leave a market just because the peso is 10 percent more expensive," said Enrique Flores, a spokesman for Alfa, a Monterrey-based conglomerate with interests in petrochemicals, steel, food and auto parts.
But other parts of the economy may be more vulnerable, analysts and executives who are critical of the government said. 
"All this stupidity of selling oil dollars on the open market is not needed," said Eugenio Clariond, chairman and chief executive of Grupo Imsa, another company based in Monterrey, which exports steel and auto batteries. "Mexico needs to have strong reserves, and the revaluation of the peso particularly does not help the productivity of the most badly affected sector, the agricultural sector."
Farmers in Mexico complain that they cannot compete against subsidized American farmers, whose corn and beef have been made cheaper in Mexico by the strong peso.
The question now is how long the peso will go on rising. A midterm election in July could return a divided Congress and continue political gridlock, dashing investors' hopes of significant reforms. 
"My view for the end of the year is that we are still likely to see the peso close to 11" to the dollar, said Mr. Newman of Morgan Stanley. "I'll believe in a robust recovery in the United States and its effect on the Mexican economy when I see it."

HEADLINE: Driven by What He Wishes He'd Learned 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
He never attended journalism school himself, and he has taught only one journalism course. 
 But Nicholas Lemann, the New Yorker correspondent who recently agreed to become dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said that in his 31 years as a writer and editor he has often thought about things he wished he had learned in graduate school. 
 Things like statistics, and the ideas of Plato and Machiavelli and Madison, and whether war is ever justified. Those longings have shaped his vision of what the journalism school might be and his decision to take on the job of revamping it. 
"The primary driver here," Mr. Lemann said, "was me stumbling through life as a journalist and keeping an inner tally of things I wished I knew."
He is taking the dean's position at a tempestuous time. Columbia's president, Lee C. Bollinger, set off a firestorm last year by suggesting that the school placed too muchemphasis on craft -- reporting and writing -- and not enough on educating aspiring journalists in issues like political theory and economics. It is a debate that has split the school's faculty. 
Mr. Lemann, 48, an affable man with abundant patience and self-confidence, seems unconcerned about stepping into the ferment. He has a clear idea of what he thinks the school should look like, and is eager to try it.
"Look, this is a big challenge, an experiment," he said in an interview. "I wouldn't be leaving my job at The New Yorker if it weren't couched this way by Lee Bollinger. Not all experiments work. But something will happen."
The starting point, he hopes, will be the proposal he presented to a task force on the future of the journalism school that Mr. Bollinger convened this year. It outlined a two-year program heavily rooted in academic learning, and it closely parallels Mr. Bollinger's own thinking.
One of Mr. Lemann's specific proposals was a course examining different ways of "searching for truth," studying the forms of evidence demanded by people in fields like law, economics, psychology, statistics and philosophy. He also suggested that first-year students take courses in great literature and great ideas. In their second year, students would specialize in a substantive major, like science or religion or economics, and produce a journal, similar to a law review.
Mr. Lemann (pronounced lemon) would not toss out craft altogether. But he proposed that the intensive teaching of basic reporting and writing skills that is the core of Columbia's 10-month program be concentrated in a three-month summer program before the regular school year begins. Students would also take newsroom workshop courses both years.
Mr. Lemann said he did not expect the journalism school to embrace his plan wholesale -- or even that any pieces will be adopted quickly -- and he said he planned to consult widely before any change takes place.
Still, he said he hoped that the school could conduct a small experiment, offering a second year to perhaps 20 or 25 students with the school paying their way as an incentive, though he added that it would take time to raise money and create the curriculum.
"Curriculum change is evolutionary," he said. "There is not one moment where everything is changed by diktat overnight."
Some critics, like Robert J. Samuelson, the Washington Post columnist, have suggested that such training is too high-minded for a press corps that produces more short daily stories for suburban papers than lengthy articles in intellectual journals like The New Yorker or The Washington Monthly.
Mr. Lemann has two answers. One is that a graduate school in an Ivy League university is not training the average journalist.
"Most journalism schools are undergraduate programs," he said. "So having a stand-alone graduate program at an Ivy League university is a different beast."
"You try to identify people who might be leaders in the profession," he added. "In addition to training people to write stories, you train them in analytic modes that will be useful throughout their careers."
His second response is that while the academic training he proposes may sound high-minded, it should be especially useful to daily journalists.
"When something complex comes up, you'd like to know what are the theoretical basics of the issue," he said. 
"The first layer of journalism is just learning how to do it, to see life in terms of events," he added. "But if you are a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School, you ought to get to a place in your career where you can do more than just that. You ought to be explaining, contextualizing, analyzing -- doing more than saying this happened yesterday."
Nor is he troubled by arguments that journalists cannot afford two years.
Two years, he said, is a minimum for students to absorb the ethos of a university and its ways of thought. Besides, he added, students in other professional schools, including divinity, social work, the fine arts and education, typically spend two or more years in graduate work, and they often earn less than journalists. 
Mr. Lemann will not assume the dean's mantle until September. He had budgeted a few weeks for finishing an article for The New Yorker, and the summer for finishing a book on post-Civil War Reconstruction. 
But after completing the New Yorker article -- it ran in Monday's issue -- he quickly found himself consumed by Columbia. Every day -- sometimes several times a day -- he has chatted by phone or e-mail with Alan Brinkley, Columbia's incoming provost.
"This is Day 3 of my post-New Yorker period," he said last Wednesday. "And so far I have spent full time working on Columbia. I have not found a balance yet."

Bucking theTide, eBay Expands in Silicon Valley

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., May 8 

 BODY:
Last month, eBay, the Internet auction company, brought some welcome news to a city and region that have been suffering from one of the worst office market slumps in the nation. The eight-year-old company, which had toyed with giving up its headquarters here, announced that it would not only keep its West San Jose complex but would also buy a 32-acre campus from the software developer Novell on the opposite side of town.
 The eBay deal, which still must undergo an environmental review, would allow the company to expand gradually, thereby avoiding the mistakes made by other highflying Silicon Valley companies that overcommitted themselves during the economic boom of the late 1990's and are now stuck with empty or only partly occupied buildings because of the slide in the technology industry. 
 Almost half of the 511,000 square feet of space in the five aluminum-and-steel buildings of the Novell campus is leased, leaving just 260,000 square feet for eBay to occupy in the immediate future. The company won several unusually generous concessions from the city that will allow further expansion to as much as two million square feet. 
But should eBay stop growing, said the city's economic development director, Paul Krutko, the company will be able to sell its development rights. "This deal also provides an exit strategy for eBay," Mr. Krutko said.
Though the eBay deal lifted spirits, especially among city officials, it will have little effect on vacancy rates in the Silicon Valley, which by its broadest definition includes Santa Clara County, where San Jose is located; San Mateo County; and Fremont, in southern Alameda County. Santa Clara County alone has lost 200,000 jobs since 2000, about half of the job loss in the entire state. Evidence of the downturn is everywhere -- from the empty parking lots in front of office parks that are only a few years old, to the quiet atmosphere of downtown San Jose and the easily flowing traffic along freeways that were once congested.
A newly completed 17-story blue-and-tan skyscraper near the San Jose Convention Center that can be seen for miles has no tenants for its 380,000 square feet, and Boston Properties has shelved plans to put up three buildings across the street with a total 850,000 square feet, said Bob Pester, the regional manager for the developer.
Of the valley's 166.7 million square feet of space for high-technology research and development, 21.3 percent was vacant as of the end of the last quarter, compared with 2.3 percent for the peak of the market in the second quarter of 2000, said Charles W. Harry Jr., the managing director of the analytics advisory group for Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate company. The vacancy rate for the office market of about 70.9 million square feet stands at 27.8 percent, compared with 1.8 percent three years ago, he said. The vacancy rate for the high-technology market is the worst it has been since the second quarter of 1993 while the office market has not been this soft since the first quarter of 1987, Mr. Harry said.
The numbers may not be the worst ever, but with 14 million square feet of high-technology space added in just a few years, many people in the industry expect the recovery to take a frustratingly long time. "This is the worst market in the Silicon Valley that we've ever seen," said Raymond W. Marino, the president of Mission West Properties, a publicly traded real estate investment trust that manages 7.8 million square feet, primarily in Silicon Valley. "In all prior downturns, we've always had a new company that was just coming into its own. This time, everyone is just stalled."
Average annual asking rents in the research and development market were $15.41 a square foot in the last quarter, compared with a peak of $57.13 at the end of 2000, Mr. Harry said. In the office market, rents have dropped to $27.34 from a height of $69.68, according to Cushman & Wakefield. C. Michael Kamm, the chief executive of BT Commercial, a Northern California company, said "rents have fallen to levels we haven't seen in seven or eight years."
As their need for space evaporated, some companies paid dearly to get out of their leases. It cost Handspring, the personal organizer manufacturer, $75 million to extricate itself from plans to move from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, said Brian Jaquot, a company spokesman.
But in Silicon Valley, as in other high-technology areas, the typical lease runs only 5 to 7 years rather than 10 to 15 years. So while space available for sublease accounts for a substantial portion of the vacancies right now -- 13.2 million of the 35 million square feet of empty research-and-development space, according to BT Commercial -- many of those leases will expire in a year or two, shifting the burden for filling the space from tenants to landlords.
In anticipation, many landlords and tenants are working deals to "blend and extend" their leases, in brokers' jargon. Mr. Marino said he was working out one such deal with a San Jose technology company that needed only 45,000 of the 120,000 square feet that it had leased until September 2004. Under the proposed new terms, the company would extend its lease for the 45,000 square feet at market rates through May 31, 2008, and the $2.3 million in rent due on the remaining 75,000 square feet would be spread out (with an undisclosed amount of interest added) over the five-year term.
One measure of how bad things are, said James J. Curtis III, a partner in Bristol Group, a real estate investment company, is that some buildings used to command annual leases of $70 a square foot (without utilities); now space is being sold at the same price.
That is slightly more than the South Bay Development Company of Campbell, Calif., paid for an empty 359,000-square-foot building in the city of Santa Clara that it acquired in August from Nortel Networks. Built in 1975, the building was completely remodeled in 1999 at a cost of $100 a square foot, said Mark J. Regoli, a South Bay partner. 
In November, his company bought a 78,000-square-foot property in Sunnyvale for $5 million; the seller, Qwest communications, had paid $25.2 million for the building the previous December, he said. "For us," Mr. Regoli said, "we view the next 6 to 24 months as a good opportunity to accumulate."
Real estate prices have fallen so far that the 3Com Corporation, a leading maker of computer-networking equipment, recently took its 900,000-square-foot Santa Clara campus off the market. Brokers and investors said the company could not even get an offer of $100 a square foot, about one-third of what the complex cost to build. EBay has not disclosed what it paid for the landscaped Novell campus, which includes a reflecting pool; tennis, volleyball and basketball courts; jogging paths; a gymnasium; and an espresso cafe as well as a cafeteria. But one real estate specialist familiar with the negotiations said it fetched just under $185 a square foot.
San Jose city officials were so eager to keep eBay in town that they abandoned their plans to buy an adjacent 15-acre vacant site from Novell to use in connection with a major airport expansion program. Instead, Novell will sell the land to eBay.
As an Internet company, eBay does not generate sales tax revenue for San Jose, but it has 1,500 employees who spend their paychecks locally, Mr. Krutko said. "EBay is what you call a 'gazelle company,' " Mr. Krutko said, "It doubles in size every five years. There are very few of those companies around."

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM THE MIDDLE EAST; 
Paving the Past, Keeping an Ear to the Ground

BYLINE:  By Daniel J. Wakin 

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 13 

 BODY:
A small bulldozer in recent days has been spreading fine sand over the rocky beach belonging to the Movenpick Hotel, one of the gleaming new buildings that have sprung up here since the Lebanese civil war ended about 13 years ago. The beach will soon be ready to receive its wealthy guests from the Persian Gulf region and elsewhere; the rocks will remain lodged underneath.
 In all sorts of ways, the Lebanese are laboring to pave over the recent past, from 1975 to 1990, when sectarian violence killed 150,000 people, reducing the "Paris of the Middle East" to a landscape of war, kidnapping and terror. 
 Lebanon has done a remarkable job of patching itself together. Peace seems well established, especially with the departure of the Israeli military from southern Lebanon in 2000. The restoration is unmistakable, even if the destruction is still evident. 
Yet the question remains implanted in many Lebanese minds: Could civil war ever return to this tormented land of Shiite Muslims, Maronite Christians, Sunnis, Druse and others?
It is an especially interesting question these days for two reasons. There is new pressure on Syria, which has guaranteed the peace here, to withdraw its military presence. There is also a new country next door -- American-governed Iraq, another war-afflicted Arab nation wondering how to govern a country with a large Shiite population and host of other religious and ethnic groups.
Here, under what is known as the confessional system, political power is divided between religions: the president is a Maronite Christian; the speaker of Parliament a Shiite Muslim; and so on. The groups fought each other in various pairings throughout the war, with the Palestinians, Israelis and Syrians taking part at times.
But the system is widely regarded as anything but secure. In Lebanon, "we are worrying it could happen again," said Farid Salman, an author and former magazine editor. He added: "Not a single problem was resolved. We are still quarreling about the identity of our own country."
Certainly, the past is still palpable here. Battle-scarred buildings abound, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians still live in squalid townships, military arsenals are said to remain intact and much of life is still organized according to religious affiliation.
The groundwork for the peace was laid with a 1989 peace accord guaranteed by Syrian troops, who remain and are widely resented. But with the United States turning its attention after Iraq to Syria, the question of their presence is being raised. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's call during a visit here for "all, all" foreign troops to leave Lebanon resonated.
But without the Syrians, would there be security? The bomb blast outside a Dutch missionary's apartment in Tripoli last week, explosions at Western restaurants and the assassinations of judges have left many people worried.
But there is also a widespread feeling among older people that the country is too war weary for a return to arms.
"We have an inner feeling against war," said Khanjar Hamieh, director of the Islamic Legal Institute, a university for clerics in Beirut. "All Lebanese have suffered from the war -- economically, politically, everything. If someone would now call for a war, nobody would answer, neither Christian or Muslim."
Younger people do not seem so sure.
"Our religious guys are taking us to civil war," said Abbas Abdallah, 18, who described himself as a Communist and poet. 
He was standing on the corniche, crowded with Sunday strollers, watching a group of his friends putting on a display of in-line skating worthy of Central Park, with somersaults and aerial twists. 
At the cafe Casper & Gambini's, a chic downtown locale, Leah Boukhater, 20, was not optimistic. 
"If you give them arms now, I think it would start again," she said. She and Tonnie Choueiri, also 20 and a fellow student at Notre Dame University in the nearby town of Jounie, said the mainly Christian student body was heavily politicized.
The camping club is sympathetic to the Phalange, the right-wing Maronite faction; the social club backs the faction loyal to Michel Aoun, a former army commander; the debate club favors the Lebanese Christian militia.
"There's never a day when we don't talk about this," Miss Choueiri said. 
Miss Boukhater said, "Confessionalism in Lebanon: this is the problem." 
The "problem" seems to bode ill for Iraq.
The students got up quickly to reach home in time to see a reality-based television show about the choosing of Miss Lebanon. 
A young man who had heard the conversation came back and spoke quietly. He asked that his name not be used. 
"Me, as a Christian Lebanese, I'm ready to go kill Syrians," he wanted a reporter to know. "They killed my family, man."
In this region, there is no shortage of people who want revenge. As a result, deliverance from a violent past seems elusive.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widened in March to Near Record 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The trade deficit widened in March to the second-largest on record as imports of oil jumped, a government report said today.
 The nation imported $43.5 billion more in goods and services than it exported, after a revised $40.4 billion shortfall in February, the Commerce Department said. The March total compares with a record $44.9 billion deficit in December. Analysts had expected a $41 billion deficit. 
 Crude oil imports reached a record in March amid concern that supplies would be disrupted by the war in Iraq. The United States was rebuilding stocks after the Venezuela strike in December and January virtually halted that country's oil exports. At the same time, rising oil prices caused economies worldwide to stall, and anxiety about the war froze business spending. Even as a weaker dollar may increase exports, economists said they expected little narrowing of the trade gap.
"Away from energy, we don't expect much of an improvement in the trade balance over the next few months," said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. "Other economies are still quite weak, with growth very sluggish, so we don't expect the demand for exports to increase much."
The decline in the dollar may have contributed to a 2.9 percent increase in imports, to $126.3 billion, the second highest on record, behind September 2000. Goods ordered months ago and delivered in March cost more because the dollar has fallen 10 percent against the euro this year. Imports from Western Europe surged in March to a record as the trade deficit with the region rose to $7.8 billion from $6.6 billion.
The value of crude oil imports hit a record $9.1 billion from $7.5 billion the previous month. March imports were 300.7 million barrels of oil, up from 247.1 million in February. The price of crude eased to $30.27 a barrel from $30.46 in February.
Imports of autos and parts rose 2.1 percent, to $17.2 billion, in March. A record 3.53 million imported vehicles were sold, topping the record of 3.52 million set in October 2001, when automakers offered no-interest loans after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Americans bought 1.5 percent more foreign-made consumer goods, including $4.4 billion of pharmaceuticals, while businesses spent 0.1 percent less on capital goods.
Exports rose 0.6 percent, to $82.8 billion in March from $82.3 billion the previous month. Shipments abroad of semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products increased. Consumer goods exports rose 5.6 percent, to $7.3 billion in March, after declining 7.5 percent in February.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- New Jersey; 
Xanadu in the Meadowlands: Exotica Close to Home

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
Three years ago Mack-Cali Realty, of Cranford, N.J., made a forceful move to expand its focus beyond the Northeast, announcing the intention to acquire another large real estate investment trust in Texas. But after Wall Street analysts criticized the plan and the stock price dropped, the company's chief executive, Mitchell E. Hersh, called off the nearly completed deal, pivoted back in the direction from whence he came and renewed concentration on Mack-Cali's core market, the Northeast.
 "Ancient history" is all Mr. Hersh wants to say now about the abandoned merger with Prentiss Properties of Dallas. These days Mr. Hersh, who has been affiliated with Mack-Cali through various company evolutions for 29 years, has fresh business to discuss. 
 In February, the company, which controls 16.2 million square feet of commercial space in New Jersey -- nearly 10 percent of the state's total, vacant or occupied -- was chosen to handle the $1.3 billion redevelopment of the Meadowlands Continental Arena site in a joint venture with the Mills Corporation of Virginia.
The Mack-Cali and Mills proposal to build an entertainment and convention venue called Xanadu was chosen over two other entries by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority -- and then withstood a court challenge last month by a rival developer, Hartz Mountain Industries, which contended that the selection process had been unfair.
The authority is still required to hold an administrative hearing on Hartz's protest. And Hartz, known for the tenacity of its legal maneuvers, can appeal to a higher court. But the state agency is free to negotiate its contract with Mack-Cali and Mills for the venture, and Mr. Hersh said: "We are in the process. It's moving right along."
Between Mack-Cali and Mills, the agreement is to share the 104-acre project in a way that reflects the expertise each company brings to the partnership. Mills will have an 80 percent share of the retail component, and Mack-Cali 20 percent. Mack-Cali will have 80 percent of the office and hotel assets, and Mills 20 percent.
Mills is known for its shopping and entertainment centers in major cities around the country. On Friday, it will open a prototype Spanish version of Xanadu. Like the proposed Meadowlands Xanadu, it will feature a domed indoor ski slope and a children's mini-city. The Meadowlands center will also have an extreme-sports park, a small stadium for lacrosse and minor-league baseball, a wildlife museum and other entertainment along with shopping.
Mack-Cali considers its expertise in areas outside shopping to be as strong as Mills's is in retailing. "For the office center and hotel, we have the best credentials," Mr. Hersh said.
Last summer, Mack-Cali opened the Hyatt Regency South Pier Hotel at its Harborside Financial Center on the Jersey City waterfront in a joint venture with Hyatt. In September, it opened two office towers at Harborside, a huge waterfront parcel including two piers that was purchased in 1996: Harborside Plaza 5, a 34-story, 980,000-square-foot space partly occupied by financial and pharmaceutical companies, and Harborside Plaza 10, a 19-story, 577,000-square-foot space. Plaza 10 is fully leased by the Charles Schwab Corporation, though Schwab has sublet about half the building. 
In November, Verizon New Jersey opened the doors at a new 95,000-square-foot office built by Mack-Cali at its Horizon Center Business Park in Hamilton Township.
In the meantime, Mack-Cali keeps moving aggressively to sell properties in what Mr. Hersh considers noncore markets. Last fall, it sold its last three office properties in Arizona. In December, a total of 13 office properties outside the Northeast were sold, generating total revenue around $200 million. On March 31, the company announced that it had sold an office building in Houston for $5.8 million. And in April, it sold Stadium Gateway, an Anaheim, Calif., office building in which it held a 65 percent interest jointly with Highridge Partners of El Segundo, Calif., for $52.5 million.
Mack-Cali still owns about 25 properties outside the Northeast -- some 750,000 square feet in Texas, 1.5 million square feet in Denver and a million square feet in San Francisco. 
"Our focus is squarely on being a powerhouse in the Northeast," Mr. Hersh said. 
Last week, he provided a generally upbeat report on the first quarter, and Mack-Cali paid a dividend of 63 cents a share, up from 52 cents a year earlier. The stock, which has risen sharply in recent months, has ranged from $26.64 to $35.45 in the last year. Yesterday, it eased 4 cents, to $33.68. 
Mr. Hersh said the properties in Mack-Cali's portfolio were 92.4 percent leased, up a bit from 92.3 percent in the last quarter of 2002. A total of 155 leases covering 1,018,926 square feet were concluded in the first quarter. Of these, 373,973 square feet were for new leases and 644,953 square feet were renewals, which Mr. Hersh said he tried to keep "an exceedingly close eye on" these days in the weak economy.
"You want to keep tenants in place, and rental income flowing when the general picture is uncertain," he said. "It's basic smart business, and that is what we do."

Lower Supply Raises Oil Prices

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose to their highest level in four weeks yesterday after the International Energy Agency said inventories had tumbled 10 percent from last year. Bombings in Saudi Arabia, the world's top producer, also contributed to the rally. 
 Oil supplies held by the 30 nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ended March at 2.34 billion barrels, down 260 million barrels from a year earlier, according to the agency, which advises industrialized countries on oil policy. Prices have gained 10 percent this month on expectations of further drops in supply. 
 "The I.E.A. believes that inventories are critically low," said James Fiedler, an oil broker with Man Financial Inc. in Rome, Ind. "The Saudi bombings are another sign of disenchantment in the country. There is the potential of instability."
Crude oil for June delivery rose $1.15, or 4.2 percent, to $28.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest one-day increase since April 17 and the highest closing price since April 22.
President Bush called the suicide bombings, which occurred shortly before midnight Monday and early yesterday morning in Saudi Arabia, "despicable" and said the United States "will find the killers." The attacks came just before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in Riyadh.

Shares Decline Slightly on Weak Results From Wal-Mart

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Weaker-than-expected revenue at Wal-Mart Stores helped set off a round of profit taking on Wall Street yesterday, leaving stocks with moderate declines.
 Analysts said the market had little reaction to the bombing attacks in Saudi Arabia, which killed eight Americans. 
 While investors are growing more confident about the market, analysts expected some retreat after two consecutive winning weeks for blue-chip stocks and a four-week winning stretch for the broader market. 
"It should be a minor pullback," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn. "You have had this surge in the market and this surge is very different than the other rallies." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 47.48 points, or 0.5 percent, at 8,679.25. The loss was moderate compared with an advance of 235.51 over the previous two sessions.
The market's broader gauges also gave back some recent gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.81 points, or 0.3 percent, to 942.30. The Nasdaq composite index declined 1.72 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,539.68.
Despite the declines, the mood of investors has been much more upbeat, particularly since companies reported surprisingly strong first-quarter profits. Investors had feared more downbeat results, this time because of the buildup to war in Iraq.
The more positive outlook was clear yesterday when investors kept declines in check despite disappointing news from Wal-Mart and news of car bomb attacks in Saudi Arabia. 
"The overall tone of the market is very good, despite the negative news and concerns that this market is getting overextended," said Brian Bush, director for equity research at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark.
Wal-Mart fell $1.21, to $55.49, after meeting analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations but missing their revenue estimates.
The El Paso Corporation slipped 16 cents, to $7.50, on first-quarter profits that missed analysts' expectations by 5 cents a share.
Brokerage house downgrades pressured other individual stocks. Cisco Systems fell 20 cents, to $16.47, after Sanford C. Bernstein cut its rating to underperform from market perform.
The dollar rose against the euro yesterday after John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, called for a sound currency to help the economy. In New York, the euro settled at $1.1519, down from $1.1541 Monday.

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News) -- Benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose for the sixth trading day in seven yesterday, dropping yields to a two-month low, on speculation government reports this week would show that inflation was slowing.
Investors are focusing on the April producer and consumer price indexes after the Federal Reserve raised speculation it might cut interest rates in warning last week about the potential for "an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation." Economists predict both indexes, which are due tomorrow and Friday, fell last month.
The 10-year note climbed 10/32, to 100 5/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.61 percent from 3.65 on Monday. And the 30-year bond rose 20/32, to 111 29/32. Its yield dropped to 4.61 percent from 4.65 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Death in Riyadh 

 BODY:
The deadly suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia serve as a reminder -- if anyone needed it -- that the threat of terrorism out of the Middle East is still very much with us.
 The attacks, which seem to have killed at least 20 people, were aimed at several compounds that house Westerners working in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Within the walls of the compounds, non-Muslims are able to replicate something akin to the lifestyles they had back home. American expatriates see them as a means of maintaining their own cultural preferences, for free mixing of the sexes and the availability of alcohol and uncensored movies, within the strict Wahhabi religious dictates of Saudi society. But Islamic fundamentalists have always been affronted by the enclaves, and for terrorists, the compounds serve as a handy symbol of the modern Western culture they despise. Attacking them also ensures intense publicity. 
 The Saudi government, which relies on foreign workers to support key parts of its economy, understands that it must move quickly to root out the people who strove to make a political point by plotting yet another murderous attack. That is the obvious first step. The second must be internal reforms that will reduce the population of unemployed, angry, disenfranchised young people who connect the United States with a government that ignores their problems.
The Bush administration is already embarked on a plan to take American troops out of Saudi Arabia. That is a smart idea that will eliminate one target of fundamentalist ire, put our soldiers where they can be more easily protected and give the Saudi royal family an opening to begin making political and economic concessions to its restless people. Nothing that happened this week should deter the administration from pursuing that plan.
Many in the Western world will always view the tragedy of Sept. 11 as being about America, but to the people who carried it out, the terrorist attack was as much about Saudi Arabia. The United States is a supporting player in the terrorists' own internal political drama, which centers on fundamentalist religion, a grandiose vision of their own role in world affairs and an anger at the Saudi government's alliance with non-Muslim Western nations.
The Bush administration hopes to replace that story with a new one, involving democracy, economic opportunity and liberty. It would begin with a new era in Iraq, the road to peace in Israel and increasing democratization in other Arab nations. Right now, with chaos in Baghdad and foot-dragging by Israel, that path looks treacherous. But it is the best current chance for a way out, toward a future in which suicide attacks on innocent civilians will be understood by Muslims around the world not asa form of political protest, but as utter insanity.

HEADLINE: Striving to Punish Cuba, U.S. Expels 14 of Its Diplomats 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The United States ordered the expulsion of 14 Cuban envoys today for "inappropriate and unacceptable activities," a common diplomatic reference to spying.
 The mass expulsion of Cuban diplomats is among the most sweeping ever undertaken by Washington in a long history of tit-for-tat ousters. It comes as the Bush administration is studying ways to punish Havana for its recent imprisonment of scores of government critics and human rights advocates. 
 The State Department notified the Cuban government this morning that seven diplomats from Havana's mission at the United Nations in New York, and seven officials at Cuba's de facto embassy in Washington, were being given 10 days to leave the country. 
"In response to certain inappropriate and unacceptable activities, the United States has decided to take strong action," said Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman. The Cuban diplomats in Washington were declared persona non grata, requiring their prompt departure, Mr. Reeker said.
The United Nations envoys, under a separate procedure, were ordered to leave for actions "deemed to be harmful to the United States."
Mr. Reeker declined to discuss the charges against the Cubans, referring questions to the F.B.I. Bureau officials did not respond to requests for comment.
"I think you're all familiar with the record of espionage by the Cuban regime against the United States," Mr. Reeker said. "It's a long record."
Officials at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which functions as an embassy in the absence of diplomatic relations, did not respond to requests for comment.
Administration officials privately insisted that the expulsions were independent of an overall review of Cuba policy following the crackdown on dissidents and the swift execution of three would-be ferry hijackers.
But administration officials have said for weeks that they were considering a wholesale reduction in the Cuban diplomatic presence in the United States as part of a menu of possible actions to be unveiled by the White House in coming days. Among the other options are curtailing cash payments to Cubans from their relatives here, restricting Cuban immigration, placing new curbs on already limited trade and enhancing United States government broadcasts to the island.
John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said the expulsions might be part of a drive by hard-liners in the administration to toughen the American position toward Havana and thwart moves in Congress toward greater liberalization.
Without discounting the possibility that the envoys engaged in spying, Mr. Kavulich, whose council advises businesses interested in investing in Cuba, said, "From what I know, they're far more political casualties."
There was no immediate reaction from Havana, but American officials braced themselves for retaliatory steps. In recent weeks, Cuban officials have complained bitterly about contacts between the top American diplomat in Havana, James Cason, and various dissident leaders, many of whom have since been sentenced to long prison terms.
The State Department refused to identify the Cubans being expelled, except to say that they did not include the chiefs of mission in Washington or at the United Nations.
The Associated Press said the third- and fifth-highest officials at Cuba's United Nations mission, Adrian Francisco Delgado Gonzalez and Alfredo Jose Perez Rivero, respectively, were among those told to leave.
The United States and Cuba have spied aggressively on each other throughout the four decades since the Cuban revolution. American intelligence operations were dealt a severe blow in the early 1990's from a counterespionage campaign by Mr. Castro that left Washington with few human sources on the island, government officials acknowledge. 
In recent years Cuba has been more successful in deploying agents, even placing some in some top United States posts.
The most prominent of these was Ana B. Montes, a Pentagon analyst with influence over Cuba policy, who was sentenced last year to 25 years for spying for Havana. In 2000, a senior United States immigration official, Mariano Faget, was convicted of passing secrets to a Cuban diplomat, and a circle of Cuban spies known as the Wasp Network rattled South Florida two years earlier with efforts to penetrate exile groups and a military base.
Washington expelled four Cuban diplomats in November in response to the Montes scandal. Irritated by the restrictions placed on Mr. Cason and other diplomats in Cuba, the administration has also compelled Cuban diplomats here to seek State Department approval for routine purchases or hires, saying it insists on parity of treatment.

HEADLINE: Bills on Tax Cut and Debt Are Set to Collide 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans repaired the faulty bill number today that had delayed their tax-cut legislation, but immediately ran into more substantive criticism from Democrats challenging an increase in the nation's debt ceiling.
 The bill number had been incorrectly chosen by the Senate Finance Committee last week, and to fix the parliamentary problem the committee met hurriedly tonight and re-approved the bill to cut the nation's tax revenues by $350 billion over 10 years. The committee's action means that debate on the tax bill will begin on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to conclude with a final vote on Thursday night or Friday morning. 
 But by coincidence, the tax bill has come up at the same time as an urgent request from the Treasury Department to increase the nation's debt limit by $984 billion -- the largest increase ever -- to make room for the nation's growing budget deficit.
The vote on increasing the limit, which has already been approved by the House, is scheduled for Friday, but many Democrats took advantage of the juxtaposition of the two votes to denounce the Republicans for driving the nation further into debt with their tax cuts.
"The great irony now is that Republicans are seeking the biggest increase in the debt in our nation's history at the same time as they are pushing for a massive tax cut, and none of this adds up," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. "This policy of increasing spending and increasing the tax cuts when you've already got record deficits can only lead to one result, and that's more and more increases in the national debt."
Mr. Conrad and other Democrats said they would ask for a smaller increase in the debt ceiling, perhaps half the size requested by the Treasury, in order to force the matter to come up again in a few months. The request is likely to be defeated by the Republican majority, however.
Congress raised the debt limit by $450 billion last year, and Democrats made it clear today that they intended to use every future request for an increase to criticize the administration's economic policies. They unveiled a new "debt clock" today that measures the size of the national debt, and announced they were opening an "economic recovery room" off the Senate chamber where Democratic senators could go to denounce the White House.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, unveiled a mock credit card with President Bush's picture on it, drawn on "The Bank of Our Children's Future," which was stamped as over its credit limit.
But Republicans said the increase in the ceiling was the result of spending on the war and domestic security, and would eventually fall once the tax cuts stimulated the economy.
"Our tax cuts do affect the deficit in the short term," said Senator Bill Frist, the Republican leader, "but in the mid- to long term, the economy grows, tax revenues increase and jobs are created. The medicine that we have to take in the short term is an increase in the deficit. But the future benefit far outweighs the short-term pain."

HEADLINE: The Mayor of Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Nossel; Suzanne Nossel is a former senior adviser to the United States mission to the United Nations.

 BODY:
The American-led effort to restore stability in Iraq is off to a rocky start, in part because of the United States' reluctance to acknowledge its occupation for what it is. By equivocating on how fast it would relinquish the reins to a locally chosen government, the Bush administration sowed confusion for its own appointed officials, and for the Iraqi people. 
 More than a month into the de facto occupation of Iraq, the United States decided last Friday, in the draft resolution it proposed to the United Nations Security Council, to embrace its role as an occupying power. Its decision should be welcomed. Though the connotations of occupation are mostly negative, making America's status official will benefit both Iraqis and the international system. By citing the 1907 Hague and 1949 Geneva conventions, the United States and Britain propose to serve as formal trustees -- roles governed by international laws that the Iraqi people, and the world, can monitor and try to enforce. 
 The law of occupation is rooted in the notion that sovereignty cannot be taken away through force. The Hague Convention obliges occupiers to put the interests of the occupied first: they must respect, as much as possible, laws already in force in the territory and restore order. In 1949, the law was expanded to ensure humane treatment, food and medicine.
The law of occupation is useful for Iraq mainly because it establishes clear lines of accountability for putting the country back on its feet. The first duty of an occupier is to establish a system of "direct administration" over the occupied population. In doing so, the United States will put itself on the line for success or failure in a way that retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner's ill-defined mandate scrupulously avoided. If Baghdad's citizenry still suffers from spotty electricity, rotten garbage on street corners and poorly equipped hospitals, there will be no doubt where fault lies.
Rather than a muddy division of responsibilities among the United Nations, local authorities and coalition forces, an official occupation makes clear that the buck stops with the United States and Britain. The proposed division of labor, wherein the United Nations' special representative will fulfill specific roles under a British-American umbrella, protects against what happened in Somalia, where the United Nations was blamed for American misjudgments. 
Putting management of Iraq squarely in American hands will also help ensure that the United States won't finance its foreign policy goals inadequately, as it has in the past. The former United Nations administrator for Kosovo, for example, had to beg the Security Council for money to pay for the police and electricity.
Official occupation may also prove useful for those who question America's role in Iraq because of lucrative reconstruction contracts granted to United States companies. International law judges the validity of an occupier's acts based on whether they smack of self-service. During World War I, Germany seized Belgian coal reserves to feed its war machine, the action was judged as self-interested and invalid. The same was true when Israel siphoned oil from the Sinai in the early 1970's to meet its population's needs. In contrast, when the United States and Britain occupied the Rhineland after World War II, they avoided economic spoils and thus gained legitimacy. Today, with the help of the internationally supervised oil disbursement audits called for in the American draft, the world can again hold the occupiers to this high standard.
Countries avoid the law of occupation and its constraints to evade accountability. In Iraq, America's acceptance of these dutiesis a sign not of imperialism but of responsibility.

HEADLINE: Brandeis Scholarships Create Unlikely Partners in a Program to Foster Peace 

BYLINE:  By CLAIRE HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Maisa Khshaibon, a senior at Brandeis University, spends many of her evenings laughing and joking with her best friend, Marina Pevzner, a junior. Their conversations go beyond classes and clothes, and often turn to human rights, suicide bombings and the future of their homeland, Israel. 
 Ms. Khshaibon, a Palestinian, met Ms. Pevzner, an Israeli Jew, at Brandeis, in Waltham, Mass., just west of Boston, and they became friends through a scholarship program with an unusual purpose: to encourage young Jews and Palestinians to create a more peaceful coexistence. 
 Since 1996, eight students have received the scholarships, and some acknowledge that against the constant violence at home their American-born friendships and common dreams might seem small. But they say they are convinced that peace must begin from friendships like their own, and from the recognition that their futures are intertwined. 
Ms. Khshaibon and Ms. Pevzner love to cook together and go dancing, at an Arab disco. 
"She is like my sister," Ms. Pevzner said. "If something happens in Israel, she is the first person I call." 
Last summer when news of a bombing at Hebrew University in Jerusalem flashed across television screens, Ms. Pevzner said, she and Ms. Khshaibon sat on the couch together and watched the coverage with a shared sense of heartache. 
In 1948, Brandeis was founded by Jews and named after Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jewish justice of the Supreme Court. Today roughly half of the more than 3,000 undergraduates are Jewish. The idea for the scholarships came from Jehuda Reinharz, the university president. 
"I have no illusion that this program can change the world or even the Middle East," Dr. Reinharz said. "But if I can plant some seeds of change, it would be fantastic." 
Alan B. Slifka, a New York money manager and philanthropist, financed the scholarships, each more than $160,000 in tuition and living expenses over four years. Mr. Slifka is chairman of the Abraham Fund Initiative, a nonprofit group that has sponsored programs to promote coexistence in Israel for more than a decade. He recently gave Brandeis $5 million to create the first master's degree in coexistence studies.
Dr. Reinharz and Mr. Slifka say they have been careful to keep the scholarships from becoming entangled in politics, and the undergraduates may take any courses they want. The scholarship holders say they see a Palestinian state as essential for peace. But given Israel's troubled economy and its paucity of jobs, their majors include not just sociology and conflict studies, but also business and computer science. 
The first two scholarship winners graduated in 2000, and two more, including Ms. Khshaibon, will graduate on Sunday. 
"I hope they all go back to Israel," Mr. Slifka said. "Because they have a country to build."
Yoav Borowitz, 28, the first Jewish graduate using the scholarship, returned to Tel Aviv and is now a sports reporter for Ha'aretz, a daily newspaper. "Coexistence comes into play with everything I do," he said in a telephone interview. He recently finished an article on the integration of Arab students into soccer teams, a topic he had to fight for, as some of his editors found it odd.
Forsan Hussein, 25, the first Palestinian to win the scholarship, now works for Mr. Slifka's nonprofit group in New York. He plans to attend Johns Hopkins next fall to do graduate work in international relations and economics, focusing on the Middle East. 
"I am a very hopeful person," he said. But, he added, the current generation of Israeli and Palestinian leaders does not "have the vision, nor the inner power to make peace."
"It is about time for young people to take over, people who don't think in terms of adverseness, but mutuality," Mr. Hussein said. 
Nearly all the students learned about the scholarships through a network of summer camps and school programs for Arabs and Jews. 
Ms. Khshaibon said she had attended an Arab elementary school with only one computer while the nearby Jewish school had immaculate rooms filled with computers. Now she is completing an economics major, with an eye toward helping build the economy, because, she said, "it is hard to maintain peace when our country is so poor."
Ms. Pevzner, who came of age in the more tranquil times after the 1993 Oslo peace accords, said her parents had "become increasingly far right" since the violence had escalated. "My parents are supportive of me, but increasingly we have more fights," she said. Concerning her 14-year-old brother, she noted, "When I was my brother's age, I demonstrated for peace, and now he is demonstrating for war." 
Still, she said, her family welcomed her friend when she visited.
Ms. Pevzner and Ms. Khshaibon have organized a weekly dialogue group, the heart of coexistence activities at the university. For two hours, 22 students gather behind closed doors at the student center, talking about the most divisive issues. Recent topics included discrimination against Arab-Americans and the war with Iraq. "The dialogue groups are always the most painful after the suicide bombings," Ms. Khshaibon said. 
After graduation, Ms. Khshaibon plans to work and attend graduate school in the United States.
Ms. Pevzner won a fellowship as an instructor in coexistence exercises in Sri Lanka this summer. "Unfortunately, conflict resolution is a field that can be applied to every country in the world," she said.
Still, she added: "My heart belongs to Israel. The more the violence gets worse, the harder it is to be away."

HEADLINE: Pataki Offers Plan To Rescue the City 

 BODY:
A day before he had promised to veto the State Legislature's budget, Gov. George E. Pataki unveiled a plan to bail out New York City that avoids raising taxes but counts on money from gambling, leasing a water tunnel and selling off city assets. 
 The governor would add video lottery terminals to Off-Track Betting teletheaters and help the city refinance its lingering 1970's debt, but not transfer the burden to the state. 
 The plan was viewed as an attempt to answer critics who say he has not done enough to help the city through its economic crisis. But many city and state officials scoffed, calling the proposal a fiscal gimmick. And it came as a new poll revealed that his approval rating had slipped to its lowest level in eight years.

HEADLINE: A Free Trip For Advocates Of Rent Rules 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 13 

 BODY:
The New York City Council has spent $75,000 in taxpayer money to help galvanize city residents and even bus them here today to lobby state leaders to support rent regulations.
 Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said he paid $27,900 to charter 31 buses for the nearly three-hour trip to Albany. About a dozen council members either rode the buses with their constituents or traveled separately and joined them later at a political rally here that drew more than 1,500 people. 
 Mr. Miller's aides said they had managed to secure a discount on the buses, paying about $100 less per bus than the other groups attending the rally. 
"I don't see how paying for buses is different than paying for fliers or for a town hall meeting or anything else," Mr. Miller said as he left the Capitol this afternoon. "We acted to give our constituents a chance to join us in raising our voice in Albany. I think it's an entirely appropriate use of our dollars."
His aides also confirmed that the Council had spent about $47,000 in April to distribute a newsletter promoting the rent issue to more than a quarter of a million city residents. Previous newsletters have focused on education and budget issues, they said.
But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and others said the City Council should not have used taxpayer money for such a purpose, especially given the city's financial crisis. Calling the Council's action "totally inappropriate," Mr. Bruno said it showed that the Council had misplaced priorities at a time when the state was trying to help the city fill its budget gap.
The rally, which was organized by the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, was meant to put pressure on Gov. George E. Pataki and Senate Republicans to renew and expand a state law, due to expire in June, that offers certain rent protections for people in rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. Assembly Democrats have vowed to back the law.
The rally quickly turned raucous this afternoon as protesters spilled into the Capitol. They blocked the steps and hallways outside Governor Pataki's second-floor office and chanted loudly, many in Spanish, for him to take action.
Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for the governor, said that he, too, disapproved of the Council's use of public money. "At a time of fiscal crisis, when all New Yorkers are being hit with higher taxes, the governor believes that all government entities should focus their resources on the core missions of government."
Aides to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declined to comment.
The Council's expenditure was first reported by Crain's Insider.
Several legal experts pointed out that the City Charter did not prohibit elected officials from using public funds to support a particular political position.
"This is one of the tough questions about where you draw the line between politics and government," said Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "On the one hand, you don't want taxpayer money to take sides. On the other hand, elected officials make a call about what they think is in the interests of their constituents."
Mr. Russianoff said that while he would have used private money to hire the buses, such practices were common. He likened it to city health department ads that publicized the dangers of secondhand smoke.
Several council members said they supported Mr. Miller's decision. Councilman James E. Davis of Brooklyn, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Miller, said that "it's not inappropriate because we're trying to get the message to Pataki that we're serious about rent control and rent laws."
The Council's finance chairman, David I. Weprin of Queens, said that during the last fight over rent protection laws, six years ago, many older residents and others complained about being left out of the process. He said that some of those residents were anxious about the outcome of the current fight, and called the Council's spending "a way to alleviate some of that stress."
"I don't think $70,000 is a large amount in the scheme of things," he said.

HEADLINE: College Graduates Lower Sights In Today's Stagnant Job Market 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C., May 12 

 BODY:
In years past, most seniors at the University of North Carolina ignored the recruiters from Newell Rubbermaid, the maker of dishwashing gloves and Calphalon cookware, dismissing the company as another unfashionable manufacturer. This year, the handful of students Newell hired as management trainees became minor campus celebrities, simply because they had secured jobs months before graduation.
 When North Carolina seniors receive their diplomas here on Sunday, only about 15 percent of them will have jobs awaiting them, half the percentage that did a few springs ago, according to a university estimate. Another 25 percent will enroll in graduate school, leaving about 6 in 10 seniors without a long-term plan come Monday morning. 
 The nation's class of 2003 was the last one to enter college while the stock market was still rising, but it is graduating into the worst hiring slump in 20 years, one that is now into its second year on campuses and has afflicted young and well-educated workers to an unusual degree. 
Corporations, after cutting their hiring of new graduates by 36 percent between 2001 and 2002, are hiring about the same number of graduates as they did last year, according to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
"We definitely picked the wrong time to be graduating from college," said Morgan Bushey, 21, who will make about $200 a week teaching English in France, after having been rejected by seven law schools. "We just have to hold on with our fingertips for a few years until we can do what we really want to do."
The lack of jobs is the main reason that applications to medical school increased this year for the first time in seven years, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Applications to law schools jumped 10 percent, after having risen almost 18 percent last year. The number of people taking the Graduate Record Exam, the standardized test required for most doctoral and master's programs, rose to its highest level ever, after declining through much of the late 1990's. 
Meanwhile, applications to Teach for America, which recruits college graduates to teach for two years in public schools in poor neighborhoods, have more than tripled in the last two years; Wendy Kopp, the program's founder, said the economy appeared to be one reason. Americorps, the national service program that pays $9,300 a year, and the Peace Corps have also become more popular and more selective.
College seniors have reacted to their poor timing with a mixture of anxiety and level-headedness. Many recall the signing bonuses and stock options offered to graduates a few years ahead of them and wonder how their own careers will get started.
"There is a haunting sense of insecurity," said Michael Barlow, a senior here who hopes eventually to work in the Foreign Service and is still looking for a job. "It is terrifying to be out of school with no job lined up and ready to go."
But few of them express the frustration that is common among older unemployed workers who know that their long-term prospects have dimmed and who have dropped out of the labor force in large numbers during the last two years. 
Asha Rangaraj, a North Carolina senior from Monroe, La., recalls that her brother, two years older than she is, was hired out of college to work for Bill Gates's money manager "really without any experience." She, on the other hand, endured a few unpromising interviews before deciding to enroll in North Carolina's master's program in accounting -- in large part because 99 percent of its graduates get jobs, she said. 
Still, Ms. Rangaraj said: "I think it's definitely temporary. Everybody has that feeling -- two or three years, and everything will be back to normal."
The change has been particularly unpleasant in Chapel Hill, home to one of the country's most selective public universities, whose lush campus sits just a few miles from Research Triangle Park, the once-booming technology cluster. 
But seniors on every campus -- big and small, Ivy League and community college -- are struggling to find entry-level jobs that they want, college officials say.
"It's pretty grim," said Jack R. Rayman, the director of career services at Pennsylvania State University. Its graduate-school fair drew thousands of students this year, filling large ballrooms in the student union. 
Over all, the unemployment rate for people ages 20 through 24 rose to 10.1 percent last month, up from 9.9 percent a year earlier and less than 7 percent in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate for the entire work force was 6 percent last month.
Courtney Flaks, 21, a senior at the University of North Carolina from North Brunswick, N.J., said her plan was "just to go home and annoy people for jobs. I don't have any idea how long it's going to take."
Ms. Flaks, who is seeking a job as a graphic designer at a magazine, had a summer internship at Seventeen magazine and recently won a competition to redesign the nameplate of a campus literary magazine. Even so, she has had little success just finding openings to apply for. 
"I finally have an interview, kind of," Ms. Flaks said, of an upcoming visit to Conde Nast, the publishing company in New York. "It's an exploratory interview. I don't know what that means." 
Many of this year's success stories have come at companies like Newell that were the antithesis of excitement during the dot-com craze of the late 1990's. This year, however, excitement requires little more than an offer of a good-paying job.
According to Marcia B. Harris, the director of career services here, North Carolina's biggest recruiters -- and thus hottest companies -- include Newell; Enterprise Rent-a-Car; Ferguson Enterprises, a distributor of plumbing supplies, and Modern Woodmen of America, an insurer.
Newell has a management trainee program that is hiring 400 college graduates this year across the country.
By contrast, Accenture and Ernst & Young, consulting firms that specialize in technology and that each hired 25 seniors at the peak of the boom, hired a combined total of three or four this year, Ms. Harris said.
Jon Narveson, another senior, from Asheville, N.C., came to Chapel Hill expecting that he would end up at a computer company, he said. He will instead move to Charlotte this summer and oversee Newell products at some Lowe's home-improvement stores in the area.
"Whether it's fashionable or unfashionable doesn't matter to me," Mr. Narveson said. What matters, he said, is that he likes the Newell executives he met and that they seem eager to help him learn the business.
The students who have been accepted by Teach for America or the Peace Corps, in spite of this year's odds, express similar gratitude.
After watching many of last year's seniors return home after graduation without jobs, Stephanie L. Scott adopted an attitude of "whatever it takes," she said. As a backup, she and a friend met in a library for two hours, three times a week over the course of two months, to study for the G.R.E. But her first priority was Teach for America, and she will begin teaching in Louisiana this summer.
"Right now, it almost doesn't matter what you're doing," said Ms. Scott, who is from Goldsboro, N.C., and was the first person in her family to attend college. "If you have a job, people look at you like, 'You're so lucky.' "
In fact, many seniors said that the last few months had given them a sense of rejection on a scale they had never before felt. Ms. Bushey said she could not help but compare applying to college, when she was accepted at North Carolina before Thanksgiving, to the string of law-school rejections she received, including some from places she had thought of as safety schools.
Some juniors here said they were already preparing themselves for similar experiences next year.
"When we were going into school, there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm to go get your four years of education and then get a job," said Matt Tepper, North Carolina's student body president, who will remain on campus for both sessions of summer school after struggling to find a paid internship. "Now it seems like everybody is going to law school."

HEADLINE: Suspected SARS Outbreak in a Hospital Deals a Setback to Taiwan 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 13 

 BODY:
This island may have suffered another hospital outbreak of SARS, the leader of the fight against the epidemic here said today.
 The country now has had 228 probable cases of SARS and 25 deaths, which means that it has surpassed Canada and is rivaling Singapore for the third worst outbreak, after mainland China and Hong Kong. 
 The possible new outbreak is at Chang Gang Hospital, a modern 2,000-bed center in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan's largest city. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have sent a team to investigate. 
At least 2 female patients sharing a room and 10 nurses have fevers or other symptoms, and about 100 people who have had contact with them have been quarantined. Only one nurse has tested positive for the strain of virus that causes SARS, but current tests are not accurate until a patient has been sick for days.
Dr. Lee Ming-liang, the former health minister who is in charge of fighting the epidemic, said the first reports did not reach him until Sunday, which he was "not happy" about.
The latest outbreak seems to have begun with one of the female patients, a transfer from Jen Chi Hospital in Taipei. Jen Chi is near Hoping Hospital, where Taiwan's biggest outbreak occurred in mid-April when a laundryman with SARS was admitted as a cardiac patient and spent four days in a ward with 40 other men.
Before that misdiagnosis was caught, several patients had transferred to Jen Chi. Both hospitals were closed in April, so any former Jen Chi patient should have been watched carefully, which is why Dr. Lee was irritated.
The director of Hoping Hospital was dismissed on Monday. A city official said the dismissal was intended "to give Hoping a fresh start," but the director has been accused of trying to cover up the outbreak. The hospital, now disinfected and partly rebuilt, is to reopen soon for SARS cases.
Early on Monday, Dr. Lee had said Taiwan's epidemic appeared to be tailing off, after all new cases were counted by the dates that symptoms began. The Kaohsiung outbreak may create a new spike, but Dr. Cathy Roth, the head of the W.H.O. team, said it was too early to tell.
Here in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, there were some encouraging signs. The Hua Tsang housing project, which was sealed off by the police on Friday, was reopened after it became clear that the building was not contaminated. All of its SARS victims, it turned out, had visited Jen Chi Hospital.
Dr. Roth also said that hospital efforts to start "fever clinics" in parking-lot tents to keep infectious patients out of emergency rooms were "moving along impressively."
The most crucial task now, she said, is to start a Web site on which doctors can enter details of every SARS case. The site was supposed to be up already.
Meanwhile, the Sogo department store, Taiwan's equivalent of Bloomingdale's and Saks rolled into one, reopened after three days of sterilization after rumors that a cashier had spread SARS to two customers, perhaps via their credit cards.
One cashier is ill, and two customers may be, but there is no apparent connection between them, said Chin Chung, chairwoman of the Pacific Sogo department store chain. The cashier probably got sick on a bus trip to southern Taiwan, and the customers had no direct contact with her. Credit cards are carried to the cashiers by saleswomen, all of whom are healthy, she said.
Asked about that later, Dr. Lee agreed that "it's fair to say that there has been no transmission inside the store."
The reopening featured a one-day 50-percent-off sale. At the 11 a.m. opening, crowds poured in past the new thermal imaging camera and the young women spraying hand disinfectant and asking everyone without a mask to accept a free one.
In the crowded food court, Susan Hsieh and Carol Tang, 36-year-old shopping buddies, were downing half-price lunches. Ms. Tang had a back massager -- 40 percent off -- and a silvery necklace, marked down to $14 from $56, with a portion donated to the SARS Prevention Fund.
"They cleaned it for three days," Mrs. Hsieh said of the store. "I wasn't worried. I brought my mask. And we haven't seen each other in a long time."
Workers spent all Saturday, Sunday and Monday disinfecting the store, using "the same methods as in the Presidency Building," Ms. Chung said in an interview in a busy store restaurant.
All of the goods were removed, the shelves and floors were washed with bleach solution, and a steam vaporizer with a germ-killing spray made two passes. Rat and cockroach poison was laid down, and every surface a customer might touch was wiped down, from escalator rails to bathroom taps.
Dr. Roth called those efforts "more than was needed."
"They erred on the side of caution," she said.
Most customers appeared unafraid, though the makeup saleswomen had to learn a new skill: working blush around their clients' masks.
"This has been good training for me," said Ms. Chung, a Cornell-trained economist and former spokeswoman for the premier who has been in her job for one month. "To deal with something this big -- I'll be much more able to deal with small things in the future."
Throughout the store, each saleswoman wore a blue sticker saying, "I'm Very O.K.!" and giving her morning temperature reading.
"It's no big deal," said Kao Chen-yu, a cashier. "The whole thing was blown up by the media. We got a lecture on SARS, and if a credit card could spread it, it'd be the end of the world."
She has not been stigmatized as a cashier, she said. "Only a few paranoid customers say, 'Stay away from me.' "
At the Hello Kitty boutique, Diana Lin said all of the pink Kitty-faced masks had sold out at $4 each.
In the aromatherapy department, Huang Yu-ling said she had rapidly sold 10 perfume atomizers advertised as "anti-SARS."
"Any kind of condensed scent has the power to kill the virus," she said, pulling down her mask to wrinkle her nose in the plume of fruity mist. Asked for the secret ingredient, she produced a small vial. It read: "Grapefruit Peel. Made in California."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE TARGET; 
Compound Was a Lure for Terror, Experts Say

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The battered compound that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited yesterday is like a little walled village on the eastern edge of the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
 It is one of many set up for Americans and other foreigners who are drawn to Saudi Arabia by lucrative jobs in private business and for the government. 
 Terrorism experts say the compound where Mr. Powell witnessed the carnage made a particularly appealing target for terrorists. It was the home of about 300 employees and family members of the Vinnell Corporation, a Virginia subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, which for 28 years has been providing training to the Saudi Arabian National Guard. 
"Given the nature of their involvement, they would have been a high-value target for Al Qaeda," said Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert and senior adviser to the Rand Corporation, a California research center.
Kevin Rosser, an analyst at the Control Risks Group in London, which provides security advice to corporations around the world, said many elements of the Vinnell Corporation would make it attractive to Middle East terrorists. 
"There is the symbolic value of hitting an American target," Mr. Rosser said. "It makes the point that you are going after aspects of the military presence in Saudi Arabia, not only the training, but the stationing of troops and planes, and also the business aspect of the relationship, the contractors who play a very important supporting role."
The Associated Press reported that the bombings marked the second attack involving Vinnell in Saudi Arabia. Eight years ago, a car bomb destroyed the three-story headquarters building of the Saudi National Guard in downtown Riyadh. At least four Americans died, including a retired American Army major. 
Mr. Jenkins said security had been increased around the compounds since before the war in Iraq.
Jay McCaffrey, a spokesman for Northrop, the big California defense contractor that acquired Vinnell when it bought a major competitor, TRW Inc., in 2002, said the company's compound in Riyadh was so "extensively damaged" Monday night that survivors were being moved to other housing.
He said that he did not have details on casualties, but that no family members of Vinnell employees had been hurt. Later, Northrop said seven American and two Filipino employees had been killed. The company said that "a number" of employees were treated and released, but that 15 remained hospitalized.
The losses might have been much worse, but The A. P. said many of the company's employees were on a training exercise when the terrorists struck.
"Fortunately, not all of them were in the compound at the time of the attack," Mr. McCaffrey said. "We're talking about probably just under 200 in the compound." 
Mr. McCaffrey said the compound, referred to on the company's Web site as Camp Vinnell, sprawled over an area of about three city blocks. Apartment and office buildings rise above shade trees and lawns in a combination residential and business area.
At least one building was reserved for families while others were for unmarried men or men whose families had not accompanied them to Saudi Arabia. The compound also holds a gymnasium, library, swimming pool, tennis courts, snack bars and a dry cleaning center.
Mr. McCaffrey said the damage had made the compound unliveable. "In just about every building windows have been blown out, suspended ceilings have been damaged, the water service has been disrupted. It's not working." 
Shortly before the war in Iraq, Dick Clarke, a security expert for Control Risks Group, had dinner at the home of friends in a Riyadh compound for foreign workers similar to Vinnell's. Inside, he said, the compounds are "a small society, if you like, of the expatriate community." 
The ones he saw, he said, were "well-guarded." At the entrance, uniformed security guards asked to see identification and looked under vehicles for explosives.
Residents, he said, were apprehensive. "They were concerned at the time because of the pending war and wondering what might spill over," he said. "And they were concerned about such incidents as we've seen in the past 24 hours."

NEW POLICY IN IRAQ TO AUTHORIZE G.I.'S TO SHOOT LOOTERS

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 13 

 BODY:
United States military forces in Iraq will have the authority to shoot looters on sight under a tough new security setup that will include hiring more police officers and banning ranking members of the Baath Party from public service, American officials said today.
 The far more muscular approach to bringing order to postwar Iraq was described by the new American administrator, L. Paul Bremer, at a meeting of senior staff members today, the officials said. On Wednesday, Mr. Bremer is expected to meet with the leaders of Iraqi political groups that are seeking to form an interim government by the end of the month. "He made it very clear that he is now in charge," said an official who attended the meeting today. "I think you are going to see a change in the rules of engagement within a few days to get the situation under control." 
 Asked what this meant, the official replied, "They are going to start shooting a few looters so that the word gets around" that assaults on property, the hijacking of automobiles and violent crimes will be dealt with using deadly force.
How Iraqis will be informed of the new rules is not clear. American officials in Iraq have access to United States-financed radio stations, which could broadcast the changes. 
A tougher approach over all appears to be at the core of Mr. Bremer's mandate from President Bush to save the victory in Iraq from a descent into anarchy, a possibility feared by some Iraqi political leaders if steps are not taken quickly to check violence and lawlessness. 
But imposing measures that call for the possible killing of young, unemployed or desperate Iraqis for looting appears to carry a certain level of risk because of the volatile sentiments in the streets here. Gas lines snake through neighborhoods, garbage piles up, and the increasing heat frequently provides combustion for short tempers, which are not uncommonly directed at the American presence here.
Mr. Bremer did not spell out to senior members of the American and British reconstruction team whether his authority would supersede that of Gen. David D. McKiernan, the land forces commander in the country.
But in tackling the security problem, Mr. Bremer will confront the need for a police force, and the difficulty of building a credible one on the wreckage of Saddam Hussein's hated security establishment.
The officials said Mr. Bremer told his staff that his urgent priority was to rebuild a police force, especially in Baghdad, so it could become visible and available "on the streets."
Another tough measure that the officials said Mr. Bremer was eager to make public is a decree on de-Baathification, the process of weeding out senior members of Mr. Hussein's political establishment to ensure that the totalitarian principles on which the Baath Party ruled are not perpetuated.
American officials said the decree on the Baath Party will prohibit its officials above certain ranks from serving in future governments. Rehabilitation procedures will be created for some high-ranking officials, but they will still be excluded from government service, the officials said.
Mr. Bremer appeared before the senior staff of the reconstruction administration with Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general who has been in charge of the rebuilding mission under military command. Administration officials say General Garner will leave his post after a few weeks.
Today, according to people who attended the closed meeting, Mr. Bremer praised General Garner's performance with words that were greeted with sustained applause. 
Nonetheless, questions linger about the Bush administration's decision to replace General Garner and abruptly call home one of his top assistants, Barbara K. Bodine. 
General Garner and Ms. Bodine, one of the most experienced Iraq specialists on his staff, were unable to decide on how to create any new authority in Baghdad, and clashed as personalities, officials said. "It was not a good fit," one commented today.
Mr. Bremer made no public appearance today, but he is scheduled to meet with Iraqi leaders on Wednesday, some of whom have misgivings about whether he will change the course that General Garner had set toward quickly forming an interim government of Iraqis and turning over substantial power to it. 
The wisdom of a speedy turnover was questioned today by some officials, who noted the acute crisis over crime and security in the capital.
Other countries, meanwhile, declared themselves willing to join in the effort to remake Iraq.
Romanian officials said they would send about 500 soldiers to help police Iraq. The foreign minister, Mircea Geoana, told reporters today that Romania would prefer to act under a United Nations resolution.
"The idea is for Romania to send a contingent of a few hundred, most likely under British command," Mr. Geoana said in Bucharest.
Meanwhile in Geneva today, the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn, said the bank would send a team to assess reconstruction needs in Iraq as soon as security permitted, another sign that the lack of security is delaying the first important steps toward recovery.
In central Iraq today, a prominent Shiite cleric said that redressing the Shiites' long exclusion from political power was necessary.
But the cleric, Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim, also said there was no single demand for a new political system from Shiites, who are a majority in Iraq.
"They have divergent views and that's what democracy is all about," Ayatollah Hakim said.
The ayatollah returned to his hometown of Najaf on Monday after years in exile in Iran as the leader of the opposition Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. He has already met resistance from one group of clerics, led by Sheik Moktada al-Sadr, who have promoted themselves as the representative of long-suppressed Shiites.
Ayatollah Hakim, at a news conference, shrugged off questions about Sheik Sadr, saying he would not comment on the rivalry. "I don't talk about these people," he said.
He was also elusive on the subject of the Badr Brigade, his armed militia that was financed by Iran, saying only that it would switch to providing security in Iraq. Asked if the group would be disarmed, as an anti-Iran militia in Iraq will be, Ayatollah Hakim said, "Security means they should carry weapons."
Security in Najaf, as in other Iraqi cities, has become a major worry for residents, who have to ward off looters and other criminals with neighborhood committees in the absence of working police forces.
But Ayatollah Hakim refused to say whether American forces had granted the Badr Brigade the job of policing Najaf, which his now administered by a self-appointed mayor who is a retired Iraqi military officer.
He also said he did not sanction the use of force to resist the American occupation of Iraq, but would resist it politically.
The ayatollah and his movement have, however, been part of the Iraqi National Congress, which has been cooperating with the United States for several years as an outside opposition to Saddam Hussein.

 Propelled by near-record oil and natural gas exports to the United States, Canada's trade surplus widened to 5.9 billion Canadian dollars ($4.2 billion) in March from 4.8 billion Canadian dollars in February, Statistics Canada reported. The surplus with the United States, which accounts for more than 75 percent of Canada's foreign trade, grew by 16 percent, more than offsetting a deficit with the rest of the world.

 An article on April 19 about a financial and academic crisis at Morris Brown College in Atlanta misstated events that preceded the resignation of Dolores Cross as president. 
In January 2002, the college failed to freeze $8 million for student loans and notify the federal government that it had received the money erroneously. A college employee did not download the money contrary to an Education Department order. Dr. Cross resigned the next month. Dr. Cross, who could not be reached for comment for the article, has since said that she resigned not because of the college's use of the $8 million but because of her fractured relationship with the trustees.

Rising Costs Threaten Field at Indy

BYLINE:  By DAVE CALDWELL 

 BODY:
The final day of time trials for the Indianapolis 500 is known around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway as Bump Day, because a slowpoke can be bumped from the 33-car starting grid by a faster car. Bump day is almost as frantic, and as harrowing, as race day itself.
 Race officials are now acknowledging that there may not be a whole lot of bumping -- maybe no bumping at all -- on Bump Day this year, because there will probably be just enough cars to fill the field for the 87th Indianapolis 500 on May 25. 
 But they are confident that there will be 33 cars, and a streak at the Indy 500, a sporting event that has lost some of its luster in the last seven years, will swerve past embarrassment. There have been at least 33 cars in the starting field at the Indy 500 every year since 1947. 
"I have all the confidence in the world that, come Sunday night, we will have a full field of 33," said Brian Barnhart, the senior vice president for racing operations of the Indy Racing League, the sanctioning body of the event.
Exactly where those cars will come from is a detail that will have to be worked out this week. Only 24 cars qualified for the race on Sunday, the first day of time trials, while the drivers of four other cars practiced but chose to wait until this weekend to qualify.
The driver Jimmy Vasser is expected to arrive at Indianapolis today to start practicing, and an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that A.J. Foyt, the four-time Indy 500 winner who is now an owner, will field a car for Airton Dare, who has not raced since September.
That would still put only 30 cars in the field. The last three cars, Barnhart said, would probably be fielded by owners who have been pinched by an expensive sport but might be able to swing deals with the owners of larger teams to buy spare equipment.
A field of 33 cars is as much a part of the history of the Indy 500 as is the winner taking a swig of milk after the race. Race officials decided many years ago that a 33-car field was best because it gives 400 feet of track to every car on the two-and-a-half-mile oval.
Foyt's 18-year-old grandson, A.J. Foyt IV, who on Sunday became the youngest driver to qualify for the Indy 500, said yesterday that he could not imagine an Indy 500 without a full field. "It's the greatest race ever, and I know there are new cars and new motors, so it's been tougher for some of the teams," he said, "but I'm sure they'll fill the field."
But money often trumps tradition. The Indianapolis Star reported yesterday that teams that already have cars in the field have shown little interest in adding cars. Teams have so much cash from their sponsors, and sponsors are not interested in spending more.
The owner Roger Penske, whose powerful team has won the race 12 times, said Sunday that he was not planning to field any more than two cars, even though he has the equipment. 
Tim Cindric, the president of Penske Racing, said yesterday in a telephone interview that the plan had not changed, but he added, "If there's any way we can help another car owner with what we have, we'd be more than happy to do that."
Various factors, foremost the slumping economy, have put the 33-car streak in jeopardy. It is not cheap to race a car of any kind. Barnhart said it costs at least $4 million to field a highly competitive car for the 16-race I.R.L. season.
The I.R.L., formed by the speedway's president, Tony George, after a contentious split with CART in 1996, had already decided to implement new rules for engines, chassis and gearboxes for the 2003 season to make the cars safer. 
Such changes to the rules are mandated every three years, but this year's were more widespread. Even if the old cars were allowed, simply to fill the field, Barnhart said, they would be much slower and more dangerous than the new cars.
With the new I.R.L. rules in effect next year, lower-profile car owners will be able to purchase used equipment from the higher-profile teams to race, Barnhart said. But that is next year. "We don't have a second-hand market for used equipment that exists yet," Barnhart said.
I.R.L. officials had expected owners to field fewer cars this year, but the poor economy led to less money from corporate sponsors and an additional drop in the amount of teams that were able to race. "The difference between having 33 cars and 43 qualifying for the race," Barnhart said, "is the economy."
Although open-wheel racers are faster and more exotic than stock cars, Indy-car racing has also been hit hard by the surge in popularity of the Nascar Winston Cup Series. Tickets for the Indianapolis 500 have become relatively easy to come by.
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway's Web site has tickets available for sale in all grandstands except the paddock boxes, which line the outside of the track near the start-finish line and the first turn.
 Ticket brokers in Indianapolis say business for the race has been almost nonexistent. Scott Cutshaw, the owner of Wholesale Ticket Service, said yesterday that only one of his telephone lines was lit, compared with six to eight during a normal day in May. 
Stock-car racing has not been immune either. The Daytona 500, on Feb. 16, did not sell out the 167,000-seat Daytona International Speedway until the day before the race. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has nearly 300,000 seats.
"I don't know of a major race in the United States this year that is not in the same situation," said Fred Nation, a spokesman for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

HEADLINE: Multicolored $20 Bill Is Coming in the Fall 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve today introduced a new design for paper currency, which will include colors other than the standard black and green, in an effort to deter counterfeiting.
 The new $20 bill will go into circulation in the fall, officials said, with new designs of the $50 bill and the $100 to follow in 2004 and 2005. Treasury officials said they were considering alterations to the $5 bill and the $10 bill. 
 While the new $20 bill will still include the image of Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, it will also have a subtle green, peach and blue tint to the paper.
The $20 bill is the most frequently counterfeited note in the United States and the second most common bill in circulation behind the $1 bill, officials said. The $100 bill is the one most often duplicated outside the country. (The $1 is not generally counterfeited, officials said.)
The plans for the bills were announced by Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snow; Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; and W. Ralph Basham, director of the United States Secret Service, the law enforcement agency responsible for combating counterfeiting. 
Mr. Snow and Mr. Greenspan said the changes would protect and bolster the influence of American currency abroad because the bills would be harder to copy.
"U.S. currency represents security and integrity around the world," Mr. Snow said at a news conference. "The purpose of the new design is to stay ahead of anyone who would compromise the security and integrity of the dollar through counterfeiting."
Mr. Snow said his department intended to redesign currency every 7 to 10 years to keep pace with counterfeiters as they develop technology that allows them to create fraudulent bills easily and cheaply.
In 1995, less than 1 percent of counterfeit notes detected in the United States were digitally produced, the Secret Service said. By 2002, that number had grown to nearly 40 percent. 
The old bills will continue to be exchanged as legal tender, officials said, while the Federal Reserve circulates the new ones among banks.
"The soundness of a nation's currency is essential to the soundness of its economy," Mr. Greenspan said. "And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender. And counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted."
The design of the paper currency dates back to 1928. In 1996, the bills were modified to include security features like a watermark and an embedded thread that are visible when the bill is held up to light.

HEADLINE: 500 More Apartments Seen In Downtown Building Boom 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A developer is buying two office buildings in the financial district for more than $100 million. Until recently, the buildings were part of a site where a new trading complex for the New York Stock Exchange and a 50-story skyscraper had been planned. 
 Instead of a tall tower, the developer, A. I. & Boymelgreen, plans to convert the buildings at 23 Wall Street and 15 Broad Street into as many as 500 apartments, with retail stores and some office space. 
 The purchase is the latest example of the residential building boom downtown, where developers are planning the creation of more than 5,000 apartments over the next three years. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has promoted the trend as a way to revive Lower Manhattan, which has suffered corporate relocations and layoffs since Sept. 11.
A. I. & Boymelgreen signed a contract on Monday to buy the properties from J. P. Morgan Chase for more than $100 million, after winning an auction with a bid considerably higher than those of other developers, real estate executives say. 
Asi Cymbal, vice president and general manager of Boymelgreen, confirmed that his company had signed the contract but declined to discuss the sale price, as did J. P. Morgan Chase. 
"We're excited," Mr. Cymbal said. "We look forward to contributing in a material way to the revitalization of downtown Manhattan. We along with many others fled downtown after Sept. 11. We look forward to coming back." 
He said the development is a joint venture between Boymelgreen, a Brooklyn company, and Africa-Israel Investments, a publicly traded Israeli company. Mr. Cymbal said they would preserve the landmark building at 23 Wall Street, the original headquarters of Morgan Bank, and renovate the other structure.
"There's going to be a lot of residential units produced downtown, which I think is a good thing for the city," said H. Henry Elghanayan, a principal at Rockrose Development Corporation, which is building 650 apartments at 2 Gold Street. "The administration is in favor of it."
In recent years, the city and state had hoped to demolish 15 Broad Street and several other buildings on the block, including one owned by Rockrose, to make way for a $1 billion trading complex for the stock exchange and an office tower. The city eventually spent $109 million putting the project together, but it fell apart last year when the exchange pulled out. But J. P. Morgan Chase had already emptied its buildings. The bank quietly put the buildings on the market in January.
"This has been a particularly uncertain site since the demise of the stock exchange," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "The interest in the property and the ultimate disposition are a welcome sign for downtown and this historic intersection."
The new owners can boast that the apartments will sit across the street from the stock exchange. But that may also be a problem; residents and businesses in the area have complained about the blockades and security details in front of the stock exchange giving the neighborhood a war-torn ambience.
