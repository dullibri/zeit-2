PERSON: Roger Ernest Toussaint 

HEADLINE: Man in the News -- Outspoken From Youth; 
Roger Ernest Toussaint

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Roger Toussaint acknowledges that there are some uncanny parallels between him and Mike Quill, the Irish-born union leader, sometimes called "the leprechaun from hell," who tormented mayors and led a 12-day transit strike in 1966.
 Like Mr. Quill, Mr. Toussaint, the president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, is an immigrant; he comes from Trinidad. Mr. Quill was the seventh of eight children in a poor family; Mr. Toussaint was the seventh of nine children in a poor family. 
 Like his predecessor, Mr. Toussaint (pronounced too-SONT) was a political troublemaker back home; Mr. Quill fought with the Irish Republican Army, and Mr. Toussaint was arrested as a teenager in antigovernment protests. Like Mr. Quill, Mr. Toussaint developed a reputation as one of the most militant union leaders of his time, known for stirring speeches and for provoking politicians. 
Now the question is whether Mr. Toussaint will follow Mr. Quill in another way, by shutting down the nation's largest transit system in a strike threatened to begin on Monday.
Mr. Toussaint said he would not shrink from defying the state law barring such strikes if he concludes that is the best way to help the union's 34,000 bus and subway workers. "The threat of going to jail is not going to stop us from going on strike," Mr. Toussaint said. 
His fierce eyes and a salt-and-pepper goatee help make him seem ultraserious in public, and he almost never cracks a joke. He does not have Mr. Quill's sometimes savage wit and he is certainly more tactful; he would never say what Mr. Quill once said about a judge who signed an antistrike order: "The judge can drop dead in his black robes."
Mr. Toussaint speaks respectfully of his predecessor. "Mike Quill was a worthy and proud and distinguished product of some of the best times in the labor movement," he said.
Still, he would not say whether Mr. Quill or anyone else was his role model. "I've seen a lot of people stand up and fight and have known people who have died for what they believe in," he said. "I was exposed to that at a very young age. I'm not teary-eyed about role models and so on."
Looking back, Mr. Toussaint, 46, said his most formative years were as a teenager battling the government of Trinidad and Tobago. Roger Ernest Toussaint was born in 1956 and the country gained its independence from Britain in 1962. In its early stages the government retained "the vestiges of colonialism," favoring the rich and short-changing the poor.
He became involved in a movement of students and workers protesting, among other things, government efforts to raise education costs, which hit the poor the hardest. At 17, he was expelled from his elite high school after being arrested for painting a slogan, "Free Education Means Free Books," on the school's walls. 
"That whole period politicized the young population and the students, that generation, myself included," Mr. Toussaint said. "That created a sort of social consciousness. That is really what I'm a product of."
Mr. Toussaint said he emigrated to the United States in 1974, when he was 17, seeking economic opportunity and a chance to be with his mother, who had left Trinidad when he was 12. She worked in Brooklyn as a nurse's aide. "She was a class-conscious worker and an active union member," he said.
Friends saw another reason for his departure: to leave his arrest and political battles behind him.
Soon after arriving in New York, he again immersed himself in political battles. He enrolled at Brooklyn College, studying biology and political science, and became a campus leader in the fight against cuts in education spending.
After 18 months he left school. "I needed money," he said. "I needed to work."
From 1976 to 1983, he worked as a ship welder, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and other shipyards. After the shipbuilding industry died, he took a job as a cleaner at the Jerome Avenue subway barn in the Bronx.
There, he said he saw something rotten with the union, and he vowed to change it. He said the union's shop steward, who was supposed to help the workers, told management when workers arrived late or were loafing. Soon, thanks largely to Mr. Toussaint's efforts, the shop steward was gone.
"I was involved in standing up to management and union corruption from the beginning," he said.
In 1985, he moved to the track maintenance department, where he used his knowledge of welding. There, he grew frustrated by what he called the union's failure to challenge safety problems. He said the union discouraged member participation and sometimes conspired with management to drop workers' grievances. He and a few friends started a newsletter, On Track, that highlighted safety problems and roasted management and union alike.
For a decade he did not seek a union position because, he said, he did not want to be associated with the union's corruption, but then in 1995 he was elected chairman of the union's 1,800-member track maintenance division. 
As an outspoken dissident, he angered managers and union leaders. In 1998, he was a passenger in a union vehicle when a car plowed into it, seriously injuring his back and neck. While on medical leave and wearing a neck brace, he often went to help union members in trouble. 
Upon returning to work, he was fired for having been in a union vehicle on work time and for not reporting where he went while on sick leave. When he challenged his dismissal, he learned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had hired private investigators to follow him to union meetings, transit headquarters, even to his son's nursery school.
Mr. Toussaint became a union hero when other workers learned about the private investigators. Two years ago, with publicity from that episode and with the backing of New Directions, a militant union caucus, he won the presidency of Local 100, defeating the incumbent, Willie James, who Mr. Toussaint said was not aggressive enough with management. Mr. James attacked Mr. Toussaint as being trigger happy about striking. Mr. Toussaint was still dismissed when he won the race, but he has since persuaded management to reinstate him.
In office, he has been a vocal critic of what he calls "the second-class treatment of transit workers." He complains that their pay is worse than Long Island Rail Road workers' and that their health plan is worse city workers'.
His talk of making the union more confrontational causes many people to believe he will call a strike when the union's contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Monday. 
"Roger has a militant side to him, but he's also a pragmatist," said Richard Steier, editor of The Chief, the municipal employees' newspaper. "I don't think he's wild-eyed or crazy, but if it comes to where he felt forced into it by management, I think he would pull the trigger."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
Keeping the Expos Intact Would Be Good Business

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Instead of working together to emasculate the Montreal Expos, Major League Baseball owners could enhance the value of their property for only about $350,000 each.
 If each of the other 29 clubs paid the additional amount for the operation of the team they own in this unique arrangement, the Expos could have a $50 million payroll for the 2003 season and retain all of their best players. 
 For a sum barely over the new minimum salary for one player, the owners of the Expos could create potentially valuable benefits for themselves and for baseball.
*Because the Expos' best players are from Latin America, their presence in the team's lineup would assure large turnouts, sellouts most likely, for the Expos' 22 games in San Juan, P.R., next season. 
*With the Expos expected to be sold and relocated sometime next year, the continued presence of their best players would enhance the team's chances to be a contender and its value to a prospective buyer.
*If their best players remain with them instead of going to wealthier teams like the Mets or the Atlanta Braves, the Expos would help improve competitive balance in their division and keep it from getting further out of whack in any division that Vladimir Guerrero or Bartolo Colon might go to.
Despite these potential benefits, the Expos' proprietors don't want to spend extra money on them. They have told baseball officials they would rather spend it on themselves. 
That is why baseball has laid out a break-even plan for the Expos next season. To achieve that economic goal, the Expos will have to limit their payroll to about $40 million, up only $2 million from last season, instead of $50 million, where they would have to be to keep all of their best players.
As a result of that development, Omar Minaya will be the most popular person at the winter meetings, which begin in Nashville today and run through Monday. 
Minaya is the Expos' general manager and will be inundated with offers for Guerrero, Colon, Javier Vazquez and maybe Jose Vidro and Orlando Cabrera. With the meetings relatively short this year, Minaya may not have time to sift through and weigh the torrent of trade proposals before he leaves the Opryland Hotel.
When he talked about his task Wednesday, Minaya was neither daunted nor depressed. "I see it as a challenge," he said, reprising his comments of last February, when he took control of the Expos' baseball operations on short -- very short -- notice. "I'm a little excited about how it's going to come together. I'm excited about seeing how we can put our team together for next year. I'm looking forward to going to the winter meetings. It's going to be tough, but we as a staff can get it done."
Depending on the moves he makes, Minaya could have an impact on next season's races. He would like to have only a positive impact for the Expos, but if the Yankees get Colon or Guerrero, they will be more difficult to beat. Baseball officials don't want the strong teams to get stronger and the wealthier teams to get richer on the field, but that will likely be the result of the Expos' forced moves.
Commissioner Bud Selig said he understood the possibility of that development, but he defended the desire for the Expos to break even.
"A lot of clubs are going to have to make those kind of decisions," he said. "It's not only the Montreal club. I understand we own the Montreal club. Everybody understands the Montreal club has to be run with positive economic resolve, but there are a lot of clubs making decisions like that, so the Montreal club is not alone."
The difference with the Expos, though, is that their roster, to an extent, is determined by baseball officials and other teams. The other teams determine their own rosters. Weakening a potential contender is better for other contenders.
As the general manager of the division rival Braves, John Schuerholz said that he did not mind competition, but that all teams had to deal with economic reality.
"They have to operate and manage their club the best way they feel it's appropriate," he said. "They have to make choices. It's no different than it is in Pittsburgh, Atlanta or Kansas City. The same considerations are measured. How much revenue can we generate and what kind of roster can it support?"
Unlike other teams, though, the Expos were used as a pawn in the negotiations that produced the new labor agreement in August. Presumably, by agreeing to end the effort to contract the Expos, Major League Baseball elicited some concession from the union. Perhaps the owners should view the additional cost of operating the Expos as a cost connected to collective bargaining, part of the price of gaining labor peace. Tie that approach to the potential benefits that could be derived from keeping the team intact, and it would make economic sense for the Expos to retain Guerrero and his $11.5 million salary and Colon and his $8.25 million salary.
But unless the Expos' proprietors change their stance quickly, Minaya will have to perform magic to keep the team whole.
"I'm not committed to trading any player," he said. "At the end of the day, I have to make the budget, but there's nobody specifically I have to trade."

Buzz on the Business of Fizz
 The neighbors in OZZY OSBOURNE'S neighborhood in Los Angeles have been alerted: a Pepsi commercial will be filmed there this weekend. That had Madison Avenue types wondering if the Osbournes would be seen during Super Bowl XXXVII on Jan. 26. Two Pepsi brands are in the game, including the one in the Osbournes' commercial, Pepsi Twist, Pepsi's answer to Diet Coke with Lemon. 

Big Brains, No Swelled Heads
"I often think I'm not the smartest person in the room, but this time I'm sure," said the city's parks commissioner, ADRIAN BENEPE.
The room he was in at the Swedish consul general's residence on Park Avenue was filled with Nobel Prize winners -- 26 in all, including TONI MORRISON (who won for literature in 1993), ELIE WIESEL (peace, 1986), DR. RUSSELL A. HULSE (physics, 1993) and GUNTHER BLOBEL (medicine, 1999).
The were carrying on a long tradition of having dinner with other Nobel winners (and nonwinners like Mr. Benepe) on the day that the Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm. JOHN FORBES NASH JR., who won in economics in 1994 and was the subject of "A Beautiful Mind," the biography that was adapted into a movie, was across the room.
The consul general, OLLE WASTBERG, had assigned JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ, a co-winner in economics last year, to give an after-dinner speech on the topic: "Is Keynes Dead?" Before facing that question, Dr. Stiglitz faced the issue of "absent-minded academics who don't read mail."
"One of the advantages of winning a Nobel Prize," said Dr. Stiglitz, who was wearing a red four-in-hand tie, "is you can get away with almost anything, including not wearing a black tie to a black tie event."

Sure, and I'm Forrest Gump
In preparation for selling jewelry on a home-shopping cable channel tonight, RITA WILSON was talking about purchases she had made -- a battery-powered hairbrush, a grill, a french-fry cooker. But she is not alone in her household. "I believe that my spouse has purchased on HSN shows, too," she said.
Do the order-takers believe her husband, TOM HANKS, is who he says he is? "They say things like, 'Come on,' " she said. "I think he's going to call up on my show and someone will say, 'No, not really, no.' "

Love Scene Has Life of Its Own
This is the time of year when film types are showered with invitations to get-togethers with prospective Academy Award nominees. Last night, the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored DIANE LANE, who, among other things, starred in the recent thriller "Unfaithful." On Wednesday, ADRIAN LYNE (who directed "Unfaithful") and TONY LO BIANCO were the hosts of a dinner party for her at the Four Seasons restaurant. Among the guests were SANDRA BERNHARD, and DINA MERRILL..
Ms. Lane seemed pleased to hear that a scene from "Unfaithful" that involves flashbacks to a tryst is often cited as a favorite movie love scene by women users of some Internet dating sites. "I'll have to tell my boyfriend," she said, referring to the actor JOSH BROLIN.

Look, but Try Not to Touch
There were toys around the Christmas tree at Doubles, the private club in the basement of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street. There was not a child in sight, but there were lots of marines in dress uniforms standing around.
They had been deployed as eye candy at a party where most of the guests were women. Consider what happened when one woman walked past GRACE HIGHTOWER, the former flight attendant and former wife of ROBERT DE NIRO. Ms. Hightower had said something about how only children receive toys for Christmas -- this was, after all, a Toys for Tots party. The woman nodded in the direction of two marines and said to Ms. Hightower, "Honey, they are the toys for women our age."
LYDIA HEARST-SHAW -- who is 18, the daughter of PATRICIA HEARST and about to be a debutante -- chatted with CORNELIA GUEST, whom the fashion columnist Eugenia Sheppard called "deb of the year" 20 years ago. Then Ms. Hearst-Shaw left.
Someone asked if she was going to dinner.
No, she said. "I have to go home and study." She had a math exam the next morning. With Linda Lee

HEADLINE: From Jail Cell to the Job Market; 
Conservatives Back Work Programs for Ex-Inmates

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Welfare-to-work programs have moved thousands of women from welfare into jobs, and now many conservative groups that championed those programs are trying to apply them to another problematic population: the hundreds of thousands of men who are released from prisons each year.
 The organizations, run by religious conservatives and crime-fighting conservatives, believe that the welfare-to-work model -- a mix of tough love and true training -- may reduce recidivism and move many of the roughly 550,000 men released from prison each year nationwide into meaningful employment. 
 In fact, these conservative efforts are part of an emerging and rare consensus to work with a population that has long been the focus of liberal groups.
"The 600,000 prisoners released each year, if not the biggest problem on the social agenda, has to be in the top five," said William B. Eimicke, a Columbia University professor of management, who recently completed a study of job programs for ex-offenders for the conservative Manhattan Institute. "Rehabilitation for criminals was originally viewed as more of a liberal issue. But moderates and even right-wing conservatives can embrace it, too, because it has a very strong self-help theme, it will contribute to the economy and perhaps most importantly it has the potential to save taxpayers a lot of money." 
Over the past year, America Works, a Manhattan-based company, has used its welfare-to-work model to place more than 300 former prisoners in jobs. Eager to strengthen ties between incarcerated fathers and their children, several religious conservatives have created job training programs for ex-offenders.
In New York City, two Republican mayors -- Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg -- have awarded record amounts of money for job programs for former prisoners. John J. DiIulio Jr., a Democrat who was the director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in the current Bush White House, is pressing Congress for a tenfold increase in spending on job programs for ex-offenders.
Former prisoners are attracting more attention partly because a record number of them are being released, about 1,600 a day, a direct result of the national prison population's climbing to a record in recent years, nearly two million.
One statistic has especially pressed conservatives and liberals alike to assist this group: nearly two-thirds of ex-offenders are arrested again within three years of release, meaning they committed hundreds of thousands of new crimes.
"Although the number of studies is limited, it has become clear that training ex-offenders and placing them in jobs is an important way to keep these people from going back to prison," said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.
On a recent Monday, a dozen newly released prisoners, all men, headed to the 12th-floor Manhattan office of America Works to ask for job-hunting leads and to attend a three-day workshop.
Juan Cortez, who runs the workshops, tells the ex-offenders not to lie when interviewers ask whether they served time. Rather, he tells them to minimize their violations. Instead of saying they were convicted on drug charges, he advises, they should say that they were involved in a situation where controlled substances were present and that they have done everything to put it behind them.
At the workshop, Mr. Cortez, who obtained a bachelor's degree and two master's while in jail on a gang-related manslaughter conviction, urged the former felons to think several years ahead. He asked Raymond, who had served 12 years on drug charges, "What do you see yourself doing in two, three years, remembering that you're young and have a lot of potential? And remember, you have a wife and the most important thing in the world, a young kid."
Raymond responded, "I want to own a business, be a successful businessman." For the short term, Raymond said, he wants a janitorial or warehouse job, prompting Mr. Cortez to talk inspiringly about two former prisoners who at first took janitorial jobs and now run a floor-buffing company that employs 16 people.
America Works places ex-offenders in janitorial jobs as well as in light-industrial, restaurant and telemarketing jobs. Company officials note that many fast-talking ex-offenders excel at telemarketing. To many companies, these workers are not threatening; 75 percent of ex-offenders were not in prison for violent crimes and one-third were in for drug offenses, up from 11 percent in 1985.
Nonetheless, job-placement efforts face considerable barriers, among them fears of former prisoners and laws barring ex-offenders from various occupations.
Still, Sheldon Flatow, whose company in Queens makes air-conditioning ducts, said he was delighted with the three former prisoners he had hired. "They're excellent employees," he said. "They do whatever I ask. My experience has been so positive, I don't see why anyone wouldn't do it."
Professor Eimicke's study found that of 891 ex-offenders who signed up for the three-day workshop at America Works, 501 finished it and 389 were placed in jobs. Of those 42 percent kept their jobs for at least six months. 
Noting that New York State spends about $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison, his study concluded that such job-placement programs could save the state millions of dollars a year by reducing recidivism, the rate at which ex-convicts return to prison, and thus cutting prison costs.
"One unintended consequence of the welfare-to-work program was it empowered women while a lot of men disappeared and went to jail," said Lee Bowes, chief executive of America Works, which runs one of the nation's most successful welfare-to-work programs. "Now we're trying to do something to help the men."
Jorge N., who served two years for drug possession, complained that he had no luck finding a job on his own when he was released last April. Frustrated, he went to America Works on a friend's advice, and it directed him to a toy factory in Queens. 
Jorge now earns $7.50 an hour at the factory, doing shipping, receiving, stocking and unloading. "It's very important for me that I can help support my 13-year-old daughter," he said.
Elizabeth Gaynes, executive director of the Osborne Association, a New York nonprofit agency that was a pioneer in assisting ex-offenders, said prisons did a bad job preparing inmates for work. 
"Prison is probably the single worst place in the world to prepare people to succeed at a job," she said. "All the things that make someone a good worker -- initiative, being careful, trying to go the extra mile -- prison discourages."
Like the Osborne Association, the Center for Employment Opportunities, in Manhattan, takes ex-offenders to drug programs, implores judges to ease child support payments and asks parole officers to change appointments so they do not conflict with a parolee's work hours. 
"These guys are coming home with an incredible number of obligations," said Mindy Tarlow, the center's executive director. "They need to report to parole officers and get drug tests. They have curfews. They can't go to certain neighborhoods."
Having served 39 months for bank fraud, Bernard Rutledge said job programs had opened doors for him. For three months, he has, with the help of the Osborne Association, worked for a restaurant supply company in Queens. He is proud that he just received health insurance and a 50-cent raise to $7 an hour.
"I used to be young and full of myself," he said. "My wife, she made me see that there were other things than fast money."
Criminal justice experts say today's ex-offenders are generally less prepared for the job market than prisoners in decades past because they served longer sentences on average and many states emphasized building prisons in the 1990's and spent less on educational and vocational programs for inmates. One study found that recidivism is 20 percent lower for prisoners who participated in vocational programs while in prison.
One religious group that embraced the cause of former prisoners is the Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization, which has job programs in New York and eight other states. After the institute placed several dozen former Rikers Island inmates in jobs, New York City's Human Resources Administration gave it a five-year contract to train and place at least 200 ex-offenders a year. 
Mr. DiIulio, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has begun championing the cause of ex-offenders, saying that aiding them will give crucial help to their children and communities.
"The moment has arrived where people right, left and center recognize we have a practical opportunity and moral obligation to do much more with this population of men," he said. "It's not that these men are victims and therefore we had better give them this. They've paid their debt to society. They're coming out. We have the resources. We can do more and better by these men and by their children and their families. That's where the consensus has come."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:Ciena Posts Smaller Loss Than Expected 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The Ciena Corporation, a maker of telecommunications equipment, yesterday posted a smaller quarterly loss and higher revenue than analysts were expecting and said sales in the current quarter could rise up to 10 percent, compared with the previous quarter. Nevertheless, some analysts said investors should not celebrate too soon. Optical equipment makers like Ciena have struggled as large telephone companies like Qwest Communications International and Sprint, both Ciena customers, have slashed spending during the severe downturn in their industry and in the United States economy.

BETTER HARVEST HELPS BUNGE'S SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Bunge Ltd., the oilseed processor, forecast yesterday that quarterly profit this year would rise by as much as 88 percent from a year ago as a record harvest and currency declines helped business in South America. Bunge's earnings forecast for 2003 also topped analysts' forecasts, with a strong performance in South America and Europe expected to help overcome weaker profit margins in North America, where drought has cut crop production. 
The currencies in Brazil and Argentina have eroded in value against the dollar amid economic and political turmoil, helping to increase Bunge's bottom line as its operating costs there are mostly in the local currency while exports are in dollars. Lower soybean production in the United States pushed the prices of soy meal animal feed to three-year highs, and global demand for soy oil has been forecast to be strong. Both are products obtained from crushing soybeans.

36 Hours Baltimore

BYLINE:  By STEVE BAILEY 

 BODY:
BALTIMORE is a large, diverse city, but a visitor with limited time can enjoy much of the best the city offers by sticking to three neighborhoods: the Inner Harbor, Federal Hill and Fells Point. All are within walking distance or a water-taxi ride of some of the city's best hotels. Until the mid-1970's, the Inner Harbor was surrounded by rotting piers and warehouses. In one of the nation's most successful urban renewal efforts, the area was reborn with the Rouse Company's "festival market" called Harborplace; new and rehabilitated housing in Otterbein, just to the west; marinas for pleasure craft; the Maryland Science Center; the National Aquarium; and an array of new Pratt Street office towers overlooking it all. Fells Point and Federal Hill are old neighborhoods where Formstone-fronted row houses (like those now appearing on Broadway in "Hairspray") have survived despite decades of gentrification. Fells Point, where the city began, is a cobblestone waterfront district of restaurants, bars and shops, reminiscent of the French Quarter in New Orleans except with rowdy Baltimoreans instead of rowdy tourists. Federal Hill is quieter but has a lively night life in the area around the popular Cross Street Market. The water taxis stop at many points in the harbor (they run from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., weather permitting). A ticket -- $5 for adults, $3 for children 10 and under, and good all day -- will take you to any stop, or you can make a tour of it, staying aboard for all the stops and returning to where you started.

Friday

4 p.m.
1.) Harbor Walking
Stroll around the Inner Harbor. The Maryland Science Center, at the harbor's southwest corner, has an IMAX theater and loads of hands-on exhibits for children (601 Light Street, 410-685-5225; open Fridays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sundays noon to 5 p.m.; admission, including the IMAX film, is $15.50 for adults, $10.50 for children 3 to 12). Harborplace, at the northwest corner, has two pavilions of shops and restaurants, as well as a pedestrian bridge to four more floors of shops in the base of a hotel and office building. The tri-masted U.S.S. Constellation, launched in 1854 and the last all-sail warship built by the Navy, is docked at Harborplace (410-539-1797, open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is $6.50 for adults, $5 for seniors, $3.50 for children 6 to 14). A little farther east is the Torsk, an American submarine that sank the last ship (a Japanese patrol boat) in World War II. (The Torsk is one of several attractions operated by the Baltimore Maritime Museum; 410-396-3453, open 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday to Sunday; admission is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors, $3 for children 6 to 14, good for all museum attractions; tickets are sold at booths near the Torsk and the Constellation.)

7 p.m.
2.) Mussels Galore
For dinner, head to Fells Point. Bertha's (734 South Broadway, 410-327-5795) is famous for its steamed wild mussels ($8.95), and rightly so, because the restaurant serves about 2,000 pounds a week with nine different sauces. Your waiter will be happy to give you an "Eat Bertha's Mussels" bumper sticker. The bar, which has a gritty waterfront ambience and live blues bands on Fridays and Saturdays, is well separated from the only slightly more refined dining rooms. You can supplement your mussels with a shrimp salad sandwich ($8.70), one of the creamy soups or other seafood and pasta dishes. For dessert, try the trifle, a light custard with fruit and brandy-soaked cake ($4.70).

10 p.m.
3.) Cognacs in a Jungle Setting
End the day with a nightcap at the elegantly appointed Explorers' Lounge on the second floor of the Harbor Court Hotel (550 Light Street, 410-234-0550). There are murals of jungles and African plains, a real-life harbor view and, on weekends, a jazz trio. The bar has more than a dozen Cognacs ($8 to $210, a glass).

Saturday

10 a.m.
4.) Row Houses
A short walk south of the Inner Harbor takes you to Regi's (1002 Light Street, 410-539-7344), a bistro carved out of two adjacent 1840's row houses in Federal Hill. Weekend brunch dishes include eggs Chesapeake ($13.50), which is a crab meat version of eggs Benedict, and croissant French toast ($6.50). Afterward, walk up Montgomery Street, which is lined with beautifully restored 19th-century houses. On one block, the residents themselves removed layers of street asphalt to uncover the original Belgian-block or cobblestone paving. At the east end of Montgomery Street, climb the steps to the top of Federal Hill, a city park that was once the site of a Union fort that trained its guns on downtown Baltimore to keep the city's Confederate sympathizers in line. All of the Inner Harbor and a good bit of the larger harbor beyond can be seen from Federal Hill.

11 a.m.
5.) Extraordinary Visions
Between the east side of Federal Hill Park and the harbor is the American Visionary Art Museum (800 Key Highway, 410-244-1900), whose focus is works by self-taught artists unconnected to any folk tradition. Outside, an amazingly colorful windmill-powered mobile by Vollis Simpson, a North Carolina mechanic and farmer, soars 55 feet. One of the most evocative works inside is an eerie 70-inch-tall carved applewood figure with a sunken chest, the only known work by an anonymous 1950's asylum patient in England who died of tuberculosis. (Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $8 for adults, $6 for students.)

1 p.m.
6.) To Market, to Market
Although there is an inviting cafe at the Visionary Museum, follow Cross Street to the Cross Street Market, one of the city's several public markets, this one in a blocklong building between Light and Charles Streets. Make your way from the Light Street entrance past the wine and cheese stall, the fruit and vegetable people, the butchers, bakers and sandwich makers -- most of the vendors have been there for decades, if not generations -- to Nick's (410-685-2020), the seafood emporium at the Charles Street entrance. You'll have to elbow your way to a spot at the bar, and you'll probably have to stand, but it's worth it for the cold beer, Old Bay-spiced steamed shrimp ($10.95 to $13.95 a pound) and oysters on the half shell ($1 each). Return in summer for the steamed crabs.

3 p.m.
7.) Let the Sharks See You
Back down at the Inner Harbor's Pier 3 is the National Aquarium (501 East Pratt Street, 410-576-3800) with a mesmerizing shark display. Visitors descend a spiral walkway in the middle of a huge ring-shaped tank (it allows the sharks to circle you constantly). There's a tropical rain forest with exotic birds under a glass pyramid on the roof and dolphin shows across a bridge on Pier 4. (Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and to 8 on Fridays; $17.50 for adults, $14.50 for seniors, $9.50 for children 3 to 11.)

5 p.m.
8.) Drink in the View
At cocktail time, it's hard to beat the view from the bar at Pisces, the restaurant atop the Baltimore Hyatt (300 Light Street, 410-605-2835), a favorite of many people who work in the nearby offices. Even the elevators have a harbor view.

7 p.m.
9.) Crab and Confit
Inner Harbor East is one of the last harbor districts to be redeveloped. In a calm and handsome space on the first floor of a new office tower, the Charleston Restaurant (1000 Lancaster Street, 410-332-7373) serves expertly prepared contemporary American food with a Southern accent. The wine expert Robert Parker Jr. has called this a "world-class dining destination" and has praised the "exquisite wine selection." Start with she-crab soup with sherry ($8) or a duck confit salad ($10), then maybe roasted wild rockfish ($32) or grilled venison ($32). Dessert could be a cheese course ($10) or vanilla bean creme brulee ($7).

10 p.m.
10.) Pub Crawling
If you're not worn out (and, frankly, you should be), walk east to the Full Moon Saloon (1710 Aliceanna Street, 410-276-6388), which offers live blues seven nights a week, often with no cover charge but as much as $10 for local favorites like the Nighthawks. If the Full Moon is too loud, too crowded or too smoky, try any of the other loud, crowded and smoky bars in Fells Point. Or visit the eclectic gift and clothing shops that stay open late to cater to bar patrons and sell things like pink flamingoes.

Sunday

11 a.m.
11.) A Marina Brunch
End your visit with one more look at the harbor, this time from the Rusty Scupper Restaurant (402 Key Highway, 410-727-3678) at the Inner Harbor Marina just north of Federal Hill Park. The Sunday brunch buffet ($27.95) offers leg of lamb, whitefish, Belgian waffles and omelets. There is live jazz, but the sweetest notes may be at the bananas Foster station.

THE BASICS
Visiting Baltimore
Baltimore is served by Baltimore-Washington International Airport, a few minutes southeast of the city, and by Amtrak at Pennsylvania Station, just north of downtown. Interstate 95 goes through the city; the I-395 spur goes to the Inner Harbor area.
Seasonal rates at hotels make winter the least expensive time to visit. A number of hotels are scattered around the harbor and downtown. Harbor Court (550 Light Street, 410-234-0550 or 800-824-0076) has 195 rooms and suites. Winter weekend rates for standard rooms range from $165 to $190.
The Admiral Fell Inn (888 South Broadway, 410-522-7377 or 800-292-4667) has 80 rooms offering a civilized retreat from the hustle of Fells Point. Winter weekend rates for standard rooms range from $145 to $199.
Scarborough Fair (1 East Montgomery Street, 410-837-0010), a bed-and-breakfast in an 1801 Federal Hill row house, has six rooms and a two-night minimum for most weekends. Rooms are $149 to $189 a night and include a full breakfast and parking.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Puttin' Down Mop, Puttin' On the Ritz

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
In her new single, "Jenny From the Block," Jennifer Lopez declares that despite her enormous wealth and global fame, she has not lost touch with her roots. The video may show her canoodling on the deck of a sailboat with the handsome Ben Affleck, her latest beau, and lounging half-dressed on an expensive-looking sofa in a lovely high-rise apartment, but the lyrics insist that at heart she is still a striving, streetwise Puerto Rican girl from New York City.
 Ms. Lopez's new movie, the blandly charming romantic comedy "Maid in Manhattan," makes a similar point. Her character, Marisa Ventura, is a single mother who lives in the Bronx and makes her living cleaning rooms in a super-luxurious Manhattan hotel. Even when her fortunes take a fairy-tale turn and she briefly trades in her maid's uniform for a creamy Dolce & Gabbana coat (and, later, a ravishing evening dress accessorized with a Harry Winston necklace), Marisa does not lose her tough, determined attitude. The film's message, like the song's, is that upward mobility is not a betrayal of working-class values but rather their ultimate fulfillment. 
 This is an appealing idea -- one that has sustained film comedies at least since the Depression. And Ms. Lopez, even in underwritten, not-funny-enough pictures like this one (or the earlier, somewhat similar "Wedding Planner") has some of the forthright magnetism of an old-time movie star. In the steamy "Jenny From the Block" video, she shows off her body, giving the cable subscribers of America generous glimpses of what may be, in celebrity if not in size, the biggest backside in the world. (At one point Mr. Affleck, to the envy of millions, uses it as a pillow.)
In contrast, "Maid in Manhattan," which opens today nationwide, is chastely directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Kevin Wade that contains just a few (perhaps contractually obligatory) references to that famous aspect of Ms. Lopez's anatomy, and it demonstrates that the most potent source of her sexiness is her eyes. You would have to go back to Claudette Colbert or the young Lauren Bacall to find an actress capable of projecting so much erotic self-confidence in a single gaze. And even when Marisa suffers inevitable humiliations and reversals of fortune, Ms. Lopez retains a suave, straight-backed dignity that makes her a credible feminist heroine as well as a bona fide sex symbol.
Unfortunately, her charisma is hampered by the blandness and banality of the movie itself, which squanders nearly every comic opportunity its urban Cinderella premise provides. Mr. Wang, whose earlier films include "The Joy Luck Club," "Smoke" and the wonderful "Chan Is Missing," has a palpable if sentimental affection for multiethnic urban life and an understated feel for both the indignities and the occasional pleasures of hard work in the service sector.
He respects the professionalism of the hotel workers and the friendly, relaxed solidarity that makes their jobs more bearable. The staff includes Bob Hoskins as a butler whose whispery punctiliousness recalls Anthony Hopkins in "Remains of the Day," Marissa Matrone as Marisa's wisecracking best pal and Chris Eigeman as the predictably uptight manager. All of them show suitable professionalism, but Mr. Wang and Mr. Wade have made them all a little too nice to be funny.
In general the picture is so committed to inoffensiveness and to hammering home its uplifting, bootstrap message that it lacks the necessary element of malice. The only safe satirical scapegoats are rich, single middle-aged women, like Caroline Lane, a brittle and snobbish Sotheby's executive played by Natasha Richardson, and her leathery, bigoted exercise partner (the hilarious and underused Amy Sedaris). They have some humorous moments, but scenes that should have a breakneck, spring-loaded rhythm unwind lazily without silliness or precision.
The plot, which might have been a fizzy exercise in latter-day screwball comedy, is set in motion when Marisa tries on some of Caroline's clothes and with the help of her 10-year-old son (Tyler Garcia Posey) catches the eye of Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a wealthy state assemblyman contemplating a run for the United States Senate seat once held by his father.
Marshall, whom the tabloids have dubbed "the playboy politico" and who is devoted to his large dog, is held on a tight leash by his adviser (Stanley Tucci), but he and Marisa nonetheless find time for a stroll in Central Park, where romantic sparks are kindled. Or at least they would be if Mr. Fiennes were not such a damp, milky presence. He tries for a fumbling, rich-guy charm but instead projects a diffidence unsuited either to an ambitious politician or a romantic lead. It's impossible to imagine this guy in bed with an Albany lobbyist, much less with Ms. Lopez.
Marshall does have one remarkable trait: he is a Republican. An environmentalist, silk-stocking John Lindsay type, to be sure, but still, after Spencer Tracy in "State of the Union," you could probably count the sympathetic big-screen members of the G.O.P. on the fingers of one hand. In any case, Marshall's party affiliation, which is no big deal for Marisa, can count as a touch of realism, given the current shape of New York politics.
And to its credit "Maid in Manhattan," more than most films of its kind, does try to find a balance between realism and whimsy, to suggest connections between the fantasy it projects and the world as it is. I only wish it were funnier, more persuasive and less pep-talky and that it came closer in spirit and execution to the studio comedies of the 1930's -- movies like "Easy Living" or "Midnight" -- which are its obvious models.
Perhaps, though, such gauzy, biting social comedies are no longer possible, which leads to a troubling thought. For movies like "Maid in Manhattan" to get much better, the economy may have to get much worse.
"Maid in Manhattan" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mild profanity and some discreet sexual scenes and references.

HEADLINE: Brazil's President-Elect Picks a Central Banker 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Brazil's left-leaning government-in- waiting today named Henrique Meirelles, former head of global banking at FleetBoston, as the new president of the central bank, in an effort to win over investors both here and abroad.
 Coming on the heels of the confirmation of Antonio Palocci as finance minister, the nomination of Mr. Meirelles is another attempt by President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to demonstrate that his Workers' Party is dumping leftist policies and shifting to the political center. 
 Mr. Meirelles, 57, will succeed Arminio Fraga, who is credited with restoring confidence in Brazil after its 1999 currency crisis. While lacking the technical experience of Mr. Fraga, a former manager for George Soros, Mr. Meirelles brings to the job a strong reputation and excellent banking contacts at a time when Brazil desperately needs to get foreign banks to restore credit lines to cash-starved exporters and banks in what is South America's biggest economy. 
"This is a very good choice," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist with West LB in New York. "He's got a solid banking background and a good name in the market." 
The reaction in the markets, however, was generally muted. The Bovespa stock index closed down 0.25 percent, while the currency, the real, weakened about 1 percent, to 3.79 to the United States dollar.
Mr. Meirelles led BankBoston's operations in Brazil for 12 years before becoming president and chief operating officer of the parent company in 1996. After BankBoston's acquisition by Fleet Financial, he became head of global and wholesale banking. 
He left his post at Fleet in August, returned home and was elected deputy for his home state of Goias for the Social Democratic Party of the departing president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
If confirmed by the Brazilian Congress, Mr. Meirelles will face a daunting task on taking office Jan. 1. 
He must rein in double-digit inflation, bolster the real, which has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, and generally try to restore confidence in Brazil's economy. 
Speaking at a news conference in Brasilia, Mr. Meirelles declined to talk about future policies but said his main task was "to make Brazil grow." 
"Our situation today is absolutely viable, Brazil's economic basics are solid and we have conditions to grow," he said. 
As a former commercial banker, Mr. Meirelles, analysts say, could be the man Brazil needs to persuade foreign banks to reopen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of credit lines to cash-starved Brazilian banks and exporters, credit that was cut off in the nervous run-up to Mr. da Silva's election victory. 
"Coming from a banking background, Meirelles understands how to talk to senior bank executives, knows what they worry about when it comes to allocating capital," said Doug Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered. 
"A lot hinges on what the international banks will do in terms of extending credit. That will have a huge impact on the real against the dollar, interest rates and ultimately jobs and inflation." 
With inflation at its highest level since 1994, it is unlikely Mr. Meirelles will deliver early on Workers' Party election pledges to lower interest rates that at 22 percent have the economy in a stranglehold. 
"Perhaps most important in restoring confidence is for Brazil to be seen to be fighting inflation," said Hugo Penteado, an economist with Banco Real ABN Amro in Sao Paulo. "He's a person who understands that, and so we'll probably see higher interest rates next year." 
Not surprisingly, radicals on the Workers' Party's left wing were disappointed at Mr. Meirelles's nomination. 
"Someone who for his whole career has served the international financial system is in no condition to serve the interests of this country," said Senator Heloisa Helena, an outspoken critic of her party's shift to the center.
Few expect that political pressure could cause Mr. Meirelles to veer off a market-friendly path.
"He will steer an orthodox course, there's simply no room for heterodox policies," Mr. Penteado of Banco Real ABN Amro said.
The only question, said Mr. Welch of West LB, "is what he'll do with monetary policy and so we must watch for whom he names as director of monetary policy."
Despite being a member of the outgoing governing party and making his career in international finance, Mr. Meirelles won points with Mr. da Silva partly because of his pioneering social work. 
Under Mr. Meirelles, BankBoston was active in restoring Sao Paulo's decaying city center and was one of the first banks to become involved in helping street children.

HEADLINE: Playing With Fire 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
The international community is playing a very dangerous game here in Venezuela, along with self-described democrats who are calling for military intervention. To consider what could go wrong, just look next door at Colombia, torn apart by civil war for half a century.
 Every evening at 8 p.m., middle-class Venezuelans pour out of their homes to bang pots to demand the resignation of President Hugo Chavez. If I were Venezuelan, I'd be with them. Mr. Chavez is an autocratic leftist demagogue who is running the economy into the ground, manipulating the Constitution and fostering hatred between rich and poor. Venezuela would be much better off if he resigned. 
 But he is also the elected president, and military intervention to oust him could trigger armed clashes. The global community has no right to try to nudge him out, and indeed should speak up and condemn the loose calls in Venezuela for army intervention.
At Altamira Plaza, the focal point of the anti-Chavez movement, senior military officers parade about in uniform and give rousing speeches calling on the armed forces to demand that President Chavez step down. 
"The military should have intervened long ago," Maj. Ulises Hernandez told me. "I don't know what has happened to their consciences."
Adm. Daniel Comisso put it this way: "The government is legitimate in its origins but was delegitimized by the way it exercised power. It systematically violated the Constitution. In that sense, the armed forces are obligated to act."
Washington has mostly kept to the sidelines, after its embarrassing endorsement of an aborted coup against Mr. Chavez in April, carefully and wisely calling only for an "electoral solution." But Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who is representing the international community as a negotiator between the two sides, has publicly laid much of the blame for the crisis on President Chavez in an apparent shove to get him to resign or call early elections.
Huh? What Latin America needs is stability and respect for electoral office, not what could be interpreted as a signal from Mr. Gaviria to people across Latin America: If you think your president is illegitimate, take to the streets and call for a coup, and then the international community will arrange a nice compromise. 
Make no mistake: This is not about Venezuela alone. The larger issue of elected leaders who go wrong has come up in Pakistan, Peru and the Philippines, just to stick with the P's.
If an elected president is slaughtering citizens, invading neighbors, brewing nerve gas or proclaiming himself president for life, it's fine for the world to help oust him. But polls show Mr. Chavez still has the support of about one-third of the electorate, and it's conceivable that he would win new elections if they were forced on him.
Granted, American officials are in a conundrum because it would be bad for the whole hemisphere if we were stuck with President Chavez until his term ends in 2007. But even he accepts that a binding referendum to remove him from office is constitutional beginning next August, half-way through his term. So why not wait and remove him then, when everyone agrees it is constitutional to do so?
The risk of forcibly removing Mr. Chavez immediately is that the poor who passionately embrace him will riot and bring Venezuela down. "It could get so bad we would have to loot," said Jose Siso, a hawker of Indian bread, who compared Mr. Chavez to Jesus. (The opposition demonstrators compare him to Hitler.)
The risk of violence is so great that Washington should get involved, ideally with Colin Powell coming for a day to knock heads together. But instead of leaning just on Mr. Chavez, we must also repeatedly insist that army officers stay in the barracks, that the opposition respect constitutional forms, and that a solution does not set a destabilizing precedent.
A Venezuelan journalist I met, Francisco Toro, is strongly against Mr. Chavez but also worries about the consequences of his removal. "In Colombia in 1948, the oligarchs assassinated the populist leader Jorge Gaitan," Mr. Toro said, "because he represented a particular problem that they wanted to solve. They never dreamed that 54 years later, Colombia would still be in civil war. You know how something like this starts, but you don't know how it ends."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIAN ARENA; 
North Korea to Reactivate An Idled Nuclear Reactor

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
In a challenge to the United States, North Korea said today that it was immediately reactivating a nuclear reactor idled since a 1994 crisis that nearly led to war between the countries.
 The reactor at Yongbyon is capable of producing enough plutonium for the country to make one or two nuclear weapons a year, according to American intelligence officials. 
 North Korea justified the decision -- the latest in a sharply downward spiral in relations with Washington -- by declaring it the only way to produce electricity to make up for the recent suspension of fuel oil deliveries from the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union. The fuel cutoff, in turn, was announced as a punishment for a secret nuclear weapons program, whose existence American diplomats say North Korea first acknowledged during an American visit in early October.
"The prevailing situation compelled the D.P.R.K. government to lift its nuclear freeze adopted on the premise that 500,000 tons of heavy oil would be annually supplied," North Korea's Foreign Ministry announced, using the initials for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. "Whether the D.P.R.K. refreezes its nuclear facilities or not hinges upon the U.S." 
The International Atomic Energy Agency, which has monitors at the North Korean plant to make sure it is not reactivated, received a letter today from Ri Je Son, the director general of North Korea's Department of Atomic Energy, asking for the removal of seals and monitoring cameras, officials at the agency's headquarters in Vienna said.
According to a statement today, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the atomic agency, immediately wrote back to urge North Korea to "act with restraint" and "not to take any unilateral action that might further complicate" the agency's program in North Korea. 
Mr. ElBaradei said it was "essential that the containment and surveillance measures which are currently in place continue to be maintained," and warned that altering the seals would be a violation of international agreements. He called for an urgent meeting with North Korea to work out new monitoring procedures.
A senior Bush administration official called the North Korean request "a very serious matter," but described no consequences for the North if it insisted on the atomic agency's withdrawal.
Similarly, at the White House today, Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, played down any sense of urgency about North Korea's announcement, which he called "regrettable." 
But there was no talk of the options that the Clinton administration discussed in 1994, when North Korea's threat to restart the reactor and "uncan" nuclear waste now in storage prompted a reinforcement of American troops on the Korean Peninsula and discussion of whether it would be possible to bomb the nuclear site.
This time the White House took the reverse approach, reassuring North Korea today that it had no plans to invade. But, Mr. Fleischer said, it also said there was nothing negotiable about the termination of North Korea's nuclear projects -- either its recently revealed effort to produce a bomb from highly enriched uranium, or the plutonium production it now threatens to restart. 
"The international community has made it clear that North Korea's relations with the outside world hinge on th elimination of its nuclear weapons program," Mr. Fleischer said.
Other American officials said that although they were not surprised by the North Korean announcement, they considered it a major challenge -- one that the administration would probably not focus on until the confrontation with Iraq was ended.
"One rogue state crisis at a time," a senior administration official said today, describing President Bush's strategy. 
Several American officials noted that the North Korean statement made reference to its willingness to "refreeze" the program if it won the kind of relationships it seeks with the United States. The administration has been divided on the question of whether North Korea is willing to trade away its nuclear program, or determined to hold onto it as a negotiating card with the United States.
In previous statements, North Korea has expressed a willingness to discuss all of its weapons of mass destruction with the United States in exchange for an offer of normalized relations and a guarantee against attack. Mr. Bush's inclusion of North Korea in the "axis of evil" has seriously rattled its government, which seems to believe that it could be attacked after a possible invasion of Iraq. "The U.S. has already listed the D.P.R.K. as part of an 'axis of evil' and a target of pre-emptive nuclear attack," today's statement read.
Another corner of the "axis of evil," Iran, also disquieted American officials today, with revelations from commercial photographs apparently taken in September. They were said to show a plant for producing heavy water, which is critical in the process of making a plutonium weapon, and a plant to enrich uranium. 
But the more immediate issue was the North Korean announcement, which today prompted an emergency meeting of the South Korean cabinet, which urged its neighbor to "observe all the obligations stipulated in the 1994 Geneva Accord, Inter-Korean Denuclearization Declaration, Nonproliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards," in a statement released by the Foreign Ministry.
In South Korea, which is one week away from presidential elections, the two major candidates have offered sharply different visions of relations with their neighbor. Throughout the campaign, there have also been large anti-American demonstrations, with many protesters condemning the presence of 37,000 American troops in the country and denouncing United States policy toward North Korea.
The North Korean statements have come like a last-minute wild card that could have an unpredictable influence the outcome.
One candidate, Roh Moo Hyun, offers continuing aid for North Korea and other reconciliation efforts, while the other, Lee Hoi Chang, is largely in line with the Bush administration, warning of sanctions if North Korea does not modify its behavior.
Mr. Roh, who according to the latest opinion polls is the narrow front-runner, has the most to lose from a sudden heightening of tensions. He said today in a carefully hedged statement that although "the world is alarmed by North Korea's announced plan to resume the operation of nuclear facilities and its threat to develop nuclear weapons," the United States should pursue dialogue and "cooperate, so that this problem can be resolved peacefully without further building tension on the Korean Peninsula." 
Spent fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor are being kept in a cooling pond under the surveillance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Their presence ensures that the rods are not reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium. Expulsion of the inspectors, or removal of the fuel, would heighten the confrontation, but analysts said tonight that the wording of the North Korean statement suggested that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, had not yet resolved to take such steps.
"We've seen no evidence of any renewed activity around Yongbyon," said one Bush administration official. He noted that restarting the reactor would take time, and that there would be an additional lag before it produced the nuclear waste that would aid the weapons project.
Adhering to a pattern that has held throughout the current crisis, North Korea leavened its defiance with an apparent call for a negotiated solution. "It is the invariable stand of the D.P.R.K. government to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula," the Foreign Ministry statement read.
In recent weeks, the Bush administration has said there cannot be any negotiations until North Korea takes "clear and verifiable" strides toward dismantling the uranium enrichment program.
By conducting that program in secret, in violation of many agreements, North Korea has strengthened the hand of critics in Washington who have long contended that negotiations are worthless.
"North Korea's traditional negotiating behavior, of pushing up to the brink of a crisis and then climbing down from it can be seen in this statement," said Victor D. Cha, a professor of government at Georgetown University. "It is a combination of threats and olive branch, but when you take the olive branch, the cooperation becomes a sinkhole."
Japanese officials expressed strong dismay tonight over the announcement but played down the immediate threat, saying the statement appeared aimed at bringing the United States to the negotiating table.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE ECONOMY; 
Offering Range of Estimates In Projecting Strike's Toll

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg warned this week that a transit strike would cost New York City $100 million to $350 million a day in economic damage, New Yorkers may have wondered how he computed those numbers, or even whether he conjured them out of political thin air.
 The answer, it turns out, is that the projection is both more straightforward and more complicated than anyone might have imagined. 
 On the one hand, Mr. Bloomberg relies on a simple formula to come up with a dollar range so broad that hardly any economists or transportation experts will challenge it. But whether the actual cost of a strike ends up being closer to $100 million or to $350 million depends on a dizzying array of assumptions and factors incorporating everything from New Yorkers' work habits to tourists' shopping habits and something beyond anyone's control: the weather. 
Indeed, some economists believe that the $350 million figure may be understated, since it does not account for the city's cash economy or the smaller costs that may be borne by people forced to rearrange every aspect of their lives.
"Any two people looking at this can come up with different answers that are perfectly defensible," said Marcia Van Wagner, chief economist of the Citizens Budget Commission. "There's not a right answer, necessarily."
Coming up with a ballpark figure is not that hard to do. According to the city's Economic Development Corporation, this is the basic recipe:
Step one: Take the annual gross city product ($450 billion), which is the value of goods and services created in the city. Step two: Divide that by the number of working days in a year (250) to come up with a daily output figure ($1.8 billion). Step three: If 5 to 20 percent of the work force cannot make it to work because of the strike, as many economists and city officials predict, reduce the daily output by 5 to 20 percent.
Presto: That translates into a range of $90 million to $360 million. Or close enough to $100 million and $350 million.
Of course, the world of numbers is often as politicized as the world of words. So it is all the more remarkable that every single economist and transportation expert interviewed for this article concluded that the range was reasonable, and that not one could detect any political spin.
"It's true that in the past, the mayor has plucked numbers out of the air," said James A. Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, which has disagreed with Mr. Bloomberg's projections on previous issues, like the living-wage bill.
Calculating things himself, Mr. Parrott said he had no qualms about the mayor's projections. "On this, given the back-of-the-envelope logic that I just went through, if it's $100 million, $200 million, $300 million -- that's plausible," he said.
Some people, including Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who lives in Brooklyn, feel that the number should be on the lower end because of telecommuting and other technological advances.
Others, though, believe that the higher number makes more sense, especially since the 1980 transit strike, according to some economists, cost the city $100 million a day -- in warm weather, and not during the height of the retail and tourist season. Indeed, the Economic Development Corporation estimates that the impact of a strike now may be $345 million to $370 million a day -- $320 million in lost productivity and $25 million to $50 million in lost retail sales and taxes. 
Even those who do make it to work may not be as productive because of their new and horribly bad treks to work, said Robert Paaswell, director of the University Transportation Research Center at City College.
"They might spend the first half-hour at work sleeping, and then they'd talk about how they had to walk over the bridge," he said.
Another salient reason why some economists believe the projections are low is that they exclude the city's cash economy. While there are no current statistics available, a 1993 study by the New York City Office of the Comptroller estimated that legal but unreported income from jobs in, for instance, construction, restaurants and child care, was $39 billion, or one-seventh the size of the city's official economy. 
If that same ratio applied today, the size of the cash economy would be about $64.3 billion, or $257 million a day. And if 5 to 20 percent of those workers could not make it to their jobs because of a strike, the corresponding losses would be an additional $13 million to $51 million a day.
The mayor's projections also omit what the ripple effects may be in the suburbs. And they do not attempt to quantify indirect costs.
What, for instance, would the impact be on someone who was unemployed and had lined up a series of job interviews? Or on someone who depended on an hourly job that could go to someone else who did not have to travel as far? Or on the extended universe of people who would be affected if one family's fragile latticework of day care, school pickups and household help collapsed?
There is also quite a bit of discretion in stating that the economy may shrink by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. Predicting economic loss is not unlike predicting the weather; one has to consider an infinite number of fickle factors -- like the length of the strike, tourists, people's moods and, naturally, the weather.
Then there is the psychological toll. Some business executives, economists and local officials fret that an antagonistic labor dispute may stall the city's attempts to recover from Sept. 11, confront huge budget deficits and bid for the 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, regardless of the exact economic toll, the most important message may be that New York can scarcely afford another debilitating episode, said Elliot G. Sander, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, and a former city transportation commissioner. 
"You know what is a body blow as compared to something that is less serious, and the actual estimate that different economists will come up with is less significant than the order of magnitude," he said. "It's like the Richter Scale. On the scale of 1 to 7, this would be pretty close to a 7."

HEADLINE: Wall Street in Washington 

 BODY:
President Bush's first economic team never commanded financial markets' respect. Now, on his second go-round, he's hoping to address this failure with two high-powered Wall Streeters. Stephen Friedman, a former Goldman Sachs co-chairman, will replace Lawrence Lindsey as the top White House economic adviser. William Donaldson, who founded his own brokerage firm and is a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, will become the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Having the confidence of the markets is important, but the danger is that in seeking to please the clubby world of Wall Street, the administration may be sacrificing reformist zeal. Admittedly, the White House's interest in cleaning up Wall Street practices has been sporadic, but average investors are still shaken from the rash of corporate scandals that came to light in the last year. They are rightly looking to the federal government to put an end to accounting shenanigans, brokers' corrupt research and other unsavory practices. 
 Given the mission at hand, Mr. Donaldson's appointment to lead the S.E.C., the investor's guardian, may be the more troublesome. A man whose extracurricular activities outside the boardroom include stints as the founding dean of Yale's management school and as under secretary of state in the Ford administration, Mr. Donaldson, who is 71, practically oozes gravitas. The question is whether one of the financial community's elder statesmen has the temperament, and the inclination, to serve as a beat cop, altering the way his Wall Street peers do business, and punishing them when necessary. 
Mr. Donaldson can go a long way toward answering that question by prodding the four sitting commissioners to go ahead and appoint a strong investor advocate like John Biggs to head the new accounting oversight board. At his confirmation hearings, senators should also scrutinize Mr. Donaldson's 11-month tenure at the helm of Aetna, the troubled health care company, in 2000-2001. Mr. Donaldson must also explain why, as head of the stock exchange in the early 1990's, he sought to dilute reporting obligations for foreign companies, and why he later opposed passage of an S.E.C. rule forcing companies to disclose information to all investors on a non-discriminatory basis.

HEADLINE: The Corridor From Goldman To WashingtonIs Well Traveled 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Stephen Friedman, named yesterday to serve as the White House's chief economic adviser, is only the latest in a long line of well-known alumni of Goldman Sachs who have found life after Wall Street in powerful Washington positions.
 In the early 1990's, Mr. Friedman served as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most prestigious investment bank in New York. Now, he is following the same path from 85 Broad Street to Pennsylvania Avenue taken by the other co-chairman at that time, Robert E. Rubin, who left Goldman in 1992 to join the Clinton administration. After taking the same White House position Mr. Friedman is about to assume, Mr. Rubin went on to become Treasury secretary two years later. 
 The Goldman-Washington relationship comes in many forms. Jon Corzine, who succeeded Mr. Rubin and Mr. Friedman, is a Democratic Senator representing New Jersey. Mr. Corzine's co-head at Goldman, Henry M. Paulson Jr., served in the Nixon White House. John C. Whitehead left the top position at Goldman in 1985 to become deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration before returning to New York, where he is chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
What is it about Goldman that makes it such a popular feeding ground for Democratic and Republican administrations alike?
There are several reasons, but many insiders attribute the firm's stature in Washington largely to a Goldman culture that values teamwork over individual self-gratification. In a city where politicians often elbow each other to grab the limelight, Goldman alumni have been trained to stand in the back and let their bosses shine.
Senator Corzine, who took the more unconventional route of running for high public office, said: "At Goldman, you work as a team. It's not about individuals as much as about a group of people being successful. That was part and parcel of the partner's culture."
He continued: "It's not about ego gratification. It was the hallmark of the Rubin era and it was the way with Whitehead, too. They were willing to work hard to make the president look good and take on tasks that were not necessarily the most glamorous, but were important contributions."
In the Bush administration, Mr. Friedman will see some familiar faces. Josh Bolten, who worked with Mr. Friedman at Goldman, is White House deputy chief of staff and an architect of the Bush economic plan. Reuben Jeffery left Goldman earlier this year to coordinate the Bush administration's efforts to rebuild Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks.
In the Clinton administration, a Goldman partner, Kenneth D. Brody, was named chairman of the Export-Import Bank, while Gary Gensler, a Goldman partner who retired from the firm at the age of 39, was assistant secretary for financial markets under Mr. Rubin.
"You must say that eyebrows go up when you hear of another Goldman person going to such a senior position in Washington," said Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who has represented several Goldman partners. "They have a phenomenal number of people rotating out of the firm at an early age, looking to do something good for their country. You don't see that at other firms."
To be sure, many people have shuttled between Wall Street and Washington. Over the years, executives at every place from Merrill Lynch to Lehman Brothers, from Dillon Read to Credit Suisse First Boston, have taken top positions in the executive branch. Just this week, William H. Donaldson, a founding partner of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, was named to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, after having served in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
But no firm, in a tradition that dates back to World War II, appears to have been as consistent a source of high-level government talent as Goldman. Moreover, the Goldman-to-government transplants have a good track record. No Goldman reputations have been sullied by the taint of scandal. Nor have they exhibited the tin ear for politics that have tripped up some other Wall Streeters.
Mr. Gensler, the former Goldman partner who served in the Clinton administration, recalls that all Goldman employees are issued a plastic wallet card outlining the firm's core values: client first, team second and the individual last. Despite all the public preening, the same values, he insisted, work well in Washington, too.
"What Whitehead had, or Bob and Steve, or myself, is years of training in putting the team ahead of the individual," Mr. Gensler said.
"To rise up at Goldman, individuals generally need to keep their ego in check. If they don't know how, they learn it."
There are practical reasons for this trend, too. Goldman has a lot of extremely wealthy partners who retire in their 40's or 50's -- far younger than at other firms -- and are looking for a second career. At any given time, there are about 200 Goldman partners. The expectation is that most will remain at Goldman for about 10 years and then leave to make way for new partners.
With their intelligence, ambition and riches, these financiers can enter public service without crimping their lifestyle. At the low end, Goldman partners walk away with $20 million to $40 million. For people at the level of Mr. Rubin, Mr. Friedman or Senator Corzine, the sum can be hundreds of millions of dollars.
"You have a lot of talented guys who are still young and looking for important things to do," said Roy Smith, a former Goldman partner and finance professor at New York University. "They could start another business. But that's not as interesting as getting your arms around something the scale of the national economy."
The road to Washington was first paved by Sidney Weinberg, the father of the modern Goldman firm and a senior partner for 39 years. Mr. Weinberg served as vice chairman of the War Production Board in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, recruiting business executives to unsalaried positions. Since then, community service -- along with landing big and profitable deals -- is one way for Goldman partners to rise in the organization.
"There was always an expectation at Goldman that people would give back to their communities," Senator Corzine said. "There was a general expectation that Goldman people had a responsibility to serve on boards, participate in philanthropy." 
In taking government positions, Mr. Weinberg and, later Mr. Whitehead, became role models for others.
"When you see other people at Goldman, like Whitehead, doing something different, you say, 'I can do that. I can give back that way,' " Mr. Brody, the former Export-Import Bank chairman, said.
Indeed, Mr. Gensler said the first person he went to when considering a job in Washington was Mr. Whitehead. "He sat down with me and said to me, 'You have to do this,' " Mr. Gensler remembered. "He said it was the best experience of his life."

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
Economic Adviser From Other Side of the Deficit -- Stephen Friedman

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
In choosing Stephen Friedman as his chief economic adviser, President Bush is getting a Wall Street veteran who is tenacious in pursuit of his ideas but will probably maintain a markedly lower profile than his predecessor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, friends and former colleagues of Mr. Friedman say.
 Mr. Friedman, 64, is following the path of his former partner, Robert E. Rubin, in leaving Wall Street for Washington. The two were co-chairmen of the Goldman Sachs investment bank from 1990 to 1992, when Mr. Rubin resigned to lead President Bill Clinton's National Economic Council. 
 Though the presidents who called them to Washington are poles apart politically, Mr. Friedman, 64, is close to Mr. Rubin, and the two men are similar in style. At Goldman Sachs, each man routinely fostered debate among the firm's partners to ensure that everyone's voice had been heard before a decision was made. Mr. Friedman, who colleagues said exudes more energy than the reserved Mr. Rubin, had a habit of rolling up his shirt sleeves and taking notes on a legal pad as he listened.
"Steve is as good a partner as anybody could have," Mr. Rubin, who became Treasury secretary and is now chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, said in an interview this week. "He's very good at working with people and trying to draw out all the pluses and minuses in whatever is being considered."
People who know Mr. Friedman said they doubted that he would serve simply as a salesman for an already formed economic plan. As a director and financial supporter of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that says it advocates fiscal responsibility, Mr. Friedman has lent his voice to arguments against deficit spending by the federal government. 
"I will be surprised if he isn't a moderating force," said Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator from Nebraska who is president of the New School University in New York. Mr. Kerrey, who is co-chairman of the Concord Coalition, said he believed that Mr. Friedman could convince President Bush that unconstrained deficits would threaten economic growth.
"I believe he knows how to do that," Mr. Kerrey said. "He knows you don't do it publicly, you make your arguments privately."
Around Goldman Sachs, Mr. Friedman is remembered for having built the firm's lucrative practice of advising companies on mergers and acquisitions. During the takeover boom of the 1980's, he developed Goldman Sach's strategy of representing companies under siege by hostile acquirers, rather than the buyers. He counseled chief executives to anticipate what the raiders would do and beat them to the pass, either by courting friendlier acquirers or putting up defenses.
Goldman Sachs, which was a private partnership until May 1999, was famous on Wall Street for keeping its internal squabbles to itself. Mr. Friedman was chairman in 1994 during one of the rare instances in which turmoil within the firm was on display.
After earning a record profit of $2.6 billion before taxes in 1993, Goldman Sachs ran into trouble when the bond market tumbled the next year. Big losses on some bets on the direction of interest rates cut the firm's 1994 profit to about $500 million. The reversal brought about an exodus among Goldman's senior partners, most of whose personal wealth was tied up in the firm. Mr. Friedman himself surprised his partners by announcing his resignation in September 1994. He said that running the firm alone, after Mr. Rubin's departure, had exhausted him.
Mr. Friedman later joined MMC Capital, the investment arm of the Marsh & McLennan Companies, an insurance and investment firm, as a senior principal. 
Stephen Friedman, born Dec. 21, 1937, in Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University and Columbia University's law school. He was chairman of Columbia's board of trustees from 1997 to 2001.
George E. Rupp, former president of Columbia, said Mr. Friedman had deftly managed a crisis in the delivery of health care by hospitals affiliated with the university. The university was squeezed by the rising cost of providing care to low-income patients, Mr. Rupp recalled.
"The way Steve Friedman deals with issues is to assemble all relevant data and then work out alternative scenarios that make the most of the assets in the equation," Mr. Rupp said. "He's very imaginative in sizing up alternatives."
Some people who know Mr. Friedman trace those skills to his days as a wrestler. His athletic exploits at Cornell University in the late 1950's -- he was Eastern champion at 157 pounds in 1959 -- earned him a spot in the university's hall of fame.
Goldman Sach's current chairman, Henry M. Paulson, was a protege of Mr. Friedman's in the mid-1970's when he made the mistake of challenging his mentor to a wrestling match at a gathering of the firm's executives. Mr. Paulson, a tall, broad-shouldered former wrestler and football player, went to the mat with Mr. Friedman, unaware of the wiry Mr. Friedman's accomplishments.
Mr. Friedman repeatedly pinned Mr. Paulson, who frequently recounts the story, adding the lesson that he learned: Always do your homework.
Just off a plane from Tokyo last night, Mr. Paulson applauded the choice of Mr. Friedman, who has been a director of Goldman Sachs since May.
"This job provides Steve with a tremendous opportunity by bringing his management skills and financial savvy to the White House," Mr. Paulson said. "We lose a director but the country gains a great financial strategist."

HEADLINE: Tougher Rules Are Proposed For Gas Mileage 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration proposed the largest increase in automotive fuel economy in more than a decade today, calling for a 7 percent improvement in the performance of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans.
 Critics, including many environmentalists and top Democrats, said the proposal demanded no more of the auto industry than it had already committed itself to achieve on its own. But the plan was praised by some moderates, and auto executives called it a challenge. 
 The proposal would require automakers to increase the average fuel economy of so-called light trucks by 1.5 miles per gallon, to an average of 22.2 miles per gallon, by the 2007 model year. The administration said that would reduce gasoline consumption by 2.5 billion gallons through that year. 
"I'm sure everyone who doesn't know about the industry will say, 'Gee-whiz, what's a couple of tenths of miles per gallon per year?' " said Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who announced the proposal in Washington. "This is going to be challenging for the industry to meet, but we feel they can do it." 
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is considering challenging President Bush in 2004, was unimpressed. "The administration is merely ratifying less than what industry is already doing on its own, without challenge or incentive," he said. 
The Ford Motor Company has pledged a 25 percent improvement in the fuel economy of its sport utilities by mid-decade. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have said they will be competitive with Ford.
"Improving the average S.U.V.'s fuel economy by a paltry one and a half miles a gallon would save less than 3 percent of the oil we already import from Iraq," Senator Kerry said.
Senator Kerry was the co-sponsor of a Senate proposal, with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to require a 50 percent increase in fuel economy for light trucks and for cars over 12 years. It was defeated in March by a wide margin.
The administration plan calls for three annual increases in light truck fuel economy beginning in the 2005 model year. Suggestions will be accepted for 60 days, and then the regulators can impose the change without Congressional approval.
Booming sales of sport utilities and pickups have become an issue at a time of escalating tension in the Middle East and growing dependence on imported oil. But proposals to improve fuel economy have long faced stiff opposition from the domestic carmakers, labor unions and sympathetic lawmakers -- in part because S.U.V. sales, in particular, have become crucial to the Big Three's profitability.
Today, government officials from both parties characterized the Bush administration's plan as a way to take some action beyond what its predecessors could accomplish without offending the industry.
"It is good economic news for consumers, and it illustrates the administration's commitment to address concerns about both energy security and global climate change," said John Graham, head of the Office of Management and Budget, which reviewed and approved the proposal. Mr. Graham said the proposal would cost automakers and consumers $373 million, but produce $794 million in fuel savings over the lives of the affected vehicles.
Growing sales of sport utilities have reduced the fuel economy of the average vehicle in the United States to its lowest point in two decades.
Each automaker's light trucks are now required to average 20.7 miles per gallon, though there is some flexibility to carry over credits year to year. Cars must average 27.5 miles per gallon. The government's measure overstates actual fuel economy by 18 percent, experts say.
The industry takes advantage of the split standard by designing vehicles that resemble cars, like Chrysler's PT Cruiser, yet qualify as light trucks because they have attributes like a rear seat that can be folded down to form a flat bed.
Dr. Runge said that he had no plans to demand better fuel economy for cars, citing a concern that automakers would meet a tighter standard by reducing the weight of cars. Doing that would put occupants of cars at greater risk in collisions with light trucks, said Dr. Runge, a former emergency room physician.
Another official involved in regulatory deliberations said that the administration was considering more steps after the 2007 model year. It might revise the definition of a light truck so that carlike vehicles are not included, he said, while the light truck standards might be extended to include the biggest sport utilities, like Hummers, which are not now subject to fuel economy rules.
Many environmental groups said that the administration's announced plans did not go far enough.
"The Bush administration is being irresponsible, because they're failing to make the auto companies use existing technology to cut oil consumption, cut pollution and save consumers money at the gas pump," said Daniel Becker, the top energy expert at the Sierra Club. The proposal, he added, was "so minuscule that it won't be felt."
Not all were as critical of the proposal to tighten so-called corporate average fuel economy requirements.
"The sad fact is that this is the most meaningful step the country has taken on oil dependence since Jimmy Carter was president," said John DeCicco, a senior fellow at Environmental Defense, an advocacy group in New York. 
Big Three officials called the proposal a challenge because they are struggling to meet the current requirements while expanding their truck sales. Moreover, they worry that the plan could create an advantage for some Asian automakers. 
For example, the average fuel economy of Honda's light trucks last year was 24.9 miles per gallon, well above the proposed new standard. Toyota's was 22.1 miles per gallon, just short of the new proposal.
According to an administration official, data submitted by the industry indicate that Nissan and G.M. will be the most hard pressed to meet the tougher standards.
"This proposal represents a significant increase," said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the principal industry lobbying group on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Mayor Bloomberg's Downtown 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's long-awaited plan for Lower Manhattan is a bracing tonic for anyone dispirited about the future of downtown New York City. The mayor's vision is first and foremost about livability. He wants an area with the offices and amenities that the financial business community wants, but also with housing, parks and schools. By lining streets with trees and making judicious use of the waterfront, Mr. Bloomberg wants to turn the intimidating neighborhood of Wall Street canyons into a place that is both elegant and down to earth. It is a Lower Manhattan that invites people to come -- a perfect response to the terrorist attack that tried to scare humanity away. 
 The mayor's proposal focused mostly on the area beyond the World Trade Center site; the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is scheduled to unveil new plans for ground zero itself next week. One of the most ambitious and potentially controversial parts of the proposal involves transportation. His top priority is creating a "one-seat" ride from downtown to the region's airports by extending the PATH to Newark's airport and building a new tunnel under the East River to reach Kennedy Airport. 
 Mr. Bloomberg is right about the critical importance of improving access to the area, but tunnel-building is an idea that many of his predecessors have embraced and then found it impossible to accomplish. The mayor argues that downtown will need quick access to the airports if it is going to compete for jobs with London, Berlin and Hong Kong. That is certainly true, but the tunnel would be both the costliest and most politically difficult part of the plan to pull off.
The mayor's dream carries a $10.6 billion price tag, and he is offering some inventive ways of getting the money. They include a tax incentive for foreign companies that move to downtown and the sale of real estate development rights. It's a complicated endeavor, but the kind of project that many voters hoped a former corporate executive might be able to come up with.
Being a practical man, the mayor certainly understands that the rebirth of downtown won't occur at his command, particularly in the current economic climate. But he reminded New Yorkers yesterday that their city has often built against the odds: Central Park was created in the midst of a financial panic and the Empire State Building was constructed during the Depression. Mr. Bloomberg's vision for Lower Manhattan follows in that powerful New York tradition.

HEADLINE: In Order, President Eases Limits On U.S. Aid to Religious Groups 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush acted today to make it easier for religious organizations to receive federal money for social welfare programs, invoking both executive powers and his belief in the power of faith to help society's neediest people.
 His move on one of his signature issues was applauded by religious and community organizations and by many conservatives as a way to encourage churches, synagogues, mosques and groups associated with them to do more to help the poor, the sick and the troubled. But it was criticized by some Democrats and civil liberties groups as an infringement on the separation of church and state and a step backward on discrimination in hiring. 
 People on both sides of the issue said the most important element of Mr. Bush's action was its assertion that federal law does not require religious groups to give up their right to hire on the basis of religious belief just because they become federal contractors. A dispute over how to deal with hiring discrimination was the main reason Mr. Bush's proposals in support of religion-based charitable work -- a centerpiece of his presidential campaign and one of the first pieces of legislation he sought from Congress after taking office -- have languished in the Senate. 
Mr. Bush, whose action today was an effort to break that logjam, said he wanted to continue pursuing legislation on the issue. But he took the action despite the shift in control in the Senate to Republican from Democratic, leading some of his critics to say he had gone farther through his own powers than even his own party would be willing to go legislatively.
In an executive order, Mr. Bush broadly required that federal agencies not discriminate against religious organizations in awarding money to community and social services groups for programs to help people in need. 
Mr. Bush also signed a separate executive order establishing offices of religion-based initiatives in the Agriculture Department and the Agency for International Development, joining similar offices already established in five other big government agencies. And he directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to allow religious nonprofit groups to qualify for aid after disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes in the same way that secular nonprofit groups can qualify.
The president's speech here announcing the actions was infused with references to faith and was built around the idea that religion can and should occupy a central place in both public and private life.
"Through all these actions, I hope that every faith-based group in America, the social entrepreneurs of America, understand that this government respects your work and we respect the motivation behind your work," Mr. Bush said. "We do not want you to become carbon copies of public programs. We want you to follow your heart. We want you to follow the word. We want you to do the works of kindness and mercy you are called upon to do."
Speaking in forceful and often emotional terms that drew repeated "amens" and applause from a lunchtime crowd of people involved in religion-based community programs, Mr. Bush drew a distinction between government financing for religious activities, which he said was wrong, and government financing for efforts by groups with religious ties to help the neediest.
"If a charity is helping the needy, it should not matter if there is a rabbi on the board, or a cross or a crescent on the wall, or a religious commitment in the charter," he said. "The days of discriminating against religious groups just because they are religious are coming to an end."
But Democrats said Mr. Bush's action undermined a legal principle dating to 1941 under which groups that receive federal financing must adhere to nondiscrimination standards. They said it would do so by allowing religious organizations not only to hire only people of their own faith, but also potentially to rule out some job seekers on the basis of other factors like sexual orientation that might clash with their religion's tenets.
"Under the new rule, organizations can accept public funds and then refuse to employ persons because they are Jewish, Catholic, unmarried, gay or lesbian," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. "Rather than use the faith-based initiative to undermine our national commitment to civil rights, the president's executive order should have made clear that no organization receiving taxpayer money can discriminate in its services or its employment practices."
Christopher Anders, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said Mr. Bush had "accomplished at the stroke of a pen what he couldn't get through Congress in the last two years and what he calculated he couldn't even get from a Republican Congress next year, which is a tremendous rollback to civil rights protections."
James Towey, the director of the White House's Office of Faith-Based Initiatives, said Mr. Bush's action was consistent with federal law holding that religious groups are permitted to hire on the basis of religion. He said it would apply to groups that receive federal contracts of $10,000 or more, but not federal grants.
"The president simply feels that this executive order will clarify that these groups keep that civil right they have when they do federal contracting," Mr. Towey told reporters this morning on Air Force One.
Asked whether Mr. Bush believed that religious groups would be able to discriminate based on characteristics like sexual orientation, a senior administration official said the president believes religion-based organizations "should be able to hire people that support their vision and mission" in a way consistent with previous court rulings on the issue.
The president's effort to promote religion-based social programs has met with a mixed reaction from religious groups. It has been opposed by most mainline Protestants, such as the president's own denomination, the United Methodist Church, and by most Reform and Conservative Jewish groups. It has been supported by most evangelical and Orthodox Jewish groups, while African American denominations have been split.
Mr. Bush's efforts to promote his religion-based agenda have taken on extra political resonance in recent weeks. Esquire magazine recently published a story quoting John DiIulio, the first head of the White House's religion-based office, saying politics had trumped policy making within the administration. Mr. DiIulio -- who is from Philadelphia, where Mr. Bush spoke today -- later apologized and said his statements had been baseless. But Democrats have seized on them to suggest that Mr. Bush is driven by a desire to please his party's right wing.
The president's move today took by surprise some groups that had been monitoring Mr. Bush's efforts. On Monday, leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Leadership Committee on Civil Rights, the American Association of University Women and Americans United for Separation of Church and State met with Mr. Towey. Some of the people present at the meeting said Mr. Towey gave no indication that the president was about to take the action he took today.
Representatives of some of those groups said today that they were outraged.
But Mr. Bush won cautious support from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. He said that Mr. Bush's executive order did not appear to usurp existing state and local civil rights laws and that "on the surface it sounds like a sound plan for realizing the principle of equal treatment for faith-based groups."

HEADLINE: In Scandals, Another High Price to Pay 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Virtue may have been its own reward for white knights of old, but the paragons brought in these days to help save corporations battered by scandal are quite well compensated.
 Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is getting $800 an hour to help straighten out WorldCom. His firm is billing WorldCom at least $300,000 a month, according to some lawyers in the case -- the exact amount is being kept under wraps. 
 Richard L. Thornburgh, a former attorney general, is billing WorldCom about $600 an hour. William R. McLucas, a former director of enforcement at the S.E.C., is charging $715 an hour for investigating potential fraud at the company. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has thrown his hat into the ring as a scrubber of corporate souls, too -- but no one is talking about his hourly rates. 
It is not unusual for senior bankruptcy lawyers to charge $550 to $650 an hour, with a very few well-known lawyers billing about $700. Neal Batson, one such expert at the law firm of Alston & Bird, is getting close to $600 an hour for his role in the Enron bankruptcy proceedings and submitted a bill for $122,130 for work in September alone. And big law firms are charging millions of dollars monthly for their expertise.
Unlike Mr. Batson, Mr. Breeden and Mr. Thornburgh are not receiving big paychecks because of their experience restructuring companies. The two men are far better known for their government service, though Mr. Breeden, at least, has worked in the area for the last several years. They are so valuable because of their prestige and reputations for integrity -- qualities that corporations mired in scandal desperately need.
"They're looking for credibility," said Mark I. Bane, head of the bankruptcy practice at Kelley Drye & Warren in New York. "The higher prices are being paid by the companies that went into bankruptcy not because of business mistakes or because of the economy," he said, but because of crises that have damaged investors' confidence.
So a reputation for integrity and a lack of tolerance for corporate shenanigans have become most desirable and valuable traits, lawyers, accountants and other bankruptcy professionals say.
"For these high-profile individuals, it's a unique opportunity," said Peter J. Antoszyk, a partner at the law firm of Brown Rudnick Berlack Israels in Boston. "Management and boards of directors in these troubled companies have lost credibility. They're looking for strong, credible leadership, and people like Giuliani may provide that."
Mr. Breeden, the former S.E.C. chairman, has set himself up as an adviser on corporate governance for companies trying to reassure investors. He has teamed up with the financial unit of Edelman Worldwide, a large public relations firm.
How much Mr. Breeden has cost WorldCom is not public because he does not submit a bill through either the bankruptcy court or the federal court overseeing the securities commission's lawsuit against WorldCom. The fact that Mr. Breeden's bills are not disclosed does not sit well with many of the other lawyers, accountants and bankers involved in the WorldCom's proceedings. Not only are their bills public, but they must get the approval of the bankruptcy court and Mr. Breeden himself before they are paid.
As WorldCom's "corporate monitor," Mr. Breeden has been charged by a federal judge both with controlling the company's expenses and helping to represent the interests of investors and employees who suffered losses from the company's collapse. The amount of money he saves the company will dwarf whatever his services cost, Mr. Breeden said in a recent interview.
"What we've saved already would probably guarantee that's true," he said. For example, he said, he opposed a $40 million program to retain essential employees and replaced it with a $22 million program covering more people. He also blocked payments of more than $3 million to top executives who have since left, and he prevented a $7.5 million payment to charity when the company could not meet its severance obligations to dismissed employees.
Efforts to rein in fees charged by lawyers, accountants and investment bankers in the current megabankruptcies are, of course, unpopular with professionals used to getting their way. In the Enron case, a retired bankruptcy judge has been brought in to review fees and, when possible, to reduce them.
Mr. Breeden has been extremely busy in the last year, according to someone who works closely with him. Among his engagements, he has been named to the board of BBVA, a Spanish bank whose directors may receive more than $400,000 in annual compensation, according to an executive at the bank; the position will require him to go to Spain once a month.
Mr. Batson, who serves as an examiner in the Enron bankruptcy, has charged on average $100,000 a month for his services since May. Mr. Thornburgh, the former attorney general who serves as an examiner in the WorldCom bankruptcy, billed that company for $11,700 for the month of September, based on his $600 hourly rate. 
Mr. Giuliani, who has perhaps the most valuable name of all, is advising David Matlin, a major WorldCom bondholder. Neither he nor his client would disclose the terms. To get an idea of what Mr. Giuliani, the nation's best-known former mayor, may charge, though, consider that his new consulting firm will be paid some $4.3 million to establish law and order in Mexico City and that his public speaking engagements are reported to run to $100,000 each.
Bankruptcy lawyers, restructuring advisers and others who normally profit from corporate failures are, of course, doing well, too, with senior partners charging upward of $600 an hour. Lazard Freres is receiving $300,000 a month for its work in the WorldCom case, and it may get a $15 million success fee when the company emerges from bankruptcy. AlixPartners, a firm that advises troubled and bankrupt companies, is getting nearly $2 million a month for its work and may get a $7 million success fee, according to the transcript of a hearing in August.
"This is a point in time where we've seen the largest scandals in our recent history take place," said Bettina M. Whyte, a principal at AlixPartners. "It takes somebody who's got both experience and substantial credibility to take on the role of an examiner or a similar kind of role and lend their names to findings that may not be very popular."
Mr. Batson, for example, has released a report on some of Enron's previously undisclosed deals with secretive partnerships. 
Companies' need for advice on how to prevent scandal, or at least look as if they are credibly trying to avoid scandal, has not gone unnoticed. New ventures, like Corporate Diagnostics, have been formed by law firms and companies in the insurance business, offering to conduct an audit of companies' governance policies and practices, not their finances. Another new venture, the Open Compliance and Ethics Group, offers to devise governance practices for corporations. 
Public Strategies, a 14-year-old Austin, Tex., company that describes itself as a "strategic communications firm," has begun marketing a service that it says will help clients identify and manage "public risks." The firm's founder, Jack Martin, pointed to its work on the problems faced by Bridgestone/Firestone after its tires were widely blamed for accidents involving Ford Explorers.
"We're not looking at financial records and corporate governance," Mr. Martin said, "although it's something that, from a public risk perspective, might be something to pay attention to." There have not been many buyers for his company's new service, he said, adding, "It's hard to sell; it is hard to articulate."

HEADLINE: Bush, Over Supply-Side Protests, Picks Wall Street Banker as Economic Adviser 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush dismissed pleas from some advocates of supply-side economics today and named Stephen Friedman, a former Wall Street investment banker, as his top adviser on economic policy.
 Mr. Friedman, 64, is a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who once ran the investment banking firm alongside Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Rubin became President Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser and later his Treasury secretary. 
 Advance word of Mr. Friedman's selection alarmed many supply-siders, who argue that tax cuts are the key to economic growth and who argued that Mr. Friedman had in the past been far too preoccuppied with reducing budget deficits, a position that White House officials deride as "Rubinomics."
Today in a brief ceremony at the White House, Mr. Bush and Mr. Friedman took pains to emphasize that they agreed.
"I strongly support your conviction that now is the time for a robust growth and jobs policy," Mr. Friedman said, while Mr. Bush introduced him as an "innovative economic thinker" and a "proven manager."
White House officials, meanwhile, had already been trying to convince more ideological conservatives that Mr. Friedman was "one of us" and that he would champion Mr. Bush's plans to push a package of tax cuts worth as much as $300 billion.
Stephen Moore, president of a conservative lobbying group, the Club for Growth, has accused Mr. Friedman of being linked to "the Chicken Little deficit-reduction myopia."
Today, Mr. Moore said he had changed his view. 
"My new line is that we hope the White House is right in its reassurances that Stephen Friedman will support lower taxes," he said. "At this point, we are certainly willing to give him the benefit of the doubt."
The feuding over Mr. Friedman stemmed largely from being a board member and donor to the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that has long annoyed White House officials by warning relentlessly about the danger of federal deficits.
Mr. Friedman is also a trustee and a contributor to the Brookings Institution, a centrist research organization whose views often clash with those of the Bush administration. 
In choosing Mr. Friedman to head the National Economic Council, Mr. Bush has assembled the top layer of a new economic team dominated by mainstream Republicans rather than ideological believers.
The nominee to succeed Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, John W. Snow, is an executive who also campaigned in Washington on the need for balancing budgets.
Republican experts said the team would not change Mr. Bush's views so much as be changed by them. 
"The policy has already been developed," said Bruce Bartlett, a Republican advocate of deeper tax cuts. "They know the president is going to put out a $300 billion tax stimulus plan next year. If they thought they were going to have problems with that, they would have said so."
Mr. Bush heard little grumbling from his right wing when he announced Mr. Snow's selection. But there was more criticism when Mr. Friedman's name arose last week.
"How in the world can he sell a program that he has never shown any inclination of believing in?" Mr. Moore asked on Tuesday on the Web site of the National Review. "The Concord Coalition represents the Chicken Little deficit-reduction myopia that was once the rage in the Republican Party."
Mr. Bush showed little concern. Though the announcement about Mr. Friedman was made three days later than the one about Mr. Snow, White House officials said the reasons were tied to the extra time needed to check Mr. Friedman's finances, which include stakes in complex investment partnerships.
Mr. Friedman will succeed Lawrence B. Lindsey as director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Lindsey, who was forced to resign last week, was a firm believer in the need for additional tax cuts. But people close to the White House said he was not adept at coordinating the flow of policy advice, and he caused a furor when he predicted, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, that the cost of a war with Iraq might reach $200 billion.
Mr. Bush repeated today that he would propose a package of tax cuts, and the package is almost certain to include an acceleration of cuts that were supposed to phase in over the next few years, a reduction on taxation for corporate dividends and more generous depreciation write-offs for businesses.
Mr. Snow, the prospective Treasury secretary, is highly likely to be Mr. Bush's top salesman for the plan in Congress. Mr. Snow, though also a middle-of-the-road Republican, has also been an advocate of more fundamental tax changes and is well liked by tax cutters like Mr. Moore and former Representative Jack Kemp. To ease his approval in the Senate, Mr. Snow has agreed to give up $15 million he could have earned as chief executive of the CSX Corporation, the large rail company. He also agreed to sell his entire stake in CSX, about 1.7 million shares.
White House officials said they hoped that Mr. Friedman would improve the organization of policy advice that flows from budget officials, the Treasury Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Commerce Department. Perhaps more important, they hope that his stature as a top executive at one of Wall Street's most respected investment banks will make it easier to sell Mr. Bush's economic plan to financial institutions.
What makes his choice awkward is Mr. Friedman's relationship with Mr. Rubin as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs for two years. Mr. Rubin has been praised as one of the best Treasury secretaries in history, but his name has become almost an an epithet in the Bush administration, because he was such an adamant believer in reducing budget deficits. 
Mr. Friedman has, at least in the past, been similarly hawkish on budget issues.
Liberal Democrats in Congress have been quick to use Mr. Friedman's selection as a backhanded way to attack Mr. Bush's plans for tax cuts.
"It is hard to see how Mr. Friedman will be able to square his common-sense concerns for prudent fiscal policy with his party's commitment to new tax benefits for the well-to-do," said Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. 
But Gary Gensler, a former under secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Clinton who also worked for Mr. Friedman at Goldman Sachs, predicted that Mr. Friedman would have little trouble.
"At the end of the day, he knows who his client is, and the client is the president," Mr. Gensler said. "Steve always knew who the boss was."

Iraq Cancels Oil Contract With 3 Russian Companies

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Iraq abruptly canceled a contract with Russia's largest oil company and two other Russian companies to develop a major Iraqi oil field. 
 Iraq's decision -- announced in a letter to the company, Lukoil, on Monday -- amounted to a rebuff to Russia, one of Baghdad's strongest supporters at a time when the United States is threatening to go to war over what the Bush administration says is President Saddam Hussein's pursuit of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. 
 Russia, one of the five permanent members on the United Nations Security Council, has economic and political ties to Iraq dating to the Soviet era. It was not immediately clear why, at such a sensitive juncture, Iraq would choose to move against Russia's economic interests there. 
In recent months, President Vladimir V. Putin has joined the United States and others in pressing Mr. Hussein to cooperate with the renewed inspections of its weapons programs, even though Mr. Putin has repeatedly voiced opposition to any American military action against Iraq.
Lukoil signed a $3.8 billion contract to develop Iraq's West Qurna oil field in 1997 as part of a consortium of Russian companies that includes Zarubezhneft and Machinoimport. Under the contract, Lukoil controlled 68.5 percent of the stakes in the deal, with the rest divided between the two other companies.
The deal, however, has remained largely symbolic since significant work on the field -- with an estimated potential of producing half a million barrels of oil a day -- has been stymied by the United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
A Lukoil spokesman, Mikhail Z. Mikhailov, criticized the decision tonight, saying the three Russian companies had been caught off guard. He said it was delivered in a letter sent to the company's representatives in Iraq by a vice minister of the Iraqi oil agency. 
"We are really surprised, as the cancellation was signed by a vice oil minister when the Iraqi Parliament approved and ratified this deal," Mr. Mikhailov said. 
There was no immediate reaction by the Russian government today, a holiday on which government agencies were closed. Iraq's ambassador to Russia, Abbas Khalaf, who has been a strong promoter of economic ties between the two countries, declined to comment. 
Reuters reported that the Iraqi oil minister, Rashid Muhammad al-Ubaydi, attending an OPEC meeting in Vienna today, said simply that Iraq expected companies to fulfill their contractual obligations.
"Any company that does not fulfill their obligation over a long time, then we will be free to cancel their contract," Reuters quoted him as saying. "That is the policy."
Russia has direct financial interests in Iraq, including about $7.6 billion in debts that Iraq ran up with the Soviet Union that have not yet been paid. Russian companies, including Lukoil, have been among the largest recipients of contracts allowed by the United Nations' oil-for-food programs, which permits Iraq some trade for essential goods.
Russia's financial stake in Iraq has become part of the diplomatic maneuvering over the Bush administration's insistence on a tough stance against Mr. Hussein. Although American officials have repeatedly said they would not offer concrete assurances that Russian companies' contracts would be guaranteed if Mr. Hussein is overthrown, President Bush said last month that the United States understood Russia's interests.
"Of course, these interests will be taken into account," he said in an interview on Russian television last month before meeting Mr. Putin. 
Iraq has complained previously about Lukoil's deal, threatening in 2000 and again last year to cancel the contract. 
Raad Al Kadiri, an analyst with PFC Energy in Washington, said that Iraq had grown increasingly frustrated with Lukoil's apparent unwillingness to begin developing Al Qurna's potential riches.
"They were eager to get Lukoil to begin at least preliminary exploration," Mr. Kadiri said in a telephone interview from Vienna, where he was attending the OPEC meeting. "This decision won't be seen in isolation. It obviously has political motivations."
Russia, he noted, had joined the United States not only in demanding the renewed inspections in Iraq, but also in rewriting the provisions of the oil-for-food program and limiting the items Iraq was allowed to import. 
"I don't think Russia's foreign policy has helped Lukoil very much," he added.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Proposal Envisions Lower Manhattan as an Urban Hamlet 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday offered his vision of the future of Lower Manhattan: a collection of neighborhoods stitched together by large parks and broad pedestrian walkways, with a direct mass transit link to Kennedy Airport via a new tunnel under the East River.
 Under Mr. Bloomberg's plan, Lower Manhattan would essentially be transformed from an ailing financial center with pockets of residential developments into an urban hamlet of housing, schools, libraries and movie theaters, as well as other businesses, some of which would benefit from a generous new federal tax package. 
 The plan calls for changing numerous streets, turning West Street, for example, into "a promenade lined with 700 trees, a Champs-Elysees or Commonwealth Avenue for Lower Manhattan," Mr. Bloomberg said to a riveted audience of business leaders and politicians. Along the East River, a new waterfront park would stretch to the South Street Seaport. 
While many of the ideas have already been proposed by various governmental agencies involved in the rebuilding process, the mayor's plan pulled those elements together and added to them, creating one broad and hugely ambitious package with a $10.6 billion price tag.
"Moving forward," Mr. Bloomberg said, in a speech to the Association for a Better New York, "Lower Manhattan must become an even more vibrant global hub of culture, and commerce, a live-and-work-and-visit community for the world. It is our future. It is the world's second home."
Much of the $10.6 billion, however, is already coveted by other state agencies. Mr. Bloomberg said the plan would be paid for using $5.9 billion of the $21 billion that the federal government promised to New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as well as 9/11-related insurance money and the proceeds from the sale of development rights and from Liberty Bonds authorized for new housing downtown.
He said no additional money would be required to pay for the projects until at least 2009, and even then, if extra dollars were needed, only federal and state money would be required, not any new city taxes.
Mr. Bloomberg reserved only 20 seconds of his 31-minute speech to describe his ideas for the trade center site, saying simply that "the restored streets would be a memorial that would put a physical shape to our grief and to our hopes for the future, and give us somewhere we can come together to share our thoughts and reflections of how Sept. 11th affected our lives."
The mayor's plan is in many ways a direct challenge to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which have led the rebuilding efforts at ground zero.
For example, Mr. Bloomberg began his remarks deriding the original World Trade Center, saying, "The twin towers' voracious appetite for tenants weakened the entire downtown real estate market," a clear poke at the plans released this fall by the development corporation, which called for substantial commercial development at the site.
Mr. Bloomberg also called for the remaining $1.3 billion from the development corporation's coffers, which the corporation -- as well as the Empire State Development Corporation -- has eyed for other uses. The mayor said nothing about burying West Street, which many transportation experts have called for as part of revitalizing downtown; Mr. Bloomberg's transportation proposal focuses principally on his dream to link Lower Manhattan to New York's airports.
Louis R. Tomson, the president of the development corporation and a close ally of Gov. George E. Pataki, said yesterday that the success of Mr. Bloomberg's plan would rely in part on getting the approval of agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which regulate much of the 9/11-related money sought by Mr. Bloomberg.
"The challenge will be how to reach agreement on husbanding the resources and applying them," Mr. Tomson said, "and how to do that in a way that meets the requirements of those who have the responsibilities to oversee these funds." Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg is most likely to ultimately find himself in a position of negotiating his vision with other state agencies. 
Several people said yesterday that they were concerned about the mayor's proposed use of $4 billion in federal transportation funds to link Kennedy and Newark airports to Lower Manhattan on a so-called one-seat ride.
The federal government will soon allocate billions of dollars in transportation money, and there is sure to be a battle over dollars for various projects in New York, like the Second Avenue subway line and the No. 7 train extension. 
"Is it worth $4 billion to have a one-seat ride to Lower Manhattan?" said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat. "We are going to have to make choices, and the important thing is to get the projects that get the most economic benefit for New York. I am not prepared to support this project until we do a detailed analysis."
Mayor Bloomberg's plan calls for an entire physical reshaping of Manhattan south of Chambers Street. He proposed building a new park to sit on the deck over the mouth of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and reshaping Battery Park. He also wants a new waterfront park stretching from the Brooklyn Maritime Building to the South Street Seaport.
The mayor has called for 10,000 new apartments over 10 years and services for their residents, including libraries and schools. The plan also seeks an investment in other transportation projects, like new ferry service and a transit hub at Fulton and Broadway. 
Mr. Bloomberg believes the city could encourage foreign businesses to relocate to Lower Manhattan by creating federal legislation -- supported by Sen. Charles E. Schumer -- that would eliminate incremental federal income tax costs for a 20-year period for companies relocating to the United States. It would also allow those businesses to retain any income tax treaty benefits they were entitled to before relocating here. 
The mayor's aides took pains to point out that his speech attracted more attendees than one given by President Bush to the same group several weeks ago.
"The expectations were high and I think the mayor delivered," said Richard Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress. "We have not seen this kind of planning and thinking out of City Hall in a long time."

Iraqi Declaration Lacking, And Questions Remain
American intelligence agencies have reached a preliminary conclusion that Iraq's 12,000-page declaration of its weapons programs fails to account for chemical and biological agents missing when inspectors left Iraq four years ago, American officials and United Nations diplomats said. They also said a host of questions remained unanswered regarding Iraq's nuclear program. A1

The general named by Iraq to work with U.N. weapons inspectors praised their "professionalism" in the first two weeks of surprise searches across Iraq. A24

Iraqi Opposition Builds Iran Ties

Japanese Economic Survey Sees a Recession in '03

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Japanese executives are less pessimistic about their businesses than they were three months ago. But they are cutting their sales, profit and investment forecasts as they brace for trouble ahead.
 Those are the latest readings from the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey, released today. They suggest that while companies are encouraged by rises in production and exports this year, they expect Japan to slip back into recession in 2003. And many are uncertain about where the United States economy, source of the bulk of profits for many Japanese automotive and electronics manufacturers, is heading. 
 Managers also said in the survey that they were having a harder time raising money, a result of the government's drive to clean up the country's shaky banks. As lenders write off nonperforming loans faster, many have been shoring up their balance sheets by conserving cash, making fewer new loans and calling in more old ones. 
The survey of about 8,400 companies subtracts the number of pessimistic responses from the number of optimistic ones; a negative figure means pessimists are in the majority. Among large manufacturers, the reading rose to minus 9 in the latest survey from minus 14 three months ago. But looking forward, the surveyed companies expect conditions to deteriorate.
"Businesses are getting worried about a double-dip recession," said Kazuhiko Ogata, an economist at HSBC Securities. "Export growth has peaked, and the domestic economy is getting worse. It's hard to see where the recovery will come from."
To counteract the negative effects of the banking measures on the economy, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet agreed on Thursday to a package of 4.4 trillion yen ($35.9 billion) in new spending, mainly on programs to help small companies and create new jobs. 
With a looming budget deficit and few other policy options, the government has stepped up its calls for more monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. But the bank has resisted calls for drastic measures, preferring a gradual approach to attacking the persistent deflation that is eroding corporate profits. The central bank's policy board meets on Monday and Tuesday.
Investors reacted to the dimmer economic outlook, a rise in the yen's value and the stimulus package, which many analysts called too limited to make much difference, by bidding stocks down. The Nikkei 225 index fell 2.2 percent today, its eighth consecutive daily decline.
In the Tankan survey, large manufacturers said they still expected sales to rise 0.8 percent in the year ending March 2003, and profits to surge 31.8 percent. But smaller companies and service providers have lowered their earnings expectations, the survey found, and even the big companies are cutting back more sharply on capital investment.
Some are going further, and closing plants. Japan's second-largest oil refiner, Idemitsu Kosan, said this week that it would shut down nearly one-quarter of its capacity in Japan to cut costs. Its larger rival, Nippon Oil, has already closed six refineries. Idemitsu is also trying to cut its 1.4 trillion yen ($11.4 billion) in debt.
For their part, the country's banks, under pressure to deal with mountains of bad loans, are leaning on clients to pay loans off or refinance at higher rates. But they are having difficulty raising lending rates generally, so they are tightening their lending standards instead, the central bank survey found. 
"Companies have been spoiled," said Naoko Nemoto, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo. "They've been allowed for too long to make many unprofitable investments."

HEADLINE: Regents Urge More Spending On Poorer School Districts 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Despite the misgivings of Gov. George E. Pataki, the State Board of Regents yesterday urged legislators to increase state education spending by $516 million and direct the extra money to school districts with high concentrations of poverty.
 While acknowledging the state's economic woes and the political difficulties inherent in raising education spending when other programs face steep cutbacks, the Regents said forgoing any increases in the next fiscal year could throw troubled districts off the path to meeting New York's rising educational standards. 
 "Even though these are difficult fiscal times, we need to keep working toward our goal of providing more help to the neediest schools," said Robert M. Bennett, the board's chancellor. 
Under the proposal, which is to go before the Legislature early next year, 76 percent of the increase would go toward what the Regents called "high need" districts, particularly those in small and large cities with high numbers of poor students. Unlike last year's plan, however, the new plan does not rest on cutting state aid to some wealthier districts but allows for nominal increases in those areas as well.
The Regents also simplified the budgetary process somewhat, proposing that districts be given larger blocks of money to spend at their discretion, rather than parceling out the funds under smaller, more restrictive programs. The move parallels the kind of overhauls both Governor Pataki and individual school districts have long called for, though it did not appear to make the increase any more palatable to those who will decide its fate.
"That would be completely out of touch with the fiscal realities facing governments throughout the country," Governor Pataki said yesterday, "and I would hope that they would show some sense of understanding the real world."
The state faces a budget gap of up to $2 billion this fiscal year and as much as $10 billion for the year that begins in April. To cover the shortfall, Governor Pataki this week proposed selling bonds backed by New York State's share of the 1998 tobacco settlement with 46 states, a short-term fix that could raise as much as $4 billion. But even if the Legislature approves the plan, it is doubtful that the money will be enough to avert the need to raise taxes, cut spending or both.
"We are going to be looking across the area to see what we can achieve in savings and no question, as with other governments, we are going to be cutting in many, many areas," Governor Pataki said.
Facing a $1.1 billion deficit of its own this fiscal year -- and $5 billion in the next -- New York City has already begun lopping $200 million off its $12 billion school budget. Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein laid off about 70 administrators last month, the first of 550 such employees to go.
Despite the economic climate, the Regents said the spending increase, which amounted to 3.5 percent more than the $14.5 billion New York gave its schools this year, was both "reasonable and sustainable" over the long haul, particularly in light of the state's rising educational requirements.
Even if the state cuts its education budget, students will still be expected to pass more standardized exams to graduate. Without an increase in spending, the Regents said, their chances would almost certainly be lessened, especially in districts with high concentrations of poverty.
"Everyone knows that a wide gap in resources still exists in our state," Mr. Bennett said. In New York City, for example, schools spent an average of $10,469 per student in 2000, the last year for which data is available. But in the wealthy suburbs surrounding the city, schools spent an average of $13,760 per child, a gap that the Regents said they would like to close.
As evidence that higher spending can improve performance, the Regents pointed to recent gains in math and reading scores during a time when the state's education budget rose as well.

HEADLINE: Discounters Stalking High-Tech Territory 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
In a television ad that began showing this year, two guys -- fairly cool-looking guys -- discuss their need for "a good TV" so they can watch their DVD's. "We're DVD freaks!" one says. The ad is fast paced, it drops names like Panasonic and Sony, and the advertiser is Wal-Mart. 
 So much for going to a specialty store for that plasma TV, MP3 player or personal digital assistant. Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart are closing in on what was once a specialized segment of retail, stocking their stores with the latest in consumer electronics instead of only the most time-worn products that come with plugs. 
 "The more these products become a part of your everyday life, the more Wal-Mart will sell them," said Marie Driscoll, a retail analyst for Argus Research. "How many people owned a P.D.A. two years ago? And now they're selling at Target. It's really incredible." 
Three years ago, the notion of visiting a discounter to buy an advanced television set was a contradiction in terms. Discounters did not have such products, and the manufacturers rarely considered them to be a respectable outlet. But the difference between the specialty stores and the discounters is narrowing, experts say, especially this year, with no clear must-have products and with the wavering economy holding spending in check. 
"When the whole consumer electronics industry was growing, Wal-Mart didn't really hurt anybody's business," said Scot Ciccarelli, a retail analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "But you get a lull in the product cycle, and you notice it." 
Like many analysts, he is wary of investing in the specialty chains that once ruled the consumer electronics business. Now that you can buy a personal digital assistant just about anywhere, the formerly plentiful profits on such gadgets have shrunk. Mr. Ciccarelli rates Best Buy neutral and expects Circuit City to underperform other stocks. The share price of both companies has fallen by about half since the beginning of the year.
It is a long way from just last year, when he and others thought that those two companies -- benefiting from a consumer demand for home theaters and other comforts instead of travel abroad -- could do no wrong. 
Wal-Mart's interest in the electronics sector began to intensify about four years ago, when the giant retailer realized the potential of sticking mass prices on high-tech items. It has made runs at other specialty retail sectors, like toys, in the past, though consumer electronics are considered more lucrative.
"What Wal-Mart does is to look at each category it sells and try to figure out how to gain as much market share as possible," said Shari Schwartzman Eberts, a retail analyst for J. P. Morgan Securities. "They will tell you that the square footage allocated to electronics has not changed. What has changed is the kind of products they carry in it."
At Target, the number of electronics products for sale has risen about 20 percent since 1998, a spokesman said. Kmart, struggling to emerge from bankruptcy, sells TV's, digital cameras, DVD players, and video game consoles, among other things, along with all the software to go with them. 
"There has been an increase in competition coming from the discounters," said Ann Collier, a vice president who handles investor relations for Circuit City, the specialty electronics retailer that is based in Richmond, Va. Chains like Costco are also featuring electronics more than they once did, she added, and "we know we have to be price competitive with any of the major players in our segment."
But Wal-Mart, with its heft that promises enormous volume to manufacturers, is casting the biggest shadow across the sector.
"Big-screen televisions were very small last year at Wal-Mart," Mr. Ciccarelli said. "This year, they're in 1,500 stores." How about flat-screen TV's, which were emerging on consumers' Christmas lists at this time last year? Ms. Eberts estimates that this year, 60 percent of all the televisions stocked at Wal-Mart are flat screens. And about 150 stores are selling plasma TV's, which offer high clarity, at just under $3,000, according to Ms. Driscoll. 
Wal-Mart's strategy has been to identify products with mass appeal and then bring them into its stores. Televisions are an obvious choice. Personal computers are close behind; Wal-Mart this week announced plans to sell a deeply discounted Hewlett-Packard computer and printer.
There are also personal digital assistants, DVD-VCR combos and digital cameras on the shelves. For reasons ranging from briefer product cycles to the increasing sophistication of middle-class consumers, the speed of the transfer from state-of-the-art to state-of-the-Wal-Mart has picked up recently. 
"It certainly seems to be a shorter time period than what it used to be," said Gary Severson, who is senior vice president for electronics at Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark. "Mass seems to be gaining appeal for a lot of categories, and electronics is one of those where the customer realizes they don't have to pay a lot of money for everything." 
These days, instead of offering only basic items, whether a home theater or a digital camera, Wal-Mart is much more in front of the curve, he added, with products and well-known brand names. And it has added to its advertising to make that clear to shoppers. 
"Years ago, mass probably represented more of the older technology at a good price," Mr. Severson said. "What we have worked harder and harder to do is to make sure we are providing good value and that we are topical in what our consumer wants. The curve has moved up to where we can be more on fashion, on trend, and at a good price." 
Mr. Severson, who oversees other departments at Wal-Mart as well, says the chain's relationships with electronics manufacturers have improved. 
"They've taught us a lot of things and we've educated them about what we can do," he said. He envisions a day, not too far off, when manufacturers will want to introduce their latest models at Wal-Mart. 
Target, based in Minneapolis, has gone for exclusivity in the mass market. Earlier this year, the chain began selling Sony boomboxes, clock radios and other items in a special color -- a bright yellow-green -- available only at Target.
The chief distinction between the discounters and the specialty chains, at the moment, seems to be the training of the salespeople and the sophistication of the products. Training has traditionally been more elaborate at the specialty chains, where some workers are paid on commission, and the most advanced products are usually seen first at a Best Buy or a Circuit City. But this year there is no "hot" item to attract the kind of shoppers who pride themselves on being first with every gadget. 
"It's a C-minus kind of new-product environment," said Gary Giblin, an analyst for C. L. King Associates. So the competition lately is mostly over price, and as a result many retail analysts have slashed their expectations for Circuit City and Best Buy, worrying that profits are at stake. 
But they should not worry too much, says Lisa Hawks, a spokeswoman for Best Buy, which is based outside Minneapolis. Salespeople are more knowledgeable at the specialty chains, she said, and product selection is more sophisticated. And with prices falling, the retailer is latching onto services like installation to draw shoppers away from discounters.
"We don't comment specifically on our competitors," Ms. Hawks said. "But where I think we do well is where there are customers looking for a total solution." Sales of digital products have been increasing as a proportion of all sales, she added. 
Mr. Severson said Wal-Mart was trying to provide more training to the sales staff in its electronics department. That can mean providing a computer that links to the company's Web site, he added. 
Other retailers are also in the service business, Mr. Ciccarelli said. Tweeter, another publicly traded consumer electronics chain, is wiring new homes as they are being built, readying them for home theaters once the homes are occupied, he said, adding, "If it catches on, I wouldn't be surprised to see Circuit City and Best Buy get into it." Still, it is more expensive than simply training the employees and organizing the displays in the showroom, which specialty retailers do well already and Wal-Mart has started to copy. 
The specialty retailers, meanwhile, are all aiming for sales to hold steady at last year's levels. "They are offering extended payment plans that take you out into 2004," Ms. Driscoll said, "and that's one of the ways they generate business. Wal-Mart doesn't do that."

HEADLINE: Price Index For Producers Is Off 0.4%; Optimism Up 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers unexpectedly fell 0.4 percent in November, the most in six months, the Labor Department said today.
 Consumer confidence rose in December to the highest level in four months, a University of Michigan survey showed, signaling that Americans have enough faith in the economy to keep spending. 
 The decline in the Producer Price Index came after a 1.1 percent rise in October. Not including food and energy, prices declined 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Producer prices were 0.9 percent higher in November compared with a year earlier, while costs of raw materials increased 14.7 percent. 
In the first 11 months of this year, the core Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate through November, compared with a 0.8 percent pace of increase in the period last year.
Energy prices fell 1.8 percent last month after rising 4.2 percent in October. Gasoline prices fell 9 percent and heating oil costs declined 11.1 percent, the biggest decrease since December of last year.
A third report, from the Commerce Department, showed that inventories at factories, wholesalers and stores rose 0.2 percent in October, the sixth consecutive monthly gain as retailers began restocking their shelves ahead of the holiday season. The rise came after a 0.6 percent increase in September. Sales at businesses rose 0.4 percent in October after falling 0.7 percent the previous month.
The University of Michigan survey's preliminary sentiment index rose to 87 from 84.2 in November, after reaching a nine-year low in October, with consumers heartened in part by discounts at the start of the holiday shopping season.
"It's very encouraging to see consumers in a more upbeat mood," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now a senior economic adviser with Schwab Capital Markets. "If you take that in context of the strong retail sales numbers for November, it indicates that the Christmas season is going to be better for retailers than anyone had expected."
The preliminary consumer sentiment index is derived from a telephone survey of 500 households. Economists had expected a reading of 85 based on the median of 46 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
The index of current conditions, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to spend money on big-ticket items, rose to 95.9 from 93.1 in November. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, increased to 81.2 from 78.5.
"It's important that both the current conditions and expectations are up," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "It's more evidence that we are seeing signs of stabilization after the downdraft that we had in late summer and early fall."

HEADLINE: On eBay, No One Can Hear You Scream (Over High Price of Hot Toys) 

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
Td49244, known to some of his hundreds of satisfied customers as Santa Tony, has three dozen jovial Chicken Dance Elmos staring him down in his Staten Island basement, but he is hardly unnerved.
 He takes the long view and will not sell short, at least through Dec. 25. Toys-as-commodities are a big game for him, as he watches the fickle fluctuations of the market for fun. 
 "Two weeks ago, FurReals were $70 each, and now they're $40 or $45," said Td49244, a Staten Island utility worker who buys popular toys at regular prices in stores and then sells them to the highest bidder on eBay, the Internet auction site where hard-to-find items are not so hard to find. "The people that want it are going to get it as early as possible." 
Who knew that buying something as soft and purring as a FurReal Friend, a robotic cat, could require the hard-core economic calculus used in the world of pork belly futures?
Td49244 (who spoke on the condition that he be identified by his eBay screen name or as Tony D., instead of by his full name, so store managers will not recognize him) is one of those e-elves who give desperate shoppers a chance to buy the toys that are ranked first on many children's wish lists, but are not on store shelves. He is Santa's newest reindeer, perhaps. Call him Scalper. Or Super Seller, as he was called by someone who recently bought a FurReal Friend and a Chicken Dance Elmo from him for $71 plus $15 shipping and handling. (In stores, the two would cost a total of $55..)
Those who handicap hot toys each holiday season are intrigued by the snapshot of the market provided on eBay, where seller and buyer come together.
"I think it's a real testament to the power of the free market economy," said Chris Byrne (he spells it "B as in boy, Y as in yippee"), an independent toy consultant, researcher and analyst. "I use eBay as kind of the Nasdaq for toys, to really see what people are believing is going to be hot."
"There are thousands of little Toys 'R' Us impresarios out there," he said. "And you know what? They're as likely to guess as Toys 'R' Us."
When stores guess wrong and fall short on a popular item, the consumer either pays the price, or, more likely, never gets the chance to. Consider all those people out there wanting to buy ZipZaps, the little remote-controlled cars from Radio Shack.
Jim Lasko, the manager of the Radio Shack store on West 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, was out of them yesterday.
"It's the phenomenon," he said. "A lot of people go from store to store to store," but there are none available in the city. "They're gone like within an hour of getting in." He said he has a long waiting list and will not sell more than two per customer, following a new company policy. Any ZipZaps ordered after the last week in November would not arrive before Christmas, he added.
But as of yesterday evening, there were 3,749 ZipZap auctions on eBay. One seller recently offered a giant gift pack of ZipZap cars and accessories, a total of 12 items, with this humble proviso at the end: "THIS IS EVERYTHING YOUR KID COULD ASK FOR! EVERYTHING in this lot is BRAND NEW NEVER OPENED! YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE! Here's what you 'don't' get: 1) Sales tax 2) Multiple shipping charges, if ordering direct online (even IF they are available) 3) Wasted time (and gas, etc.) calling and/or driving around to get missing items 4) In-store salesperson attitude 5) Batteries (sorry)."
Td49244 said eBay is supplying a demand: "I have kids. I know how hard it can be to find certain toys at Christmas or whatever. I know how much the kids look forward to it. If I can help somebody out, I'm going to do my very best to try and get it to them as quickly as possible, as promised."
Mr. Byrne agreed.
"They can go to one place rather than running around all over wherever they live," he said. "Nobody's forcing you to pay."
But there are some who think the Staten Island Santa, and others like him, are stealing Christmas, in a way.
And parents who really think they need a particular item for their child can end up paying too much on eBay. Beleaguered parents staring the holidays in the face will do most anything to get something their child wants, and sellers know it.
"The people who lose out are sometimes the kid collectors," Mr. Byrne said. "The kids who are really into action figures, they feel some of the eBay sellers strip the shelves of cool action figures when they come out. I interview kids in certain pockets, like in Los Angeles. They feel like they're competing with adults collecting things. They want a chance at the toys as well. But that's the free market. We want our free market economy."
Then again, Camille Wattley would be willing to pay more online for the LeapPad she was buying for her niece, just to avoid shopping at a real toy store.
"I actually bought it on the Internet, but it didn't come," she said. "The order was canceled." She found the item at Toys "R" Us in downtown Brooklyn for $39.99, but would have been willing to spend up to $10 more on eBay. "It's the price you have to pay," she said. "Everybody is trying to save time, and it's hard, on the bus. With big packages, it's tough."
On Tuesday, a potential customer for Td49244 approached the same Toys "R" Us. For the fifth time. The man, Alonzo Wooden, found the last Chicken Dance Elmo on the shelves, and he wanted it for his son, Sayquan, even though nothing happened when you pressed his feet (Elmo's, not Sayquan's.) The diagnosis? Low batteries. The verdict: Buy it anyway. Counting cab fare and subway fare for his trips to the store, Mr. Wooden may have done better on the Internet.
Time will tell how this holiday season will stack up compared with previous years. Td49244 speaks wistfully of 1998.
"The Furby Christmas, that was an excellent Christmas," he said, recalling how he cleared about $4,000, making a profit of about $50 on each of the 80 bug-eyed, armless, $29.99 creatures he sold. In 2001, he ordered a few too many Xboxes, a video-game system, but still made a profit of $2,200 to $2,400, he said.
Mr. Byrne pointed out that Td49244 and all those tiny toy stores behind their eBay screen names may not always pick the hottest toys.
"I'm willing to bet there are people who are going to get stuck with things," he said. "They are going to guess wrong. Guess what? That's what every retail establishment does. It's just a microcosm of the entire retail organization."
Not so fast. Santa Tony knows that if his 36 Elmos do not sell, he can always return them. And he said a Web site he reads about popular toys predicted that the Elmos would run out the first or second week in December.
"If that holds true, maybe the 36 I have sitting in my basement might turn out to be worthwhile," he said. "At this point I might be going back to Sears. I don't care, I'm not taking the chance. It's not like the stock market where you can lose money."

HEADLINE: Job Listings Decline 20% At Colleges 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Listings for academic jobs in literature and languages -- a key barometer of staff positions in colleges and universities -- are off 20 percent, the Modern Language Association of America said. It is the first decline since 1995 and the largest decline in about a decade. 
 "Deans and provosts are under tremendous pressure now because of a decline in financial support," said Stephen Greenblatt, a Harvard professor and president of the association, which has 32,000 members. 
 "If you have to cut, it is easier to do it in English or French than in chemistry or computer science," Professor Greenblatt added. "Part of that is structural -- there are no laboratories that you have already paid for. The other part is that the job market in English and certain foreign languages has been depressed for the better part of a decade, so it is easy to find qualified part-time workers, who you can pay less, and give less time for research."
The language association said the number of English positions fell to 792 this year, from 983 in 2001, a 19 percent decline. The number of foreign language positions fell to 535 from 675, a 21 percent drop. 
The decline in tenure track jobs -- roughly half of the total jobs -- was slightly lower than for part-time jobs. Tenure-track job openings in English fell 17 percent to 401, while those in foreign language departments fell 16 percent to 279.
But university officials say the situation may be worse than the job listings suggest.
Cary Nelson, an English professor at the University of Illinois, said he had already heard of some listed jobs being canceled after they were posted.
His own department, Professor Nelson said, is scheduled to interview candidates for four tenure track jobs at the language association's annual meeting later this month in New York, but it is concerned about whether it will actually be able to make the hires because the university may face another budget cutback in January.
"It is entirely possible that we could come back home and discover that it was all for nothing," Professor Nelson said.
In an otherwise bleak landscape, some specialized fields are showing greater stability. The Middle East Studies Association of North America, for example, which covers areas like Middle East history, Islamic studies and Arabic and other languages, has seen advertisements for job listings rise. 
Last month it had 55, up from 29 in November 2001 and 34 in November 2000. But the vast majority of the positions are for adjuncts, lecturers and other part-time instructors, said Amy W. Newhall, the association's executive director. 
The Association of Asian Studies also reports an increase in job advertisements, especially for Chinese and Japanese studies. In October, the association had 399 job advertisements, up from 370 last year. 
The American Historical Association, however, has had a decline, although not as great as at the Modern Language Association. As of this week, the historical association had received 745 job advertisements, down from 790 last year, a 6 percent decline. But a preliminary review found the number of advertisements for tenure track positions was down 13 percent, to 495 from 566 last year. And universities seemed even less willing to fill slots with senior scholars; the number of listings for tenured jobs fell to 16 from 54.
Robert B. Townsend, assistant director for research and publications at the historical association, said that despite the job declines, there were still shortages of candidates in specialized fields like Chinese and African-American history.

HEADLINE: Bring In a Mediator 

 BODY:
With New York City facing the possibility of a disruptive transit strike on Monday, there was little sign of negotiating progress yesterday. Given the wide gap between the union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the short time left to reach agreement, the two sides should bring in an experienced mediator to help them bridge the gap.
 A sustained strike by the 34,000 members of the Transport Workers Union Local 100 against the largest local transit system in the world would be disastrous. Like those caught in the 1981 strike that prompted President Ronald Reagan to dismiss 11,500 air traffic controllers, transit workers may find the price of a walkout much higher than they imagined. With the threat of millions of dollars in fines for striking, the union might not survive and striking members would be hit hard economically. The city could lose as much as $350 million a day, when it is already in the worst fiscal crisis in its history. 
 Roger Toussaint, the union leader, says he does not want a strike but nonetheless has been keeping the possibility on the table, despite the injunction issued last night by a state Supreme Court justice. With the union seeking an 18 percent pay hike over three years and the M.T.A. holding onto its demand for a pay freeze at least for one year, the impasse may be too difficult to break without help.
A strike must not be allowed to become a foregone conclusion. Anxious New Yorkers are being left to anticipate the worst and prepare for it as best they can, if they can. Some people -- the poor, children, the elderly and the infirm -- will suffer in immeasurable ways. The city deserves better. It's time for both sides to acknowledge the ramifications if they fail. They should step back and allow a mediator into the picture now.

Trustee Appoints Members Of United Creditors' Group
A federal trustee has appointed 13 members to the creditors' committee in the United Airlines bankruptcy case, including a representative from each of the airline's three main unions.
 Some industry experts said that the strong presence of the unions could lead to tension as United tries to restructure because they might look out for work force-related interests first rather than the interests of the creditors. Union officials, though, said they were committed to helping the airline emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Page C2. 

Brokerage Firms Seek All Accounts
Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab are preparing to introduce accounts that they hope will replace their customers' accounts at commercial banks. The firms' plans for everyday checking accounts are part of a general trend toward positioning themselves as advisers on their customers' whole financial lives. A1.

Bombardier Names a New Chief
Paul M. Tellier, left, 63, chief executive of the Canadian National Railway, was named chief executive of Bombardier, succeeding Robert E. Brown, who resigned. Bombardier, which makes commercial and corporate aircraft, motorboats and passenger trains, cited its sagging share price and a need to improve its corporate governance practices as reasons. Mr. Tellier guided Canadian National through a transformation from a government-owned corporation into one of North America's most efficient and profitable railroads. C3.

Coke Will Stop Making Predictions
Coca-Cola said that it would stop making earnings forecasts after this quarter, following the lead of one of its largest shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway, controlled by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett. Focusing on profit goals is a distraction from longer-term objectives that enhance growth, the company said. C2.

Japanese Executives Cut Forecasts
Japanese executives are less pessimistic about their businesses than they were three months ago. But they are cutting their sales, profit and investment forecasts as they brace for trouble ahead, the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey reported. C3.

Columbia Rescinds Bancroft Prize
Columbia University announced that its trustees had voted to rescind the Bancroft Prize awarded last year to a book by Michael A. Bellesiles, an Emory University historian, citing accusations of scholarly misconduct. The prize was awarded for "Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture," published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2000. C4.

Producer Prices Decrease 0.4%
Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers unexpectedly fell 0.4 percent in November, the most in six months, the Labor Department said. Separately, consumer confidence rose in December to the highest level in four months, a University of Michigan survey showed. The Commerce Department reported that inventories at factories, wholesalers and stores rose 0.2 percent in October, the sixth consecutive monthly gain as retailers began restocking their shelves ahead of the holiday season. C2.

Burger King Sold for $1.5 Billion
The British liquor company Diageo has agreed to sell Burger King for a reduced price of $1.5 billion to an investment consortium. The deal was for about a third less than the $2.26 billion the consortium agreed to pay in July for the Miami-based burger chain, the nation's second largest after McDonald's. C4.

SK Securities Warned by Regulators
South Korean regulators have warned SK Securities that it violated securities laws by trading derivatives with J. P. Morgan Chase without the approval of the governor of the Bank of Korea. C3.

HEADLINE: Creditors' Panel at United To Have 3 Union Members 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
A federal trustee today appointed 13 members to the creditors' committee in the United Airlines bankruptcy case including one representative from each of United's three main unions.
 Some industry experts said that the strong presence of the unions on the panel could lead to tension as United tries to restructure because they might pursue worker-related interests first rather than the interests of the creditors. Union officials, though, said they were committed to helping the airline emerge from bankruptcy. 
 United also continued negotiations today for concessions from its unions. People briefed on the discussions said that United presented numbers for cutting labor costs that were larger than some unions had expected, angering leaders. United and union representatives declined to comment on the talks. 
The creditors' committee was formed this afternoon by the trustee, Ira Bodenstein, who met with many of the largest unsecured creditors in a ballroom at the Sheraton Hotel here. The committee includes Airbus, which is owed $47.6 million by United for aircraft parts and services, and Bank of New York, which is a trustee for bondholders with $1.84 billion owed to them. Mr. Bodenstein named Airbus the interim chairman of the committee.
Airbus is United's largest trade creditor, and it also serves as chairman of the creditors' committee in the US Airways bankruptcy case. In that case, the pilots' union and the machinists' union also have representation on the committee.
The creditors' committee at United will have the power to oversee broad business decisions that United makes as it operates under bankruptcy protection. Much of the power of the board of UAL, the parent company of United, will be diluted by the presence of the committee.
Some creditors hoping to be on the committee were disappointed. The City of Indianapolis, for example, wanted representation on the committee because United owes it money for a maintenance center contract at its airport. In fact, United owes various government authorities in Indiana a total of $162 million -- one of the largest unsecured debt amounts -- because of that contract.
"We're disappointed that A, we're not on the committee, and B, that no municipality or government is on the committee," Scott Chinn, corporation counsel for Indianapolis, said as he raced to catch a flight home.
But Mr. Chinn said he hoped that Indianapolis would be selected as an ex-officio member of the committee, meaning it could advise on matters but have no voting rights.
The other creditors on the committee are the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Lufthansa Airlines, Pratt & Whitney, HSBC Bank, U.S. Bank N.A., R Squared Investments, the Goodrich Corporation and Galileo International.
Those are not the largest unsecured creditors. But the federal trustee generally tries to select a wide range of creditors to represent the interests of small as well as large debt holders. When asked about the selection process, Mr. Bodenstein simply said: "It was a difficult decision." He declined to give further details.
Some industry experts said that having union representatives on the creditors' committee could make it difficult for United to restructure properly. The airline has had difficulties working with two union representatives on its board, they said. United is 55 percent employee owned, and the pilots' and the machinists' unions each have a seat on the board.
"I don't look for them to provide constructive input," said Morten Beyer, chief executive of Morten Beyer & Agnew, an airline consulting company based in Arlington, Va. Mr. Beyer said that union representatives on creditors' committees in some past airline bankruptcy cases had done "as much to maintain the status quo as anybody could have done."
But the unions said they deserved to be on the committee and would work to ensure the survival of United.
"I think the employees are the ones who put together a plan to restructure this airline," said Sara Dela Cruz, a spokeswoman for the flight attendants' union. "We've been committed to this from the beginning. I don't see there being a conflict of interest there at all."
Jake Brace, United's chief financial officer, said: "We work very collaboratively with the unions outside of the bankruptcy committee. We look forward to working with them as part of the committee as well."
Mr. Brace also said that United had sent out proposals to 2,500 parties to renegotiate the terms of aircraft leases. He said he had received some positive responses.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dollar Loses More Ground To the Euro

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro in almost three years yesterday as investors worried about the strength of the American recovery, the country's huge current account deficit and the possibility of a war with Iraq.
 The decline in the dollar came as stocks fell, ending lower for the second consecutive week, despite a rise in consumer confidence. In addition, the price of oil rose to an eight-week high as the strike in Venezuela against the government of Hugo Chavez continued to disrupt oil shipments from that country, one of the main suppliers to the United States. The price of gold climbed to its highest in five and a half years. 
 While all these financial market moves are not directly related, they are indications of investor concerns. Gold can be a haven in times of unrest and the increase in oil prices, if it continues, could slow global growth, which is bad for stocks.
Analysts are not predicting a big decline for the dollar, in part because America's chief commercial rivals -- the 12 countries using the euro and Japan -- are weaker economically than the United States.
"The dollar decline has been gradual and will continue to be gradual because the alternatives are not that attractive," said Ann Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup, said the current decline in the dollar was partly caused by seasonal factors and some one-time demands for euros in connection with mergers. When the seasonal factors reverse in January, the dollar can rally, he said.
The euro settled at $1.0226 yesterday, up from $1.0185 on Thursday. That rate represents the lowest dollar value against the euro since Jan. 13, 2000. Against the yen, the dollar dropped to 120.47 yen from 122.73 yen Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average, led lower by United Technologies and 3M, fell 104.69 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 8,433.71, and was down 2.5 percent for the week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 12.10 points, or 1.3 percent, to 889.48, and was off 2.5 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 37.13 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,362.42, and was down 4.2 percent for the week. Microsoft and Cisco Systems helped pull both the Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500-stock index lower.
The worry about a war with Iraq and the weakness of the dollar helped send the price of gold for February delivery on the Commodity Exchange to $333.80 an ounce, up from $332.10 Thursday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of oil for January delivery climbed 43 cents, to $28.44 a barrel.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to a price of 99 15/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.07 percent from 4.02 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 28/32, to 106 15/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.95 percent from 4.89 percent on Thursday.
The decline came after the University of Michigan reported that its preliminary confidence index for December rose to a higher-than-expected 87, from 84.2 last month.
For the year, the dollar is down 13 percent against the euro and 8.5 percent against the yen. Many forecasters expect the decline against the euro to continue next year but at a slower pace. 
The average of 100 predictions gathered by Consensus Economics in London shows little change for the dollar against the euro next year based on yesterday's level. For the yen, the average forecast shows a slight dollar rally. That outlook is already getting support from Japanese officials who want to weaken the value of the yen to make Japanese exports more competitive.
A weaker dollar could also help the economic rebound in the United States by making American exports more competitive abroad and many domestic manufacturers, including the automobile industry, more competitive at home. A weaker dollar lowers what foreigners have to pay for American exports and increases the cost of imports into the United States.
The lift that a lower dollar could give to the American economy led to immediate speculation in the currency markets about whether the Treasury secretary-designate, John W. Snow, whose nomination was announced Monday, would favor a weaker dollar.
Mr. Sinche of Citigroup, who is forecasting a modest rise for the dollar next year, said he did not think the Bush administration would make such a policy shift but that the speculation was still weighing on the dollar.
The seasonal pressure on the dollar, Mr. Sinche said, comes because many investors tend to wind down their activities in December, which means the flow of foreign funds into the United States to buy dollars slows at the end of the year. In the last five Decembers, Mr. Sinche said, an index of the dollar against major currencies has fallen an average of 1.4 percent. But that same index has shown an average rise of 1.2 percent from Dec. 1 to the end of January in those five years.
Downward pressure on the dollar is also coming from the threat of a war with Iraq. Ms. Mills of Brown Brothers said that "going into the war is not a dollar positive; nor is waiting for a war a dollar positive." But she said a quick victory with broad allied support could help the dollar.
Another negative factor is the near-record current account deficit for the United States, which was $127 billion in the third quarter. The flow of funds from abroad needed to cover this deficit is enormous and if these flows slow down just slightly there will be downward pressure on the dollar.

HEADLINE: Latest Revisions to Nasdaq 100 Leave Index With Less Technology 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq 100 stock index is losing more technology stocks. Now the old industrial and consumer stocks are moving up to rank among the largest companies in the Nasdaq stock market.
 The Nasdaq 100, which comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market, announced yesterday that 15 companies would be dropped from the index on Dec. 23, to be replaced by 15 others. Most of the companies vanishing are fallen technology stocks, while many of those being added have gained from operating stores -- Whole Foods Market, Petsmart and Ross Stores -- or such old-economy businesses as oil services (Patterson-UTI Energy) or industrial fasteners (the Fastenal Company). 
 The popularity of the Nasdaq 100 was reflected in the great success of the exchange-traded fund based on the index, known as the QQQ after its ticker symbol. Just 12.5 million shares of the fund were outstanding at the end of March 1999, the first month it traded, but that figure rose to 804.3 million at the end of last August.
Since then, however, the figure has fallen 11 percent, to 721.7 million, at the close of trading on Thursday. That could indicate that investors have begun to grow less enchanted with the QQQ.
In announcing the additions and deletions from the index, which are based on share prices at the end of October, John L. Jacobs, the chief executive of Nasdaq Financial Products, said that the Nasdaq 100 "has outperformed every other major stock index since 1992."
That calculation is accurate if dividends -- something that few Nasdaq companies pay -- are ignored. But assuming the reinvestment of dividends, calculations based on Bloomberg data indicate that the Nasdaq 100 is up 186 percent since the end of 1992, while the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 214 percent. Of those gains, only 7 percentage points of the Nasdaq 100 gain came from reinvesting dividends, while 59 percentage points of the Dow return came from that source.
Moreover, since March 10, 1999, when the QQQ began trading, the value of the Nasdaq 100, not including dividends, is down 51 percent, compared with a 14 percent fall in the Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off 31 percent over that period.
The companies to be added, in addition to the ones already mentioned, are Expeditors International of Washington, Dentsply International, the Lamar Advertising Company, the First Health Group Corporation, Pixar, the American Power Conversion Corporation, C. H. Robinson Worldwide, the Gentex Corporation, Henry Schein and Ryanair Holdings. All are based in the United States except Ryanair, which is a European airline.
The 100 companies in the Nasdaq 100 are not necessarily the largest traded on Nasdaq. Companies must have been public for at least two years before being added to the index -- a fact that is less important than it was, with the recent dearth of initial public offerings -- and companies in the index are not removed the first year they fail to qualify for it, so long as they remain in the top 150.
The companies to be deleted are Abgenix, the Andrx Group, the Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, the Atmel Corporation, Charter Communications, the Conexant Corporation, the Cytyc Corporation, Integrated Device Technology, ImClone Systems, i2 Technologies, Protein Design Labs, PMC-Sierra, the Rational Software Corporation, Sepracor and the Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation.
The replacement of shares in the QQQ trusts must be made within three business days of the changes in the index. That will lead to substantial sales of the stocks being dropped, and to substantial purchases of shares being added.
Several research firms have published forecasts on the changes, and some of the price movements may have already taken place as investors tried to anticipate the changes. This week, the 15 stocks being removed fell an average of 10.9 percent, far worse than the 5.6 percent decline in the Nasdaq 100 index. The stocks being added rose an average of 1 percent.
Since Oct 31, 2001, the last time stocks were priced for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, the companies being removed have fallen an average of 68.9 percent, with the worst performer, Charter Communications, down 90.9 percent. The index is off 26.3 percent over the period.
The 15 stocks being added rose an average of 45.2 percent over that period, but such are the fortunes of many stocks in the Nasdaq 100 that a big rise was not needed. First Health Group is down 10 percent from its level at the end of October 2001, but is still being added to the index. --------------------

Chairman to Step Down
(By The Associated Press)
Hardwick Simmons, the chairman and chief executive of the Nasdaq, will step down in 2003 as the technology-focused stock market struggles with operations in a three-year bear market.
A search for his replacement will begin in mid-2003, shortly after the Nasdaq board's March meeting, officials said yesterday.
Mr. Simmons will remain in his position until a successor is named and then serve as nonexecutive chairman for the rest of 2003, when his contract expires.
Mr. Simmons, a former chief executive of Prudential Securities, has been Nasdaq's chief executive since February 2001 and chairman since September 2001.

HEADLINE: European Union Acts to Admit 10 Nations 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The European Union redrew its map today, pushing its border eastward to add 10 nations, most of them poor former Communist countries. 
 The expansion -- the biggest in European Union history -- will create a mega-Europe of 450 million people in 25 countries and an economy of more than $9 trillion, close to that of the United States. 
 Today's announcement comes a month after NATO, the military alliance formed as a shield against the Soviet Union after World War II, redefined its borders by inviting seven former Communist nations to join. But after a year of American-led combat operations in Afghanistan in which NATO countries played a minimal role, and with the possibility of war against Iraq, the new NATO is struggling to find a mission.
This is not the case with the European Union, which already has far too much to do. Today, European leaders congratulated themselves on the history of the moment, which will put an additional 75 million people under the union's banner and add 23 percent to its territory. 
"Today is a great moment for Europe," the new group of 25 nations said in its first joint communique, under the title, "One Europe." It added, "Our common wish is to make Europe a continent of democracy, freedom, peace and progress." At the close of the summit meeting, the union's leaders competed with one another's superlatives. "Today we have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in European history," the Danish prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, told reporters. "We decided to heal our continent. We decided to create one Europe."
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said at a news conference: "This is a summit that redefines Europe for the future. This is an extraordinary moment in Europe's history."
The new members -- Poland; the Czech Republic; Hungary; Slovakia; the former Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; the ex-Yugoslav republic of Slovenia; and two Mediterranean islands, Cyprus and Malta -- will formally join the European Union in May 2004.
Today's announcement follows extraordinary, detailed haggling in recent months over issues of money and even national identity.
The main fight during the summit meeting was between Poland, the largest new member, and Germany, the club's biggest paymaster, over money for Polish farmers.
Poland had threatened to sabotage the expansion by demanding more financial aid to help bring Eastern economies up to Western standards. The impasse was resolved after the union agreed to spend an additional $430 million in farm and other subsidies for the new members, for a total of $42 billion between 2004 and 2006.
Other concessions included an increase in milk-production quotas and money for border guards to Poland. "Our tactic of tough negotiations proved to be successful," the Polish prime minister, Leszek Miller, said at a news conference. "Our nation deserves this."
Many concessions to other countries were much more modest. Bulgaria was granted an exemption from certain taxes on local liqueurs, for example. Hungary was granted the exclusive right to use the word "Tokay" for the wine it produces. Malta can continue to catch finches, Latvia to catch undersized herrings. Slovenia has claimed the exclusive right to use the name Lipizzaner for the breed of horse.
Nothing was signed today. The European Union prides itself on process and consensus, which means serial meetings before decisions can be made. So a formal treaty will be signed in Athens in April.
Today's celebration was marred by the union's rejection of Turkey's demand to set a date to begin negotiations for its admission into the exclusive European club.
Turkey, with the support and involvement of the Bush administration, had lobbied hard for the European Union to agree to open talks on its candidacy. It had wanted a firm commitment that negotiations would start before the membership of the 10 new nations is formalized.
Late Thursday night, the union's leaders agreed to meet in December 2004 to decide whether the largely Muslim country of 70 million people was democratic enough and respectful enough of human rights to begin negotiations. But no date for negotiations was set, and instead of 15 nations agreeing on its fate, 25 will now have to do so.
The 15 leaders reopened the issue today, however, changing their draft agreement to read that if the Turks meet the union's criteria to begin entry talks two years from now, they entry would begin "without further delay." Still, the decision not to set a firm date deeply disappointed Turkey's new government. 
There had been hopes that the showpiece summit meeting could also celebrate a deal to end the 28-year-old division of Cyprus, which will become one of the new union members. But talks brokered by the United Nations in Cyprus ended without an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
That means that only the southern, Greek side of Cyprus -- the only government on the island that is recognized internationally -- was invited today to join the union. The Turkish north could enter later if it agrees on terms to end the island's division.
Even before the decision on expansion, the first since Austria, Finland and Sweden joined in 1995, the union was engaged in an ambitious, open-ended experiment to redefine what it means to be a European. Both its believers and its skeptics say member nations are relinquishing sovereignty on a scale not seen since the Emperor Charlemagne tried to unify the continent 1,200 years ago.
There are proposals to make the European Parliament more powerful, perhaps even more so than national legislatures, and a debate over whether to set up the office of a president of Europe, who might compete with national leaders for influence.
Despite big dreams, however, the union has been unable to forge a common foreign policy or to piece together a viable military force to respond quickly to crises in its territory.
The current membership has no wiring diagram or blueprint for how to absorb 10 new bureaucracies when their nations become full members in 2004. There is no political plan for how the organization will govern itself and no economic plan for how the European Central Bank will create a single monetary policy for dramatically different economies.
The European Union is in the midst of negotiations led by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, to draft a new constitution for the new Europe, which he once suggested naming "the United States of Europe." But nowhere is there consensus about how to draft a common constitution for 25 countries.
With the expansion, the population of the European club will increase by 20 percent, but the average wealth per person will fall by about 13 percent because most of the newcomers are relatively poor. That means that the new union, which started out as a rich man's club, will have to find ways to balance the interests of a country like Luxembourg, with a per capita G.D.P. of nearly $43,000, with a country like Lithuania, with a per capita G.D.P. of $3,200.
The new members will have to adhere to 80,000 pages of European Union laws and regulations, which dictate what members can and cannot do in some of the biggest and smallest areas of life.
Its laws govern, for example, how corporations carry out acquisitions, what farmers can call their cheeses, when hunters can shoot small birds, how many hours a week people can work, and who is a dentist.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE UNION; 
Respect From M.T.A. Is Workers' Big Concern

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
The No. 2 train had just left the 241st Street station in the Bronx, and the group of fluorescent-vested transit workers who had cleaned it had time to talk. They spoke of the impending transit strike and their reasons for supporting it. They played down the issue of money. The underlying concern, they said, was respect.
 "We have a right to voice our opinion," said one of the workers, who gave only his first name, Dennis, because he feared repercussions from both the city and his union. "We feel that it's an unjust system. There's been a lot of animosity brewing over the years. It's just a shame it's come to this." 
 While it may seem as if the threat of a transit strike has appeared in the last few weeks, conversations with several transit workers in the Bronx yesterday -- most of them working out of the sprawling 239th Street maintenance facility -- seemed to indicate that the problem has been simmering for quite some time. 
By and large, the workers said they were in favor of striking, but only as a last resort. They said they had no desire to bring unnecessary hardship to their fellow New Yorkers, but quickly added that they felt they had no choice.
"We can't let the M.T.A. have their way," said a worker who would describe himself only as a 21-year veteran of the job. "The management is using the public as pawns, as a smoke screen. They're like magicians doing a trick."
Pay is not what rankles them, they insisted. The starting salary for transit workers is about $33,000, and senior workers can earn as much as $47,000 a year. What does bother them, they said, is how they are treated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. For example, under the current contract, workers have to notify the authority when they go to the doctor on a sick day. If they leave the doctor to pick up a prescription at the pharmacy, they have to notify management again.
At the union's headquarters on the West Side of Manhattan, Veronica Brown, a train cleaner who is a single mother and lives in the Bronx, said the authority's current proposal would force her to pay for medication, and possible hospital stays, for her two asthmatic children. "I know we're inconveniencing a lot of people," she said about a possible strike. "But what we're fighting for is not just a wage issue. Health coverage is so important for us."
Last night, after a supreme court justice issued an injunction barring a strike by the union, transit workers expressed disappointment. James Johnson, a token operator at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, said: "We have to go by what the law says. I don't think it's right, but we don't have a choice." He said he thought the injunction made a strike less likely. "We want to stick to the negotiating table," he said. "Striking is always the last option."
A token booth operator in Times Square who spoke on condition of anonymity said of the injunction: "It goes against our fight. We're not asking for too much. I feel we deserve something, a raise."
Earlier, at the Bronx train yard, workers said cleaning the subway was a dirty job. The cars are often stained with blood, human excrement and other bodily wastes. The tracks are caked with filth.
"I get rashes and five or six colds a year because of the trash I deal with every day," Dennis said. "And I have to call the transit authority every time I go to the doctor? Every time I go to get a pill?"
The 21-year veteran was shaking his head. "It's like saying, 'Yes, master. Can I go get healthy, master?' " he said. "It's a whole plantation mentality."
Because many transit workers are black or Hispanic and many managers are white, there have been racial overtones to the labor dispute. Union leaders have noted that the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, which both have a larger percentage of white employees than New York City Transit, the subway and bus division of the transit authority, pay higher wages for comparable work. But the workers went out of their way to say the contract squabble was not about race.
"It's not a black-and-white thing or a race thing," Dennis said. "It's a respect thing. We do our job, and we want respect."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has taken a tough stance toward a possible strike, promising fines of at least $1 million against the Transport Workers Union and $25,000 each against the workers themselves. Mr. Bloomberg has suggested that a strike would cripple the city's economy and claim lives if emergency vehicles were stuck in gridlocked traffic. 
The transit workers interviewed yesterday said the mayor's rhetoric had been needlessly incendiary and showed that he was out of touch.
"I think he's overblowing the issue of people dying," Dennis said.
Another worker, who called himself Big O, added, "And there's no judge in this city who is going to fine a transit worker."
Down at the union headquarters, John Farrington, a bus driver and union official, said the sentiment among most union members was equally defiant. "They're laughing at what the mayor is saying -- injunctions and stuff," he said.
Raymond Hulen, a subway motorman, has been driving trains for 18 years. He said he is ready, if not exactly willing, to go on strike.
"No one wants a strike," he said, "but if we get pushed too far there will be one."
Although the transit authority says it faces a huge deficit and cannot afford a raise, the workers are skeptical. They said that the authority spent too much on New York City Transit's offices in Brooklyn. They said they wanted the authority to open its books. Those very words, in fact, "Open your books," were said, like a mantra, by each man in turn.
By now, another train had rumbled into the station. Mr. Hulen had already headed off to the maintenance yard a block away. The men on the cleaning crew picked up their brooms and dustpans. 
"We have to get back to work," Dennis said. "For now."

The free transportation is not a perk to pamper high-paid executives; it is insurance that 200 lower-wage workers like bank tellers and security guards can get to the company's 23 Manhattan bank branches to do their jobs.
 "They're the ones that make the world go round," said Rena Desisto, a spokeswoman for Fleet. 
 As for the company's other employees -- there are roughly 2,000 in the city -- managers have the option of letting them work from home, she said. 
The situation at Fleet demonstrates how much the world of work has changed in New York since the last transit strike in 1980, when if you did not show up at the office, you were not working. Now, changes in technology -- and in attitudes after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center -- have made it possible for huge numbers of people to work without commuting at all.
Indeed, a transit strike may draw attention to a split among New Yorkers even more profound than the one between Yankees and Mets fans: those who have to go to the office, no matter what, versus those who can work from elsewhere.
No one knows for sure how many people can avoid commuting to New York by working at home or from another location, but anecdotal reports suggest there are a lot of them, and that the number has been growing.
A study published this year by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found that about 15 percent of all employees regularly did some work from home. Most of them used computers; most were in what the bureau calls "managerial, professional and sales occupations." Which pretty much describes much of New York City's white-collar work force.
At Merrill Lynch, close to 4,000 people routinely telecommute, said Janice Miholics, vice president for work-life strategies. More than 10,000 have "remote access," she said, adding that "a lot of that is the offshoot or after-effect of 9/11."
Experts in the field say that Merrill Lynch is in the vanguard of companies that encourage telecommuting, and has been doing so for seven years. One reason, Ms. Miholics said, is so that "whether it is a transit strike or a snowstorm or something as disastrous as Sept. 11, business can continue."
Moody's Investors Service, the Wall Street bond rating firm, was forced to embrace telecommuting after the attack on the World Trade Center made its nearby offices unusable. So if there is a transit strike, Robert Kurtter, who follows New York's finances for Moody's, said he was "all set to pack my laptop and go home and work in my pajamas or sweats."
Alas for Mr. Kurtter, he cannot stay home in New Jersey on Monday, because he has to attend a luncheon with the new governor of Georgia, he said. "But that's just my minor tale of woe."
Some companies are moving quickly to improve their telecommuting abilities in advance of a strike. Queue Associates, a Wall Street technology company, just beefed up its "remote access" technology so that 15 employees, rather than 5, can work from home, said Jeffrey L. Goldstein, the firm's president. "It alleviates a lot of anxiety," he said. "Whatever happens, happens."
And some employees are suddenly figuring out, all on their own, that they can work even if they cannot make it to the office. Ann Manby, who works for a public relations firm in Midtown, said that she has "a very office-based job." But faced with commuting from the Cobble Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn, she is pondering whether to work from home. "I'm sending documents to myself, just in case," she said.
"It's just a different world now," Ms. Manby added. "A lot of people can probably just stay home and do their jobs."
A lot more, perhaps, but not everybody.
"Not if the more is more hands on, like a manufacturing environment," said Marcia P. Ellis, a human resources consultant based in Norwalk, Conn. "Not if it's tellers at a bank and the way they provide customer service is face to face."
Just ask Mi Law, a teller at the J. P. Morgan Chase branch at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street. Ms. Law, who lives in Coney Island, usually leaves her home by 6:45 a.m. to catch the subway so that she can start work by 8:15.
After briefly flirting with the idea of taking a day off, she is now planning to go to the office, either by taking a car service with colleagues or using a car pool set up by Chase. "We have a responsibility to be here -- we have to run the country," said Ms. Law, who came to the United States from Burma almost four years ago.
Her boss, Robert K. Farmand, the branch manager, has worked for the past 10 days to find ways to get his 35 other workers to the office, he said. "In this business, you cannot work from home," said Mr. Farmand, who plans to take an especially early train from Commack on Long Island so he can be at the office by 8 a.m.
Unfortunately for Ms. Law, he said, "We can't give her a cash drawer at home."
Which explains why banks and brokerage firms have hired 55 buses for "critical employees," who must have special passes, said Albert Wood, senior vice president of the Clearing House, the organization that made the arrangements. The buses, which will loop around Manhattan and provide some service in Brooklyn, are likely to carry 10,000 people between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.
At least some of those people are likely to have the ability to work at home, but not the desire, telecommuting consultants say. "Because of the economy, people are less likely to want to be away from the office," said Richard Federico, a vice president of one such organization, the Segal Company. "They'll be thinking: 'Where's my boss coming in from? If my boss has an apartment in Manhattan, I'm in dire straits.' "

HEADLINE: A Housing Plan That Falls Short 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's new housing plan (news article, Dec. 11) falls woefully short of the needs of New York's low- and middle-income renters. Moreover, those needs are not consistent with the interests of the real estate developers supporting his plan. 
 The 65,000 new and renovated units called for in the plan, only some of which will be made available to low- and middle-income renters, will not even replace the more than 80,000 units of affordable, regulated housing lost since rent laws were weakened in 1997. 
These units are no longer available to the New Yorkers who need them most: the police officers, firefighters, teachers, civil servants, health care workers, retail clerks and countless office workers who are the economic foundation of this city.

HEADLINE: Q&A; 
Extracting the Poison From White Racism

 BODY:
Carol M. Swain, a professor of both political science and law at Vanderbilt University, has studied racial attitudes for more than a decade. Her latest book, "The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration" (Cambridge University Press, 2002), argues that white nationalism is on the rise. To defuse its appeal, she counsels African-Americans to stop supporting affirmative action and reparations. Felicia R. Lee spoke with her.
 You argue that an energized white separatist movement exists, despite polls that show more racial tolerance and an increasingly diverse popular culture. Why? 

A lot of white people feel that diversity is being forced on them and it comes at their expense.
For example, in one of my focus groups with whites from the New York area -- men and women of different ages -- they were very angry. One person said employers will not take white males when they have to take blacks, Hispanics and Chinese; that there were quotas; that blacks could go to schools like Yale before whites; that blacks were lazy.
Blacks saw quotas as a ceiling and were angry about affirmative action, too. They said affirmative action was the receptionist out front and the guy who fixes the copy machine.
Racial extremists have a long history in this country. Why sound alarm bells now?
A constellation of forces are coming together at this point in time that we've never had before. There is the projection that non-Hispanic whites will be the minority around the year 2050. There's economic uncertainty, with a recession and globalization and loss of jobs. An immigration policy that means that some immigrants do compete with Americans for jobs. Racial preferences, a policy never accepted by the majority of whites. Continued white fear of black crime. And the ability of the Internet to reach people who want information about white nationalism. 
Historically, rapid demographic changes and economic uncertainty put people on a collision course and lead to social ills.
Senator Trent Lott is under fire for saying that the United States would be better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency on the segregationist platform in 1948. Should he resign?
I think Trent Lott should lead the national debate on race. If we're going to have a serious discussion, we need people to say what's on their minds. I don't think he should step down. If we attack these people when they put their feet in their mouths, we can never get to the root of the problem.
Is the specter of whites as a minority the biggest race card the racists play?
Yes. They say that your children and grandchildren will be submerged in these teeming masses of people that don't share your values, don't share your culture. It's very dangerous that white nationalists are the only ones talking in open forums about what it might mean for white people being a minority in America.
You yourself overcame the disadvantages of being black, poor, a high-school dropout. And now you advocate restrictions on immigration and the end of race-based affirmative action as big steps toward creating a better racial climate.
We can neutralize white nationalists by taking away two of their best issues. One is affirmative action as racial preferences and another is liberal immigration policies. One of the concerns that many people have about immigration is that new immigrants, who don't have a shared history of discrimination in the same way as African-Americans, can be eligible for racial preferences; it works against the interests of African-Americans and other people who have a history in this country. Some of them are illegal immigrants, who tend to depress the wages of native workers.
We need to move toward race-neutral affirmative-action policies and guarantee people a working wage. I believe that affirmative action never reached down to the people who were most disadvantaged.
What do you think of the current national black leadership?
The house is on fire for African-Americans, but the black leadership is more focused on the easier, symbolic issues. Some of those issues that the black leaders champion push some white people into the neo-conservative movement as a reaction. Like the focus on slave reparations at this time in history -- the timing could not be worse. If whites don't support affirmative action, why would they support reparations? I think it comes at an enormous cost of resentments being stirred.
Black leadership needs to focus still on issues like black crime. Even though crime has dropped nationwide, it's still a pattern that separates African-Americans from other groups. There are cultural things that need to be addressed, like the high rate of illegitimacy. Close to 70 percent of black children are born illegitimate. AIDS is the leading cause of death of African-Americans under the age of 55, and that is not really being discussed by the leading black spokespeople.
Liberals, you say, are not any better in turning back white nationalists because they have no new ideas about race, immigration, poverty.
I think the left is very much focused on maintaining and defending the status quo of things put into place 30 years ago. They're not strategic at all.
How in the world is the average white person, who maybe doesn't like affirmative action, turned into a white nationalist?
To reach the mainstream white population, the group they'd like to politicize, white nationalists have very skillfully adopted the language of multiculturalism and the language of civil rights. The language of multiculturalism says it's O.K. for groups to organize for self-determination and self-pride. The white nationalists say if it's O.K. for blacks and Hispanics, then why not whites? And they say that white Americans are the group that is most discriminated against in America and that there's no one protecting their interests. They are talking about racial preferences, immigration, job loss. The K.K.K. is a dying organization, not because its views and hatred are not out there, but because people have other avenues, and white intellectuals, people who are well educated, are not going to be in any of those organizations.

HEADLINE: The Selective Conscience 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the theater of totalitarianism, Saddam Hussein's Iraq is Grand Guignol. The testimony of victims who have lived to talk is replete with accounts of prisoners hung by the arms until their muscles rip, raw voltage applied to genitalia, suspects slowly dipped in vats of acid. When the jailers tire of tormenting the body they go after the soul. They will bring in a wife or daughter and rape her again and again before your eyes. They will bring in your little girl and methodically crush the bones in her feet. They will behead a mother in front of her children. And let us not forget the thousands of Iraqis gassed like insects for the crime of being Kurds, or the countless victims who have simply vanished forever.
 What does any of this have to do with whether we go to war? 
 That question causes no end of anguish among the people who labor to expose abuses in places like Iraq. Officials at Amnesty International, long a prime source of these repellant accounts, grow indignant when they hear their exposes repeated by George Bush or Tony Blair, men whose motives they regard as impure. 
"This selective attention to human rights is nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists," declared Irene Kahn, the secretary general of Amnesty, among whose worldwide membership humanism coexists with a considerable pacifism. 
This high-minded quandary reached a sort of apotheosis in a Time magazine interview with Scott Ritter, the former weapons inspector turned antiwar crusader. Mr. Ritter, one of the few outsiders to have visited a notorious children's prison in Iraq, was asked what he had seen. "Actually I'm not going to describe what I saw there," he said, "because what I saw was so horrible that it can be used by those who would want to promote war with Iraq, and right now I'm waging peace." Ah.
Not all humanitarians are so squeamish. Horrified by Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda, some human rights advocates have come slowly and grudgingly to the use of force. While Amnesty International has never favored military intervention, American-based Human Rights Watch will support it to stop a slaughter in progress -- a standard established amid great internal strife after Serbian massacres in Bosnia. The group's position on invading Iraq now is hardly pacifist. "We don't object to people using military force to go after very bad guys," said Kenneth Roth, the executive director. "We just don't advocate it." 
You would, however, find among the group's activists and supporters a powerful mistrust of President Bush's motivation when he talks about systematic torture and Saddam's chemical attacks on his own people. 
Officially, formally, Saddam's depravity is not relevant to the question of whether America will lead a military effort to oust him. The question of invasion -- officially, formally -- is all about ridding Iraq of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and the means to deliver them.
But the barbarity of the regime is subtext to everything. It animates the moralist faction within the administration, apparently including Mr. Bush, whose revulsion at the misery of Iraq seems genuine enough to me. Saddam's cruelties also touch a little on two central questions about any exercise against Iraq: What's the evidence that Saddam is a real threat? (Any leader who encourages the torture of children as a mechanism of control is probably never going to become a good neighbor.) How will Iraqis react to an invasion? (Many of them with an outpouring of relief, wouldn't you think?) 
Saddam's mistreatment of his people is an important factor, too, because it has helped confound liberals who otherwise have doubts about the war. As George Packer pointed out in this paper's magazine last Sunday, the sheer awfulness of Saddam makes it hard to muster an antiwar movement. Caution on Iraq puts liberals in the "unsettling position of defending a status quo they despise."
One liberal who has settled this dilemma in favor of war is Bob Kerrey, the former senator and current president of the New School University. Mr. Kerrey, citing not Iraq's arsenal but its atrocities, has signed up with a committee of neoconservatives who support the liberation of Iraq. His argument is actually more complicated than I can do justice to here, but it is explicitly driven by the impulse to do good rather than the impulse to defend ourselves. He is a humanitarian hawk. Naturally Mr. Kerrey's stance has roused the doctrinaire claque in his traditionally leftist student body to demand he resign. 
I don't entirely buy Mr. Kerrey's argument. The view I've expressed in this space is that Saddam's appetite for a nuclear weapon makes him a grave danger, that containment is ultimately a sucker's game, and that Mr. Bush is right to prepare for war -- purposefully but patiently, hoping it will be unnecessary, and aiming to act as part of an aggrieved world rather than a posse of one. To my mind the sadistic practices of the Iraqi police state, and the more genocidal impulses -- now successfully held in check by American and British air patrols -- may be ample cause to indict Saddam as a war criminal, but they are not in themselves enough to launch an invasion. Nonetheless, Mr. Kerrey should be applauded for the valor of his convictions, which is at least as rare among college presidents as it is among elected officials. 
Why, aside from their roots in the Vietnam antiwar movement, are human rights activists not more open to the idea that America can use its unmatched muscle for good? In large part because Republican administrations -- in truth, Democratic ones as well -- have paid human rights little more than lip service, and little even of that.
Samantha Power, who documented America's long indifference to the most extreme form of abuse -- genocide -- in her harrowing book "A Problem From Hell," points out that Presidents Reagan and Bush Senior were worse than silent when Saddam was at his most genocidal. During the so-called Anfal campaign of 1987-88, when tens of thousands of Kurds were slaughtered in mass executions or fumigated with lethal gases, the U.S. regarded Iraq as a bulwark against Iran. Even after the gas attacks were documented the U.S. continued to ladle out credits for Iraq to buy American grain and manufactured goods. Ms. Power's reporting turned up one State Department document that concluded, with spine-tingling diplomatic detachment, "Human rights and chemical weapons use aside, in many respects our political and economic interests run parallel with those of Iraq." Human rights activists know their cause has perennially been "aside."
The Bush administration's enthusiasm for human rights would be more believable if it were less selectively applied. That does not mean we should ostracize countries whose cooperation we need in the war on terror -- Pakistan, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and others -- for their flagrant violations of basic human liberty. Despite what the purists say, engagement is sometimes a more effective weapon than sanctions. The critical thing is that fostering civilized behavior should be a priority up front in the design of our foreign policy, not an afterthought, a sop to bleeding hearts, or a pretext for something else.
If the time comes when we attempt to overthrow the ruling order in Iraq, the administration could allay the misgivings of humanitarians by demonstrating some sensitivity in how we do it. Even Iraqis who secretly yearn for our help must worry about civilian casualties, about vicious factional reprisals and about a new regime staffed by some of the very thugs who have participated in Saddam's chamber of horrors. In Afghanistan, a demonstration project in building democracy is endangered because we have abandoned much of the country to the warlords. 
One big reason for the credibility gap is that promoting human rights, even more than promoting American security, depends on the cooperation of those bothersome multinational institutions this administration seems to loathe. Here's a test case to watch. The administration says it wants Saddam charged for his crimes by an ad hoc international tribunal. Good idea. If -- as Human Rights Watch proposes -- such a court has broad jurisdiction over atrocities committed in Iraq, not just license to try Saddam Hussein, it will send a strong message to opposition forces to forgo bloody reprisals during a coming war. Few expect such sophistication from an administration that recoils from the very idea of international justice -- but let's see.
Finally, promoting freedom abroad will ring a little false as long as the administration is so often, so instinctively, scornful of freedom at home. The automatic recourse to preventive lockup, the lack of confidence in the criminal justice system, the casual regard for privacy and presumption of innocence, the obsessive secrecy -- you don't have to be a libertarian to wonder how dearly this administration cherishes the values it promises to export.

HEADLINE: THE TV WATCH; 
The Presidency? No: Gore Tackles A Real Challenge

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
The only "Saturday Night Live" material Al Gore vetoed during read-throughs as too embarrassing was a sketch about flatulence.
 "I'm sure this is funny," Mr. Gore said, according to Al Franken, a "Saturday Night Live" alumnus who has written speeches for the former vice president and helped shape tonight's show. "But at the end of this I want to have some bread crumbs leading back to my dignity." 
 The former vice president has still not revealed what else he expects at the end of his epic monthlong television blitz -- a book promotion whirl that has not helped sell two books he wrote with his wife, Tipper, about the American family, nor lifted his low standing in public opinion polls. If, as some of his aides whisper, Mr. Gore is not positioning himself for a rematch against George W. Bush in 2004, then he may be breaking new ground: doing television for television's sake. 
Reality shows proved that ordinary citizens will do anything to get on television. Presidential campaigns have shown that candidates will do anything to get elected. Al Gore's television odyssey suggests that politicians will do anything to stay on television.
"He has a sense of humor, and I think he thought there would be something invigorating about doing the show," Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of "Saturday Night Live," explained. Mr. Michaels, who began discussing the appearance with Mr. Gore last June, described his guest host's attitude in rehearsals as "conscientious."
Mr. Gore has been that way throughout his career. In every talk show appearance this week, he has acquitted himself well, or as he put it when Jon Stewart, the host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central, complimented his appearance, "I benefit from low expectations."
Mr. Gore balanced somber public policy pronouncements -- Iraq, the economy, Trent Lott -- with self-mockery about his Supreme Court-determined defeat in 2000. One of his first job prospects after the 2000 Florida ballot debacle, he told Conan O'Brien on "Late Night," was from a seafood restaurant chain promoting a shrimp platter special. The chain invited him to star in a television ad, "counting the shrimp," he said in a drawling deadpan, "then recounting the shrimp."
Funny Gore and Serious Gore smoothly took turns all week until they crashed into each other outside the studio of the NBC "Today" program in New York on Thursday.
Still wearing the fluffy red Santa hat he had donned to show his holiday spirit, Mr. Gore answered a question from Matt Lauer about Senator Lott and segregation. The former vice president gave a stern, thoughtful indictment of the Senate majority leader's praise for Strom Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat presidential campaign -- while looking like a loony Dr. Seuss creature crashing an office Christmas party. 
It is that snag in Mr. Gore's television persona -- his propensity to trip suddenly over a clumsy gesture or a coy or overly rehearsed remark -- that made him such an irresistible target for "Saturday Night Live" comedians and makes his decision to be the host of the show so puzzling.
Plenty of politicians have appeared on the show, most recently, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, who sang Barbra Streisand songs, among other things. But Mr. Gore has already been on "Saturday Night Live": he made a taped cameo appearance on a 2000 election special along with his rival, George W. Bush. In past weeks and days, he has demonstrated over and over how good-humored and sporting he is -- to Barbara Walters, Larry King, David Letterman, Mr. Stewart and George Stephanopoulos to name but a few.
Mr. Gore may not have much to lose by starring on "Saturday Night Live," but neither does he have much to gain, except yet more time on television.
Personal reasons cannot be discounted, of course. Mr. Gore is trying to sell books, although the books' standing on sales charts have actually dropped since his tour began. His appearances have not helped his political stature, despite a bath of favorable publicity right before Thanksgiving. Only 19 percent of the respondents to a late-November New York Times/CBS poll said they held a favorable view of Mr. Gore. 
The former vice president, whose presidential bid was endorsed by the Simpsons, seems to genuinely enjoy comedy shows. His wife sat in on the rehearsals, as did his daughter Kristin, a comedy writer based in Los Angeles who is friendly with several members of the "Saturday Night Live" staff and who helped prepare the show.
Behind the scenes, the former vice president was game and affable, said Steve Higgins, a staff writer who worked on some of the skits. Mr. Gore offered some ideas, including a satire of Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday, Mr. Higgins recalled, but he rejected material that could be interpreted as disrespectful to former president Bill Clinton. He also dismissed a joke about Mr. Bush and cocaine as "unfair." Mr. Higgins described Mr. Gore as intelligent and personable or, as he put it, "a fun version of Charlie Rose."
Aides have long complained that Mr. Gore's private charm seems to dissipate as soon as camera lights go on -- another reason his determination to take on "Saturday Night Live" baffled even veterans of the show.
"He is probably the most consequential person who has done the show, yet there was no awkwardness or backpedaling, no 'How will they take this,' " said James Downey, who began writing for "Saturday Night Live" in 1976 and collaborated with Mr. Franken on a taped sketch at the Oval Office set of "The West Wing" this week.
Mr. Downey said he was not surprised that Mr. Gore worked hard on the material. He was amazed, though, that the former vice president agreed to do it at all. "Usually we have all kinds of people and I almost never get never stunned, but this is one of those times," he said. "I am still surprised."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The TV Watch column on Saturday, about Al Gore's appearance as the host of "Saturday Night Live," referred incompletely to the role of Steve Higgins, who said the former vice president had been game and affable behind the scenes. Besides writing skits, Mr. Higgins is the producer.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Officials Defend Compromise on Smoking Bill 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Senior Bloomberg administration officials defended a compromise version of the mayor's sweeping anti-smoking legislation yesterday from attacks by City Council members unhappy with changes negotiated by their own leaders.
 Testifying before the Council's Health Committee, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden argued that banning smoking in almost all bars and restaurants could benefit those businesses, and that the exceptions they agreed to were pragmatic and fair. 
 In August, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg asked the City Council to extend a 1995 law that banned smoking in all restaurants with more than 35 seats, but excluded stand-alone bars and the bar areas of restaurants, as a workplace-safety measure. Under an agreement reached earlier this week, the prohibition on indoor smoking would be extended to bars and small restaurants, but with some exceptions: a handful of cigar bars already in operation, bars with no employees except the owners, nonprofit membership clubs with no employees, and bars and some health care facilities with enclosed smoking rooms. 
Bar and nightclub owners have argued that a ban on smoking in their establishments would devastate their businesses, and city officials have conceded that few, if any, of them will take advantage of the provision that allows the construction of special smoking rooms, because the requirements are burdensome and the exemption expires after three years.
"As has been said, politics is the art of the possible," Dr. Frieden told the committee members yesterday. "And just as seven cigar bars represents a compromise, so a very small number, if any, facilities that would construct a separate room would represent a small exemption."
Mr. Doctoroff, who is in charge of economic development and rebuilding, said the changes could help the bar business in a time of economic fragility. In a random survey conducted in Los Angeles and San Francisco, he said, bar owners reported no negative impact on their customer bases or revenues in the wake of a California state ban.
But bar owners and council members challenged that evidence, and questioned the logic of making decisions about New York City pubs and taverns based on a West Coast survey. Ciaran Staunton, in his third appearance before the Council on the bill, said he planned to lay off 3 of the 12 employees at his Midtown bar, O'Neill's, in anticipation of a 20 percent drop-off in business.
And several committee members, some of whose names appeared as sponsors of the amended bill, criticized it nonetheless.
"The thing that I think has been more appalling to me is the fraudulence of this compromise," said Philip Reed of Manhattan, who is not among those 26 sponsors. "I haven't met anybody who has read through those regulations and realistically thinks anybody's going to be able to build a room in their bar."
Kendall Stewart of Brooklyn went so far as to ask a group of witnesses testifying against the ban in bars for further amendments they might incorporate. James S. Oddo of Staten Island, who had drafted his own anti-smoking legislation, wondered aloud if the exemptions created an uneven playing field among bars competing for customers.
And Yvette D. Clarke of Brooklyn argued that the exemptions were elitist because they would place unfair restrictions on small bars, especially outside Manhattan, while providing loopholes for cigar bars and private clubs like American Legion halls that have no employees. "If I lived in that neighborhood, and I know 'American Legion: no problem; the guy next door: got problems,' " she hypothesized, referring to a situation she said is common in Brooklyn, "I'm going to the American Legion hall."
Bloomberg administration officials conceded that there were some philosophical inconsistencies in the proposed legislation, but added that the Council could always revise or repeal the provisions in the future.
Nonetheless, Council leaders remained optimistic that the bill, which needs 26 votes to pass, would be approved, probably at the next session of the full Council on Wednesday.
"I feel like further issues got raised about some of the amendments, but at this hearing more people testified in support than against," said Christine Quinn, chairwoman of the Health Committee, after emerging from the six-hour hearing. "And we now have more sponsors than we did prior to the compromise bill being released."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE REPUBLICAN LEADER; 
Lott Apologizes But Won't Yield Leadership Post

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss., Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Senator Trent Lott delivered a lengthy public apology today for comments he made last week that were widely decried as racially divisive, and vowed to "undo the hurt" that he had caused. But he rejected growing calls from Democrats and even conservative commentators for him to relinquish his post as incoming majority leader.
 Mr. Lott appealed repeatedly for "forbearance and forgiveness" in his first news conference since a firestorm broke out over his remark last week that the nation would have been better served had Strom Thurmond been elected president in 1948, when he ran on a segregationist platform. 
 "Segregation is a stain on our nation's soul," Mr. Lott said, reading from a prepared text at an inn near his home here. "There's no other way to describe it. It represents one of the lowest moments in our nation's history, and we can never forget that."
Although Mr. Lott's remarks drew measured support from other Congressional Republicans, many Democrats called them unconvincing and said he should not become the next majority leader. Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus continued to call for his censure. 
Senator Lott's remarks today were his fullest yet on the subject of race and segregation. He described himself as a product of a segregationist time and place, "an environment that condoned policies that we now know were wrong and immoral, and I repudiate them." He added, "Let me be clear: segregation and racism are immoral."
Mr. Lott, who said in 1997 that, as a student at the University of Mississippi in 1962 he had "favored segregation," sidestepped a question about when and how he had come to change his mind on the subject.
Instead, he sought again to explain his remarks as anything but an endorsement of segregation. He said he was merely "trying to make happy an incredible, legendary human being."
He added, "That said, I apologize for opening old wounds and hurting many Americans who feel so deeply in this area."
Mr. Lott became engulfed in criticism after a 100th birthday party for Senator Thurmond of South Carolina, last week at which he said: "I want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either."
Asked today about the growing chorus of demands that he step down as Republican leader, Mr. Lott said that no senators had urged him to do so, and that some had called to say they were praying for him and to offer helpful suggestions. "But, you know, I'm not about to resign for an accusation that I'm something I'm not," he said.
If Mr. Lott's words were full of humility, his voice had the familiar singsong lilt to it, and his demeanor ranged from subdued to defiant to the kind of upbeat, proud tone more associated with a stump speech. The senator defended himself against charges of racism, in part, by citing his noted and often criticized pork-barrel achievements, among them a highway bridge through downtown Pascagoula and federal contracts at the nearby shipyards.
He said a Nissan auto plant that he had helped lure to Canton, Miss., would bring "hundreds and thousands of jobs" to "an overwhelmingly African-American community."
"That's the best way I can think of to help liberate people, to help them be able to get a good-paying job," he said.
Mr. Lott did not retreat, either, from some of his votes over the years that have been cited as evidence that he is racially insensitive. He said he had opposed making a national holiday of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday because of the economic cost involved. And he said he had voted against an expansion of the Voting Rights Act to include penalties for Southern states that did not protect blacks' access to the polls because "it was always aimed at one region."
In his defense, Mr. Lott said he had spoken at one historically black college, Alcorn State University, and provided federal research funds for another, Jackson State University; hired numerous minority interns and staff members over the years; and appointed black Mississippians and others to national and regional federal posts.
He also pointed out that he had supported placing a bust of Dr. King in the Capitol, "because there was a lot of support for it, and I thought that that was something that would help bring about reconciliation." He said he had written a resolution commemorating Juneteenth, the date when slavery came to an end, June 19, 1865, and tried to get a monument to the event placed on the Mall in Washington. And he cited his support, along with Representative Charles Rangel, the New York Democrat, for a successful Africa free-trade bill.
Nonetheless, Mr. Lott promised to "dedicate myself to undo the hurt I have caused." As the "next step," he said he had spoken with Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, and Robert Johnson, the head of Black Entertainment Television, about arranging for an hour-long television appearance next week.
A spokesman for the network said Mr. Lott would sit for a half-hour interview on Monday night with the BET anchor Ed Gordon.
Mr. Lott's lengthiest mea culpa to date came a day after President Bush rebuked him, saying, "Any suggestion that the segregated past was acceptable or positive is offensive, and it is wrong."
Republican allies of Mr. Lott said he chose to speak out today in Pascagoula because he wanted to follow President Bush's comments relatively quickly and from his home state.
Mr. Lott said again today that he agreed with the president. At another point he even used Mr. Bush's own words, saying that he hoped for a color-blind society where every child has a chance for an education that "gives him a real chance for a good life and that rejects the soft racism of low expectations."
But reaction from his neighbors on the Gulf Coast, where Mr. Lott's popularity largely follows racial and political lines, suggested he had won few new sympathizers.
Evelyn Stephens and her 16-year-old daughter, Constance, residents of neighboring Moss Point, the most predominantly black of the 13 coastal cities strung along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, attended Mr. Lott's news conference and said they were disappointed.
"My daughter was planning to go to Ole Miss after she graduates, but after what Lott said, she doesn't want to go to the same school he went to," said Evelyn Stephens. "She'll find another college to attend."

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS; 
Excerpts From News Conference Held by Senator Lott in Mississippi

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Senator Trent Lott's news conference yesterday in Pascagoula, Miss., as recorded by The New York Times:
 I have a prepared statement, and then I have a brief announcement, and then I'd be glad to take your questions. 
 Segregation is a stain on our nation's soul. There is no other way to describe it. It represents one of the lowest moments in our nation's history. And we can never forget that. 
I grew up with segregation here in these communities. But I want to note that in these communities of Pascagoula and Moss Point and Gautier and Ocean Springs, Miss., we worked hard to overcome that and to bring about reconciliation and to work together. I grew up in an environment that condoned policies and views that we now know were wrong and immoral, and I repudiate them. 
Let me be clear. Segregation and racism are immoral. I feel very strongly about my faith. I grew up in a local church here. I actively participated. And as I've grown older, I have come to realize more and more that if you feel strongly about that you cannot in any way support discrimination or unfairness for anybody. It's just not consistent with the beliefs that I feel so strongly about. 
I've seen what that type of thing in the past can do to families, to schools and to communities. I've seen personally the destruction it's wrought on lives, good people. I've known many of them personally and I know that there are terrible harms that have come out of that era. 
The president was right when he said that every day our nation was segregated was a day that America was unfaithful to our founding principles and our founding fathers. I lived through those troubled times in the South. And along with the South, I have learned from the mistakes of our past. I have asked and I'm asking for forbearance and forgiveness as I continue to learn from my own mistakes and as I continue to grow and get older. But as you get older, you hopefully grow in your views and your acceptance of everybody, both as a person and certainly as a leader. 
With regard to my remarks about Strom Thurmond, Senator Thurmond is a friend. He's a colleague. And if no other reason because he's 100 years old and still a member of the Senate, he's legendary. But he came to understand the evil of segregation and the wrongness of his own views. And to his credit he said as much himself. 
Last week, I was privileged to join hundreds of others to honor him. It was a lighthearted affair, but my choice of words were totally unacceptable and insensitive. And I apologize for that. 
Let me make clear, though, in celebrating his life I didn't mean in any way to suggest that his views of over 50 years ago on segregation were justified or right. It was wrong and immoral then, and it is now. 
By the time I came to know Strom Thurmond some 40 years after he ran for president -- I knew of him when I was in the House of Representatives, I didn't really get to know him till I started running for the Senate and moved over to the Senate -- he had long since renounced many of the views of the past, the repugnant views he had had. And he made that public himself. 
That said, I apologize for opening old wounds and hurting many Americans who feel so deeply in this area. I take full responsibility for my remarks. I can't say it was prepared remarks. As a matter of fact, I was winging it. I was too much into the moment. But I only hope that people will find it in their heart to forgive me for that grievous mistake on that occasion. 
Not only have I seen the destruction by these immoral policies of the past, I have tried to and will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that we never go back to that type of society again. I have worked in this town, in this county and in this state to try to help people, to bring about reconciliation, to reach out to people of all race, colors, religions, to give them a chance to get a better education, to get a job. That's the best way I can think of to help liberate people, to help them be able to get a good-paying job. And this is a blue-collar working-class community. And we've been blessed with the opportunities we've had here because we're a blue-collar working-class community. 
Now there will be some disagreement on the best ways to ensure that every American, every American of every color and race and ethnic background has a fair and equal chance in life. But our goals are the same, even though we'll debate it on philosophical or partisan lines. 
We want a color-blind society that every American has an opportunity to succeed, an end to the entrenched poverty and joblessness that has plagued minority communities and communities of all kinds in this state and across this nation. A good education for every child that gives them a real chance for a good life and that rejects the soft racism of low expectations. 
I've benefited from the public education in this state. I was able to go on to college and to get a law degree. So did my wife, and so did both of my children, both in public schools in Virginia and in Mississippi. And it gave us the chance that we want everybody to have, to get a good education then go on and have a profession and get a job. 
We need strict enforcement of civil rights laws on the books, and all laws on the books, to guarantee equality and punish racism. Government does best when it helps people help themselves. You've heard that phrase before. Human dignity is found not in a handout, but a hand up, to help people to be able to do more for themselves and their children and their grandchildren and their future. Government should be about giving people a real chance to do for themselves and help themselves and to live the American dream.
I believe this because I have lived it. My father when I was born was a sharecropper. Yes, a sharecropper. He raised cotton on somebody else's land in a county where everybody was poor, regardless of race or anything else. Almost everybody was barely making it.
And then of course we came down to Pascagoula. My dad was a shipyard worker. My mother taught school. So I had lived this dream. I was their only son, the first to earn a graduate degree. And I feel so strongly that everything I've been able to do in my education, in my opportunities in life and in my political career, is evidence that no matter where you're from or what you're background, of your parents, or what your race is, you can if you work hard and take advantage of the opportunities, get a good education. You can live this American dream.
To those who believe that I was implying that this dream is for some and not for all, that's just not true. But I apologize, for those that got that impression. I work in this state to try to make sure that all Mississippians have a chance at the American dream. And I will continue to do that as long as I live.
In the days and months to come, I will dedicate myself to undo the hurt I have caused and will do all that I can to contribute to a society where every American has an opportunity to succeed.
As a man of faith in local church here, I read the Bible all my life. I now will fully understand the Psalm that says a broken spirit, a contrite and humble heart.
One final point. The next step to make sure that these are just not words here today is I am talking to and working with African-American leaders like Roy Innis of the Congress of Racial Equality and Bob Johnson of Black Entertainment Television. And in that vein we're working to get final agreement on a time next week, early next week, when for a full hour I will talk about my hopes and dreams for the people in this state and this country, regardless of their race, and to make sure that African-Americans have the opportunities that they deserve. . . . 

Q. Senator, obviously you were surprised at the reaction of the country to your comments. Besides being surprised, were you angered? Were you disappointed, saddened? What was your take in terms of how your colleagues and the nation and the media reacted?

A. You know, I was surprised. And that shows you where I've done wrong. I mean obviously I had a blind spot. I was insensitive in the words I chose or the extra phrase I added. I did not in any way mean to be endorsing policies of 54 years ago. I was trying to make happy an incredible legendary human being that holds the record in the Senate, was 100 years old, landed at Normandy. And I love him for so many things he has done and the growth that he has shown. But that doesn't justify it.
When you're from Mississippi and when you are a Republican leader, you got an extra burden to make sure you think about every word and every phrase, so that it doesn't convey the wrong impression or hurt people. 
And so while I was surprised, because I was just into the event, I still caused a major problem. And I want to get over that. Let me go right here. Yes.

Q. Senator Lott, a lot of conservative commentators have called for you to step down as Senate Republican leader. Have any Senate Republicans come to you privately and asked you to step down? Or perhaps talked to you about a Senate censure for what you said, even though you've already apologized?

A. No senator has spoken to me about the possibility of me stepping down, directly, publicly or privately. Certainly not any Republican senator. A lot of senators have called to say they're, frankly, they're praying for me, to offer suggestions and ideas of what we could do to, you know, have something positive come out of all of this.
But I'm not about to resign for an accusation that I'm something I'm not. And my colleagues have been very good about calling -- even, you know, Senator Paul Simon from Illinois was at the event. Now he's a Democrat, ran for president, pretty liberal Democrat, really nice guy. I'm crazy about him, too. He brought over and introduced me to his wife, because his first wife I had known had passed away a couple of years ago. He called and said: "Look, I was there. I saw the tone of the event. I heard what you said. I in no way, you know, read into it what has been inferred."
And so, I mean that's what a Democrat said. Some people might be surprised that Jim Jeffords -- hadn't exactly made my life a bowl of cherries the last year and a half -- but Jim Jeffords has put out a statement saying I know this guy, I've been in 15 or so states with him around the country. Never did he utter one word. 
These are not his words, but basically saying this is not the Trent Lott I know. I may not agree with him on how much funding for, you know, some education program. But I know the man. And I appreciate him doing that. Yes.

Q. Mr. Leader, you said you were winging it last week. But you winged it in the same way in 1980, you said almost the same comment to a newspaper here. And even regarding issues like the Martin Luther King birthday -- Strom Thurmond voted for a Martin Luther King holiday. You voted against it. I'm wondering if you can see how your actions don't inspire a lot of confidence among some people, particularly some African-Americans.

A. Well, I've heard about the 1980 incident and I don't deny that that, you know, that almost the same words were used. For many years, I'd go up to Senator Thurmond -- some of you know where he sits there on the floor -- and I'd kid with him and say, "Strom, you'd have made a great president." And he always looked up and smiled big. And it was this, that kind of a platonic, almost father-son, relationship that we had.
But you know, there are a number of issues that I have voted for and supported over the years. Look, Martin Luther King Jr. was the premier civil rights leader in this country over the last 50 years. And while I have never supported additional holidays, because I think that they cost a huge amount of money -- $325 million is the statistic I have -- some things I have done, for instance, is I did vote to put a bust in the Capitol. Because there was a lot of support for it, and I thought that that was something that would help bring about reconciliation.
Also, I was the author of the resolution commemorating June 19 Independence Day, June 19, 1865, the day on which slavery finally came to an end in the United States. I did that. And some people were surprised about it. And I've been working with a number of African-American leaders to try to get a suitable memorial, monument on the Mall. 
I made the point in an interview three weeks ago, well before this developed, that I had seen some leaders over the years that might surprise you. And one of them was Charlie Rangel of New York, who worked with me, and we passed the Africa free trade bill. And at one point, it was about to die. And I talked with him. And he said: "No, I don't want to blame anybody for what we didn't get done. But let's get this done."
He and I worked together. We passed a bill. It will be a bill in the end that will help the people in Africa. And it will help the people in America. Because trade is good. Some people will argue with me about that in this state. But I think that free trade like freedom. Free enterprise is what America is based on.

Q. Senator, you've already mentioned the old reputation that Mississippi still has. And those that grew up here and experienced it with you struggle with it every day. But you now represent a new stronger Republican Party nationwide, and that's got to be very important to every elected official in that party. Does this recent incident lessen your strength in the position that you are to assume in January?

A. You know, a friend of mine who sang for "The Lawrence Welk Show," I don't know, 15 or 17 years, has written a song called "Mississippi, This Is Your Song." And it talks about "Mississippi, you seek forgiveness where you've gone wrong."
One of the things I'm committed to is trying to help this state. I don't want us to be treated the way we've been treated, sometimes by our own making. I want us to be a part of this nation. I want us to be economically competitive, socially competitive, civilly competitive and a part of the national team. That's one of the things I really enjoyed. 
And my party, they have not held where I'm from against me. They've allowed me to be involved and advance, maybe because I was here. Because I was trying to find a way to help this state, some people have been critical of me. Wait, you try to bring federal money to your state. Well, yeah. When I tried to get funds to bring the bridge, right over here -- you want to take a look at it? -- people were endangered. We couldn't grow. We couldn't get across the bridge at certain hours. So I feel very strongly about trying to improve the image of this state.
And I appreciate so much the fact that my colleagues have allowed me to be in leadership positions for 20 of my 30 years in the House and the Senate. And I don't want to do anything that stops our effort to reach out and to get more people involved in the party and in government, just voting. That's why I'm for this election reform bill that we passed. 
I talked to Eddie Bernice Johnson, congresswoman from Dallas, last week. She was asking me about that, like she was surprised that I was for election reform. And I think we should fully fund it. I want everybody to be able to vote. I don't want to hang in chads. 
And in this state, by the way, we've got a secretary of state that's worked pretty hard and working with the local officials. And we had a pretty efficient and we had fair and honest elections. I want that to fly all over America. And I want the Republican Party not to be hurt by this. I want us to find a way to reach out and build on mistakes that we have made in the past, but commit ourselves to the future. 
When I go around this state and I give speeches to mixed groups, I've noticed that when I start talking about what we want in this state are jobs, quality education for everybody, infrastructure so that we can attract those jobs. It was no accident that we brought the Nissan plan to Canton, Miss. Canton, Miss., by the way, which is an overwhelmingly African-American community, this $1.5 billion plant that's going to mean hundreds and thousands of jobs. That's what we've got to do more of in this state. It will help us all.

Q. Senator, you said that you repudiated segregation and previously you acknowledged that at least while at Ole Miss you were a segregationist then. You've said that in the past. And today ----

A. I don't think I said that. I don't think I said that.

Q. You said in an interview in Time magazine in 1997 that at Ole Miss as a student in 1962 you endorsed segregation. What I'm trying to get at, when did you have this conversion on the subject? When did you decide ----

A. No. Just think back what has happened in this state and this country over the last 100 years and what's happened over the last 50 years, and the progress we've made, particularly in the 60's and the 70's and the 80's and the 90's. I know this state has more African-American elected officials than I think any other state, certainly per capita. And by the way, we have African-American Republican elected officials, the mayor of Tchula, Miss. We had a Congressional candidate that ran as a Republican nominee. And we have been encouraging that.
So Mississippi, like the South and the rest of the country -- this was not, by the way, a problem that was just in the South, you know. And we get a little offended sometime that that's the way it's stated. In fact, we think we have made more progress and reconciliation of relationships maybe than some other people in other areas. 
So we changed with the rest of the country as we got away from those things and made real progress. And I think particularly in the last 20 years you've seen huge advances. Are we where we want to be? Is it perfect? No. And that's why I say we've got to do even more.

Q. Senator, this television program, it sounds like the start of a public relations offensive to get along with the African-American community in the United States. Is that just the first step of that offensive? And if that offensive fails after two or three weeks, do you say this human cry is not going away, I have to reconsider? I might step down as leader of ----

A. Not at all. It's not an offensive, either. I know Bob Johnson, the man that founded and owns Black Entertainment Television. He's from Mississippi, Jackson, Miss., like a lot of other highly successful outstanding African-American Mississippians in sports and music, in entertainment and business. And I'd worked with him in the past and been trying to arrange a time when he can come to Jackson to speak to the 100 black businessmen's group. And he knows me. And he called and said: "Look, you need to be able to speak to the audience that we have. Would you be willing to do that?" . . .
He offered. And I said absolutely. 
That's what I am saying, though, this is not a one-day deal. This is something that's going to take time and effort. . . .

Q. You're a plain-spoken person. Tell us, bring it all down, just exactly what you meant when you said that.

A. I see Strom Thurmond, the Strom Thurmond I have known, this is a man that was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. So I see strong national defense. He was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I remember when I first moved over to the Senate, I thought gosh, can he still give a strong speech? He got in the center aisle, gave a strong speech about how unfair a crime it is and the need for strong law enforcement. I presume it was a crime law reform. I don't remember the particular bill.
This is a man that has always said that we've got to encourage growth, but we've got to have fiscal responsibility. We need to look at the bottom line, make sure that we don't create long-term problems for ourselves by overspending or any other practice that will cause problems for our children. That's the guy I knew. But instead of that, really, it was just an effort to help, to encourage an elderly gentleman to feel good on that occasion of his 100th birthday. So there were no venal thoughts in my mind. But those are the things I thought about. 

Q. Mr. Lott, you represent the state of Mississippi, and here in Mississippi we have a very large African-American population. In your opening statement you mentioned that you were going to dedicate yourself to bridging to overcoming all the controversy this has caused. And I was wondering what specifically are you doing in the State of Mississippi, what do you plan to do here with your constituents to reach out to that important constituency?

A. Well, the first thing I need to do is to be a good job as a senator for the state, work on issues here at home and at the federal level that will help the state. And I mentioned those, the ones I've concentrated on here, have been economic growth initiatives, infrastructure. You know, I found out that, you know, if you don't have decent roads you're not going to get industry. People won't come. And also roads will get you killed. That's what happened to my own father.
And also, of course, education. Our education system, we sometime are too critical of it. Some schools are really good. I think the school here in this community is good, Ocean Springs, a lot of good ones. But it's uneven. It's not consistent across the state. I'm trying to help our universities, including our historically black universities and colleges. I have a program named for me at Jackson State University, because I helped get some research funds from Defense and NASA to help them do some research for the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County. 
I gave the commencement address at Alcorn State University. I have probably had six or eight interns from Alcorn State University. I think those internship programs are very good, because you get young college students. You give them a chance to come to Washington. You listen to them, by the way. I always have lunch with them and say: "O.K., tell me what you see. Tell me what you think. Tell me what you want in life." 
And I've made it a point to appoint Mississippians, including African-American Mississippians, to national commissions and boards. Because we can do it, too. You know, you can. We've got outstanding people here. I mentioned Wanita Dody right here in Pascagoula area. I appointed the longshoremen union head, Ronald Robinson, to the National Labor Standards Board, an African-American. Would tell you right quick he's a Democrat. But I knew him. I've known him since I practiced law here in 1967. I knew him to be a good smart man that was working in an area that was relevant. And there are others like that. The vice chairman of the Postal Rate Commission is Danny Covington from the Mississippi Delta, an African-American. 
I can give you a list like that. And I've had staff members for years and years and years, including some from right here in Moss Point and Pascagoula, Miss., area. And I do today. And it's not just African-Americans, I have other minorities that have worked or work for me now. All right, let's see here. I don't want this going too long.

Q. Senator, what's your life been like for the last week ?

A. Sort of like a hurricane. My wife and I had planned -- we thought this would be a quiet time and a good time to get just a couple days off to sort of rest before we came home to childproof our home here in Pascagoula, where we, we're going to have our three grandchildren here. That certainly, those two days certainly, weren't restful, as I was trying to talk to people and reach out and think out, think and try to even communicate, which was hard to do, because there was no television station close by.
But it's been, you know, it's been very difficult. But again, I don't blame anybody else. I brought this on myself. And it's going to be up to me to deal with it. . . . 

Q. Senator, you and your office have issued several apologies and clarifications over the last several days. Why did you feel the need to come here and expound upon that? Were you pressured by anyone in Washington to come here today?

A. No. First of all, I was in Washington last week. I can't remember what day this birthday party was, Wednesday or Thursday. I was there Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Events, I went to events, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. I left Tuesday afternoon and had lots of contacts with the media, and was not much being said about it. And then all of the sudden, of course, Wednesday and Thursday it really got quite active. And I was in a remote area, and the only way I could communicate was in writing or in, at that point, this is Wednesday and Thursday, or by radio hook-up with Larry King and Sean Hannity.
But the main reason I'm here today is because I'm in, I'm home, I'm in Mississippi. And the first person I called on was local media. I knew I needed to do this for my local people, anyway. And so since I had not actually stood up and taken questions from the national media because of my location for the last three days, it seemed like the logical thing to do. I didn't want to be running back and forth doing one, two or a 100 interviews. This seemed like a better way to do it. 

Q. Senator, before the president publicly denounced your comments did he contact you? Did he say anything?

A. I did receive a call. His remarks were read to me. I said, "That sounds fine." They were terrible words. I apologized, and rightly so. That's what he said. And I talked to him after his trip to Philadelphia. And we have a very close relationship and we've talked about it. It was a very positive conversation. I'm not going to quote him, because you're not supposed to.
But look, I've talked to everybody that I can get on the phone, the president, the vice president, the president's chief of staff, probably 50 or 55 senators that are strung all across the country and the world and a lot of individuals, leaders, in Congress, in Washington, African-American leaders and others. All right, last question. You had one.

Q. You said that you support everybody's right to vote. And yet you were one of just a handful of people in the House of Representatives, just 24, who opposed the expansion of the Voting Rights Act that would have created penalties for Southern states that didn't assure open polls for black voters.

A. My problem with that was it was always aimed at one region. I had serious doubts about my ----
Are you with Al Sharpton?

Q. Yes, I am. Do you denounce racism?

A. Absolutely, I do. I repudiate it. . . . Well, I don't know who you're talking about there. Let me go back to this gentleman's question and finish up.

Q. Some people have tried to link this controversy to the nomination of Charles Pickering. They've said they're going to try to bring this up next year to get the White House not to renominate him and make him a federal appellate court judge. Do you think this is going to work . . . next year?

A. All I know is Federal Judge Charles Pickering is an outstanding human being that has made an excellent judge, and he would make an excellent Circuit Court judge. Obviously, people will try to use it against him. They used a lot of things against him last time that were very unfair. But we'll work through that before the year is out and early next year.

HEADLINE: Turks Denounce Europe Snub but Then Soften Tone 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Turkey's leaders began the day today by denouncing the European Union's refusal to agree to entry talks for their country, but ended it by issuing measured promises of continued cooperation. 
 The reaction followed the decision on Thursday by European Union leaders meeting in Copenhagen to reject the request by Turkey that they set a date to start negotiations for its entry into the group. Instead, the union's leaders said they would wait two years to measure Turkey's progress in strengthening democracy and safeguarding human rights, and take up the question then. 
 The decision amounted to a rebuke to Turkey's new leaders, who had pressed the union to begin negotiations next year. In rebuffing Turkey, the European leaders also snubbed the Bush administration, which, mindful of the country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, had lobbied on its behalf. 
Turkey's candidacy had prompted an emotional debate across the Continent over the wisdom of lowering European borders to a Muslim-majority nation of 70 million people. Early today, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul touched on the same issue when he suggested that Turkey had been unfairly singled out. 
"There is a prejudice against us," Mr. Gul said, declaring the European decision unacceptable. Turkish leaders pointed out that the European Union was preparing to admit 10 new members, most from Central Europe. 
Mr. Gul's remarks echoed those of other Turkish leaders before the meeting in Copenhagen, when they suggested that a snub by Europe could prompt Turkey to turn away from Europe and toward the Middle East.
Later today, though, Turkey's leaders softened their tone, with Mr. Gul and others promising to keep trying to gain eventual entry into the European Union. The conciliatory remarks seemed to reflect the mood among many Turkish business and political leaders, who are still eager to join but whose expectations for quick success were not so high. 
"We're not upset, but it could have been a better decision," Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the governing Justice and Development Party, said later in the day. "We will do our utmost to start talks in 2004, December." 
There were other indications today that the European decision was regarded as something less than a disaster. The main index of Turkish stocks was down only slightly, and the Turkish lira strengthened against the dollar.
The feeling among many Turkish business and political leaders seemed to be to take the European Union at its word: that its objections to Turkey's quick entry were not based on religion or ethnicity but rather on more tractable issues like democracy and human rights. 
"I would say that I am very stoic about this," said Ishak Alaton, chairman of Alarko, a large Turkish contracting company. 
Against the frustrations expressed by Turkish politicians, Mr. Alaton, whose company employs 6,000 workers, offered a different perspective. 
Over the years, he said, Turkey's leaders have in effect kept the country out of the European Union by refusing to reform what he described as a hidebound and overbearing central government. While sweeping reforms of their economic and criminal justice systems have been enacted recently, Mr. Alaton said, they have barely begun to change the antiquated political culture. 
"I can only say we have failed miserably in meeting the promises we made in the past," he said. "We are like the hare that started running five minutes before 12. We did only a few months ago things that we could have done 40 years ago. Now we are trying to push our European friends in a frenzy." 
Leaders of the European Union say they are reluctant to admit Turkey mainly because of its shaky democratic credentials. Criminal suspects are said to be tortured and beaten by the police, and the government has been accused of systematically persecuting the country's Kurdish minority. Through the republic's 79-year history, the military has been a central player in politics, intervening repeatedly to remove governments not to its liking. 
Despite the wave of legislative reforms, it is unclear how much has changed. For instance, although Parliament recently outlawed the use of torture, human rights groups here say it persists. Feray Salman, director of the Human Rights Association of Turkey, said that in the first six months of 2002, the group received about 350 complaints of torture and beatings.
For many Turks, though, there is still a feeling that for all the European talk of democracy and human rights, it is Islam that is the real sticking point. Indeed, before the Copenhagen summit meeting, some prominent Europeans, including former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, asserted that Muslim Turkey was not a European country. 
Those remarks angered many Turks, but some here found the recent discussion healthy. With the issue finally in the open, they say, the negotiating road to Turkey's final entry into the European Union could be much easier. 
"We need to get to the bottom of this, and we need to find out whether Europe is ready to accept a Muslim country," said Erkut Yucaoglu, a prominent businessman here. "That was a hidden point, and now it's in the open. That is a good thing."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE STAKES; 
Players in Strike Drama Struggle With Issues Of Image, Clout and Cash

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has repeatedly reminded New Yorkers over the last week, there is a lot at stake if the city's 34,000 transit workers go out on strike: hundreds of millions of dollars lost from the economy, traffic paralyzed, people's very lives endangered. 
But what do the main players -- the Transport Workers Union, Mr. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- stand to lose themselves?

The Union
 The last time subway and bus workers shut down the system, for 11 days in 1980, they suffered huge financial penalties. The union itself was fined $1 million and its members each had to pay two days' of their salaries for every day they were on strike, erasing some of the gains they had won in a new contract. 
 But beyond money, many labor experts say that the strike inflicted much deeper though less quantifiable damage on the union's members that is still being felt today.
Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, said he believed that the transit system's disciplinary rules -- the ones that the union's president, Roger Toussaint, and his members now bitterly complain are too petty and punitive -- grew directly out of the 1980 strike.
"The M.T.A. took advantage of their victory, as they saw it, and really bore down hard on the union and its members," said Professor Aronowitz, who added that he thought the authority's disciplinary system was the harshest since the one used by Ford Motor Company for its workers in the 1940's.
In the current contract dispute, a strike could win the union higher wages and energize the membership. But some labor leaders say that the union faces even greater risks because it is isolated and has not won enough support from the public -- always a tough job but much more so in a bad economy, in the winter, as the city recovers from last year's terrorist attacks.
As a result, characterizations like the one Mr. Pataki used yesterday, when he said that a strike would be "a horrendous act of disloyalty to the people of New York," have greater staying power and could embolden the authority, an agency he controls, to take an even harder line with the union in the future.

The Mayor
While Mr. Bloomberg has no seat at the negotiating table, his administration is just as invested in the outcome of the talks as either the union or the authority, and not simply because the mayor fears a crippling strike on his watch.
In many ways, if the union strikes and is able to wrest more money over the next three years, that is money that the Bloomberg administration itself will lose.
Almost since taking office and beginning to wrestle with the city's enormous budget gap, Mr. Bloomberg has said he wants to find a way to cut or eliminate subsidies to the bus and subway system, a $225 million annual bill he says the city can no longer afford. His representative on the authority's board, Susan Kupferman, reiterated that goal publicly this week when New York City Transit's $4.8 billion budget was approved in committee.
In part, it is why the mayor, unlike any predecessor that political experts can remember, has practically urged a fare increase, long viewed as a form of political suicide.
It is also why Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Toussaint can be viewed as direct competitors in the contract negotiations.
Looked at in the simplest terms, a 1 percent wage increase for workers would translate into $120 million more coming from the transit authority over the next three years, at a time when it says it is facing a deficit of more than $1 billion. A 2 percent increase would mean $240 million, or more than the city's $225 million contribution.
Of course, higher worker salaries would not come directly out of the city's coffers. But the higher the authority's labor costs, the less able the authority ultimately is to help Mr. Bloomberg, who also wants the authority to extend the No. 7 line and perhaps even buy the city's bridges.

The Governor
A strike could mean several things for Mr. Pataki, but one is certain. While many subway and bus riders still believe that the mayor is in charge of the city's transit system, it is the governor who controls the transit authority board and has the greatest power to prevent a strike.
And if one happens, the spotlight will undoubtedly shine brightly toward Albany, as it did toward Gov. Hugh L. Carey during the last strike.
"It will quickly become clear to people that the key political actor in this issue is the governor," said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz who is a Republican and a former Ulster County legislator.
But what will that mean for Mr. Pataki, who was recently re-elected by a comfortable margin, has hinted that he has no plans to run again for governor, and may have aspirations for the presidency or vice presidency?
In the short term, Professor Benjamin said, it could mean a lot. The state is facing a deficit of $5 billion to $10 billion in the next fiscal year and will be hard pressed to find any extra money to appease striking workers.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican who had strong labor support for his re-election, must also be cautious in how he deals with the union. If he were to be seen as overly harsh toward strikers, he could damage relations with the Democrat-controlled State Assembly, which has close ties to labor and whose cooperation the governor needs in the tough budget days ahead.
But looking further ahead, to the governor's next job, Professor Benjamin said, the effects of a strike are harder to predict. If the governor made a convincing case that the state got something from a strike -- that it saved money, that it faced down a bullying union -- then he could emerge with a sheen of courage. But a drawn-out strike, even this early in the governor's new term, could end up doing lasting damage to his political reputation.
"The best strategy is to stay away from it as long as he can," Professor Benjamin said, "but the longer a strike goes, the less able he'll be to do that."

The Authority
For the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the dangers of a strike are straightforward: riders are the authority's lifeblood, and after the 1980 strike, subway and bus ridership fell to the lowest level since 1917. Of course, the system is in much better shape than it was in 1980, when subways were swathed in graffiti. The graffiti is gone, trains are more reliable and ridership is much higher. But after suffering steep losses in riders and revenue last year in the months after the Sept. 11 attack (not all of the money recovered through insurance), the system would be hit very hard if trains and buses sit idle for days.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE COURTS; 
Judge Orders Transit Workers Not to Strike

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE with ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn issued an injunction last night that bars the city's transit workers from striking, while union leaders, the mayor and the governor worked to ease the sharp tensions surrounding the contract talks.
 The justice, Jules L. Spodek, issued the injunction as the union representing the city's 34,000 subway and bus workers was threatening to shut down the transit system at 12:01 a.m. Monday if no contract was reached with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 "Given the enormous, debilitating and destructive influence a strike would have, such action would wreak havoc upon this city," the judge wrote. "The recent vote by local union membership to give union leadership the power to call a strike leaves this court no choice but to grant" the M.T.A.'s request.
Invoking the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees, Justice Spodek barred transit workers from striking and ordered union leaders not to incite their members to strike. But he denied the authority's motion to prohibit union leaders from even discussing a strike. The injunction opens the way to penalties for contempt as well as the fines for individual workers set by the Taylor Law: two days' pay for each day on strike. 
It was unclear what effect the injunction would have on the talks. Union leaders said a strike remained very possible, with one adviser even suggesting that it could be postponed until later in the week. In interviews, many rank-and-file union members expressed support for a walkout, but only as a last resort. Page B8. 
The chief management negotiator, Gary Dellaverson, said during a break last night that the injunction was a turning point. "My expectation is we will reach a settlement right at the table," he said. "I have no expectation of a strike. I truly believe that now that the judge has issued his order, he's taken that issue off the table."
Later in the evening, Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said that the ruling simply restated the existing law and would not change the union's negotiating strategy. "All our energies will be focused on the bargaining table, and a settlement reached by negotiations not injunctions," he said.
Arthur Z. Schwartz, a lawyer for the union, voiced disappointment, saying, "If somehow this injunction encourages the M.T.A. and the transit authority to be more recalcitrant than they've already been at the table, then that's unfortunate."
During two hours of arguments yesterday in Justice Spodek's courtroom, a lawyer for the authority, Neil Abramson, said, "This is the last best chance that the parties have to stop this disaster."
But Mr. Schwartz argued that there was no need for an injunction because the workers had not yet decided to go on strike. He asserted that the judge should wait until a strike began before signing an injunction. Justice Spodek dismissed that idea, saying, "I don't feel like being awakened at 12:03 and asked to sign an order."
The city has filed a separate lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn seeking larger penalties, including a $1 million-per-day fine for the union, doubling every day thereafter, and a $25,000 fine for each worker, doubling each day. It is also seeking $5 million in damages to compensate the city for the money it has already spent preparing for the strike.
Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, said the city was not seeking an injunction of its own, which could bring the threat of additional contempt citations, but was instead satisfied to bring a regular lawsuit threatening huge penalities.
The union and the transportation authority held talks yesterday in the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, and everyone seemed to be trying to reduce tensions, which mushroomed on Thursday when Mr. Toussaint said the mayor should "shut up." The union leader, who was frustrated with the mayor's siding strongly with the M.T.A., made the remarks when asked about Mr. Bloomberg's announcement of the city's lawsuit.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the authority, in his most extensive comments about the talks, said, "The important thing now is for everyone not to engage in inflammatory rhetoric." He said both sides should "work as hard as they can, talk as much as they can, and do everything in their power to reach an agreement."
Mr. Pataki rejected the union's request that he come to the negotiating table with millions of dollars to help seal a deal. "There is not going to be any federal, state, local official riding in at the last minute on a white horse with a billion dollars to solve the contract," he said.
Echoing Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Pataki warned the union not to strike, saying it would have dire consequences and would betray New York's post-Sept. 11 spirit.
"It would also be a horrendous act of disloyalty to the people of New York at a critical time," he said. "We've seen New Yorkers pull together in the last year and a half in a way that is extraordinary. And to do this, to threaten to hold the people of New York City hostage, is simply wrong as well as illegal."
Mayor Bloomberg sought to play down Mr. Toussaint's attack. On his weekly radio program, he noted that New Yorkers often spoke bluntly, and ended by saying, "The governor, the M.T.A., Roger Toussaint and the mayor are all doing their best."
Trying to win more public support, the union began broadcasting a 30-second advertisement yesterday, saying transit workers were paid less than Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road workers, had unsafe jobs and deserved a fair contract.
In the ads, Mr. Toussaint says: "We don't want to strike. All we want is to work hard and to support our families."
One adviser to the union said that Local 100 was considering beginning the strike later than Monday, even if no contract was reached on Sunday. The thinking is that Monday could be used to keep the city off balance and to rally public support from other unions and the public. The transit workers and other unions have scheduled a rally at City Hall Park and a march across Brooklyn Bridge on Monday afternoon.
In contrast to previous rounds of negotiations, the union has dropped the slogan "No contract, no work."
With the union and M.T.A. saying little, it was hard to assess how bargaining was going. Earlier in the day, at a news conference at the Grand Hyatt, Mr. Dellaverson, the authority's negotiator, said, "We are making progress in important areas." At a separate news conference, Ed Watt, Local 100's secretary-treasurer, said, "We are disappointed in reporting there has been no progress."
Mr. Watt said the union was frustrated that 54 hours before the contract deadline, management was sticking to its original economic proposal, which called for a wage freeze in the first year and no definite raises in the second and third years. Any raises would be contingent on the union's agreeing to productivity increases. Management also wants the workers, whose salaries average $44,000 a year, to increase their pension payments by $1,000 a year and their out-of-pocket health payments by $500 a year.
The union, which originally demanded an 8 percent raise three years in a row, is now asking for raises of 6 percent each year.
To set an example on how to weather a transit shutdown, Mr. Bloomberg went to Gotham Bikes in Lower Manhattan and spent $663 to buy a Cannondale F-300 mountain bike equipped with 24 speeds, a bell, lights, a helmet and a lock.
On Thursday, Mr. Toussaint mocked all the mayor's bike talk as a "sideshow," and said the mayor should instead focus his energies on pressuring the authority to show more flexibility in bargaining.

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: VOTING RECORD; 
Lott Opposed Many Bills With Links To Civil Rights

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
In his 30 years in Congress, 16 in the House and the last 14 in the Senate, Trent Lott has voted consistently against measures that could be identified as civil rights legislation, and often he was one of a small number of lawmakers to vote that way.
 A review of his voting record shows, for example, that Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, opposed extension of the Voting Rights Act, expansion of fair-housing laws, establishment of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and payment of lawyers' fees to people who bring successful civil rights suits. 
 Last year, Mr. Lott was the only senator to vote against President Bush's nomination of Roger L. Gregory to be the first black judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. 
Over the years, he favored measures to outlaw busing for school desegregation, to extend a design patent owned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and to eliminate affirmative action in federal contracts.
On Wednesday, Mr. Lott's office put out a list of his legislative accomplishments in the areas of trade with Africa, economic development and community health.
The press release noted that Mr. Lott had sponsored Senate resolutions condemning the bombing of black churches and commemorating Juneteenth, June 19, a celebration of the emancipation of the slaves. "Under Lott's majority leadership," the release stated, Congress approved measures like a Congressional medal for Rosa Parks, a day of honor to recognize minority veterans of World War II and a resolution honoring Jackie Robinson.
Mr. Lott was majority leader from 1996 to 2001, and he has been elected by Republican senators to be majority leader again when the new Congress convenes next month.
In some instances, Mr. Lott's positions had widespread support in Congress. For example, his opposition to school busing was consistent with the position of a large majority of lawmakers, including such staunch Democrats as Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. 
But in many other cases, Mr. Lott stood as part of a small minority. Here are some examples:
*In 1975, at the beginning of his second term in the House, Mr. Lott voted against a seven-year extension of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark civil rights law meant to prevent racial discrimination in elections. The House voted, 341 to 70, to extend the law. In 1981, he voted against another extension, which was approved, 389 to 24.
*In 1976, he opposed allowing judges to award payments covering lawyers' fees to plaintiffs who brought successful civil rights suits. The measure passed by a vote of 262 to 108.
*In 1980 and 1988, he voted against legislation to allow the government to impose administrative penalties against people who practiced racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. The House passed the measure in 1980, 310 to 95, but it died in a Senate filibuster. In 1988, Mr. Lott favored a motion to kill the fair-housing measure, but the recommittal motion was defeated, 334 to 63. Mr. Lott then voted for the bill, which was approved, 376 to 23.
*In 1983, he voted against making Dr. King's birthday a holiday. The House passed the bill, 338 to 90.
*In the Senate, Mr. Lott supported measures in 1995 and 1998 that, had they been enacted, would have prohibited affirmative action programs in federal contracts like grants for highway construction.
*In 2000, he opposed a measure that made it easier for the federal government to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
In 2001, Mr. Lott was the only senator who voted against Judge Gregory's confirmation. Judge Gregory had been put on the bench by President Bill Clinton as a recess appointment while Congress was out of session. Shortly after President Bush took office, he nominated Judge Gregory for the seat.
Mr. Lott's spokesman, Ron Bonjean, said the senator had voted against confirmation to register a protest against the recess appointment of judges.
At the end of every Congress, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People publishes a "legislative report card" that grades lawmakers on the percentage of times they were in accordance with the association's position on selected votes. In nearly every year he has been in the Senate, Mr. Lott has been one of the lowest-ranked senators, if not the lowest.
Many of the votes selected by the association are not directly related to civil rights. For instance, Mr. Lott's vote in favor of the impeachment of President Clinton counted against him on the report card.

HEADLINE: How the East Was Won

 BODY:
 THE SHAMAN'S COAT
A Native History of Siberia.
By Anna Reid.
Illustrated. 226 pp. New York:
Walker & Company. $25.
 TOWARD the end of the 16th century, Siberia fell to the Russians as an unexpected prize. When this conquest and occupation began, European Russia stood deep in its own ashes after a half-century of war, famine, plague and despotic rule under Ivan the Terrible, Russia's first czar. Ivan's imperial ambitions had been thwarted to the west by Poland and Sweden and to the south by the Crimean Tatars backed by the Ottoman Turks. Russia then turned to the east, and within the space of a few generations acquired a territory larger than the Roman Empire.
In statistical terms, that territory covers five million square miles (about a twelfth of the total land surface of the globe) and stretches from the Arctic to Central Asia, the Urals to the Sea of Japan. Its mineral wealth makes it potentially the richest resource area on earth. But "not everything that counts can be counted," as Einstein once remarked, and after the geologist and the geographer have exhausted their estimation of its dimensions in numerical wonder, there remains its human heart. When the Russians first arrived, Siberia (like aboriginal America) already had a diverse life and culture of its own, and it is the idea of Anna Reid's captivating new book, "The Shaman's Coat: A Native History of Siberia," to explore the impact of the Russian conquest on that aboriginal culture's fate.
A former Kiev correspondent for the Economist and the Daily Telegraph, Reid is no ordinary journalist. As in her previous book, "Borderland: A Journey Through the History of the Ukraine," she sets out on her travels determined to bring the land of her reckoning alive. In this she is aided by her acute curiosity, fine descriptive gifts and delight in detail. The result is almost always to give us, in her own wry way, an indelible sense of place.
Consider, for example, her description of flying from Moscow to Tobolsk: "The in-flight movie . . . was 'Some Like It Hot,' accompanied by rye bread, cucumber and soapy mineral water, served on battered aluminum trays. The Tupolev's engines kept up a homely rumble, and the sun sparkled on the scratches on the windowpanes. As we came in to land, no bossy loudspeaker said to belt up or stow bags in overhead lockers, the unoccupied seats flopped forward in unison and a canteen of cutlery jingled down the center aisle. On the runway our baggage tumbled onto potholed tarmac awash with meltwater and the cawing of rooks."
Or, later, her impressions of a voyage in western Siberia: "The river Ob, wide, brown, meandering mightily among leafy islets, has cast a spell on our hydrofoil. On deck men in paint-spattered trousers . . . smoke in silence, shifting only to point out the rise of a fish or the current's churn past a tethered buoy. . . . When the engine cuts, sky and water tilt gently upward, silence washing over us like the floodwater drowning the willows on either bank. The trees part and a village drifts alongside, strung along a low scarp of soft brown earth. Then the cabins and fences spin away, and we are skimming again between mazy walls of green. It would be no surprise if parrots flashed out of them, or a hail of arrows."
Some part of Siberia's vanishing present will always be preserved by words that attend it with such care. But it is the plight of the indigenous peoples that is Reid's chief concern. Like other conquering powers, the Russians insisted on their colonial right to civilize the "savage" and make the wilderness their own. Ultimately, their way was cleared by slaughter, alcoholism and disease. Reid's account of her own journey -- part history, part travelogue, part excursion through the outback of Siberian lore -- more or less follows the progress of Russian domination eastward as the Khant, Buryat, Sakha, Ainu, Chukchi and other peoples are subdued.
It was not long before some of them were struggling simply to survive. In 1876, for example, there were said to be only about 1,600 Yukaghirs left, the pitiable remnant of a once-powerful tribe. Here and there, their ancient burial mounds could still be seen, containing skeletons with bows and arrows, spears and shamanistic drums, but the descendants of these mighty warriors had fallen into such indolence and addiction that their chief delight was a coarse Ukrainian tobacco stretched with dung.
Under the Soviets, the Yukaghirs and other small nomadic groups essentially disappeared. Stalin, in fact, distrusted all native peoples because they lacked an "industrial proletariat," the only class to which he could pretend to relate. But in the parsing of native life, the new categories did not apply. "The Small-Numbered Peoples," Reid explains, "possessed no exploiters and exploited in the Marxist sense. . . . Owning a hundred deer did not make a man a kulak; prospective sons-in-law working out their bride-prices were not hired laborers; a shaman was not the same thing as a priest." No matter: it was not the people but the categories that counted, and collectivization programs proved as devastating to Siberian natives as to peasants in Ukraine.
The history of their obliteration has since been obliterated -- the erasure of an erasure, so to speak. In St. Petersburg's State Russian Museum, we learn, "the sole evidence of the native Siberians' existence is an 18th-century ivory," while the vast collection housed by the Hermitage contains but a single "china figurine of an Itelmen girl, one of a series of 'national types' produced by the Imperial Porcelain Factory in the 1780's."
Forty years ago, it was still possible to find whole communities of the Khant, a west Siberian people, where their language was spoken. Today, only the elderly keep it alive. Though a somewhat primitive tongue (in that it lacks a capacity for abstraction), it is evocative and vivid, with a poetic particularity all its own. A photograph, for example, becomes by analogy "a pool of still water"; a hat, "a wide-crowned tree that keeps off the rain."
Losses of all kinds abound. At Goose Lake, once home to a thriving monastery, the author goes in search of the head lama and finds him "in a cabin in the temple grounds, hiding from his mother, girlfriend and infant sons behind a newspaper. The wall above his bed was decorated with 3-D posters, one of kittens in a basket, another of a table laid with Ben Nevis whiskey and tomatoes sliced to look like flowers." The shaman's true power and knowledge, in exaltation, belong to another book. Here we find it in its fall.

 THE EAGLE'S SHADOW
Why America Fascinates
and Infuriates the World.
By Mark Hertsgaard.
246 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
 THE image most of the world holds of America is not America. The glitz and sexual license portrayed by Hollywood, the opulence and inanity on television, the glamour and eroticism on MTV, the prurient fascination for the bizarre and violent on the nightly news and trash talk shows combine to present gross and perverted visions of American life. Many of those who hate and even love us judge us through the distorted prism of popular culture and our sometimes ham-handed and brutal blundering in the affairs of other nations. 
We are often, as Mark Hertsgaard writes in "The Eagle's Shadow," ignorant of how others view us. And because we see Palestinians wearing jeans or Czechs wolfing down Big Macs, we think that the great global village has brought us closer together. We think we understand each other. It is a dangerous misconception. 
Every foreign correspondent has had to listen to long-winded, convoluted conspiracy theories from ill-informed bureaucrats and out-of-touch intellectuals. These theories have in common one thing, the absolute conviction that Washington is obsessed with manipulating or destroying whatever country you happen to be visiting. For many of these regimes, including those of allies, America is the devil of choice to divert attention from homegrown repression and corruption. And sections of the Arab world, thanks to a rabidly anti-Semitic press, believe Israel, with the C.I.A.'s help, orchestrated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But such fantasies are endemic from Asia to Central America. 
Yet at the same time many of these people, even those that detest us, long to emigrate. This tension between envy and longing, the pull of fundamentalist religion and the enticing license of secular Western society, is one Hertsgaard interestingly sets up. The subtitle of his book is, after all, "Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World."+
"If America is as flawed as detractors say, if it is a self-centered, gluttonous bully with a racist past and a soul-less center," Hertsgaard asks, "why are millions of people from around the world willing to do nearly anything to immigrate here?" 
Sadly, his exploration of this question never gets far along. Hertsgaard gives us fleeting perceptions of the United States from a handful of foreigners. He clutters most of the book with cliched and sententious rants about the shallowness of American culture, the debacle that passed for our most recent presidential election and our backing of sordid little dictatorships around the world. Then, often within just a few pages, he will turn around, as if to save himself from accusations of being a self-hating American, and extol our virtues. The swing from moralistic excoriation to patriotic blurbs gives "The Eagle's Shadow" an aura of bizarre disconnect.
For example, Hertsgaard lambastes the American press as "a stenographer to power," our society as "wastefully rich" and our bodies as "testaments to bloat and sloth." Our foreign policy, he writes, is "shamelessly hypocritical, siding with treacherous dictatorships that serve our perceived interests and overthrowing real democracies that do not." Our political process is "a squalid yet boring spectacle conducted by and for the political elite in Washington, the media jackals who cover them and the wealthy interests who finance the whole thing." He even likens the bombing of Dresden during World War II to the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.
And yet, he writes: "I love America. As a journalist and writer, I feel blessed to live in the land of the First Amendment. I remain awed by the founding ideals of the United States; 225 years later, they survive as an inspiring prescription for, in Jefferson's majestic phrase, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
The book, in the end, is maddeningly thin. I have some sympathy for Hertsgaard's charges against the United States and for his view of how the rest of the world sees us, but I wish he had done the hard reporting to back them up. (Hertsgaard acknowledges that some of the material from abroad is taken from trips for other projects as far back as 1991, which can make it feel as if he is working with leftovers.) 
One essential problem is that even when Hertsgaard does give us the perspective of a foreigner (foreigners generally open the chapters, but that's about it), he tends to gravitate to people like himself. In France, for instance, he chats with newspaper editors in Paris rather than visiting the depressing industrial zones in the north where many of the four million bitter and disenchanted Muslim immigrants from North Africa live segregated from French society. Their voices, along with those of the slum dwellers outside Cairo or Lagos, are the ones we need to hear and the lives we must begin to understand, especially as they wrap themselves in holy rage. 
BUT the book's greatest weakness stems from Hertsgaard's quaint conviction that if we can see that we commit injustices in the pursuit of national self-interest and the accumulation of wealth -- to, for instance, keep our grip on the world's oil supply -- we will rectify those injustices. "Our country is strong enough to profit from a searching consideration of both its virtues and its vices," Hertsgaard writes, adding later, "I would plead ignorance rather than venality on behalf of my fellow Americans."
I for one suspect we do not look at the injustices because we do not want to look. Like many of the spoiled elites of history -- take the British Raj -- we prefer to think of ourselves as good and decent people while we use our military and economic prowess to ensure we bend the world to our will.
At the end of his book Hertsgaard asks, "If volcanoes can be beautiful as well as deadly, why can't America be wise as well as powerful, generous as well as rich, magnanimous as well as proud?" Here he captures the conundrum "The Eagle's Shadow" presents but never finally deals with. Wisdom, generosity and magnanimity, the values he wants us to embrace, do not sustain or expand empires. They destroy them.

 THAT OLD ACE
IN THE HOLE
By Annie Proulx.
361 pp. New York:
Scribner. $26.
 WHEN Bob Dollar's parents abandon him at the age of 8 on a doorstep in Denver, he has arrived at the threshold of two things: his Uncle Tam's junk shop and Annie Proulx's fourth novel. And, to be sure, "That Old Ace in the Hole" has a lot in common with the Used but Not Abused thrift store. The proprietor, Tambourine Bapp, and his partner, the marvelous grump Wayne (Bromo) Redpoll -- once thrown off a plane for his militant refusal to lower his window shade and ever at work on an essay entitled "This Land Is NOT Your Land" -- specialize in "Art Plastics," for which they have set aside a special chamber in their shop. The Art Plastics room contains such treasures as Bakelite radios and jewelry, but also, "on floor pedestals, as if sculptures . . . plastic washing-machine agitators, black and white." Bob's uncle explains that "one day . . . people will collect plastic objects from the 20th century as art, like now they are going after wooden grain cradles and windmill weights." For Proulx, it isn't odd bits of large appliances that cry out for a curator, it's the texture of working-class rural life.
Proulx wrote about New England farmers in her first novel, "Postcards," and about the residents of a Newfoundland fishing town in her Pulitzer Prize winner, "The Shipping News." Her short-story collection "Close Range" cast a cool eye on the rough lives of Westerners, mostly Wyoming cowboys and ranchers. In "That Old Ace in the Hole" she memorializes the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles: high, flat country where the prairie still lingers even though the grasslands have been harried by cattle, oil rigs and agribusiness for over 150 years. She has collected quite a pile of stuff -- history, economics, folkways and local lore -- to shoehorn into this novel, and the result is decidedly lumpy.
"That Old Ace in the Hole" starts out pleasantly enough, a nice ride through the rolling country of anecdote and eccentricity. The weather descriptions, though frequent, are brief, and there is hardly any geology -- one of the deadlier preoccupations of regional literature. Since she shifted her focus westward, Proulx's prose has lost the Anglo-Saxon knobbiness of "Postcards" and "The Shipping News," books with amputee sentences that read as if someone had attacked them with a cleaver, determined to chop off their subjects and verbs. Her style is now rangier and more discursive, as if delivered by someone leaning over a fence rail rather than by someone hurrying to get the wood chopped before the onset of nine months of snow. She still goes in for goofy names, but there are fewer that sound as if they belong to hobbits (Froggy Dibden, Mrs. Stinchcomb) and more that sound like the monikers of strippers or rodeo clowns (Babe Vanderslice, Harry Howdiboy and the truly inexcusable Francis Scott Keister).
To his chagrin, Bob Dollar reaches the age of 25 without any particular sense of what he wants to do with his life; this anxious vagueness is almost his only character trait. Having landed a job with the multinational Global Pork Rind corporation, he is sent down to the panhandles in a company car to scope out possible sites for factory hog farms. The locals, says his boss, Ribeye Cluke, "have been brainwashed by the Sierra Club to think that hog facilities are bad," so he needs to be "as circumspect as possible" about his true mission: befriending the neighborhood gossips and notables and looking for the "farmers whose kids went off to school and those kids are not coming back unless somebody puts a gun to their heads." Bob stumbles upon the town of Woolybucket, Tex., where he rents a rustic bunkhouse -- no running water or electricity -- from a talkative widow named LaVon Fronk, and he starts to poke around.
So far, it's an agreeable journey, but then, about 90 pages in, the novel hits a wide, dull stretch of potted history and exposition on topics like the Ogallala aquifer, pivot irrigators and the principal crops of the region (wheat seed, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts and cotton, if you were wondering). This is mostly conveyed by unconvincing dialogue and by Bob's letters to the home office, but there are also big chunks of it in raw form, sentences -- The flood of people came with the railroads, small farmers who believed that drought and wind could be overcome by hard work and the plow" -- that sound like the voice-over on an old educational film strip.
IT just so happens that LaVon Fronk is putting together a multivolume work she calls "The Woolybucket Rural Compendium" and therefore has heaps of historical documents in her house, as well as scads of regional legends stuffed in her head. In addition to this "faded panhandle Scheherazade," there's the gang down at the Old Dog Cafe, a passel of sound-alike ranchers ever ready to explain regional water policy: "Hell, we ain't like California where they got central irrigation and water co-ops." And then there's the Round Robin Baptist Bible Quilt Circle, ladies whose conversation about disastrously failed permanent waves, killer tornadoes and the evil doings at "abortion parlors" is a bit juicier. Despite his promisingly Dickensian upbringing, Bob is just a filament on which to string assorted tales of 10-mule freight wagons, lovesick cowboys, box socials and frontier voter fraud. He's an outsider and "a sucker for stories told" who will sit at the feet of the old-timers and plead for more.
The novel's acknowledgments suggest that Proulx once did much the same thing and came away smitten with the panhandles, the regional folklore and the operational details of such items as wind-powered water pumps. "That Old Ace in the Hole" is her paean to all that, a loving record of an evaporating way of life. The cause is worthy, but why she chose a novel for her vehicle instead of what the material seems to dictate, a nonfiction book about the people of the high plains and the author's travels among them, is another question. Why fiction, when the book's driving impulse is documentary in nature and when Proulx's heart really isn't in the long narrative of Bob Dollar and his implausible quest? (No one could believe for one minute that he'll end up helping to install a vile, polluting hog farm in Woolybucket.) She used a similar device in "The Shipping News," but, despite the slenderness of that novel's premise (a widower finding new love), it managed to carry the book. Decent, indecisive Bob can't do the same here.
It's not as if Proulx has lost her touch. When "That Old Ace in the Hole" occasionally slips into full-blooded fiction -- in chapters, for example, where Proulx describes the arrival of the first Fronk in the region or a farm wife's sudden, overwhelming lust for a cowhand -- it really comes alive. Any one of the dozens of yarns crammed into "That Old Ace in the Hole" would probably make a captivating novel or short story; it's Proulx's determination to jam all of them between the book's covers that bogs things down.
Then again, however unsung the panhandles may be, the tales told here -- of wayward cowpokes, stubborn ranchers, leather-tough women, temperamental horses, plagues of locusts, family farms devoured by nefarious conglomerates and creeping environmental threats -- are all pretty familiar. The really savory morsels in "That Old Ace in the Hole" aren't about the panhandles at all. There's a charming account of the Sunday night ritual of the proprietors of the Used but Not Abused thrift store, a rapt viewing of "Antiques Roadshow." And then there's Orlando Bunnel, Bob Dollar's school friend, an "evil fat boy" who introduces him to movies like "Rat Women" and "The Corpse Grinders" (the former zestily synopsized by Proulx). Orlando is sent to prison for hacking into the computers of the Colorado office of the United States Forest Service and diverting all its funds to a Nevada bordello, then gets rich while incarcerated by making a CD in which sample recordings of flatulence cover classic rock songs. ("We had one guy was a real star. Nothing he couldn't do -- basso profundo to coloratura, whistles and quavers, tremolo.") When Orlando materializes late in the book, trying to lure Bob off to Austin, it's clear that our hero is a better man for staying on and getting involved with preserving the native flora and fauna of the prairie. But you can't help wishing he'd taken that evil fat boy up on his offer.

 THE DINNER CLUB
How the Masters of the Internet Universe
Rode the Rise and Fall
of the Greatest Boom in History.
By Shannon Henry.
288 pp. New York: The Free Press. $26.
 AS a contributing factor in the 1990's technology-stock bubble, denial is underrated. Many of us now prefer to think of the entrepreneurs and the gurus who made such elaborate promises just a few years ago as a bunch of charlatans and crooks who set out to trick the world in a huge confidence game. Somehow this seems more satisfying than concluding that these people really believed what they were saying, and were simply dead wrong. The charlatan theory is attractive because it allows the rest of us to be victims; to accept that the peddlers of the sunniest version of the Internet dream were simply blinkered by their own fantasies is to admit that those who bought the dream were in denial, too. 
But denial must have been thick in the air in November 2000, when a Washington Post reporter named Shannon Henry began attending the dinner meetings of the Capital Investors. These 25 or so technology entrepreneurs from the Washington area had amassed huge fortunes, mostly in stock, and decided to form a sort of hybrid kaffeeklatsch and investment club. The gatherings would channel knowledge, contacts and money to the deserving next generation of start-ups and generally "create a force." Members included Steve Case, now the chairman of AOL Time Warner; Michael Saylor, C.E.O. of the software company MicroStrategy; Alex Mandl, the former president of AT&T; and John Sidgmore, an executive at WorldCom. 
Henry persuaded these "masters of the Internet universe," as her book's subtitle has it, to let her into the sanctum to record what happens when such minds meet. That November 2000 dinner coincided with the Florida chadmire that dragged out the end of the last presidential election, and we listen in as the gang pompously discusses how they would solve the problem. In general, they seem to believe that the country would be better off if it were run by one of their number.
Of course, there are guys at my neighborhood bar who reach a very similar conclusion every Friday night. In neither case is the discourse leading up to this epiphany very enlightening. The only thing that makes the high rollers' blather slightly more interesting is that by the time of this dinner, the turbocharged economy that had created them was already cracking up, a turn of events as obvious as the plunging Nasdaq, which had been bleeding for many months. Many of these men would soon be lucky to continue running their own companies, let alone the United States government.
According to Henry, the 1990's boom spawned "a new ideology" among the instantly wealthy -- they were "richer, younger and more idealistic than those who amassed wealth in the 1980's," and they craved the instant gratification of deploying their money "in ways that might change something, now." So at each Capital Investors dinner, a handful of young entrepreneurs would get a chance to make a pitch for money, assuming they had good enough answers as the titans quizzed them between courses. 
Reality set in somewhat belatedly over the course of the year that Henry attended these sessions. Probably the best scene in the book is an April 2001 dinner at the Georgetown Club, where a young man named Reggie Aggarwal, who had earlier wangled one capital injection from the group, strikes out in his attempt to get a second financial commitment. When he leaves the room one Capital Investor says, in so many words, "Reggie is full of it, isn't he?" Here's the moment when the denial finally lifted. All it lacks is someone else blurting, "My God, we all are!" 
This actually points to a big problem for "The Dinner Club": why should we care about these people? Henry writes that she "wanted to show that this technology boom and bust did not occur only in the confines of Silicon Valley." Since there's little substance to the dinner party scenes, we also get a thorough history of the Washington area tech community. There is a chapter on the Nextel co-founder Mark Warner's successful run for governor of Virginia. And there's a rehashing of the sorry tale of Saylor, the blowhard C.E.O. of MicroStrategy who is best known for comparing himself to Mother Teresa and for the massive collapse of his company's share price (from a high of $333 to about $1, as Henry mentions four times).
The biggest names in the group are Steve Case and Marc Andreessen, but neither of them seems to be around much during the period the book covers -- and actually Andreessen was only a temporary Washington area resident who soon headed back to the Valley. Late in the book we find that even one of the Capital Investors' principal architects has quietly moved to Cleveland, citing Washington's "pretentiousness." 
Along the way, Henry -- who according to this book's dust jacket is "widely labeled the 'dot-com diva' " -- is surprisingly nonjudgmental when the C.E.O. of Proxicom declares that one of the "lessons" he learned was that he was right to start selling his stock immediately. Or when the same guy complains that the managers of the company that bought his didn't give him the inside scoop about earnings problems before he bought several million dollars' worth of stock. ("Had he known about the missed earnings, he could have bought at another time," Henry writes dispassionately.) Or when Mandl, who failed to keep his telecom start-up from going bankrupt, says that next time around he plans to "control the board" and "regularly sell off shares."
As for the 18 new companies the group backed, several flamed out completely, and not one had produced any return on the group's investment by the end of 2001. This is hardly a surprise, since the Capital Investors seemed to think about their portfolio for no more than a few minutes a month. The group may have come together thinking they'd be world-changing Renaissance men -- one member jets to Colombia to lecture a rebel leader on the wonders of capitalism -- but they come across mostly as spoiled dilettantes. And surely no more than a footnote to the bigger story of the 1990's.
It's odd that the Capital Investors would have agreed to let a journalist in on what amounted to an ill-considered hobby in the closing months of 2000. But maybe it's even more odd that someone would want in when the action was so clearly moving in a different direction. Perhaps all concerned still figured that the club's members, against all odds, could "change something" while the new-economy idea crumbled around them. Talk about denial.

Intellectual Magnet Cities

BYLINE:  By Blaine Harden 

 BODY:
American cities used to become rich and important by attracting high-energy, low-skilled workers from abroad or from farm states. Now they do the same thing by luring brainy young people away from less livable American cities. Austin, San Francisco and Seattle are sparkling with newly arrived smarties who recently fled Cleveland, Harrisburg and St. Louis. 
 The 2000 census, which shows a clear correlation between a city's prosperity and its attractiveness to college graduates, suggests a new, winner-take-all pattern in urban growth. A handful of cities are quickly moving away from the pack in their ability to attract and retain workers with college degrees. In the top 100 metro areas, the 25 cities that began the 90's with the highest percentage of college graduates ended the decade with even more. The highfliers saw the educated share of their population jump by 6 percentage points -- twice the average growth of the other 75 cities. 
 Winning seems to feed on itself, as cities like San Francisco, Boston and San Diego have become more than just good places to find a high-paying job. They are cool places to hang out, with gourmet food, great live music and an abundance of well-spoken, well-dressed singles looking for sex and marriage.
Losing, too, feeds on itself. Cities like El Paso, Gary and Hartford are dreary places with diminishing night life and an acute shortage of upwardly mobile romantic prospects. The good catches with college degrees have high-tailed it to Raleigh-Durham or Denver. (It is hard for demographers to tweeze out patterns in huge cities like New York or L.A. They gain and lose millions of smart people in ways that do not lend themselves to easy analysis.)
There is a downside for the winner cities -- chronic inequality. Cities with the highest percentage of college graduates also tend to attract low-skill, low-wage newcomers to work in the yuppie service economy. They make coffee, mow lawns and mind babies, but have low salaries, poor benefits and little upward mobility. They also tend to be segregated, not by race but by income, from the highfliers they serve.
Yet there is no mistaking the dollar value of luring in ever-more-smart young things. The Austin American-Statesman, in an analysis of nine years of income-tax records, found that 10,000 more people moved to Austin from Dallas-Fort Worth than moved in the other direction. Those who came to ever-smarter Austin were better paid than those who left for Dallas. The result: an annual income gain for Austin of half a billion dollars. Blaine Harden

Forced Transparency

BYLINE:  By Blaine Harden 

 BODY:
In poor countries blessed with oil, revenue from oil has a way of making most people poorer. The pattern is so pervasive and has been going on for so long that it has a catchy slogan: the paradox of plenty.
 No place has been more paradoxical for more years than Angola. It is potentially the richest country in Africa, with huge reserves of offshore oil and a population of just 12 million. Oil money, though, has bought decades of war, while giving Angolans a terrible standard of living. Although the war ended this spring, it's still not clear where the money is going (or even how much there is). In the past five years, $4 billion has vanished; meanwhile, the world spends about $200 million a year to feed poor Angolans. To break this cycle, in Angola and elsewhere, a simple idea has emerged this year. It also has a catchy slogan: Publish What You Pay. 
 The World Bank backs the idea, as does George Soros, the financier and human rights crusader, as do 70 private aid agencies around the world. The Publish What You Pay coalition prods major companies to declare how much money they give governments in order to extract oil and minerals. If citizens know how much money comes in, they can, at the very least, figure out how much is stolen. Forcing transparency on corrupt governments would increase pressure on leaders to spend more on schools, hospitals and roads -- and might motivate citizens to toss out known thieves. 
Tony Blair, the British prime minister, gave the idea a boost this fall by calling on all companies involved in oil and mineral extraction to voluntarily announce how much they pay. But the Publish What You Pay coalition wants more. They want regulators of the world's richest stock markets, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, to compel oil companies to declare net annual payments to countries like Angola. None currently do.
Most oil-producing states hate this idea. And oil companies fear losing billion-dollar concessions to competitors that will keep their mouths shut. This is not an irrational fear. When BP announced last year that it would publish its payments to Angola, the government threatened to cut the company off unless it "scrupulously respects" confidentiality laws.
In all this, the Bush administration has been noticeable for not taking a leadership role. Forty percent of Angola's oil is exported to the United States. blaine hardend to cut the company off unless it "scrupulously respects" confidentiality laws.

Hybrid That Gets 239 M.P.G.

BYLINE:  By Stephen Mihm 

 BODY:
The You have to hand it to those hyperefficient Germans. While American auto manufacturers keep wailing about how devastating it would be if the government raised fuel-economy standards by one mile per gallon, the clever engineers at Volkswagen went ahead and unveiled a car this year that gets 239 m.p.g. 
 Think how a car that gets 239 m.p.g. would stack up against our much-beloved gas guzzlers in a hypothetical "race" between the VW and an S.U.V. that gets 15 m.p.g. Starting in New York City, each vehicle is given -- let's be generous here -- 50 gallons of fuel to make a cross-country trip. While the S.U.V. would grind to a stop outside not-so-beautiful Gary, Ind., the 239 m.p.g. car could go all the way to Los Angeles and then have enough to go back to New York, back to L.A. once more, back to New York yet again and still have enough left over to make it to Chicago. 
 The VW prototype, a sleek black two-seater with a single gull-wing door, looks like a cross between a Lamborghini and the Batmobile. It was built, in the understated words of one company spokesman, "to show how state-of-the-art technology can be used to reduce fuel consumption and still come up with a safe, usable and roadworthy vehicle." 
Several elements contribute to the car's performance. An ultraefficient diesel engine captures and stores energy when the driver hits the brakes, converting it to electricity that is then used to help propel the vehicle. The aerodynamic exterior cuts drag: wheels are sheathed in carbon fiber, and the car's designers dispensed with exterior mirrors, replacing them with tiny video cameras that display images on liquid-crystal screens on the dashboard. 
It also helps that the car is extraordinarily light. The engine weighs a mere 57 pounds, and a host of magnesium, titanium and aluminum components help keep the total mass down. But don't worry about safety. With its carbon-fiber composite exterior, crash tubes and air bags, the car has a safety rating equivalent to a racecar's. Though it may not go as fast as a Ferrari -- it cruises at 75 miles per hour -- it's fast enough for most drivers. Volkswagen doesn't currently have plans to mass-produce the vehicle, but it may harvest the car's innovative technologies for future versions of its more mainstream models. Stephen Mihm

Whitelisting

BYLINE:  By Marshall Sella 

 BODY:
The dream of e-mail has always been that of an open world. It was to be a revved-up cognate of the telephone and, hearkening to a simpler age, shouting across the village square. With a few keyboard strokes, Jimmy or Timmy in Brisbane, Australia, could easily shout out to another Jimmy or Timmy in Sandusky, Ohio. Those days, however, may soon be gone -- thanks to whitelisting, a new technology that allows users to keep bothersome strangers out of their e-mail in box. 
 The primary reason e-mail is becoming a closed system is spam, the dreaded electronic junk mail that floods in under the guise of deceptive subject headings like "Great seeing you last week" or "I found those pictures you wanted!" In recent years, spam has become an annoyance pandemic. The average Web user gets more than 2,000 unsolicited messages annually. Businesses, especially, have suffered. According to one study, managers spend 10 minutes of every hour being forced to read about low mortgage rates, how to increase the size of certain body parts and the like. These are hardly welcome new components of a well-oiled economy.
 Whitelisting technology helps you to filter out this chaff by permitting you to receive e-mail only from people and Internet vendors you specify. (The name is a play on blacklisting, in which people on a specified list are ostracized.) Most major e-mail providers now include some kind of filtering service. America Online, Microsoft and Yahoo!, for example, have incorporated whitelist guards into their systems -- with varying success. AOL itself has a five-option smorgasbord, which includes blocking just about everything or allowing only certain domain names (say, Amazon.com). But whitelisting in its purest form -- granting access solely to those whose exact addresses you know at this moment -- has proved to be a bit too black and white for most consumers. People don't want the spam, but they do want to hear from that old high-school sweetheart. 
 Efforts are now being made to gray things up a bit, to create technology that probes deeper, in order to avoid banishing as-yet-unknown e-mail messages you might actually want to read. An e-mail security firm called MessageLabs has enlisted heuristics technology, identifying what it calls "spam DNA" instead of going with the all-or-nothing approach. This is probably a good thing. E-mail may be the Wild West of communication -- a virtual seedy saloon -- but most of us like to have a drink once in a while. Marshall Sella

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-15-02: QUESTIONS FOR JEFFREY SACHS; 
Poor Man's Economist

BYLINE:  By Amy Barrett 

 BODY:
Q: This year you moved from the Center for International Development at Harvard to Columbia and started the Earth Institute, which is dedicated to the idea of sustainable development. What is that?
 Sustainable development means rising living standards for everybody in a way that's not going to destroy our ecosystems, cause mass extinctions and add to enormous problems in climate or water scarcity. The links between the physical environment and the economic environment are much more profound than economists have recognized. If they really want to get to the core of what's happening in Africa, they had better start understanding AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and nitrogen-depleted soil. These are important phenomena that help to explain why the poorest countries are not achieving economic progress. 
 That seems like common sense. Why do you even need the idea of sustainable development?
In academia, the scientists and the policy types rarely deal with one another directly, especially on problems of the poor. The idea of the Earth Institute is to focus not on the disciplines but on the problems and to bring together five main areas in an intensive dialogue: the earth sciences, ecological science, engineering, public health and the social sciences with a heavy dose of economics. 
The term sustainable development showed up in the 80's, and it wasn't very popular. Why not find another, more marketable, catch phrase?
I resisted the term also because a lot of people said what sustainable development means is that the rich have to cut their living standards sharply to make room for the poor. But my own analysis doesn't suggest that the reason that poor people are poor is that rich people are rich. I think rich people are rich because they have developed technology successfully to address a lot of challenges and because they were lucky enough not to have some of the ecological barriers that the poor have. 
But under the idea of sustainable development, won't Americans have to cut back on their consumption in some way in order to not deplete the planet?
We have to cut back on the amount of carbon that we are putting in the atmosphere, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to cut back on our living standards. If you develop technology that can capture the carbon, you can have your consumption and your climate too. 
At some point, though, won't we simply have to stop consuming so much?
Actually, one of the surprises of the last couple of centuries is that we are not running out of stuff. Almost every commodity has gone down significantly in price in the last hundred years. Stuff is not driving our economy. More and more of what we do is in bits and information services. 
You have said that a lot of your ideas came from experience on the ground in poor countries, rather than in the classroom. Are there a lot of theories in economics that just don't work when you go out into the world?
Or are completely irrelevant in a particular context, because what might be important in one place may be irrelevant in another place. Differential diagnosis is critical. You have to be open to the wide range of things that can go wrong in the world. 
Many economists are still very skeptical of the idea of sustainable development. How are you going to sell it?
I'm on my way to China this month to meet the Chinese leadership. In January, I'll be traveling to India. Yesterday, I was on video conference with a number of ministers of health from Latin America. 
So you are a global economic consultant.
Well, I call it an adviser, but yes, I've been doing that for a number of years. 
Columbia has given you an $8 million town house for the use of the Earth Institute. Is there a part of your new job that will be fun, giving dinner parties for dignitaries, maybe having Bono stop by? 
Of course. I adore the work I do with Bono. He's one of the great people on the planet. To have advised the pope, to be engaged with Kofi Annan -- I think our world's greatest political leader -- it's a joy beyond anything I could have hoped for. To have pulled out of the papal residence in a van with Bono and have the mobs chasing behind us, like in a Beatles movie -- it's fun, I have to say.
Did you feel like a rock star?
I leaned over to him, and I said, "Look, they always do that with macroeconomists." And he looked at me, like, "Yeah, right." Amy Barrett

An Anthem Frosted With Irony

BYLINE:  By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
THE first impression of "White Christmas" is motion. Leaning gently forward, unencumbered, each phrase is in perfect balance with the others, as if a hidden spring in one were propelling the words and music to the next. "White Christmas" travels light, unnecessary baggage stripped away.
 A Cole Porter song teases with double meanings. George Gershwin's "Our Love Is Here to Stay" enchants us with a Schubertian symmetry. Both men invite the ear to apply the brakes gently and to reflect on what has been heard. "White Christmas" is not like that. Irving Berlin may have been a man of large personal insecurities, but the best song he ever wrote shows no doubt and no need for second thoughts. 
 "White Christmas" -- as Jody Rosen's new book of the same name (from Scribner) tells us -- began life in 1937 with its tongue in cheek. The verse describes a poolside Christmas Eve in Los Angeles and the incongruities of a yuletide set at 80 degrees and dipped in chlorinated water; only after the introductory ironies does the famous chorus follow. After "White Christmas" became World War II's national anthem of American homesickness, when Bing Crosby's recording became as essential to G.I. battle gear as hand grenades and C rations, Berlin had the initial verse suppressed.It had already absented itself from "Holiday Inn," Crosby's snowbound movie of 1942, for obvious meteorological reasons, and from his recording of the same year.
Everyone, Berlin included, was staggered by the song's success and profitability. He had been writing hits since 1911 ("Alexander's Ragtime Band"), and 35 years later there was fertility enough to produce "Annie, Get Your Gun" on Broadway. Hundreds of successes in between had made him millions, but if Berlin had abandoned all other rights, he and his family could have lived in wild luxury on the returns of one song alone. Mr. Rosen reports that the Crosby version has sold 31 million copies.
"White Christmas," of course, traffics in nostalgia. It is the singer standing in one time and place thinking about another time and place. That second time and place never existed, at least in the terms in which it is remembered. Berlin was an immigrant Jew from Siberia, writing about a Christian celebration foreign to his past. The Christmas of "White Christmas" is about snow and sleigh bells, not the birth of the son of God in a heat-drenched and dusty Middle Eastern town.
The contradictions more or less put Berlin's Christmas on an equal footing with that of his gentile fellow Americans. Indeed, the present-day merger of rural New England winter by way of Currier & Ives with Dickensian urban scenes reminds us that Christmas is a newer religion's superimposition of itself on a midwinter feast that reaches much farther back in history than the glad tidings reported from Bethlehem 2,000 years ago. The music and rituals of Christmases past have become delightful and touching ornaments, but the season's enormous economic engine of productivity and sales makes the heathen aspect of Dec. 25 a little overpowering next to its more recent worshipful side.
"White Christmas" is melancholy but straightforward, submerging its minor-key deviousness until we forget that it is there. The beginning is a swirl of clustered half-steps. The 18th century called this kind of gesture a "turn" and wrote it as an S turned on its side. Mr. Rosen's book has nice descriptions of Berlin's musical secrets, including the long, unexpected held note on the word "bright," and the brief final phrase that rights and restores an equilibrium suddenly under threat.
There is nothing bitter in the melancholy of "White Christmas." Its wistfulness may not be profound, but the grace of its shape and movement is another story. Educated on the mean streets of turn-of-the-20th-century popular music, Berlin wrote songs for sale. To bring in money, they had to reach out unequivocally to as many people as possible. Berlin was "a public songwriter," Mr. Rosen tells us. He once said: "A good song embodies the feeling of the mob. A songwriter is not much more than a mirror which reflects those feelings."
There are two paths to musical immortality. One leads to a Valhalla peopled by Beethoven and the like. The other penetrates the collective consciousness of ordinary people.
How many intelligent listeners still believe that Dvorak plucked "Goin' Home" from folklore and inserted it in his "New World" Symphony? Actually, it was the other way around. Germany's famous national anthem, "Deutschland Uber Alles," is not the traditional public artifact it is often believed to be but music by Haydn, laboriously fashioned (as we know from a pile of rejected sketches) in his "Emperor" String Quartet. Put four Austrians and as many liters of wine together, and by the end of the evening you will hear "Der Lindenbaum," sung by men unaware that they are in the midst of a Schubert art song. Grieg's music created a Norwegian folk heritage out of thin air. Solitary composers have manufactured a lot of music since taken over by the public and submerged into everyday usage.
Today "White Christmas" doesn't seem to be by anybody. It's too much ours. It initially prospered among a military audience sweltering on Guadalcanal or frozen in bombed-out Belgian towns, but opportunism does not account for the song's immediate and unshakable place in everyone's heart. "White Christmas" speaks with great beauty to everyone. Berlin himself called it "the greatest song anybody ever wrote." A hard sell, perhaps, but with high-quality goods.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.; 
Plants That Block a Terrace View

 BODY:
 Q. We are shareholders who live on the top floor of a nine-story co-op. Each unit on our floor has sliding glass doors to an undivided terrace. There are no permanent physical structures that note the boundary lines of each shareholder's part of the terrace, but we have marked our lines on both sides with low rectangular flower pots. 
 Just recently, our neighbor to the right placed huge planters with four- to five-foot bushy shrubs along his terrace boundary line. Now, when we sit in our living room, we can no longer see the view of Manhattan and New York Harbor. Are there any regulations about impairing a shareholder's view in a co-op? . . . Leroy Smith, Staten Island.

A. Richard Klein, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that he is not aware of any state or city regulations governing the height of plants placed on terraces.
And, Mr. Klein said, there is nothing in state or city law that makes it unlawful for one property owner to block another property owner's views, provided the first property owner is not violating any building or zoning regulations.
"Being that this is a co-op, however," Mr. Klein said, "the corporation's proprietary lease and house rules would be the first place to look to see if the corporation has imposed any restrictions." Many proprietary leases, he said, contain a provision prohibiting any "planting, fences, structures or lattices" on the terraces, balconies or roof of the building without the prior written approval of the co-op.
While the house rules of many co-ops also contain certain restrictions and conditions regarding planting on terraces and balconies -- such as making sure that the plantings are standing on supports at least two inches above the surface -- he has never seen a rule restricting the height of the plants. 
Mr. Klein said that if there are no lease or house rules regarding blocking shareholders' views by planting on terraces, the letter writer could petition the board to come up with some kind of policy that will allow the shareholders to have plantings while not interfering with other shareholders' views. 
"I would suggest that Mr. Smith speak to his neighbor to see if they can work something out," Mr. Klein said. "It is possible that the neighbor might not even be aware that he is obstructing Mr. Smith's view."

A Rent Increase For a Renovation

Q. My landlord recently renovated all the bathrooms in my building and is seeking a large rent increase from the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The quality of many of the new fixtures is inferior to the original equipment. The bathtubs are smaller, shallower and cheaply made, and the bathroom doors and frames are quite flimsy. Is there any law requiring landlords to replace items with fixtures of equal quality? . . . Tim Smith, Manhattan.

A. Joel E. Abramson, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said it appears that the letter writer is referring to a major-capital-improvement increase the landlord has requested for renovating all the bathrooms in the building.
While the law that allows such increases does not specifically address the quality of the fixtures used in a renovation, Mr. Abramson said, it does require the landlord to improve the building and it does give tenants an opportunity to submit objections to the landlord's application. 
He said that the tenants have 30 days from the time the state agency notifies them of the landlord's application to inform the agency of their concerns. The agency will then take those concerns into consideration in deciding whether the increase is warranted. 
For such a buildingwide increase, a landlord is allowed to raise the total monthly rent in the building by 1/84th of the cost of the improvements. An individual tenant's share of the increase is pro rated on a per-room basis.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS; 
Climate Jumping

BYLINE:  By William Speed Weed 

 BODY:
On April 3, the high temperature in New York City was a balmy 77 degrees -- a full 17 degrees warmer than the previous day. New Yorkers were delighted; many wore shorts. But what if the earth's whole climate system were to snap warm like that? It would be anything but delightful. Imagine the global temperature spiking 17 degrees in a decade. Enough polar ice could melt to cause oceans to surge over New York, Amsterdam and Bangladesh faster than people could build dikes or relocate to higher ground. A global warming snap could wreak havoc on regional weather patterns: rain forests would dry up, tundras would melt. Imagine a centuries-long, Sahara-hot drought setting upon the West Coast and withering crops (and Californians). 
 This dire situation bears little resemblance to the global-warming picture, currently in vogue among policy makers, of a slow, steady warming that creeps along imperceptibly year by year. This picture is dead wrong, according to a National Academy of Sciences study published this year. Climate change often isn't gradual. It's sudden and ferocious. When it happens, we won't have time to adjust. 
 The report, "Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises," collates a mass of geological evidence showing that the earth's climate system is a jumpy beast: long, dormant spells are overturned suddenly by drastic events. Instead of smoothly transitioning over 10,000 years from ice age to warm era, the earth jumps from one "regime" to another in just a few years. For instance, 11,500-year-old ice cores taken from Greenland show that annual precipitation doubled in three years and that the annual mean temperature jumped 14 degrees in just 10 years. "That means a third to half of the warming that took place between the last ice age and today all happened in one decade," says Richard Alley, the Penn State geologist who presided over the study. Two dozen such climate jumps have occurred in the last 100,000 years.
As for what causes abrupt climate change, Alley says that "nobody know what the triggers are." Does that let us off the hook with greenhouse gas emissions? Not at all. "The climate has changed most drastically when something was forcing it, like a change in the earth's orbit around the sun," says Alley. "Our emissions today are definitely forcing the climate." William Nordhaus, a Yale economist who also worked on the report, says that the impact of gradual global warming would be relatively modest. But the "abrupt stuff is more dangerous," he says. "What we're triggering is in a sense irreversible. . . . If we flip into that mode, it may be like that for 5,000 years." William Speed Weed

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN IDEAS; 
Coming-Of-Age-In-Eastern-Europe Novel, The

BYLINE:  By Taylor Antrim 

 BODY:
Among the year's best novels, a trio of debuts -- Gary Shteyngart's "Russian Debutante's Handbook," Arthur Phillips's "Prague" and John Beckman's "Winter Zoo" -- all shared the same basic plot: young man graduates from college circa 1990, undergoes crisis and rushes into the warm embrace of Eastern Europe. Readers who themselves hit Prague, Budapest or Cracow in the early 90's winced in self-recognition. But for Shteyngart, Phillips and Beckman, post-Communist Eastern Europe isn't just a hipster destination; it's a free market in the raw, a playground for Americans on the make. Their heroes establish a model of self-becoming that should pain those anxiously mining today's Wall Street for gold. 
 Another Eastern European pilgrimage novel this year, Jonathan Safran Foer's "Everything Is Illuminated," gave us a young man's search for his ancestral roots. That's a more traditional literary mode of self-discovery; so is sex or drink or a general questioning of authority, either on the road ("On the Road"), in or out of school ("The Catcher in the Rye," "The Rachel Papers") or in a racy, cosmopolitan milieu ("Less Than Zero," "Bright Lights, Big City"). While there is plenty of sex and drink in Shteyngart, Phillips and Beckman, it's the financial exploitation, investment land grabs and Ponzi schemes that really drive these stories along. 
 Take Shteyngart's Vladimir Girshkin, born in the Soviet Union, educated at a Midwestern college, bewildered and, as he puts it, "half-formed" in 1993 Manhattan. He escapes to the fictional Eastern European capital of Prava and, through a phony investment scheme, begins fleecing its young, moneyed expatriates with self-actualizing zeal. "To be rich in my own milieu," he says, "to partake in the economic rebirth of my own part of the world, why if that's not part of my narrative, what the hell is?" Likewise Charles Gabor of "Prague" (which actually takes place in Budapest) teams up with a fellow ex-pat, John Price, to privatize a small press run by a Hungarian family and sell it off to a global media conglomerate. Back home, Gabor and Price would be feckless Americans; in Budapest, they're coming-of-age capitalists, intent on self-determination and a slice of the free-market pie. Then there's Beckman's Gurney. During the fall of 1990, he struggles (with meager success) to bed all the American women in Cracow. After scamming a fortune from a Western-backed casino, he stages an orgy in which his friends dub him Midas and kowtow, unclothed, at his feet. His thoughts run a mantra: "Currency, currency, currency. . . ."
Wit, irony and some irrepressibly likable protagonists save these novels from sanctioning the superficiality they describe. Still, in a headline year of corporate fraud, the books remind us just how strongly we've come to identify economic entitlement with national identity. Getting something for nothing: it's how Americans grow up. Taylor Antrim

Pokemon Hegemon

BYLINE:  By Margaret Talbot 

 BODY:
If you are the parent of an American child, then you may well have noticed how Japanese our kid culture has become. No set of images has dominated childish desires quite so handily over the last five years or so as the amalgams of cuteness and power in the Japanese-made cartoons (and their many product spinoffs): Pokemon, Digimon, DragonBall Z, Sailor Moon, Hamtaro and, most recently, Yu-Gi-Oh. It's enough to make Disney envious. 
 The spike-haired, doe-eyed girls and boys and sweetly pugilistic animal familiars of anime and manga are conventions of American childhood now. (And not just American childhood: the "Pokemon" cartoon series is broadcast in 65 countries around the world.) Japanese manufacturers rule the growing market for home video games, one that reaches into older demographics and rivals movie box-office sales in the United States. Hello Kitty and some of the other critters from the candy-toned dream world of Sanrio not only enjoy a terrific "awww" factor, they also have brand recognition to spare. (The Sanrio Web site lists 420 stores in California alone where its products are sold.) And while in the 1980's, Kitty products were customized for national markets -- research revealed that Americans didn't like snails as sidekicks and did like purple and pink -- Sanrio now markets the same products everywhere, having realized that Kitty's Japaneseness is a part of her appeal. 
 So has Japan become a cultural superpower -- an exporter of fashions, trends, gizmos, buzz and values -- just like the United States? That's what Douglas McGray argues in a lively article, "Japan's Gross National Cool," which appeared in the journal Foreign Policy earlier this year. Though a decade-long recession has robbed Japan of its economic power, the country has "far greater cultural influence now than it did in the 1980's," McGray observes, in areas ranging from "pop music to consumer electronics, architecture to fashion and food to art." And its accession to what McGray calls Pokemon hegemon suggests that economic and cultural prowess are not as straightforwardly linked as we might think. To be a cultural superpower, a country needs something more specific, it seems: a youth market with consumer clout. And Japan, like America, most definitely has one. 
Japan's "national cool," McGray argues, is a form of what the Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye calls "soft power" -- the nonmilitary, nonpolitical means by which a country can influence another country's values or it citizens' wants. And though, so far, Japan's media exports don't convey an obvious or coherent set of values -- akin to the capitalist individualism that American pop culture tends to package, for example -- they might, if Japan's culture-makers wake up to the consequences of their global reach. After all, Japanese pop culture already has certain aesthetic hallmarks: techno-obsession, warp-speed trend cycles and infatuation with childhood. Hello Kitty, hello world. Margaret Talbot

Housing Growth Is Strongest in Eastern Part of State

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WITH thousands of new jobs created in the casino, pharmaceutical and military industries over the last few years, eastern Connecticut's housing market has shown some of the strongest growth in the state.
 Thomas R. Switz, owner of Switz Real Estate Associates in Mystic and president of the Eastern Connecticut Association of Realtors, said median house prices rose 18 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with a year earlier and 14 percent in the third quarter. 
 "You're going to see that slow down, I'm sure, because the market can't sustain it -- wages aren't going up that fast," Mr. Switz said. "There's no way we can continue to run up at 14 to 18 percent." 
Connecticut's two easternmost counties led the state in percentage gains of new housing in the first half of the year as well, according to the state Department of Economic and Community Development. Towns in New London County reported issuing permits for 451 units of new housing in January through June, up 26 percent from 358 units in the first half of 2001. Windham County reported an increase of almost 30 percent, to 246 units from 190. Other counties had gains of 6 to 17 percent, except for Fairfield, where permits fell 22 percent.
William R. Sweeney, the city planner in Norwich in New London County, said his office had approved plans for 400 condominium units in the last 18 months, and it has almost that many more under consideration. "It's really happened in the last year and a half, that we've really seen the housing market explode," Mr. Sweeney said.
Mr. Sweeney said Norwich was trying to promote the development of higher-priced homes, because 18 percent of the city's housing stock is at a price level that qualifies under state guidelines as affordable for low-income families.
"We're basically carrying the burden of affordable housing for the region, and we need to be aggressive about building up the rest of the market," Mr. Sweeney said. "This sort of situation, where there is demand across the spectrum of the housing market, has made it possible for us to push the high end of the market."
Nicholas H. Mullane II, president of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, said 24,000 new jobs at the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos are driving the lower- to middle-income part of the market. Other parts of the tourism industry have also been adding workers. "Every rental apartment and room in the region is gone," Mr. Mullane said.
But there is also a shortage of housing at the upper end of the market, thanks to more than 3,000 jobs added by Pfizer in the last few years with construction of a new research campus in New London and expansion of its existing complex in Groton. In addition, Electric Boat, which builds submarines in Groton, has added several hundred new jobs in the last year.
THE council released a report this year that said in the five-year period ending in 2005, southern Connecticut will have to add as many as 5,100 housing units, about twice the rate of the previous decade. 
But Richard B. Erickson, a planner who completed a study of the southeastern Connecticut housing market for the council this year, said the growth in employment is not the only explanation for the sharp increase in demand.
"I identified five major factors that are affecting housing demand, housing supply and housing cost," he said. Single-person households, for instance, grew at a pace of 22 percent in the last decade, while the total population grew at just 1 percent. This trend has quickened demand for housing.
Restrictive local zoning policies, limited public sewers and water, a shortage of trades workers and a lack of available land for housing are other reasons that have crimped the housing supply, according to his 135-page analysis.
"I think the tendency is to view it simplistically, but if you really start digging into it, you realize this is a very complex situation," Mr. Erickson said. "There's not a single factor causing the housing shortage, and no one thing is going to come close to meeting the needs of housing in the region."
Mr. Erickson's study also asserted that despite the need, "public attitudes do not support the development of new housing," and several housing projects that have been proposed in recent months have faced significant opposition, including a complex of 172 one- and two-bedroom condominium and rental units on Route 82 in Norwich, planned by Cherenzia Excavation of Westerly, R.I. "If the area needs housing, people shouldn't think it all has to be in single-family subdivisions," said Thomas J. Ligouri, general counsel for Cherenzia. The company is finishing a 45-lot subdivision in Mystic and a 22-lot subdivision in Stonington.
"Because of the time and money it takes to meet all the municipal standards, the cost of the infrastructure and delays in the permitting process, only the big companies can afford to go through the process," Mr. Ligouri said. "The little builders are being squeezed right out of the market."
The Council of Governments has established a special commission on housing to examine the issue, headed by James P. Cronin, president of the Dime Savings Bank in Norwich, which has branches throughout the region and this year established a program it calls Champ, for Creating Housing -- Affordable Mortgage Program.
Under the program, experienced landlords can borrow up to 90 percent of the cost to purchase and renovate a multifamily unit, at 6 percent interest, a rate Mr. Cronin characterizes as particularly attractive. "It's so below market we don't expect to make any money on the program; we're only hoping not to lose money on it," he said. "The object here is to get these buildings rehabilitated and occupied and get the cash flow going to pay off their taxes and their mortgages."
The only restriction is that the landlord has to hold the property for at least 10 years. "We didn't want to have people flipping the properties, trying to get in and get out with a quick profit," Mr. Cronin said. "It's seen as a way to get landlords to invest in the community."
So far, the bank has backed renovations that provide 38 updated units of housing in different towns around the region, the largest being an eight-family apartment building in the Occum section of Norwich that is being rebuilt to house 12 families.
"It's been a neighborhood eyesore for a long period of time, and now it's going to be occupied by low- to moderate-income families," Mr. Cronin said. "We have a critical shortage of housing in the area, and as that became more and more evident -- and the government programs are doing as much as they can -- we decided it was time we as the private sector step forward and do something."
Norwich, because of its proximity to the two casinos, has been the area developers seem to have focused on early. 
Sofee T. Noblick, owner of Noblick Properties, which offers rental apartments, and president of the Norwich Property Owners Association, said about one-third of her tenants are casino employees, which is close to the average for the region. The increased demand, she said, has helped to combat urban blight.
"The rents have come up by at least a third in the last couple of years, which allows developers to put money into renovations," Mrs. Noblick said. A two-bedroom unit in the area will now bring anywhere from $700 to $1,200, she estimated, and a two-family house that might have sold for $50,000 two years ago will now bring $100,000.
BUT the small towns in the region say the new development in the area has been a mixed blessing. Peter F. Sielman, first selectman in Salem, a rural town northwest of New London, said Pfizer employees and their families now make up about 10 percent of the town's population. "They're great neighbors and get very involved in the town," Mr. Sielman said. "But if a family moves into town with two school-age children and the value of their house is less than $600,000, it costs the town more than we can collect in taxes."
Mr. Mullane, the president of the Council of Governments, said that because towns rely so heavily on the property tax to pay for schools, roads and any other services, towns would rather encourage commercial or industrial development, which pays more in taxes than it consumes in services.
"This area is creating some good argument in favor of tax reform," Mr. Mullane said. "What we call town roads, for instance, are really public roads, and especially those towns around the casino are seeing an enormous increase in traffic."
"I don't think we can focus on affordable or senior or assisted living or top-end housing -- we need to look at providing a broad range of housing," Mr. Mullane said. "It's going to take a bit more study to determine who had the best ideas, the best location, the best areas to build, the best housing grants to help out, and then broadly spread across the region. You don't want to have an unfair impact in any one community."
"We have to be looking at a wide variety of projects," Mr. Mullane said. "We can't close our mind to any kind of housing. All of them will contribute to a solution."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Officials Are Selling County and Town Real Estate

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
TWO of Long Island's largest governments are preparing to sell off some of their real estate and consolidate some offices. Nassau County is examining its extensive inventory of property as part of a wide-ranging effort to deal with a staggering budget deficit. And Brookhaven, a Suffolk County town that is larger in area than all of Nassau, is moving to centralize its operations and reduce operating costs in the process.
 The two governments have determined not only that they have more property than is ideal but also that in some cases offices are not situated in the most convenient places for many residents. This haphazardness reflects the explosive growth of Nassau since the middle of the 20th century and of Brookhaven over the past 25 years. 
 The efforts also reflect the fact that government officials seem to be paying more attention to real estate than they used to. "They are now thinking more like a private enterprise and trying to realize untapped value in their holdings and improve space efficiencies," said Martin L. Lomazow, senior managing director for Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company, which was hired as the exclusive broker for both the Brookhaven and Nassau consolidation projects. 
When Thomas R. Suozzi took office as Nassau County executive in January with a pressing need to deal with a projected budget deficit of $428 million over the next four years, he discovered there was no inventory of its properties.
"The problem resulted from the tremendous growth the county experienced over the past 50 years," Mr. Suozzi said. Nassau, which covers 298 square miles, grew from 400,000 people in 1940 to 1.3 million at present. "Explosive growth continued with government programs in the 1960's and 1970's, causing the county to either buy new, or rent, buildings." 
One of the first things he did was to hire the county's first real estate director, Sheldon L. Cohen, a lawyer who had spent 20 years as vice president of facilities and services at MetLife in Manhattan. 
In the first phase of the consolidation process, an inventory revealed that the county owned 2,500 properties, including 764 buildings that it occupies and 1,340 vacant parcels ranging from a one-square-foot piece of road to 138 acres of a 207-acre 4-H camp in eastern Suffolk, Mr. Cohen said. 
"We are now trying to get a handle on the properties, find out which ones are overlapping and determine which are surplus," said Richard Karson, a member of a 10-member Insignia team that is helping to develop Nassau's plan. 
Eventually, up to 20 buildings and dozens of small parcels may be sold and put back on the tax rolls, Mr. Suozzi said.
HE added that a six-member nonpartisan advisory panel had been set up to review the disposition of surplus properties and screen buyers to ensure there is no conflict of interest or political favoritism.
"Our goal is to take the county operations and consolidate them into five campuses: police, jail, courts, health and human services and the rest of the county offices," he explained. "The best example is health and human services, which has eight departments in different locations. We want them all in the same place so they can share administrative costs and be more accessible to the public."
Many agencies were found to be in rented buildings rather than in those that the county owned. Since January, $1 million has been saved by moving approximately 40 offices out of leased buildings into county-owned buildings, Mr. Cohen said. 
The first to move was the purchasing department, which had been paying an annual rent of $360,000 in a building it had used for 20 years surrounded by numerous county-owned buildings along Old Country Road in Mineola, the county seat. 
The financial advantages of moving from leased space to county-owned buildings may not, however, be a given. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said that in some cases there may be financial advantages in continuing to lease buildings. "They'll have to look closely into rental spaces, because with health or social services it could be an economic gain to lease," he said. "Those departments, if not located in a government building, would be reimbursed by the state for 50 percent of the cost to lease and maintain."
While plans for most properties are still being studied, Mr. Suozzi said, there are "some definites."
The jail in East Meadow and seven courthouses in Mineola will remain. Two are historic properties: the 134,400-square-foot 102-year-old original County Courthouse and the 73-year-old 273,600-square-foot current County Courthouse.
A two-story 18,393-square-foot Mineola building that houses the consumer affairs and human rights departments will be sold for approximately $2 million.
Two buildings and a 105-acre vacant parcel in Bethpage, which were part of the Grumman plant where aerospace products were manufactured, were deeded to the county by the United States Navy this week. A 19,560-square-foot building will be sold and a 660,000-square-foot building, where the lunar module was manufactured, is being considered for use by the public safety department.
The revenue from the sale of surplus county buildings will be applied to the renovation of existing buildings, Mr. Cohen said.
THE preliminary Nassau consolidation plan is expected to be released for public comment by the end of January. Once it is approved by the county executive, it will be sent to the County Legislature for a vote. 
"The obvious things have been done already," Mr. Suozzi said. "The big things will take off, we hope, by mid-2003."
Fifteen miles to the east, in the 347-year-old town of Brookhaven, the major focus of a consolidation plan is the $21 million purchase of a 221,000-square-foot office building -- currently owned by Allstate. Centralizing operations in that building is expected to save the town a quarter of a million dollars in operating expenses annually, according to John Jay LaValle, Brookhaven's supervisor. 
The three-story building is on 42 acres in Farmingville, centrally located in the 324-square-mile town, which has 448,519 residents. It is two miles north of a 150,000-square-foot complex of 10 buildings on 15 acres in Medford, which has housed most town offices for the past 15 years.
Thirteen tenants, including a delicatessen and a dentist, currently lease 38,000 square feet at the complex, paying annual rents ranging from $11.41 to $18.49 per square foot. 
THE tax receiver's office is in the village of Port Jefferson on the North Shore, and the town clerk is in a building that Brookhaven leases for $1 a year from the village of Patchogue on the South Shore. The Highway and Parks Department is in Coram. 
"Historically, the town offices had been in Patchogue," Dr. Koppelman said. "Forty years ago, it didn't matter. Most of the population was there. But in the last 25 years the population has moved to the center of the town and eastward."
In consolidating, the town will divest itself of three of the four properties and move all departments -- with the exception of the Coram facility -- to the Allstate building. 
The 9,000-square-foot Port Jefferson building will be sold, and the 12,000-square-foot Patchogue building will revert back to the village. 
Bidding for the Medford complex closed this week. Proceeds from the sale, which town officials hope will be about $10 million, will be used to pay off the remaining $9 million debt on the property. 
An adjacent one-and-a-half-acre vacant parcel, appraised at $295,000, may be sold separately, Mr. LaValle said. It was purchased last year for $235,000 before the town decided to sell the complex.
The three buildings cost $2.4 million a year to operate. It is estimated that the Allstate building will cost $2.1 million a year for debt service and operating costs. Under a five-year lease, Allstate will continue to occupy about 50,000 square feet on the second floor at an annual cost of $24.50 a square foot.
The 24-year-old building, which was renovated in the late 90's, is in "pristine condition," and because it already has high-technology wiring will bring the town "up to speed technologically," an undertaking that would have cost more than $1 million to accomplish in existing offices, Mr. LaValle said. The town hopes to close on the building by Jan. 1 and move in by August.

Struggling to Get Doctors' Attention

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
LAST month, about 15 executives and sales representatives from Vasomedicalin Westbury flew to Chicago for the annual American Heart Association meeting at McCormick Place. More than 25,000 cardiologists and other medical professionals attend the event each year, and Vaso, as the company is called, always makes it a point to be there.
 The company looks for every chance it can get to bring its product, a computerized blood pump, to the attention of cardiologists, hospital procurement officers and others who make or influence decisions about cardiac treatment. Vaso has sold about 600 pumps since the device was introduced in 1995 and believes that it can sell many more. 
 The catch is that in a market that considers high-tech synonymous with efficacy, Vaso manufactures a product that might be assembled for a high school science fair. Known as the Model TS-3 Enhanced External Counterpulsation System, the device pumps blood to the heart by inflating a series of cuffs strapped to the patient's legs. A computer monitors the heart, and while it pauses between beats, the cuffs pump blood upward, from the legs to the trunk. 
The concept of enhanced external counterpulsation is based on research initially done at Harvard half a century ago and advanced in China during the 1970's after American researchers lost interest. About 15 years ago, a small group of investors, most of them with backgrounds at midsize companies that made medical devices, acquired the patents to the technology and founded Vaso's predecessor. In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration approved the technology for the treatment of angina.
Last June, the F.D.A. approved enhanced external counterpulsation for the treatment of congestive heart failure, positioning Vaso to compete in a $40-billion-a-year market. In a much narrower field last year, the company recorded revenues of $27.5 million. 
"This development opens a vast and exciting market opportunity for us, years ahead of our most optimistic projections," said D. Michael Deignan, the company's president and chief executive at the time of the F.D.A. announcement. "We believe this noninvasive, cost-effective therapy will provoke a paradigm shift in the way cardiovascular diseases come to be treated."
Paradoxically, just two months later, on Aug. 31, the company ended its fiscal first quarter in a river of red ink, losing $4.2 million. The performance was disappointing, given the F.D.A. news and the company's growth in the previous year, when revenues doubled. On Oct. 22, Mr. Deignan resigned but continues as a consultant; he did not return a phone call seeking comment.
As for the "paradigm shift" he had so enthusiastically envisioned, that, too, has become a casualty, at least in the short term, of the realities of health-care economics and the intensity with which physicians guard their sources of revenue.
Photios T. Paulson, 63, a longtime Vaso director with years of experience running midsize medical companies, has become the company's new chief executive. "My priority as C.E.O. will be to build and execute a more effective business strategy, and consequently, our marketing efforts will be aimed toward selected market segments and decision makers through whom we can achieve faster market penetration. I am confident that the E.E.C.P. market will continue to grow." 
Although Vaso's pump has the potential of being prescribed for five million patients with heart disease in the United States, few of the nation's heart-care specialists have chosen to do so. The cost of the pump, about $230,000, is a fraction of many high-tech medical devices. Yet until Medicare and private insurers establish their reimbursement rates for treatment sessions with the pump for people with congestive heart failure, Vaso's market remains relatively narrow. 
Meanwhile, Vaso is paying for a $3.5 million study supervised by Dr. Arthur Feldman, the chairman of the department of medicine at Thomas Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. The results of the study, if it bears out Vaso's expectations, will help put it on the radar of the country's medical decision makers. In this world, external counterpulsation is an anomaly. Investments commonly involve products that feature advances in technologies like laser surgery, angioplasty and implantation that have already been touted in professional journals and then discussed, before invited audiences, at educational seminars held at fine restaurants and resorts. 
In contrast, Vaso, which has cash reserves that are far from limitless, attempts to buttonhole prospects at events like the heart association gathering, then following up with calls asking for a few minutes when scheduling permits.
"We don't do the conferences in Bermuda" the way larger medical product companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers do, said Gregory D. Cash, who was named Vaso's president and chief operating officer on Oct. 31. "We try to talk with them one at a time, in their offices, when they can free a moment."
Vaso continues to deal with what it describes as an unwarranted suspicion among cardiologists that the company is their competitor.
"A large percentage of our customers are interventional cardiologists who are concerned that E.E.C.P. will cut into their angioplasty business," said Mr. Cash, 45. "I would say that more than a quarter of our customers perceived of us initially as a threat to their business."
Dr. Feldman, the principal investigator in the Vaso study, said patients with heart disease improve remarkably when they undergo external counterpulsation treatment. "I think it's an incredibly effective new therapy," he said. "We found that after 35 sessions these patients showed marked improvement," better than with conventional medications like diuretics and beta blockers. "I'm talking about people who could barely get up and walk across a room were now going out to play golf," he added.
The technology's very simplicity seems to work against it, Dr. Feldman said. "The cardiologist thinks, 'Put a catheter in,' so this noninvasive technology goes somewhat against their thought process," he said. "It's almost too simple. It's a shame that our current economic system of medicine is slowing down its utilization across the country."
Yet even Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where Dr. Feldman practices, has not purchased the Vaso pump. "I've asked the hospital to buy one, but it is not in this year's budget," he said. "There are items of higher priority."

HEADLINE: A Tough Sell 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL 

 BODY:
RICH and Olga Montgomery were wheeling three grandsons through the Cherry Hill Mall, with three huge red shopping bags hanging off the back of a double stroller. Mr. Montgomery's job was to maintain order in the stroller, and Mrs. Montgomery's mission was to hunt down deals.
 "This year we are definitely looking for bargains," said the 65-year-old grandmother from nearby Mount Laurel. 
 The Montgomerys, who both retired five years ago -- she as a secretary in the Willingboro School District and he as an administrator for Dow Jones in South Brunswick -- are living on a fixed income. At the same time, they are facing grandchild inflation, up from 8 to 10 this year. 
Still, their biggest holiday Grinch this year is Wall Street.
"The stock market has been bad," said Mrs. Montgomery.
"And how," the 68-year-old Mr. Montgomery piped in.
The annual holiday buying binge is in full swing, with the traditional rituals of long checkout lines and crowded parking lots. But an unsettled economy, exaggerated in New Jersey because of the loss of thousands of jobs on Wall Street and in the telecommunications industry, has made holiday shoppers cautious this year. Unemployment is at uncomfortable levels -- 5.5. percent in October in New Jersey as against 4.7 percent last year and 3.7 percent in 2000 -- and the lingering fear of terrorism and a possible war with Iraq seem to have taken the bounce out of the step of many shoppers.
Yet opinions on how this shopping season is shaping up depends on who is doing the talking -- mall operators with their best holiday smiles or forecasters talking economics, otherwise known as the dismal science.
"Customers are definitely shopping the sales," said Billie Scott, a spokeswoman for Simon Property Group Inc. of Indianapolis, which operates four major malls in the state.
Indeed, with the nation's second-highest median income -- $52,000 compared with $42,000 for the United States as a whole -- New Jersey will have a holiday season that will not be quite as bleak as a tale told by Dickens.
"I don't think it's going to be a spectacular holiday season, but it should be a solid one," said Gus Faucher, who specializes in New Jersey at Economy.com, an economic forecasting company in Pennsylvania.
Elaborating a bit, Mr. Faucher said: "It's not going to be like it was in the late 1990's or 2000. On the other hand, the state isn't in recession. Things should be O.K., but not fantastic."
Retailers who were bracing for slow sales have been pleasantly surprised, said Richard Santoro, assistant vice president of the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association.
"Starting with Black Friday, sales were very encouraging, and we're hoping to continue that success as the season draws closer," said Mr. Santoro. "Of course, there are six less shopping days this year and concerns about the Middle East are on consumers' minds. But up to this point it seems retailers are at, or above, their projections."
For his part, Mr. Faucher said he is forecasting retail sales -- excluding automobiles -- to rise 4 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter in New Jersey.
Yet according to Ira Kalish, chief economist of Retail Forward, a consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio, those figures could lag behind the rest of the nation.
"I think New Jersey is going to have a worse Christmas than the rest of the country," he said. "The New York metropolitan area is still feeling the effects of Sept. 11, and more so the decline in stock prices that affect employment and income."
On New Jersey's main streets, merchants are also seeing hesitancy -- the result of an economy in which consumers have less confidence than they did six months ago.
"It's going slowly," said Marceline Lotman, owner of Her Own Place in Moorestown, which has been selling antiques and estate jewelry since 1979.
Ms. Lotman noted, "There are a lot of jobs that have been lost, and people are really feeling that."
Whether the season will be successful or lackluster, no one is immune to the lure of a bargain -- be it Florsheim or Fendi.
"Even though we are an upscale property, I think that this year consumers are looking for discounts," said Mike McAvinue, general manger of the Mall at Short Hills.
Mr. McAvinue said the Friday after Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season, went surprisingly well, with the parking decks that surround the sprawling mall full by noon. In most years, he said, that did not happen by 1 or 2 p.m. And in most holiday seasons, Hanukkah does not fall so early, which this year was the day after Thanksgiving -- known to retailers as Black Friday because the lucrative holiday season puts them in the black.
"It was a great weekend overall," said Mr. McAvinue. "The consumer seemed to be upbeat and optimistic. It seemed like they were in a great mood." Still, he cautioned, "It's only the first inning."
If this season has boon to any group, it has been the personnel managers. With the unemployment rate in New Jersey higher than usual, merchants have had a better selection of potential employees, though they have been cautious about adding too much staff in case sales sag.
Mr. McAvinue said that when stores at the Short Hills mall advertised for positions last year they received two to three applicants for each job. This year, he said, they have typically had 10.
Retail stores comprise the state's second-largest employer behind services, making up 16 percent of total employment, compared with 18 percent nationally.
"In terms of the number they are hiring compared to last year it's about the same," Mr. McAvinue said. "But the quality of the candidate we've been hiring has been very good. Given the job market, there's a better pool of employees out there."
On an overall employment base of more than 4 million, New Jersey added 10,000 jobs in October, and of that 1,000 were in the retail sector. Hardware stores added 700 workers and food stores an additional 600. But general merchandisers and apparel stores cut employment by 400 jobs each.
In the past, said Mr. Faucher of Economy.com, fourth-quarter retail employment usually went up by one to two percentage points. In the fourth quarter of 2001, for instance, retail employment figures in New Jersey increased by 7,000. In 2000 it was up 9,000.
Yet for all the seasonal help, one question is repeated by shoppers almost as much as "It's a Wonderful Life" is shown on television: what's taking so long in the checkout line?
On a slow day at the Cherry Hill Mall Devonia Ramseur pointed to a line at the Gap that was nearly a dozen people deep.
"They know it's Christmas," Mrs. Ramseur complained. "They never have enough people. Every time I make it up to pay there are two registers but one is always empty."
Since July, Seventy McNee has been working part-time for Macy's in Cherry Hill at the fragrance counter. Ms. McNee, a full-time student, wanted to give notice that she planned to leave her job a month ago, but the store managers persuaded her stay through the holidays -- even giving her a bonus for helping them to recruit her husband for a security position for a month.
"I think it is always hard to get employees at the holidays," she said. "They were definitely begging me to stay."
From her vantage point behind the counter, Mrs. McNee said she, too, had seen customers clutching their wallets a bit tighter this season.
"They definitely want the smaller bottle or the one that comes in a gift set," she said. One customer, she said, stood at her counter for about 10 minutes weighing whether to spend $18.50 or $35 on one present. 
"Finally she want with the $35 one," said Mrs. McNee, "but she really thought about it."
Across the counter, one shopper, Alice Tribbett, of Marlton, said she had cut back on the number of people on her gift list.
"I just don't want to spend the money," Ms. Tribbett said. "That's the bottom line."
Tight-fisted shoppers aside, this year's abbreviated shopping season -- created not only by the early Hanukkah but by a relatively late Thanksgiving -- has haunted retailers. Then came a snowstorm, closing schools and making travel difficult.
Still, Elizabeth Platt, marketing director for the Rockaway Town Square in Morris County, chose to see the snow as a potential marketing device.
"It might create more of a sense of urgency," said Ms. Platt. "Snow creates more of that wintry holiday atmosphere and puts shoppers more in the spirit -- after the roads are clear."
But once the roads are cleared, the frustration can set in, fueled by long lines and the anticipation of unappreciated presents. To counter that weariness, shoppers try to stay focused and move quickly.
Mr. McAvineu from the Mall at Short Hills said he had noticed more people referring to their lists to keep them on track, and families using walkie-talkies to help speed the process.
He said he helped a customer with nine shopping bags back to her car on the day after Thanksgiving.
"I asked her, 'How did you do all this so fast?' " said McAvinue. "She said she used the Internet and catalogs to prepare her list of what she wanted, but she wanted to avoid the shipping charges and still be able to feel and touch what she was buying."
Of course, holiday time means a proliferation of promotions to entice the weary and the wary. Dogs and children are easy targets. Take the Mall at Short Hills, which held what it billed as its first Santa Paws event in which people brought their pets to be photographed with Santa Claus. More than 300 dogs -- but only a few cats -- were brought in over two nights.
But promotions and gimmicks can only go so far. The more pragmatic shoppers are turning to gift certificates and the Internet this year. During the week including Thanksgiving, shoppers spent $1.5 billion on the Internet, up 41 percent over the same period last year, according to ComScore Networks of Reston, Va.
In New Jersey, that has been a bonus for the State Museum in Trenton, which has been offering selected merchandise from its shop over the Internet for three years.
The museum sells "Trenton Makes the World Takes" T-shirts as well as caps and sweatshirts that spell out New Jersey in an elegant script; there is a watch with the state quarter as its face, and a paperweight with the Great Seal of New Jersey.
"Business has been growing gradually," said Becky Morrisson, manager of the museum shop. "It has been exciting for us. We're testing the waters and seeing how many people have an interest in New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Advice for 2003: Balancing Pain and Opportunity

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
AT a market forecast meeting last month attended by 300 commercial real estate professionals in New Jersey, two speakers from the same company performed something of a bad-cop/good-cop routine about prospects for next year. 
 First, Robert J. Rudin, head of Insignia/ESG's New Jersey office, delivered the slap in the face -- hard facts about the current commercial market and a prediction that the pain -- his word -- will last another year to 18 months. Then, Linda Dow, head of the firm's consulting group in New Jersey and a specialist in financial techniques, stepped up to talk about tools for survival through this "very challenging" time. 
 Mr. Rudin told the assembled brokers, lenders and property managers that reality is not pretty. "The current overall vacancy rate of the New Jersey office market is 18.1 percent," he said, "higher than the bottom of the market in the early 1990's, when there was a real estate depression. Considering that the market has grown since the 90's, in absolute terms, there is actually more office space on the market than at any other time in the history of New Jersey." 
He noted that the vacancy rate has climbed to 24 percent in Monmouth County and 28 percent in the prime office locale of Parsippany, and along Route 287 in the Piscataway-New Brunswick area, it has hit 29 percent.
It is hard to say how far rents have fallen, Mr. Rudin continued, because the leasing market is so slow. But based on an analysis taking into account what landlords are giving up in free rent and free improvements to space and what information there is on rental rates, Mr. Rudin said, the price of Class A space has fallen between 20 and 25 percent from the peak in the year 2000.
"Going forward," he said, "our problems are threefold: the first is the drag on rental pricing created by the surplus space, the second is a lack of demand based on employment trends in the state of New Jersey and the third is the reluctance of corporations to spend capital."
What is more, Mr. Rudin told the real estate people they do not have the power to solve these problems. "What we need most is an uptick in employment, which is out of our realm for the most part," he said.
"In order to get the market back in balance, New Jersey is going to have to create 50,000 office jobs in the northern part of the state to take up about 12.5 million square feet of space." With that many new jobs, the vacancy rate would be "back to 10 percent, which is where it needs to be," he said.
Mr. Rudin, who has been the top New Jersey broker for Insignia/ESG in 8 of the past 12 years, softened the picture a bit by pointing out several things that make this down market less devastating than the one a decade ago.
For one thing, he said, the economic boom preceding the recession that hit in 1992 had generated "massive overbuilding" of commercial space. For a number of reasons, including the benefits of experience, that was not the case in this cycle. 
Also, Mr. Rudin noted that in the early 90's, real estate investment trusts were a less pervasive presence in commercial real estate. At that time, banks or savings and loan institutions financed most commercial property purchases. "When economic recession hit," he said, "banks were forced to foreclose, and properties were either sold or written down to 40 cents on the dollar."
For REIT's, the risk is spread over multiple investors, he noted, and the situation does not get "desperate" as quickly, he said, which helps a market recover faster. The real estate depression in the 90's went on for almost five years, he said.
Mr. Rudin predicted that with interest rates at their lowest point in 40 years, investors would continue to pour money into the real estate market -- at least in the short term. However, he said, "As soon as alternative investments, such as the stock market, become attractive again, or if interest rates rise significantly, that will be over."
BROKERS listening to such blunt talk may have been moved to shift uneasily in their seats. But next, Ms. Dow appeared with advice on how to hold on to real estate value when times are bad.
Ms. Dow, who expanded on her remarks in a later interview, summed up the thrust of the speech she gave last month like this: "If you have space issues or needs, you have to look at this market opportunistically." 
Obviously, it is prospective tenants who have the better opportunities in a bear market. Mr. Rudin predicted at the seminar that owners and sublessors would soon be forced to compete in space auctions to offer the lowest price per square foot. 
But Ms. Dow said that owners, investors and sublessors also have options for "creating pools of value," by arranging more flexible terms with lenders or tenants.
In some cases, it may suit both sides to work out a trade, a longer term on a lease for a better price, she said. "If a company has a lease that is expiring, or rent that is above market, or the need to consolidate, there is the opportunity to talk with the landlord and offer to trade," she said.
She said Insignia/ESG is working on helping four large companies reconfigure terms. "These cases involve strategic locations for the companies -- a headquarters, or regional facility, a place where they need to be -- so they are willing to go longer term on the lease, if they can get a better deal." 
In her speech, Ms. Dow addressed various situations that companies may find themselves in and offered advice on each. "If you need to sublease some space," she said, "you must set the price at what you think it will be six months from now -- because you don't want to be chasing deals."
Generally, she said, this means a 10 to 20 percent cut in the asking rent. Many market specialists have observed that asking rents have been slow to come down despite rising vacancy. "But nothing is moving, either," Ms. Dow said, adding that more sublease space is expected to flood into an already swamped market in 2003. "Forward pricing trades on the only thing you have to trade because as every day goes by, a sublease becomes worth less."
For companies selling or leasing property because they need to consolidate or reduce the amount of space they occupy, Ms. Dow recommends one big move rather than incremental shifting. "You might have to hop, skip and jump around when there is less supply of space," she said. "But now, when there is excess supply and weak demand, you are better off with a discrete shift to one location. It costs less; it is easier to write off; there is less disruption to your business; and if you are looking to promote the image or market share of your company, it keeps you highly visible."
Companies that need to move within the next year should also consider -- temporarily -- purchasing space on an interim basis, Ms. Dow said. "I am not suggesting companies load up the balance sheet with corporate real estate facilities, but that they consider purchasing as a way to add value."
She explained her thinking this way: "If you look at the value of a vacant building," and compare that with the value of the same building fully occupied, "the price spread is 20 to 50 percent. So, if your company leases space and it is then sold; your tenancy has created that extra value. Why not acquire the property, write your own lease, then turn around and sell it?"
The sale-leaseback of property generates cash that can be used in other areas of a business, Ms. Dow said. If cash is not an issue, she said, a company can structure a deal to "buy down" its rental rate, entering a contract to purchase vacant space and finding another buyer before closing who will agree to lease the space back on the preferred terms. "With interest rates the lowest they've been in 40 years," she said, "investors are more than willing to jump at such deals."
Asked to give a few words of advice for those engaged in the market during 2003, Ms. Dow jumped at that deal. "Plan ahead," she said.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Office Parties, Downsized, but Surviving

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE market is down, unemployment is up, holiday bonuses may be the ghosts of Christmas Past, but around Westchester, the business Christmas party is still on, albeit in a more subdued style than in flush times.
 Across the country, about two out of three companies are giving holiday parties for employees, about the same as last year, according to a study of 432 businesses nationwide by Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. 
 "Companies continue to have holiday parties, in spite of not opting to have holiday bonuses," said Ken Abosch, a senior consultant at Hewitt. The end-of-the-year parties are popular among employees, he said, "because they boost morale, and give employees a way to socialize with colleagues outside the confines of work." 
Anxiety about last year's terrorist attack has been shouldered aside by anxiety about the economy, and organizations are avoiding even the appearance of extravagance. "You won't see caviar or truffles or foie gras on many holiday party menus this year," said Scott Davis, president of Flik International, a food service management company in Rye Brook. 
Other local party planners agree.
"This year we have a heavy event schedule, but companies are cutting back on the number of people they are bringing to events," said Gerald F. Longo, general manager of Abigail Kirsch at Tappan Hill, a catering concern in Tarrytown. Businesses are less likely to invite spouses, and more budget-minded about food and drink, he said.
At the Abigail Kirsch facility, where parties cost about $100 a person, even high-spending customers are cutting back on the open bar, substituting wine service with the meal, Mr. Longo said.
"Instead of ordering the highest price entree, like rack of lamb or something in veal, they're sticking to chicken or salmon," he said.
At the less expensive Surf Club in New Rochelle, where parties run about $50 a guest, business has been down for the last few years, said Ron Vogel, senior banquet manager. He has booked only about 50 holiday parties this year, down from twice that number in 2000. "Now, people are very laid back, they want music, a light menu, a gathering," Mr. Vogel said.
Westchester hospitals traditionally hold holiday parties onsite with marathon hours, so every shift of the round-the-clock staff can attend. The six-hour holiday party last week at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow included breakfast, lunch and dinner, as it has for about 40 years. The food was prepared by the kitchen staff and served in the hospital cafeteria to 750 people, at a cost of about $5,000, according to a spokeswoman, Mary Sernatinger. Hospital administrators, including Keith Safian, the president, served food at every meal.
Being served by the head of nursing "made me feel appreciated," said Lou Guarnaschelli, a part-time pharmacist who has attended holiday parties since he started working at Phelps in 1959. One of the largest and longest parties in Westchester is held at the Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. Last week, a 14-hour party for about 1,200 employees, volunteers and visitors began with a 5 a.m. breakfast, including pancakes, omelettes and fresh-baked bagels. The party lasted through dinner -- prime rib, salmon and penne -- and featured a harpist at breakfast and a pianist throughout the day. The event cost the hospital about $7,000, according to Karen Judson, director of nutritional services. 
"Last year, the hospital had a different atmosphere, and we were taking collections for families affected by Sept. 11," she said. "This year, things are more relaxed.
A T Purchase College, a holiday party will be given this week at Beechwood, a Georgian mansion and former home of the school president, for 300 staff members. There will be wine, soft drinks and hors d'oeuvres, catered by the college's food service provider, along with blazing fires and tree decorating, and entertainment from the school's brass ensemble and choral group. "We give a gracious New England holiday party, with a warm, rosy glow," said Geraldine Sanderson, public relations director at Purchase.
Employees there enjoy the chance to socialize with colleagues from all corners of the campus. "We're in our own little financial aid world, and we don't come out to breathe too often," said Tom Tanettierre.
Most employers realize that a holiday party keeps morale up, said Mr. Davis of Flik International. "Food and company spirit is the one place of refuge for employees" in troubled economic times, said Mr. Davis, who will be catering about 35 corporate parties, at a cost of $35 to $200 a person.
The Snapple Beverage Group, with 300 employees in White Plains, held a four-hour holiday party last week at the Rye Town Hilton, a buffet lunch for 300 people, and gave out 300 crystal candy dishes as gifts. 
"We're a partying group and we don't mind hanging out with people after work because we all get along," said Karen Long, 49, who works in accounts payable.
Nextel, a wireless telephone service based in Elmsford, held a holiday party for nearly 600 employees last week at the Glen Island Harbour Club in New Rochelle. 
The luxurious setting and good food are a large part of the party's appeal, as are raffles of CD players andtelevisions, said Anthony Maraglino, 26, who works in the finance department. Nobody gets really drunk, he said, "because it's a business atmosphere, and you don't want to get carried away."
Other companies hold parties onsite, with catered food. At the global headquarters of MasterCard in Rye, for example, an after-work party last week for 1,200 employees and their guests, featured food and an open bar. 
Still, elsewhere Scrooge has prevailed. At PepsiCo, which has 2,000 employees at its global headquarters in Purchase, there has been no companywide holiday gathering for several years, although some departments hold their own parties. At Nine West, a shoe company in White Plains with 439 employees, there will be no companywide holiday party this year. 
Employees at Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan are having a holiday dinner party on Saturday at the Best Western Inn in Poughkeepsie. To attend, though, employees must pay $100 a couple, since the plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, will subsidize only 40 percent of the cost. So far, only 100 out of 1,500 employees have signed up.

HEADLINE: Rates Drop, but Adjustable Loans Persist 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
MORTGAGE rates in the last couple of years have been consistently low, with costs of 30-year fixed-rate loans in recent weeks down to their lowest point in more than 30 years. But rather than locking up these low rates, a substantial number of borrowers continue to opt for adjustable-rate loans, whose rates, while initially lower than those on fixed-rate loans for a specified period, can fluctuate substantially over time.
 What at first glance may sound imprudent, however, may be just the opposite. In some cases borrowers opting for adjustable-rate mortgages expect to sell their houses before it comes time to adjust the rates -- an ARM might have a one-year, five-year or seven-year period before its rates are adjusted upward or downward based on a specified financial point of reference, typically the three-year Treasury note. 
 In others, especially for those taking out large loans, the sharp run-up in home prices in the New York metropolitan area in recent years has meant that a buyer may be able to afford the payments under the initial rate of an ARM but not the higher monthly payment of a fixed-rate mortgage. Such a buyer would be gambling that interest rates will not rise sharply before his mortgage payments must be adjusted or that his income will increase sufficiently to cover the higher payments. 
In the week ended Dec. 13, the interest rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgages averaged 6.04 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), which issued its report in midweek, slightly above the 31-year low of 5.94 percent in mid-November. 
It is hardly surprising, then, that 82 percent of conventional home mortgages through the first 10 months of this year were for fixed rate loans, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board. But what may surprise many homeowners is that 18 percent of the mortgage loans through October of this year were for adjustable rate mortgages, according to Joseph A. McKenzie, the deputy chief economist of the finance board. 
The average interest rate for one-year ARM's (those with a initial interest rate that remains unchanged for the first year of the loan) in the week ended Dec. 6 was 3.79 percent. ARM's, which were introduced in the early 1980's and are also known as variable-rate mortgages, have accounted for between 15 and 20 percent of mortgages nationwide for some time, and as recently as the first quarter of 2000 they accounted for 31 percent.
A borrower who took out a $300,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at an interest rate of 6.08 percent this week would have a monthly payment of $1,814, according to Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Butler, N.J. If the same borrower instead chose a five-year ARM, the rate would be 5.13 percent and the monthly payment $1,634, a saving of $180 a month. 
But after five years, the interest rate on the ARM would change and could rise as much as five percentage points at the first adjustment. If that maximum five-point increase were to happen, the new interest rate of 10.13 percent would result in a monthly payment that increased by 54 percent, to $2,533. It is also theoretically possible, of course -- though unlikely given the historically low rates now being offered -- that the rate could be adjusted downward after five years. Once the five years have passed, interest rates on the loan, adjusted annually, could also go up, but the rate could at no time be more than six percentage points over the starting rate.
A check with mortgage lenders and brokers suggests that adjustable rate mortgages may be slightly more popular in the New York area than in some other parts of the country. 
Steven Schnall, chief executive of the New York Mortgage Company in Manhattan, said the ratio for his company, which has offices in Manhattan as well as nine cities in five other states, is about 70 percent fixed-term loans and 30 percent adjustables. A similar ratio prevails at Withers & Company in New Rochelle. "Although people are looking at adjustables," said Robert Withers, the owner, "they're still mostly taking fixed-term mortgages." 
In many cases, borrowers who prefer adjustable-rate mortgages tend to be those with very expensive homes, according to Phil Colling, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. As a result they also tend to have bigger loans, known as jumbos -- loans that exceed the dollar ceiling set for purchase and repackaging as tradable securities by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government-chartered enterprises that buy home loans from lenders, giving the lenders the cash to make more loans. The agencies' current limit, $275,000 for single family homes, will increase to $322,700 on Jan. 1.
According to Mr. Colling, the average adjustable-rate mortgage loan this year is about $300,000 while the average fixed rate loan is about $165,000. So far this year, according to Mr. McKenzie, ARM's have accounted for a large percentage of jumbos. For example, through this October adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for 49 percent of all mortgages for $300,701 to $400,000, 52 percent of those from $400,001 to $500,000, and 62 percent of those from $500,001 to $748,400.
When Bonnie McNab, a broker at the Mortgage Center in Roslyn on Long Island, sells an adjustable-rate mortgage these days, she said the loan is likely to be at least $500,000. With the median price of a home at $360,000 in October in Nassau County and $282,000 in Suffolk, large mortgages are common. 
Nevertheless, adjustable-rate mortgages have appeared to be headed for extinction several times in recent years. In September and October of 1998 they represented a mere 8 percent of the market, according to Frank Nothaft, the chief economist at Freddie Mac, and only 11 percent for that whole year. By 2000, ARM's accounted for 23 percent of all mortgages, but the percentage tumbled to 12 percent last year. A reason for the drop is that even though ARM rates were low, so were fixed-rate mortgages, so that the spread between the two did not impress homeowners. Most home buyers opted for the low fixed-rate mortgages, Mr. Nothaft said, which were at levels not seen for much of the previous 30 years.
Over the years, consumer taste has changed somewhat in the kinds of ARM's taken out. In the early 1990's, Mr. Nothaft said, one-year ARM's dominated the adjustable-rate mortgage market, so much so that only 30 percent of lenders offered three-year terms, mortgages whose initial low rate, or "teaser rate," was fixed for three years before adjusting annually. By 1998, 80 percent of lenders offered three-year terms, and now five-year and seven-year ARM's are just about everywhere, because they offer low rates for longer terms. The rule of thumb on ARM's is that the shorter the initial term, the lower the initial rate. 
Sometimes ARM's are tailored for a specific customer, and on most very large mortgages the terms tend to be customized. For example, three years ago Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton bought their $1.7 million house in Chappaqua with an adjustable-rate mortgage in the form of a $1.36 million loan from PNC Mortgage, a subsidiary of the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh. The $340,000 down payment represented 20 percent of the purchase price.
A White House spokesman said at the time that the loan would carry an annual interest rate of 7.5 percent for the first three years, after which the rate would be set at the one-year Treasury rate plus 2.75 percentage points. According to Mr. Gumbinger of HSH, if the Clintons have not refinanced, they could be paying an interest rate as low as 4.24 percent -- unless interest rate caps prevented their rate from falling more than two percentage points, as is common on these products. 
Most homeowners are more comfortable with a mortgage that has a fixed rate for its whole term than with a loan whose rate could rise sharply. In such an event, the homeowner also has the option of refinancing the mortgage, but that entails shopping for the best deal and paying substantial closing costs and perhaps a penalty.
Still, many borrowers have had reason to be pleased by their experiences with ARM's. Mr. Schnall of New York Mortgage, for instance, said that he has an ARM on his own home that he took out in 1990 and that through several adjustments the rate has never exceeded the initial rate.
Much of the durability of adjustable-rate mortgages, in Mr. Gumbinger's opinion, can be attributed to their variety. "There hasn't been a lot of innovation recently," he said, "but ARM's have held up well." One reason they have, he added, is that their lower interest rates have helped to offset the increase in home prices in recent years.
Mr. Nothaft of Freddie Mac agrees. "Since their introduction into the mortgage market in the early 1980's," he said, "ARM's have continued to evolve, adapting to inevitable changes in market conditions and subsequent borrower needs. As a result, borrowers today can choose from a wide variety of ARM products."
Among those choices are hybrid ARM's -- the term refers to the fact that rates are unchanged for a specified period of years, and then adjust according to contemporary interest rates. 
Such loans are especially popular with borrowers who plan to be in their house no longer than for the length of the fixed-rate period of their loan. And if circumstances make it necessary or advisable to remain longer, some ARM agreements enable borrowers to convert to a fixed-rate mortgage -- but even then, in the words of many other advertised bargains, "restrictions apply."
A type of adjustable-rate mortgage that has been around for almost 20 years in some parts of the country -- but has become widely available in the Northeast only in recent years -- is the interest-only mortgage. As its name suggests, the borrower's monthly payment covers only interest and none of the principal. But at the end of the interest-only term, the borrower has to pay the principal over the remaining term of the loan. This results in a sharp jump in monthly payments. 
For example, a borrower of $300,000 over 30 years with an ARM with an initial rate of 5.25 percent, fixed for the first five years and adjustable thereafter, would pay $1,657 a month for the first five years, according to Mr. Schnall of New York Mortgage. But, he said, the monthly payment for an interest-only mortgage at the same rate for the same term would be $1,313 per month for the first five years. Not only is the interest-only loan no more risky than the other loan, Mr. Schnall said, the payments are lower and the entire mortgage payment is fully tax deductible. 
"The only disadvantages are that during the interest-only period the borrower does not build equity by amortizing principal," he said, "but many borrowers feel that is mitigated because they're building equity by appreciation. And at the end of the interest-only period on a typical 10-year interest-only ARM with a term of 30 years and a rate fixed for five years, the borrower is forced to amortize the entire principal balance over the remaining 20 years, thus resulting in higher payments for that 20 years." 
If the rate in the example stayed the same after the initial fixed rate period, the monthly payment over the next 20 years would increase to $2,022, compared with a payment of $1,657 on the ARM on which the borrower is paying principal as well as interest from the beginning. If the rate went up to 10.25 percent and remained there for the balance of the loan, the monthly payment would be $2,945. 
BALLOON mortgages bear some resemblance to interest-only mortgages, but there are differences, A balloon mortgage usually has a fixed rate for a period of time, but then requires a repayment in full. For example, a five-year balloon known as a 5/25 carries monthly payments for the first five years based on a 30-year payment schedule, but when the five years are up, the entire loan balance must be paid. Balloon loans often have a provision entitling the borrower to extend the loan for the remaining 25 years, with certain conditions.
Lenders and brokers also say that even when ARM's can be demonstrated to cost less than fixed-rate mortgages over the same period, many borrowers still choose fixed-rate loans. First-time buyers are often reluctant to take out an ARM, despite the lower monthly payments, according to Joseph L. Romano, president of A. J. Romano Mortgage in Stratford, Conn. "Because they've usually been used to paying rent," he said, "the idea of paying more than they have to for a mortgage doesn't cause sticker shock." 
FOR more sophisticated buyers, other factors are involved in the decision to choose between a fixed-rate mortgage or an ARM. For example, when Jim and Pat Racz of Avon, Conn., outside Hartford, decided to refinance their mortgage Mr. Romano offered them a $400,000 adjustable rate mortgage with an interest rate of 5.375 percent fixed for seven years or a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 6.25 percent. After talking it over, the couple chose the adjustable rate.
"We live in a very large house with a 10-year-old daughter, who will be packing up for college in about seven years, and I expect to be retired then," said Mr. Racz, who negotiates contracts with customers of Pitney Bowes management services. "We also decided to take the risk with the ARM because we're planning to sell the house in about seven years, taking the equity and downsizing into a retirement-sized home." The lower rate will save the family $18,716 over those seven years.
Refinancing by homeowners has been a major factor in the mortgage industry for the better part of the last two years, but the frenzy is slowly abating, according to figures compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The group's index of refinance applications has declined 47 percent between early September and late November, but refinancings are still strong compared with the level of activity in the 1990's.
Relatively few homeowners remain who would stand to gain from refinancing and have not yet done so, Mr. Colling said. "Unless rates drop to 5 percent," he said, "at some point everyone who wants a low-interest mortgage and qualifies for one will have one."
But a greater threat to the refinancing boom, said Orawin Velz, the senior economist for Fannie Mae, is rising interest rates. Ms. Velz does not expect the economy to strengthen much before the middle of next year and therefore does not expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates anytime soon. But "you can probably see mortgage rates start to edge up earlier than any hike by the Fed," she said. "That's when we should see the end of the refinance boom."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about residential mortgages misstated the ceiling for home loans eligible for purchase and repackaging in security pools by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally chartered sources of financing. It is $300,700; the 2001 ceiling was $275,000. It is to increase to $322,700 on Jan. 1.

HEADLINE: THE CITIES; 
Keeping The Gangs At Bay

BYLINE:  By LISA SUHAY 

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN 

 BODY:
MARGUERITE LE wants to keep immigrant children on the straight and narrow path, while street gangs and others seek to detour them. For nine years she has been successful by employing the three L's: language, love and laughter.
 She believes these newest and youngest members of the community are easy prey for recruitment into illegal activities because the children are isolated behind a barrier of language and poverty, with parents so busy trying to survive financially that they have little time or resource to help their children adjust. 
 Ms. Le, 52, a resident of Camden and teacher of English as a second language at Lanning Square School in South Camden, is the founder and director of the program known as Gleam, for God's Love English Art and Manners, at the Martin Luther Christian School here in Pennsauken. 
She meets at the school every Saturday morning with nearly 60 children from Asia and the Caribbean. Twice a year she tries to raise enough funds to take the group someplace they would consider a dream come true, whether that is to the movies or a big league ballgame.
The students come from all over Pennsauken and Camden. Most attend public schools, and most are Buddhists or of other faiths, not Christian.
"It isn't a conversion push," Ms. Le said. "We had to get God in there, otherwise it would still be taking place in my little row house in Camden instead of in the classrooms. But some of the original Gleam kids did become Lutherans, so you never know."
Even teaching Bible basics was a trial when her first students, about a decade ago, spoke no English and she no Vietnamese.
"We sat there with a translator as I tried to relate the story of Adam and Eve," she recalled. "Whoa! Now that was tough."
The participants range in age from 5 to 21. Many come from large families with barely subsistence-level incomes.
"Let's get this straight," Ms. Le said. "Our kids are not victims. Some are economically poor, but you don't have to give them your old socks or something. They need education, good role models and to get the heck out of Camden and Pennsauken once in a while to see outside the narrow focus of an immigrant's way of life."
Ms. Le knows of the immigrant life. She was born Marguerite Wunsch, the daughter of second-generation Americans: a father of German descent who worked in a factory and a mother of Irish lineage who worked for Bell Telephone. She and her two brothers grew up in Camden.
The father of Ms. Le's daughter, Kim, now 19 and a student at the University of Pennsylvania, is from Vietnam. In addition, her former husband, whom she met while teaching English as a second language at Catholic Community Services program in Camden, was a refugee from Vietnam. 
Ms. Le graduated from Rutgers University in Camden in 1972. She worked as an operator for Western Union for eight years and then worked for the Camden public schools until 1989, when she took the job at Catholic Community Services, teaching Enlgish to adult refugees from Vietnam. 
For six years she taught in the basement of an old convent at St. Joseph's Cathedral, where a bare bulb swung from the cold, damp ceiling and bars covered the windows. 
"So that's where I met my ex-husband, Hoang Le, and how the Gleam program began," Ms. Le explained. "The refugees couldn't afford sitters so they brought their little ones to class."
According to Ms. Le, as time passed the parents graduated from the class, but the children continued to come on their own.
"It was like their second family," she said. "They felt safe there and the parents came to me and asked me to take the kids with me to the Lutheran church, where I went on Sundays, so they could be with me and hear more English spoken."
All along, the need for a children's group similar to the one for their parents became obvious. "So we started meeting at my house in Camden," she said. "When it got too big I asked my church for space."
In the Gleam classroom on a recent Saturday morning, about 30 children from Haiti, China, Vietnam, Puerto Rico and Mexico sipped juice, devoured doughnuts and leafed through their journals comparing short stories they had written. 
At this meeting the had a lecture by a Revolutionary War buff, Lou Gionobli, clad in full British military regalia. After that came a lesson on how computers work from Pete Gerken. Both presenters are local, unpaid volunteers.
The children gave their rapt attention. At the end they shyly accepted Mr. Gionobli's offer to try on his tricorn hat. 
After much coaxing, one child, Mathe Rose Marcellus, 12, of Camden, put on Mr. Gionobli's British redcoat, starting gales of laughter and a buzz of many languages from others as the coat engulfed her small frame. 
In English, Ms. Le admonished the children: "If you are going to joke about how funny it is, try and do it in English. Please. In English!"
Ms. Marcellus's sister Nathalie, 9, and brother Yves, 6, immediately stopped laughing so as to marshal their tongues to the new language. At home the Marcellus children speak Haitian-Creole and English with their parents and five other siblings.
"We learn manners and we do a lot of reading," Mathe Rose said. "Ms. Le got us Newsweek and now we learn a whole lot from there."
Mathe's oldest sister, Marie, 26, added: "This is a wonderful thing they do for the children here. It is keeping them busy and safe from the world. It teaches them the good things they should know about to protect them." 
Ms. Le says her main struggle is against the gangs in Camdem that try to enlist immigrant children. 
"Oh yes, there are plenty of gangs here and other kinds of bad people looking for someone vulnerable," she said. "They get them when they first come into this country and they are struggling and they see all these American kids going to movies and getting things they can never have. That resentment and alienation builds up. The kids feel like outsiders and they gravitate toward the support of the gang."
Ms. Le is fiercely proud of her young charges. The gangs that tried eight years ago to indoctrinate her students failed in their appeal, she said, "because these kids had support."
"If you have education and good role models, people who love you, you can compete and you can survive, even get ahead in America, no matter how poor your family is," she said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A First Step To Cutting Reliance On Oil

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
WHICH events of recent days are likely to have the most significant long-term impact on American business and the economy?
 To my mind, it was not the Bush administration's new team of economic policy makers, who dominated the headlines last week. Nor the efforts to clean up Wall Street. And not the buildup of troops to fight a war in Iraq, either. 
 No, my money is on the barely noticed introduction by Honda and Toyota of a handful of experimental fuel cell vehicles to be tested by the State of California.
The possibility of running cars on fuel cells has been heavily promoted in business circles in recent years, and for good reason. Imagine a global economy no longer dependent on oil and the internal combustion engine. Fuel cells, because they produce energy from pure hydrogen rather than from petroleum, emit only water and heat as waste, potentially generating power without burning fossil fuels.
By making it possible to shift from petroleum to other primary energy sources, fuel cells could ease the threat of global warming without taking away the freedom and mobility that Americans and Europeans take for granted -- and the rest of the world is determined to get for itself. China and India, with more than one-third of the world's population, could sustain rapid growth for decades without choking the sky with pollutants and climate-damaging carbon dioxide.
But this vision of a truly sustainable economic future is far from inevitable. The technological challenges to building a commercially successful fuel cell vehicle are overwhelming. And who would supply them? Recasting the entire petroleum-based infrastructure to produce and deliver hydrogen safely to hundreds of millions of such vehicles presents a classic chicken-and-egg problem of immense proportions.
Every major automaker and oil company has a hydrogen or fuel cell research effort under way; supporters say they recognize that fossil fuels can't last forever. Environmentalists carp that industry is simply trying to preserve the status quo and avoid more immediate steps to improve the fuel efficiency of conventional automobiles.
In a generally positive article on the efforts of General Motors to reinvent the automobile, Wired magazine noted that Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, likes to call the fuel cell car "the holy grail," but that the description "may be a truer assessment than he intends." After all, as David Redstone, editor of Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Investor, a newsletter, told the magazine: "The holy grail is something you spend your entire life looking for. The whole point is that you never find it."
No one knows for sure whether a hydrogen economy is a possible dream.
"The oil companies and automakers are not doing this because they want to kill it," said Steven Taub, an expert on alternative fuels at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass. "But they are not doing this because they know it's the future, either. They're doing it because they don't know whether or not it's the future."
It's worth the risk to find out.
Bolstered by modest support from the government and a new commitment from the Bush administration, American automakers and other companies are already investing in fuel cell research. But an effort to put tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of vehicles on the road within a decade, which many analysts regard as feasible, would require a substantial commitment from Washington to help jump-start the market and support the investment in a supply infrastructure.
THIS shouldn't mean giving up on less ambitious efforts, as both the White House and the auto industry have done in abandoning the research program to build a very fuel-efficient car using existing technology. If nothing else, as an insurance policy to avoid being usurped again by Japanese automakers, Detroit should also be investing more in fuel-efficient hybrid electric-gasoline vehicles like the Toyota Prius.
True, big federal programs like the Interstate System of highways, the development of the Internet and the creation of the semiconductor chip (which grew out of the space program) have gone out of fashion. But even in an era in which markets have rightly assumed a much greater role in allocating resources, government commitment is needed to set ambitious goals in crucial areas.
And when the nation is preparing to spend at least $100 billion to liberate Iraq from Saddam Hussein and much more to maintain stability in the Persian Gulf, nothing is more crucial than investing a fraction of that sum to help liberate the world economy from its addiction to Middle East oil.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
When Health Coverage Is Decided by the Calendar

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
PEOPLE play chicken with their health insurance all the time. They leave their jobs and their employer-sponsored health plans, gambling that they won't be in an accident or become seriously ill before they get another job that has a group plan. Once secure in their new positions, they may think their insurance worries are over.
 But that's not necessarily the case. A gap in coverage, even for just a few months, could leave people responsible for certain medical bills for up to a year. 
 Blame the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as Hipaa, a law that was intended to protect people when they switched plans. The law safeguards coverage for pre-existing medical conditions after a worker joins an employer's group health plan -- as long as there has been no significant break in coverage. (Any period of more than 62 days is considered significant under Hipaa.)
With the economy still in turmoil and jobs harder to find, more people are failing to make this seamless transition. Many cannot afford to extend health insurance under the federal law known as Cobra, which lets workers continue policies for up to 18 months if they pay the full premiums. (If they keep previous insurance through Cobra, that's not considered a break in coverage.)
"We're clearly seeing more gaps in coverage," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer health care advocacy group in Washington. "I believe we're going to see considerably more of them in the future."
When Chip East, 31, of Jersey City left his job as a newspaper photographer in Fayetteville, N.C., four years ago to try his hand at freelancing, he didn't expect to be without health insurance for long. But the policies he found were more than he could afford, and Mr. East is still uninsured.
Last year, in addition to picking up a nasty intestinal parasite and being shot in the leg while on assignment in Israel, Mr. East was found to have skin cancer and had to have two surgeries. Although he plans to sign on with his future wife's group plan after he marries in March, his troubles may not be over. If his intestinal problems or skin cancer recur, he may not be covered for those conditions for up to a year because the break in coverage has been more than 62 days. 
About a third of workers are covered by plans with pre-existing-condition exclusions, including 43 percent of workers in preferred-provider organizations, according to the 2002 Employer Health Benefits Survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Signing up for a short-term medical policy while between jobs can avoid a break in coverage. Fortis Health, based in Milwaukee, says sales of these policies, which typically last one to six months, have grown 160 percent in the last five years. But these plans don't cover pre-existing conditions. "They're good for healthy people," said Kristin Seigworth, a company spokeswoman.
Once someone has a new job, Hipaa loopholes may still be a problem. If an employer bought insurance through an association -- one in four employers buys health coverage this way, as do many freelancers and small-business owners -- an employee may not have the same protections as under regular group coverage.
"Associations label these plans 'group coverage' to make people think they're getting the protections they would have if they got coverage through an employer group plan," said Mila Kofman, an assistant research professor at the Institute for Health Care Research and Policy at Georgetown. "Consumers need to understand that's not the case."
When Michael Opelski, 38, of Norristown, Pa., started a new job as a sales representative for a home hardware manufacturer in the summer of 2000, he took the Golden Rule group plan offered by his employer. To get Golden Rule coverage, however, he first had to become a member of an association called the Federation of American Consumers and Travelers. Mr. Opelski said he hadn't given it a thought. But when his wife, Jean, became sick with inflammatory breast cancer, he learned how restricted his coverage was. Because Mrs. Opelski had discussed finding a lump in her breast with her doctor before joining the plan, Mr. Opelski said, Golden Rule refused to pay for her breast cancer treatments. It was a pre-existing condition, he said he had been told. Golden Rule, based in Lawrenceville, Ill., declined to comment on the case, citing confidentiality.
If the couple had been covered by a regular employer group plan, Mrs. Opelski's breast cancer would probably have been covered under Hipaa. But their plan was something that Golden Rule calls an association group policy.
IN Pennsylvania, Golden Rule treats these plans as if they were individual policies for the purposes of regulation, said Michael Corne, a vice president at Golden Rule. Unfortunately for the Opelskis, individual policies don't generally afford the same level of pre-existing-condition protection as employers' group plans do.
Through the Patient Advocate Foundation in Newport News, Va., the Opelskis found a hospital that continued to treat Mrs. Opelski at no charge. She died in January at the age of 34. "We were just caught in the middle, and nobody really cared," Mr. Opelski said.
Is anyone calling for any revisions to Hipaa to close these loopholes on pre-existing conditions? If anything, political momentum is moving in the opposite direction -- toward less comprehensive coverage and fewer safeguards and protections. 
Coverage gaps may be among the least of our worries.

HEADLINE: Business; 
In This Family, Corporate Crises Test a Second Generation

BYLINE:  By KAREN ALEXANDER 

DATELINE: SAN MATEO, Calif. 

 BODY:
THESE are tough times for chief executives in Silicon Valley, and Paul G. Lego is feeling the pressure. 
 His company, Virage, based here, makes software used to publish and manage video content on the Internet. With a client list that includes CNN, Nascar and Major League Baseball, the company has survived a crushing economic slowdown that has pushed many of its high-technology peers out of the game. Yet, despite a virtual monopoly in its field and a surge in government business since the Sept. 11 attacks, Virage continues to lose money. 
 Amid the recent abundance of corporate scandals and the scathing scrutiny of runaway executive pay packages, there aren't many places for a weary chief executive to seek understanding. But Mr. Lego has a good sounding board and signpost in his father, Paul E. Lego. 
The elder Mr. Lego was tossed out as chairman and chief executive of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in January 1993. Westinghouse, then a multibillion-dollar electrical and technology giant, had been brought to the brink of failure when a subsidiary, Westinghouse Credit, was crushed by a collapse in the real estate market. In the two and a half years that he led Westinghouse, the company lost $2.1 billion.
The younger Mr. Lego, then in his early 30's and about a decade out of Harvard Business School, watched angrily as his father took the blame for a situation that had been smoldering undetected well before he took command. The crisis ended his 37-year career at the company. "To watch him get caught in this kind of scandal and to watch the effect it had on him was very difficult," the son said. "It really tore him up inside." 
Nearly 10 years later, after the collapse of the technology market, the son is facing unpleasantries that in some ways resemble those endured by his father at Westinghouse. Mr. Lego, now 44, has made wrenching job cuts at Virage. He has shrunk the company by more than half, and he struggles to keep it alive in conditions beyond his control. "I sometimes wonder whether I am haunted by those parallels," he said.
The father and son, who live on opposite sides of the country, talk to each other at least once a week by phone, the younger Mr. Lego said. "That doesn't mean I talk to my dad that often about business," he said. "Often my folks will call and just talk to my wife or their grandson." 
The son said he probably talked to his father about business once a month. "In general, our conversations tend to be strategic and philosophical, as opposed to practical," he said. "For example, I would ask, 'Dad, how did you deal with laying off people when you had to do so at Westinghouse?' and he would respond, 'Paul, these are tough things, but you have to face up to them -- remember that your responsibility is to help the company do well so that all the remaining people have jobs.' "
Mr. Lego also said that with heightened sensitivity about corporate scandals, he and his father spoke a bit less about business now to avoid any impression that inside information about Virage is disclosed. Although his father does not own any Virage stock, other family members do. "We have thought a lot about this and have taken steps to prevent any improper behavior," the younger Mr. Lego said.
He was recruited to run Virage in January 1996, a year after its founding, and has spent nearly $4 million of his own money to buy shares of the company to help buoy the price, which remains below $1 on Nasdaq. The climate for chief executives in general, meanwhile, has become stormy as the greed of a few prominent corporate leaders has tarnished the reputations of many.
"You've gone from the status where people used to respect the position and respect what you're doing to basically not having a lot of respect," Mr. Lego said. "I do take it personally." He shows pride in having known the name of each Virage employee, even when the company's head count peaked at about 240. 
Today, with 115 employees, Mr. Lego answers his own phone and works without a secretary to help slow the company's "burn rate," an Internet-era indicator for how much time is left before the cash runs out. His humble and straightforward style seems slightly incongruous in Silicon Valley, where even some dethroned technology executives make great efforts to maintain their swagger. He is described by almost everyone who knows him as a Boy Scout. 
"One of the nice things about having my dad available through all this is, here was somebody who could understand, who had gone through a very similar experience in the sense that all of a sudden the walls were coming down around you," Mr. Lego said. "I don't think he could necessarily relate to the Internet bubble, or to running a company that is only $10 million in revenue, but he could certainly relate to having to lay off bunches of people. And he could relate to going from almost feeling invincible to being in six or nine months almost a nothing."
The elder Mr. Lego, 72, now the chairman of Commonwealth Industries, is indeed sympathetic.
"Those difficult times have been a real test for Paul because most of the time these entrepreneurial I.P.O. types have been faced with how to handle growth, not faced with situations of laying off people," he said. "That's a very difficult thing to do."
This from a man who was nearly in tears as he met with angry Westinghouse shareholders before his ouster a decade ago, according to news accounts from the time.
But rather than facing dismissal by his board, the younger Mr. Lego has won praise from Virage insiders and customers for his candor.
"The impression is that Paul is a very good manager," said Brian M. Alger, a stock analyst at Pacific Growth Equities and the only financial analyst who still regularly follows Virage. (Mr. Alger says he does not own any shares of Virage, and his firm does not make a market in the company's stock.)
When the Internet boom faded, Mr. Alger said, Mr. Lego was "very forthright about what it meant and what they were going to do about it."
"That kind of transparency, which the entire company has shown, is a sign of the way Paul runs his business," he added.
Bradley Horowitz, Virage's chief technology officer and one of its founders, said Mr. Lego's openness about the challenges they face had increased understanding and loyalty among the firm's employees, even as their ranks were winnowed.
"He will go over the financials with employees at a level of minutia that is only limited by the employees' level of interest," Mr. Horowitz said.
That style was on full display as Virage prepared for its initial public offering in March 2000. While Mr. Lego was in Europe peddling Virage to foreign investors, the Nasdaq began its nose dive.
As the company's market debut was postponed -- first for days, then for months -- Mr. Lego showered his employees with e-mail updates. Virage finally went public in late June 2000 at $11 a share, about two-thirds of the originally planned asking price, according to Mr. Lego. It was one of the last companies to go public before new stock offerings just about stopped that year.
HIS openness also helped strengthen Virage's relations with what has been its most important client, CNN. 
Virage, along with Silicon Graphics and Informix (which has since been acquired by I.B.M.), were hired in 1998 to digitize CNN's huge video library and make it available and searchable throughout the network's computer systems. At the time, the half-million-dollar contract was Virage's largest account. 
But it soon became apparent that all three vendors had greatly underestimated the work required. "We were kind of the ants dancing with elephants," Mr. Horowitz said. "There was debate around Virage that this deal was a dog and we should just walk away."
Mr. Lego acknowledged the problems to CNN executives, offering to refund their money. But Kevin Ivey, then the vice president for research and development at CNN, insisted that Virage finish the job.
Mr. Horowitz said, "We probably spent a million dollars' worth of goods and engineering to win that half-million-dollar account." 
The investment has paid off. The outcome was the first successful large-scale deployment of a digital media asset-management system. CNN won an Emmy award in 2001 for its pioneering efforts in digital asset management for television news. The account has become a showcase for Virage's technology, helping to win other customers. 
"I think Paul made a decision that was going to be very unpopular among his other vendor partners by saying what needed to be said," said Mr. Ivey, who will begin a new job with the British Broadcasting Corporation in January. "Paul to me is an Eagle Scout. He's perfectly at home in Silicon Valley because he understands the business." At the same time, Mr. Ivey said, "you wouldn't be terribly surprised if you walked into the neighborhood hardware store and he was the guy behind the counter."
Despite his penchant for full disclosure, Mr. Lego is unwilling to discuss much of his recent business, helping various government security concerns manage their video holdings. Although Virage's government business has doubled since Sept. 11, that alone will not be enough to carry the company if the technology market fails to improve.
"I think we're doing a pretty good job of doing things right, but we're still losing money," Mr. Lego said. "It's very difficult to bootstrap yourself out of this without the market doing better."
He estimates that Virage has enough cash to last 18 to 24 months if revenue does not improve.
The elder Mr. Lego, meanwhile, has some advice for his son. 
" 'I think one the things you have to do is keep your wits about you,' " he said. " 'Keep as positive a frame of mind as you can, realizing that you're not responsible for all the things you're faced, with but you are responsible for dealing with it.' "

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Daniel J. Fuss and Kathleen C. Gaffney; 
Loomis Sayles Bond Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
DANIEL J. FUSS and Kathleen C. Gaffney say they aren't having any trouble finding cheap bonds for their $1.3 billion Loomis Sayles Bond fund.
 Despite the uncertain economy and tensions with Iraq, the managers say the unusually wide gap between the yields of corporate bonds and Treasury securities should narrow, with corporate bonds likely to be the winners as the economy improves. 
 Because of credit worries and an oversupply of issues, they are finding particular bargains among investment-grade and junk bonds issued by technology, telecommunications and power companies, Mr. Fuss said from his office in Boston. 
In some cases, bonds that typically yield five to eight percentage points more than 10-year Treasuries are now trading up to 20 points higher. "Obviously, these are very high-risk bonds," he said. "However, there are a few within the group that represent reasonable speculations."
The managers are also finding value in cyclical securities, which should respond favorably to a rebound in economic activity, Ms. Gaffney added. As a result, the fund, which had nearly 10 percent of its assets in Treasury securities in September, owns none today. 
The fund returned 5.7 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus 3.7 percent for its group of multisector bond funds, which own a mix of corporate and government bond issues in the United States and overseas, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 11 percent in the last 12 months, versus 5.1 percent for its group.
Mr. Fuss, 69, is vice chairman of Loomis, Sayles & Company, the fund's adviser. Ms. Gaffney, 40, is a vice president of Loomis.
They choose the fund's 300 or so issues mostly from among American investment-grade bonds. They can invest up to 35 percent of the fund's assets in high-yield, or junk, bonds; that stake is now 28 percent.
"Spreads in some parts of the high-yield universe are very high right now," Ms. Gaffney said, "although we have to be careful, with ratings surprises coming through."
The fund can also invest up to 20 percent of assets in emerging-markets and other overseas issues. That stake is now 15 percent.
The managers look for call protection, which forbids issuers from paying off the bonds within a specified number of years. As a result, they generally avoid mortgage-backed securities. When interest rates fall, mortgage holders tend to refinance loans, forcing investors to reinvest at lower rates.
The managers also seek bonds with high yields for their duration and credit quality -- say, 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more for medium-grade corporate bonds rated single-A or triple-B.
Over all, the fund's yield to maturity is 8.28 percent, versus 6.78 percent for its customized benchmark -- a weighted combination of the Merrill Lynch Government Corporate Bond index and the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master index. The government-corporate index gets two-thirds of the weight.
In September, the fund bought Norwegian sovereign debt due in January 2007 and rated AAA by Standard & Poor's. It paid 102.78 kroner, then worth $13.72, for each 100 kroner in face value. On Friday, the bonds closed at 103.90 kroner, or $14.47. The yield to maturity is 5.99 percent, versus 2.62 percent for United States Treasury securities of comparable maturity. Norwegian short-term rates are high, Mr. Fuss said, because Norway's central bank is worried about inflation. He said he would not buy more because of the risk of a decline in the currency.
This fall, the fund bought a zero-coupon bond issued by Nextel Communications and due in October 2007. The bond, rated B by S.& P. and thus in the high-yield category, added a 9.75 percent coupon in October, creating a blended yield of 14.76 percent. The managers paid $81.50 for each $100 in face value; it now trades at $92. The bond was cheap because telecommunications companies have been out of favor, Ms. Gaffney said, adding, "Over the next two years, we expect the credit to improve to BB because of the improving growth and profitability of the company."
Among cyclical companies, Ms. Gaffney and Mr. Fuss like Fort James, a unit of Georgia-Pacific that raised capital for its European operations in 1999. The managers paid 87 euros for each 100 euros in face value for the 4.75 percent coupon bond, due in June 2004. It closed on Friday at 92.50 euros. Mr. Fuss said the issue, rated BB+ by S.& P., is sharply discounted for three reasons. Many European investors are unfamiliar with this type of bond, he said, and many American investors are uncomfortable with euro-denominated debt. And many people are worried about the parent company's asbestos risk, Mr. Fuss said, adding that he thinks it is containable.

A Questioning Voice at ABB

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: OERLIKON, Switzerland 

 BODY:
JURGEN DORMANN flops about in his gray leather chair like a 2-year-old at the symphony. He is clearly not comfortable with idle chatter.
 Speed is important to Mr. Dormann, chairman and chief executive of the ABB Group, Europe's largest, and probably most financially unstable, engineering company. Because $5.5 billion of its debt is maturing this month, his first priority is to put the balance sheet and financial structure in order, fast. 
 "It is always a question of timing and value," he said in a recent interview at his office here. "Right now, we accentuate the timing; that's pretty clear." 
Mr. Dormann, a German, describes himself as a reluctant rescuer. But he appears to enjoy the challenge of saving ABB, a Swiss-Swedish company once considered the General Electric of Europe but now mired in huge debts and dysfunction from a hodgepodge of recent acquisitions. 
He stepped in as chief executive in early October when his predecessor, Jorgen Centerman, quit under pressure after eight months for failing to move quickly enough to slim down ABB. Mr. Dormann, 62, who was chairman of ABB, was asked by fellow directors to run the company.
Mr. Dorman, the former chief executive of Aventis, the large pharmaceuticals maker, has always been an impatient manager. But he speaks slowly and prefers to converse in a question-and-answer style to make a point.
"Why did my colleagues ask me to become C.E.O.? Why did I accept? Well, that is my way, how I am educated, how I behave, how I take responsibility," Mr. Dormann said. "I was chairman of the board. I took my role seriously."
Not many others at ABB seemed to take Mr. Dormann seriously at first. He has spent most of his life working in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry and knows little about, say, ABB's FlexPicker robot that makes Pepperidge Farm's Milano cookies, or its turbines and power plants. Or the circuit switchers that are used to keep New York's power supply flowing.
One Monday morning early in his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Dormann asked a colleague if ABB really had to build windmills. 
"Why?," the colleague asked.
Because, Mr. Dormann answered jokingly, they ruined his view on his weekend hike in the mountains. (He is not selling the windmill business.) 
Mr. Dormann started his career at Hoechst, a large German chemicals company, right after graduating from the University of Heidelberg in 1963 with a master's degree in economics. He worked his way up to chief executive 30 years later. The colleagues who once cheered his ascent -- he was named manager of the year in 1995 by Manager, a German magazine -- began to change their view of him when he merged Hoechst with Rhone-Poulenc, a large French pharmaceuticals maker, to create Aventis in 1997. Many Hoechst employees resented that Mr. Dormann had fused their famous German company with a French partner.
That cross-border deal occurred eight years after one of the biggest such fusions: the merger of Asea of Sweden with Brown Boveri of Switzerland to create ABB. But unlike Aventis, ABB, the house built by Percy Barnevik, the former Asea president who was the main promoter of the merger and ABB's longtime chairman, is now crumbling. 
Mr. Dormann, who acknowledges that he had a stunning lack of knowledge of ABB even though he had been on the board since 1998, made embarrassing gaffes. When he took the chief executive's job, he boldly reassured investors that the company would meet its profit target. A few weeks later, he retracted that promise. In fact, ABB had a $183 million loss in the third quarter. 
With his reputation at stake, Mr. Dormann had to face the bankers. 
"They were a hair away from bankruptcy, and he didn't flinch," said Andres Gujan, an analyst at Bank Vontobel of Zurich. "The banks were ready to liquidate if they didn't have more confidence in the next leader."
Within weeks of entering office, Mr. Dormann devised a plan for how to turn around a company that had a junk-bond credit rating and a stock that by Halloween traded at 1.60 Swiss francs ($1.08) -- less than the price of a bottle of Swiss milk. The shares have tripled since then, closing Friday at 4.85 Swiss francs. 
He executed his plan, he said, largely by deferring to his team. 
"He asked them: 'What is possible? What can you achieve?' " said Urs Diethelm, who follows ABB for Bank Sal. Oppenheim, a Swiss private investment bank in Zurich. "Then he said: 'O.K., I'll hold you to that. If people commit themselves, they have to deliver or they're out.' " 
It is no surprise that some of his employees might find him intimidating. One ABB employee privately called him steely.
To keep the company afloat, Mr. Dormann, like Mr. Centerman, has been forced to sell profitable divisions in quick succession.
In the latest sale, part of ABB's structured financing unit was bought by General Electric for $2.3 billion. ABB will use the proceeds to help pay the loans due this month. Mr. Dormann said that should tide ABB over until it completes the expected sale of its oil, gas and petrochemicals division next year. At least three companies are making offers.
Mr. Dormann's next goal is to insulate ABB from the asbestos-related lawsuits filed against its American subsidiary, Combustion Engineering. Mr. Dormann promised that it would be done in the first half of next year by throwing the subsidiary into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
In the long run, Mr. Dormann wants to shrink ABB, a far-flung conglomerate of 140,000 employees, to 100,000 employees in two businesses, power technologies and automation, that will focus on ABB's engineering strengths.
Twenty percent of ABB's business -- it expects $22 billion in revenue this year -- is in the United States, most of it unseen by the public. ABB built five 145,000-volt circuit switchers that helped Consolidated Edison rebuild the part of New York's power transmission system destroyed by the World Trade Center attack.
Mr. Dormann is a voracious reader of newspapers, in several languages, and philosophers. He said he reads the works of Max Weber, the founder of sociology, for pleasure. 
In conversations with employees, Mr. Dormann prefers to ask the questions. He excels in provoking discussion just to make his employees squirm. He stirred things up at headquarters in this quiet Zurich suburb when he suggested to a local reporter that he was considering moving the company back to its roots in Baden, a Swiss city famous for its thermal baths.
He turned heads when he told Neue Zurcher Zeitung, a newspaper, that he might sell one of the two remaining divisions if it meant keeping ABB profitable.
During the interview in his office, Mr. Dormann had a twinkle in his eye when he suggested that he would not rule out a merger if this latest restructuring plan moved too slowly.
"This is a timing issue," he said. "If you have sufficient time, if you put sufficient resources behind those two businesses to let them, will they grow? Will they grow alone or with someone else? We will see." 
He is a corporate chief executive who displays some seemingly contradictory behaviors. He exchanged the company Mercedes for a more modest model and once surprised his colleagues in London by arriving in a taxi rather than the customary limousine. On the other hand, he keeps his own wine cellar and has a penchant for 1982 Bordeaux.
In his spare time, he said, he listens to opera and hikes to keep fit. On weekends, he and his wife, Lisbeth, often make the three-hour trip to Heidelberg to visit their four grown children and seven grandchildren.
Mr. Dormann said he likes meeting employees by roaming the halls at ABB headquarters. But one manager tells of a dinner last spring where Mr. Dormann, then still chairman, spoke only to one employee he already knew.
"He didn't introduce himself to us and he left early," the manager said. "I got the impression he was kind of shy."

HEADLINE: Standing the Test of Time 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
IF you are shopping for a used car, reliability is likely to be a top priority. A new study may provide some guidance about which vehicles have held up best over the last five years.
 The survey, the 2002 Vehicle Dependability Index Study by J. D. Power & Associates, is based on responses of more than 30,000 original owners of 1998 model vehicles. The survey covers 137 potential problems. 
 This year's survey, the 13th of its type by J. D. Power, a market research firm in Westlake Village, Calif., found that 8 of the 15 most reliable brands were Japanese. Lexus topped the list for the eighth consecutive year, followed, in order, by Infiniti, Acura, Honda and Toyota. Of the other Japanese companies rated above average, Subaru was 13th, Nissan 14th and Mazda 15th.
Four of the 15 most reliable brands were domestic: Buick in 7th place, Cadillac in 8th, Lincoln in 11th and Mercury in 12th. Three of the top-rated brands were European: Porsche 6th, Jaguar 9th and BMW 10th.
Detroit's automakers have made big improvements, but they will have to do more to catch the best of the Japanese, said Brian Walters, director of product research at J. D. Power. He said the perception of strong long-term durability could result in high resale values. In addition, more than half of new-car buyers say long-term durability is an important factor in their purchases.
J. D. Power bases its rankings on the number of problems for each 100 vehicles. The average in the latest survey was 355 problems per 100 vehicles; Lexus, at the top, had just 159 problems per 100 vehicles.
J. D. Power does not release scores for companies that rank below average, although Automotive News published the entire survey list, citing industry sources. According to Automotive News, these brands ranked below average:
Ford and Mercedes-Benz (each with 364 problems per 100 vehicles), Saturn (365), Saab (373), Oldsmobile (376), Pontiac (389), Audi (392), Chevrolet and Chrysler (393), Volvo (402), Suzuki (405), Dodge (410), GMC (415), Plymouth (422), Hyundai and Jeep (449), Mitsubishi (461), Volkswagen (489), Isuzu (500), Land Rover (585) and Kia (709).
Mercedes fell below average for the first time since the survey began in 1989, according to Automotive News, dropping to 16th place from 10th last year.

A Healthier Future In Cruise-Line Shares?

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
SINCE October, cruise lines have suffered through outbreaks of stomach virus, an engine fire that ruined one ship and an incident in which a vessel ran aground and had to be taken out of service. 
 Cruises have been canceled and share prices of cruise-line companies have fallen, but some investors say the stocks are now bargains. "We do like the cruise ship industry at this point," said David Malmgren, a portfolio co-manager at Rydex Funds in Rockville, Md. "The valuations look attractive. We don't think the recent incidents have really soured people on cruises. But the recent dips look like a good entry point into these stocks." 
 The publicly traded cruise companies include Royal Caribbean Cruises and the Carnival Corporation, both based in Miami. Carnival is expected to merge next year with P & O Princess Cruises, a London company that is also traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Since their November highs, Carnival and Royal Caribbean have both fallen 13 percent. 
Gerald Cahill, chief financial officer of Carnival, says the cruise business has recovered faster than the rest of the travel industry since Sept. 11 last year. Customers "ended up deferring decisions, and bookings came back," he said. He would not comment on the effect of recent incidents on business.
Carnival would become an industry behemoth after the merger, controlling nearly half the world cruise market. Royal Caribbean, its closest competitor, has about one-fourth of the market. Under the merger plan, P & O Princess and Carnival would be dually listed and trade on the London and New York exchanges.
Anthony Socci, senior managing analyst at Dreyfus in New York, said the merger would create "an oligopoly" with "fewer pricing wars." He recommends Carnival shares, saying the company has a strong capital structure with modest debt and a cash flow of $1.2 billion. Carnival's valuation is "compelling," he said. It is now at $25.96, or about 15.5 times the last 12 months' earnings of $1.68 a share. From 1989 to 2001, the price-to-earnings ratio was 13.4 to 22.9. Robert Simonson, an analyst at William Blair & Company in Chicago, whose firm provides investment banking services to Royal Caribbean, said Carnival was a good buy because the company's price-to-book value was only 2.1, well under its historical range of 2.9 to 3.8.
John H. Escario, a portfolio co-manager at Rydex Funds, which holds shares of both Royal Caribbean and Carnival, said the industry had "strong underpinnings" and was at least profitable, as opposed to the airline industry. He said profit margins of Royal Caribbean are 8.3 percent, compared with 4.9 percent for a healthy airline, Southwest.
Carnival is even more profitable, he said, with margins of 21.9 percent.
ROYAL CARIBBEAN'S long-term debt, at $5.5 billion, worries some analysts. Glen Reid, a vice president of Bear Stearns in New York, who is neutral on the industry, said the debt could cause problems for Royal Caribbean in another economic downturn.
And T. K. MacKay, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said he was concerned that the industry might be growing too fast. "Carnival itself will increase its capacity by 17 percent next year," he said. Carnival stock would be fairly valued at about $35, he said, conceding that it was "starting to look attractive." But he said he would not recommend it as a "screaming buy" until it reached $21. 
Mr. Reid shares Mr. MacKay's concern about a possible oversupply of ships, which, he said, could lower return on investment. And any war in Iraq, he said, could hurt travel-related stocks.
Mr. Cahill of Carnival said overcapacity concerns were unfounded because demand was growing steadily. He said that a war would damage any travel business, but that it was hard to know the exact effect. "We do know," he said, "in 1991, when the gulf war took place, our business was resilient and came back very quickly."

Far From the Podium, A Wrangle Over a Debate Team

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
Rafael Kuhn, a junior at the Bronx High School of Science, can champion both sides of affirmative action and sprinkle Marxism into an economics debate. But when it comes to taking sides in a dispute that had plunged the elite debate and speech team into chaos, Mr. Kuhn is stumped. "There is no clear right or wrong in this situation," he said. "Both sides are at fault." 
 At issue are the team's volunteer coaches, mostly lawyers who cut their prosecutorial teeth as students at the school. "It's probably the most successful team, next to the Yankees, in the Bronx," said Kirby Chin, a corporate lawyer who became the acting director after the team's beloved founder, Richard Sodikow, retired in 1999. 
For the last three years, Mr. Chin and others have spent dozens of hours a week, and thousands of dollars out of their own pockets, to keep the team competitive on the national circuit. The team is ranked among the top five in the nation, according to the National Forensic League. 
 But in fall 2001 differences began to arise between the coaches and the school's new principal, Valerie J. Reidy. During her tenure, coaches say, Ms. Reidy has canceled two debate classes, failed to hire a full-time director, cut the team's budget and refused to return their phone calls. The last straw came last month, the coaches said, when the principal reinstated a speech coach, Sarah Rosenberg, over the objections of the volunteer coaches and some parents.
 Late last month, all five volunteer coaches, including Mr. Chin, resigned. 
 "It was necessary to resign," said James C. Mallios, a volunteer coach, who graduated from the school in 1992 and is now a trial lawyer. "I don't want to use the word 'dismantle,' but the administration was making it difficult for us to run the program on a national level."
 School officials defended their actions, saying they were following guidelines. "What we needed were people who understood and adhered to the directives of the Department of Education," Ms. Reidy said, "and were able to work well with all constituencies, including all administrators here." 
 Many students sympathized with their coaches, but the abrupt resignations left them struggling to prepare for two big tournaments in Chicago and Philadelphia on the weekend of Nov. 22-24. "We spent two days trying to get flights, rather than prepping," said Caitlin Bruce, a junior from Inwood. Her mother, Catherine Bruce, was among several parents who saw the principal's actions as an effort to wrest control of the hundred-member team from the outside coaches.
 Ms. Reidy has since restored the debate classes, appointed her assistant principal to run the program and picked four English teachers to coach. The students, however, complain that their new coaches have little experience in either the Lincoln-Douglas or policy debate formats, and are wholly unfamiliar with the inner workings of the rarefied debating circuit.
 Still, the students are confident they will succeed, and have already chalked up the controversy as a life experience. 
 "I've learned how to be political and not to say things that may offend authority," Ms. Bruce said, with a bit of sarcasm. "And I've learned that adults don't always resolve their differences constructively." DENNY LEE

Who Says Unions Must Dislike the Chief?

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH 

 BODY:
THERE are many chief executives that unions love to hate. Think of Jeffrey C. Barbakow of the hospital chain Tenet Healthcare, who cashed in $111 million in stock options this year but whose unionized workers complained of short staffing and jobs lost to outside contractors. Or Jack Welch, the retired boss of General Electric, whose penchant for sending jobs overseas led him to say, "Ideally, you'd have every plant you own on a barge."
 Especially in this wobbly economy, animosity between labor and management seems the natural order. Yet a handful of chiefs have somehow won over the rank and file; unions actually like them. And corny as it may sound, their secret seems to be treating unions as part of the team and caring about the members. 
 Consider Jeffrey L. Bleustein, the chief executive of Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee. In 1995, when he was president, the company established a pioneering arrangement that gave a large say in how it does its business to members of its two unions, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International. The two sides have only nice things to say about each other today.
"The partnership agreement says we're in this together instead of having the quasi-adversarial relationship" that is typical between companies and unions, Mr. Bleustein said.
When he joined the company as a vice president in 1975, he said, he tried to work with unionized employees in a way that is formalized now. "I asked people in the union what they thought about things," he said. "I didn't pick up a manual every time I wanted to do something."
The arrangement, he said, took almost 20 years to evolve.
"Instead of selecting someone as the head of the local union because he's the meanest son of a gun in town, they have to pick someone who can adequately represent the union" concerning the company's strategy and performance, he said. "It's the same with management. It's a whole new way of working if you're used to a command-and-control environment where you give orders and everyone comes to attention."
So collaborative have the two sides become that a couple of years ago, Mr. Bleustein invited the international presidents of both unions to speak at Harley-Davidson's shareholder meeting. In turn, the chief executive spoke at the machinists' convention. Sometimes, he can barely believe the chumminess. "I pinch myself and say, 'Think of what's happening here,' " he said.
R. Thomas Buffenbarger, now international president of the machinists union, remembers the bad old days before a group that included Mr. Bleustein bought out Harley from the former owner, AMF Inc.
"AMF wanted to take out of the company; they didn't want to put anything into it," he said. Today, he said, chief executives at other companies could learn a lot from Mr. Bleustein's willingness to communicate with the factory floor.
"A lot of executives who come to run major corporations have no idea what a union is about," he said. "Things break down pretty quickly."
Of course, as the recent history of United Airlines shows, any serious collaboration between labor and management can become fractious if the interests of the two sides diverge. UAL, the parent company, is 55 percent owned by its employees, and the two union representatives on the 12-member board helped block the appointment of one chief executive and force out another.
THAT said, a long history of dealing with union workers may help explain an executive's popularity with them, said Elliot J. Mandel, a partner and labor specialist at the New York law firm Epstein Becker & Green, who advises companies on how to stay union-free. Similarly, says Paula B. Voos, a labor economist and professor at Rutgers, coming from a union background fosters a natural bond.
David Freedman, the chairman of the New Brunswick Scientific Company, a maker of biotechnology research equipment in Edison, N.J., is a case in point. Before he started the company with his brother in 1946, he was a toolmaker who belonged to unions, including the machinists. "I was very pro-union," he said.
As a result, Mr. Freedman made no effort to fend off the union when it came to his company, in contrast to the usual corporate strategy of fighting unionization at every turn.
Unions like him for other reasons, too. "Sometimes, when people are dismissed, we go back to David because he has the biggest heart and he reinstates them," said Ray Koczan, the machinist union's business representative covering New Brunswick Scientific.
It wasn't just memories of growing up in a union family that made George C. Halvorson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., a friend of labor.
"I heard quite a few stories at the dinner table about labor issues on the iron range from the perspective of a shop steward," he said.
But Mr. Halvorson, previously chief executive of HealthPartners in Minneapolis, says the main point in getting advice from workers is that they know the job best.
"If we were building a new clinic in Minnesota, we would put out blueprints and floor plans for all the employees who would be affected to look at," he said. "Invariably we'd get 30 or 40 suggestions for improvement that would be very useful."
His appointment to his current job this year was hailed by union leaders like John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president. Mr. Halvorson has since conducted retreats with labor leaders on company strategy.
Of course, a chief executive is a chief executive, not a union member. Mr. Bleustein of Harley-Davidson acknowledged that if he were to start a company today, he might not welcome a union with open arms. But that's hypothetical. In the real world, it makes good business sense to keep union members happy.
That is why, when the company opened a plant in Kansas City in 1997, it not only invited in the unions but asked them to help choose the site. "For us to try to open a nonunion plant was not viable with the culture we were working on," he said.
In fact, in that factory, the local union president and the plant manager share office space.

HEADLINE: Chapter 11? Or Time To Close The Books? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
IN the last two years, more than 150 of the nation's large public companies have trooped into bankruptcy court, seeking protection from creditors while they reorganize. The process, under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, has long been praised as one that gives American capitalism an advantage over systems in other wealthy countries, which are more likely to force insolvent companies to liquidate.
 But that hardly means that there is no room for improvement. 
 A growing number of experts, having witnessed the damage to companies involved in drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings, want courts to move the cases along more quickly. Others see their point, but note that companies that have restructured in the nation's fastest-moving courts -- in Delaware and New York -- are the most likely to fail again. And experts in both camps agree that liquidation happens too infrequently. 
"We tend to be biased toward saving failing firms," said Michelle J. White, an economics professor at the University of California at San Diego. "The general view is that the United States system tends to overdo it. Often, firms tend to end up failing again after bankruptcy and probably should have been shut down in the first place."
To thwart the gradual erosion of a company's value during years of legal wrangling, some academics have proposed an entirely new system to deal with insolvent companies. They would use auctions to assess and parcel out quickly the valuable parts of the company.
Yet in the decade since they began publicizing their ideas, Chapter 11 has only grown in use, especially among big, complex companies.
The next year will be telling for the bankruptcy system. When United Airlines filed for protection under Chapter 11 last week, it not only joined the list of the 10 biggest bankruptcies in history but also brought to 7 the number of those now in legal proceedings. How those cases unfold may well influence investors and creditors, hampering the markets' recovery in 2003.
Though only eight years have passed since Congress last revised procedures for corporate bankruptcies, some recent cases suggest that more work on Chapter 11 is in order.
Consider Caldor, the former discount retailer based in Norwalk, Conn., that filed for protection in September 1995 but did not announce that it was going out of business until January 1999.
The company's assets -- including 166 stores -- were worth about $1.2 billion in 1995, versus debts of $883 million, and it ranked fourth in sales among the nation's discount chains. Most analysts expected the company, which did not have a long history of financial problems, to reorganize and survive.
Instead, the chain lost money throughout the late 1990's. By the time it folded, Caldor had sold about half its stores for about $375 million and had received $223 million for its merchandise from liquidators. 
What happened to the other $600 million in value?
"Caldor made the decision to liquidate too far down the road to really maximize the value of its assets," said Warren R. Graham, who was involved with the case and is co-head of the bankruptcy practice at Duval & Stachenfeld in New York. "If they had decided Day 1 that they were going to liquidate," he said in hindsight, "they probably would have done pretty well."
The bankruptcy process allowed Caldor's leaders to keep control of the company, however, and their strategies were not radical enough to keep up with the changing retailing environment. What's more, in the first two years of its bankruptcy, the company paid its lawyers and accountants $15 million. Its executives extracted an extra $8 million to oversee the liquidation and paid its lawyers an additional $10 million.
Mr. Graham said that not even the creditors pushed for immediate liquidation. But it might have allotted Caldor's assets to more competitive companies sooner and saved millions in fees. By the time the liquidation decision was made, the value of Caldor's stores had declined significantly.
BY holding off creditors and protecting assets from sale or seizure, Chapter 11 was intended to give insolvent companies breathing room as they tried to restructure their operations into profitable businesses. Courts oversee their affairs, and companies finance their operations with short-term loans from lenders who move to the head of the line for repayment. Creditors vote on management's plan, and only if they disapprove -- and neither side comes up with an agreeable plan -- does a company liquidate.
But the process has a huge weakness. In the last two decades, several companies -- from airlines like T.W.A. to retailers like Grand Union to building materials giants like USG -- have emerged from bankruptcy only to file again under Chapter 11. That suggests that liquidation or a harsher restructuring might have been merited the first time.
The trouble is, Chapter 11 does not prevent various stakeholders and hired-hand advisers from pursuing their own interests at the expense of the company's value -- and lengthening the whole process.
And the longer a company is in bankruptcy, the more its brand value tends to dissipate. "When T.W.A. was in bankruptcy, it wasn't the choice airline," said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a professor of law and economics at Harvard who has studied the bankruptcy process. Relations with suppliers often suffer, too. "When companies are in insolvency proceedings, then any business partner would have to deal with it with more precautions," he said.
Executives, meanwhile, may no longer have incentives to make good business decisions during a bankruptcy. "There isn't really any good way to do effective corporate governance in insolvency," Mr. Bebchuk said. "Most of the mechanisms that you hope would do the work outside the insolvency are not there." Stocks and stock options, for example, which are traditional mainstays of executive pay, offering incentives to produce profits, become virtually worthless when a company is in bankruptcy. In addition, Mr. Bebchuk said, outsiders can no longer take over the company by buying up its stock -- a powerful way of enforcing investors' will. 
The actions of shareholders, who are last in line for payment when a company is bankrupt, often combine with poor management incentives to extend the process, Ms. White said. Shareholders have to agree to any restructuring plan, she said, "so they often want to drag their feet until, just to get things done, the other groups are willing to give some slice" of the company to them.
Managers can also have an interest in stretching out the proceedings, said James J. White, a law professor at the University of Michigan (and no relation to Ms. White). They can, and often do, offer several plans for reorganization to try to stave off liquidation and the loss of their high-paying jobs -- even though their actions can be self-defeating.
"Because value is being dissipated," Mr. Bebchuk said, "the ability of the company to be a viable, going concern and compete when it comes out of Chapter 11 might be hurt."
That destruction of value hurts all creditors; they may have recovered more of their debts, sooner. Eastern Airlines, which filed for protection in 1989, was a case in point. "They went in front of a judge who viewed bankruptcy as an institution for saving firms, so they were allowed to operate for quite a while," Ms. White said. "The managers had the right to propose reorganization plans. They just kept operating, kept losing money, and there just wasn't anything left. Eventually, they were liquidated."
Almost two years passed, filled with battles among Eastern's management, employees and creditors, before the airline stopped flying. While Eastern's unsecured creditors lost about $240 million, the company paid out at least $67 million in legal fees. Eastern, once the name of the biggest airline in the noncommunist world by several measures, became a byword for corporate failure of the most grinding and humiliating sort.
Mr. White argues that liquidation should come quickly in many cases. "It depends on whether the company is in a business that is fatally flawed because of changes in the economy," he said, "versus one that just had a financial problem."
Airlines have usually fallen into the first category. "Rarely have airlines that were run well made much money in the last 10 years," he said.
An example of the second type was Federated Department Stores, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990. Proving that Federated should remain intact was not easy, said Carol A. Sanger, who is now its vice president for corporate affairs. "It was a matter of providing an awful lot of information to an awful lot of committees in a very short time frame," she said. At the beginning of negotiations, she added, liquidation was definitely a possibility. "Everything was on the table at that point," she said.
FEDERATED'S bankruptcy process, however, reached a turning point in bizarre fashion. A judge's decision to allow charitable donations by the company to continue during its insolvency -- a matter of paying out a small but symbolic amount -- acted as the acid test. Federated exited bankruptcy in January 1992. It earned $795 million on $16 billion in sales in 2000, but lost $276 million on $15.7 billion in sales in 2001, as the economy slumped. 
But properly categorizing companies at the time of their distress may be difficult, said Randall S. Eisenberg, senior managing director of FTI Consulting and president of the Turnaround Management Association, a trade group. "Certainly, things occur that weren't anticipated," he said, including economic trends, terrorism and changes in technology or competitive pressures. "I'm not sure that the current process could, by itself, identify them -- nor could any process."
"Every company is different," Mr. Eisenberg said. "I don't know whether it's fair to say that a company should go through quickly or slowly. The dynamics dictate it."
Mr. Eisenberg recounted the bankruptcy of a furniture manufacturer he advised several years ago. "Right after we filed, the industry went into a deep recession," he said. "The judge supported the company's view that it should not rush out of Chapter 11." The company reorganized at a moderate pace, left bankruptcy and is still in business.
Speed may have other drawbacks that are more difficult to identify. Delaware and New York courts have traditionally dealt with bankruptcies fastest, according to Ms. White. Yet they may render the process too easy on restructuring companies.
Lynn M. LoPucki, a professor of law at the University of California at Los Angeles, tracked the outcomes of big public companies that emerged from bankruptcy from 1991 to 1996. More than 4 in 10 that exited Chapter 11 in Delaware ended up back in bankruptcy within five years; in New York, the figure was close to 2 in 10. In courts elsewhere, only 4 percent of bankruptcy survivors filed again within five years.
This recidivism has led many experts to argue that there are efficiencies to be gained by tilting the process in favor of liquidation.
Oliver Hart of Harvard and John H. Moore of the London School of Economics, innovators in bankruptcy theory, recognized the single source of these problems of vested interests, speed of resolution and efficient choice of liquidation. Bankruptcy laws around the world, they wrote in 1997 with two colleagues, fail to separate two fundamental decisions: how to best preserve the economic value of a company and how to split up that value among its claimants. When those two conflict, insolvent companies that are economically viable can deteriorate and disappear, and weaker companies can stumble along too long.
The professors offered a new way to resolve bankruptcies, based on a two-tiered auction. As in Chapter 11, it would begin with a court's protecting the company's assets. The court would appoint a receiver to catalog all claims against the company in classes: from the creditors with the strongest rights to the company's assets (the most senior) down to its shareholders (the most junior).
The receiver then asks for offers -- either in cash or in promised shares in the company's future profit -- to buy and restructure all or part of the company. In the meantime, the receiver either operates the company or oversees its existing managers.
After making public the list of claims and any offers for the company, the receiver would issue 100 "reorganization rights" to the most senior creditors, based on the relative size of their claims. Next, the more junior creditors and investors, starting with shareholders, could buy the reorganization rights at auction.
The prices for the rights must equal or exceed shares in the more senior classes' claims on the company. The bidding claimants may buy a number of reorganization rights equal to their own share of their class's claims. An owner of 18 percent of one class of debt, for instance, could buy up to 18 reorganization rights at a unit price not lower than one-hundredth of all the more senior creditors' claims.
If the shareholders do not buy all the reorganization rights, then the next most junior class has its chance. A creditor with 7 percent of the next class of debt could buy up to seven reorganization rights, at a price not lower than one-hundredth of all the more senior classes' debts.
The creditors always make their offers to the class directly above them in seniority, whose members are then obliged to buy the rights from the next class up (keeping any leftover cash), to complete the chain of transactions. 
Consider a simple example with three classes: senior creditors and junior creditors who are each owed $100 as a class, and shareholders. If shareholders offer to buy 20 reorganization rights, they must pay $2 each for a total of $40, which they give to the junior creditors. The junior creditors must buy rights from the senior creditors, who are obliged to sell them at $1 each -- enough to pay off their debts. The junior creditors receive 40 rights, of which they deliver 20 to shareholders and keep 20 for themselves. They may then buy the remaining 60 rights from the senior creditors at $1 each. The most senior creditors are always paid first, because they hold the reorganization rights initially.
After the auction among the creditors, another auction takes place that allows outside investors to buy reorganization rights. Again, the prices paid must cover the holders' claims. When this auction ends, all the company's stocks, bonds and loans are canceled; only the reorganization rights remain. The final holders of the rights vote on the announced restructuring plans, which may include liquidation, and the company's bankruptcy process has ended.
The whole process should take about four months, the professors estimated. No one can draw it out, and the rights to reorganize the business are sold to the highest bidder. 
The auctions-based approach has received much attention in academic circles, yet it has not gained much support among policy makers. "It's not clear who is the strong, organized body of interests who would support such a reform," Mr. Bebchuk said, "because the benefits would be diffused in a very big way."
LAWYERS who earn millions in fees under the current system, and managers who can cling to control of their companies, may provide powerful political opposition. "They are very organized," Mr. Bebchuk said, "and they don't have an interest in reforming the system."
Nonetheless, he said, the professors' system and later models of its kind could stand up to the naysayers. "Some people criticize market-based approaches as leading excessively to liquidation, and liquidation has this negative connotation. But it might lead to a more efficient restructuring."

Clean Your Closet and Save on Taxes

BYLINE:  By KARL RUSSELL 

 BODY:
There's still time to lower your 2002 tax bill, possibly by donating used clothing, books and other goods to charity. But how much should you deduct for those old maternity clothes or too-tight jeans? 
 The Internal Revenue Service stipulates that donations should be deducted at the fair market value and suggests that taxpayers use prices at thrift and consignment stores as a guide. 
 At least one company, Income Dynamics of Omaha (www.incomedynamics.com), does that research for you. It produces a booklet and software that provide suggested values for about 2,000 commonly donated items. For instance, it values a pair of womens jeans in fair condition at $8, and a mens silk tie, also in fair condition, at $5.
 This year, the company said, prices for many used goods declined, possibly because of the sluggish economy. KARL RUSSELL

HEADLINE: North Korea Can't Wait 

 BODY:
A combination of factors makes North Korea uniquely dangerous. It has an unpredictable and untrustworthy dictator, an economy in free fall and a two-track nuclear weapons effort that appears more advanced than Iraq's. One of those tracks, a secret uranium-enrichment program, was uncovered in October. The other, built around plutonium reprocessed from spent reactor fuel, has been closed since 1994, by agreement with the United States. Now it seems about to be reopened. On Thursday, Pyongyang announced that it was immediately reactivating a sealed power reactor that could produce one to two bombs' worth of weapons-grade plutonium per year. 
 This development requires an energetic diplomatic response from the Bush administration. The joint declaration on Friday by Mr. Bush and South Korea's president that the North's actions are unacceptable is accurate, but not enough. Washington seems to think that it can afford the luxury of deferring the North Korean problem until it has finished disarming Iraq. It cannot. 
 The starting point must be diplomacy. Military action would risk a violent North Korean response that could be ruinous to South Korea. It could also endanger Japan and the 100,000 American troops currently based in northeast Asia. Diplomacy coercive enough to work is hampered by the stubborn unwillingness of most of North Korea's neighbors to consider tough sanctions. These obstacles must somehow be overcome, and there is little time to lose. 
Restarting the reactor is bad enough. What would be even more alarming would be ending the current international monitoring of North Korea's spent fuel and of a nearby plutonium-reprocessing plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency is working hard to keep those monitors in place. To succeed, it must have the United States' wholehearted support. 
North Korea claims that it needs the power reactor to replace electricity lost when the United States and other countries recently suspended fuel oil shipments because of the enriched-uranium deception. Sending the international monitors home and allowing plutonium reprocessing to resume would leave no doubt that nuclear weapons production was North Korea's real and only agenda. 
The White House must now mobilize an all-out diplomatic effort to prevent that next step from being taken, enlisting as much help as it can get from Russia and China, the two countries with the greatest influence in Pyongyang. If North Korea is not compelled to change course and abandon both of its nuclear weapons tracks, it could soon be producing several nuclear bombs a year. It currently has long-range missiles that threaten Japan and might one day be upgraded to reach parts of the United States.
The world is a complicated place, with multiple dangers, and the United States cannot always choose to deal with them in sequential order. At best, the Iraq crisis will not be resolved for many more months. Dealing with the North Korean weapons threat cannot wait that long. The danger is too grave and immediate.

HEADLINE: Death To Dictators 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Sometimes you're reading the newspaper and a quote just jumps out at you. I had that experience last week while reading an Associated Press story from Iran about the mounting student protests against Iran's hard-line clerical leaders. Deep in the story, I came upon this sentence: "On Sunday, more than 2,000 protesting students chanted 'Death to dictatorship' and condemned anew the death sentence against a prominent university professor."
 I had to rub my eyes. Did I read that right? The Iranian students who had practically invented the chants "Death to America" and "Death to the Great Satan" had -- on their own -- changed the tape. Now they are chanting "Death to dictatorship." And because they are, there is hope for the post-9/11 world. 
 No, I am not getting carried away by one chant. Iran's hard-line clerics have the power to crush the student-led democracy movement anytime they please. Yes, Iran's bad guys have all the power to do that -- but none of the legitimacy to do it. And that is why they are hesitating. The hard-line clerics have lost their legitimacy with a wide swath of Iranians, particularly the young, who have concluded that it's their own hard-liners -- not America -- who are to blame for Iran's economic woes, political paralysis and isolation.
The Iranian students chanting "Death to dictatorship" may not be able to do anything about it, but the fact that they've identified their real problem as their own bad mullahs, not outsiders -- and their real solution as true democracy, not some rigged Islamic version -- is a big change. When Arab Muslims on the other side of the gulf draw the same conclusion -- that it is their own autocrats, religious fanatics and education systems that are holding them back, not America -- we will be on the road to curing the madness of 9/11.
What are the chances of that? Some days they feel very low. Look at the shameful comments just made by Saudi Arabia's interior minister, Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, who told a Saudi weekly that the Zionists "are behind these events" of 9/11. Yes, yes, there were 15 Saudi hijackers, but the Jews did it. How pathetic. It is that sort of escapism -- "Death to the other guy" -- that has retarded Arab development for decades.
But here's the good news. The events of 9/11 have had a bigger impact than you might think. They have intensified something I would call "the conversation" among Arabs and Muslims. It has been going on in private for years, but lately some courageous voices are taking it public -- shouting in their own press, "Death to the old lies."
Consider a strong piece that just ran in Okaz, a major Saudi daily, by the columnist Abdullah Abu Sameh, who decries the fact that Muslim extremists "have stuffed the minds of some of our youth with a fanatic ideology and a faulty interpretation of Jihad -- that it is a tool to oppress and dominate others." He quotes an essay in the Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat by the gutsy Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, who said that while Saudis were shocked to find so many of their youth involved in 9/11, "it is better to confront the fact than make excuses. . . . The cause of the radicalization of our youth was the culture of violence that has infiltrated religious education, deviating from the traditions of the conservative . . . Saudi society." To regain peace and reconciliation with the world, Mr. Abu Sameh said, "our youths must be re-educated and violence -- a concept alien to our society -- must be discarded." Translation by Memri. 
Or consider a fine piece in Al Ahram, the main Egyptian paper, by Usama Ghazali Harb, who says the Muslim world's predicament today is not the result of some external plot but the fact that "while the vast majority of Muslims keep silent, an extremist minority has hijacked the faith and is steering it into a confrontation with the world. . . . These extremists are supported by conservative forces that fear progress and modernity." What the Muslim world desperately needs, Mr. Harb says, is a progressive model that works -- a role Egypt could play even better than Iran. "But," he asks, "is Egypt ready to assume such a role?"
We should not exaggerate the influence of these writers or ignore it. We should understand that they are there, that 9/11 has emboldened them to emerge and that the quicker we get this Iraq thing over, and the more we can quiet the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the more their "conversation" will gain momentum.
Wish them well. They're our best hope for change from within -- which is the only change that matters.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In criticizing taxes, Mr. Feldstein says they cause people to spend large sums on housing and to put unnaturally high value on company benefits because of the tax advantages they offer. 
 Indeed, these tax breaks encourage individual home ownership and company retirement and medical plans because these are considered essential to American well-being. Tax incentives also allow people to get these things through the private sector, relieving government of the burden of providing them. Paternalistic? A bit. Good government? Absolutely. 
 Conservatives, it seems, prefer tax cuts for the rich over breaks for middle-class housing, health and retirement.

HEADLINE: South America Region Under Watch for Signs of Terrorists 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CIUDAD DEL ESTE, Paraguay 

 BODY:
The Triple Frontier where Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay meet has long been South America's busiest contraband and smuggling center, a corrupt, chaotic place where just about anything from drugs and arms to pirated software and bootleg whisky are available to anyone who can pay the price. 
 Its reputation has brought the area under close surveillance by the police and foreign intelligence services for decades. But since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Triple Frontier has been transformed into a sort of Casablanca, a center of intrigue scrutinized more intensely than ever for its suspected links to Islamic terrorists. 
 Argentine and American officials describe the area, with its large Arab immigrant population, as teeming with Islamic extremists and their sympathizers, and they say those businesses have raised or laundered more than $50 million in recent years for terrorist groups. Their Brazilian and Paraguayan counterparts are more ambivalent, however, and say they need more evidence that the area has been used by terror groups in the past as a financing, logistical and recreation center. 
 In a sign of increased United States attention, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Cofer Black, is scheduled to visit the Triple Frontier on Dec. 18. 
In such a hotbed, the authorities say that nearly as plentiful as Islamic extremists since Sept. 11 are the spies and intelligence agents of a half dozen countries -- from China to the Middle East to the United States. "There are so many of us now that we are bumping into each other," a senior Argentine official said last month.
The question on nearly everyone's mind, especially after a map of the region was recovered from a Qaeda safehouse in Kabul, Afghanistan, is whether Osama bin Laden's operatives are also among those operating here. Acting on what they say was a tip from the United States last July, the Paraguayan police arrested a pair of Lebanese men, Ali Nizar Darhoug and Muhammad Daoud Yassine, who are uncle and nephew and were said to be raising funds for Al Qaeda. 
Paraguay has no antiterrorism law, and Mr. Yassine was released and is reported to have left the country. Mr. Darhoug, owner of a perfume store and a pharmacy, is being held on tax evasion charges. "So far, nobody has been able to prove a single thing against me," he said after a bail hearing here late last month. "I'm not accused of terrorism and I'm not involved in terrorism."
Early this year, the frequently sensationalist Paraguayan press reported that Al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist groups had set up training camps; and, more recently, they have also talked of a secret terrorist summit meeting here. Intelligence officials monitoring the region are skeptical of such reports, though they acknowledge that Islamic fundamentalists are indoctrinating the region's young Muslim residents in extremist ideology. 
But intelligence officials do say they have noticed worrisome signs that Islamic extremists are fanning out, especially to nearby countries that have established Arab or Muslim communities. Mentioned most often are Iquique, Chile; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and Maracaibo, Venezuela. At the same time, a parallel dispersion to smaller towns within the region also seems to be taking place. A recent Argentine intelligence report mentions Uruguaiana, a Brazilian town on the border with Argentina south of here, and Cascavel, also in Brazil, as well as Pedro Juan Caballero in Paraguay, as places where Muslim merchants with suspicious connections have surfaced. 
What worries them most, intelligence officials say, are signs that Islamic extremists are also gravitating toward Sao Paulo, a bustling city of 18 million that is home to the largest concentration of Brazil's estimated 1.5 million Muslims -- an ideal hiding place for anyone intent on being overlooked. 
Officials say the Triple Frontier has been used for years both to collect and launder money for terrorist groups and for mafias, as well as providing a haven for fugitives.
More than 20,000 Middle Eastern immigrants, most from Lebanon and Syria, live in the area. Many operate small businesses on the Paraguayan side, but the most successful commute daily across the bridge from homes in Foz do Iguacu, a tidy Brazilian city of 250,000 where neighborhoods are dotted with halal butcher shops and women walk in headscarves. There are a pair of Islamic schools there, four Arab language cable television stations and a gleaming mosque with a gold-tinted roof on Palestine Street. 
Terrorists sought in the Middle East have been sent to the Triple Frontier to hide out in comfort, using fake passports or other documents manufactured in some of the same local workshops that also make phony credit cards, intelligence officials say. 
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terrorist group, appears to be the dominant group in the area. But according to a recent Argentine intelligence report, "support activities" on behalf of Hamas, Amal and the Party for Islamic Unification have also been detected, and there is also evidence that Egypt's Islamic Brotherhood has used the area as a haven. 
Since 1999, two men said by Egyptian authorities to have been central figures in the terrorist attack in Luxor that killed 58 tourists -- El Said Hassan Mokhles and Muhammad Ibrahim Soliman -- have been arrested here and are in custody. 
In June, the Brazilian police also apprehended Assad Ahmad Barakat, a Lebanese businessman who is said to have been a Hezbollah enforcer and money launderer. The Paraguayan police raided his electronics store less than a month after the Sept. 11 attacks, but Mr. Barakat fled across the border to Brasilia, where he is fighting extradition. 
Local officials say that money Mr. Barakat took from merchants was forwarded by local banks through the United States and Canada to Hezbollah accounts. 
When the Paraguayan authorities first raided Mr. Barakat's shop, among the items they found was a letter from Hezbollah acknowledging receipt of $3,535,149 from Mr. Barakat in 2000. One of Mr. Barakat's employees, Sobhi Fayad, is in custody on charges of having illegally transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to the United States.
But Muhammad Youssef Abdallah, a Lebanese businessman who is the founder and caretaker of the main downtown mosque here, says the Triple Frontier is the victim of an unfair image stemming solely from its large Arab population. 
"We have nothing to do with Hezbollah here, and Hezbollah doesn't need money from the people here," Mr. Abdallah said in an interview in a 19th-floor office above the mosque, from which all three countries were visible. "Their money comes from Iran, so they don't need to take anything from hungry merchants in a far-off place like this." 
There are also indications that Islamic terrorist groups may have been using the Triple Frontier as part of a clandestine communications networks. In little more than a year, the Brazilian police have shut down a dozen telephone switching operations here and in other nearby cities, which experts say could be used to evade American satellites monitoring telephone traffic. 
In October last year, for instance, the police in Maringa, about 125 miles to the east, detained a 33-year-old unemployed waiter who said he had been hired in Foz do Iguacu by a Lebanese businessman to rent a house and install telephone lines to switch telephone calls to and from the Middle East. Phone records indicate that much of the traffic involved countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 
"I would get an international call, and the person would ask in English to call another number," the waiter, Ederaldo dos Santos, told the Brazilian newsmagazine Epoca. 
Of the three countries that converge here, only Argentina has been attacked by Islamic terrorist groups. The Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was blown up in 1992, killing 28 people, and in 1994, the main Jewish community center in the Argentine capital was also destroyed, killing 86 people in what is still the world's worst anti-Semitic attack since the end of World War II. 
According to the secret testimony of a defector from Iran's intelligence agency, offered to Argentine investigators during interrogations in 1998 and 2000, both bombings were organized by the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires. But Argentine intelligence and police reports have concluded that at least part of the planning took place in the Triple Frontier and involved a pair of Lebanese immigrants who still live and work here. 
Based on an examination of telephone records, Argentine investigators found "evidence of coordination between the Triple Frontier area and 'sleeper cells' in Buenos Aires," in the words of a confidential government report obtained by The New York Times. Two main centers of activity were cited: the principal mosque in Foz do Iguacu and a travel agency there operated by Mr. Abdallah and the man who was then his partner, Farouk Omairi. 
Mr. Abdallah acknowledged the phone traffic but said his former partner, Mr. Omairi, was responsible for all calls that were made to Iran or the Iranian Embassy and that none of the contacts with Iranian officials had to do with the terrorist attack. "He was trying to put together a business deal to sell them chicken," Mr. Abdallah said. 
In a separate interview, however, Mr. Omairi, who now runs another travel agency in Foz do Iguacu, said, "This is all news to me. I don't remember having talked with anybody like that, and I don't know anything about any attack. Everybody is always picking on the Triple Frontier. Just because you're Lebanese doesn't mean you're involved with Hezbollah."

HEADLINE: Michigan Law Dean to Lead Cornell 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Jeffrey S. Lehman, dean of the University of Michigan Law School, will become president of Cornell University in July, Cornell announced yesterday. 
 In his role as a dean at the University of Michigan, Mr. Lehman is a defendant in a lawsuit over affirmative action that the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear. 
 Cornell said Mr. Lehman, a 1977 graduate, is the first Cornell alumnus to become its president. He succeeds Hunter R. Rawlings III, who has been president since 1995 and will return to teaching and research. 
Cornell is the latest in a string of universities, including Columbia, New York University and Yeshiva University, to name a law dean or lawyer as president.
Mr. Lehman said his legal training probably helped him to be comfortable with ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. Like Columbia's president, Lee C. Bollinger, and N.Y.U.'s president, John Sexton, Mr. Lehman was a clerk at the Supreme Court before entering teaching; he worked under Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Now he is deeply involved in preparing Michigan's case for the Supreme Court hearing next spring.
Affirmative action is an issue Mr. Lehman has lived with closely for a decade. In 1992, as a junior faculty member, he served on a committee to revise the Michigan law school's admissions procedures, an experience he remembers with affection. 
"It was an intellectually stimulating experience -- to think deeply about the purpose of an institution of higher education," he said. "You don't often get to do that; often, institutions carry on by inertia."
Since 1997, when a white applicant sued the law school, saying it had rejected her in favor of minority students with lesser credentials, Mr. Lehman has been active in defending the school's admissions practices. In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld its procedures.
Mr. Lehman said he had confidence in the legality of the school's admissions process because race was only one of many factors it considered. He noted that in the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke decision, on the medical-school admissions procedures at the University of California at Davis, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., writing separately, specifically said that public colleges could consider race if they were trying to ensure a diverse student body for educational purposes.
"I understand what motivates our critics," Mr. Lehman said. "I understand what their discomfort stems from. But where we part company is that our critics feel that any deviation from colorblindness is simply intolerable, even if it means that schools like ours do a much worse job teaching students to be leaders in an integrated society."
A mathematics major at Cornell who spent his junior year in France, Mr. Lehman has a ready sense of humor and was an avid game player in college. As a freshman, he said, he spent many nights playing Monopoly with Jay Walker, a friend across the hall (who later founded Priceline.com). During winter break the next year, the two wrote a book, "1,000 Ways to Win Monopoly Games."
Mr. Lehman graduated with distinction and went on to earn degrees in public policy and law at Michigan, where he was editor in chief of The Michigan Law Review. Besides working for Justice Stevens, he was a law clerk in Portland, Me., for Chief Judge Frank M. Coffin of the United States Court of Appeals. He also practiced law for four years at Caplin & Drysdale, a Washington law firm, before returning to academe.
In 1987, he joined Michigan's law faculty, where he focused on policy issues like higher education financing, corporate taxation and welfare reform, working closely with Sheldon Danziger, a Michigan economist. Mr. Lehman also helped create a clinical program for law students to assist community groups in economic development and developed a course in transnational law that is required for Michigan's J.D. degree. 
During Mr. Lehman's tenure as dean, the law school received $82 million in cash gifts, and its endowment grew to $204 million from $79 million. Last year, the school won the American Bar Association's award as public interest school of the year. The son of two lawyers, Mr. Lehman is also president of the American Law Deans Association. 
He said that it is too early to have a specific agenda for Cornell, but that he hopes to continue to focus on public service and transnational issues, which he believes already have an important place at the university.
Mr. Lehman said he had not been looking to leave Michigan, since there was more to accomplish. But he said that with a father who had also attended Cornell and a son, Jacob, who is a freshman there now, he felt a deep kinship with it. "It so happens that Cornell is the other institution that I have this irrational emotional attachment to," he said.
Mr. Lehman said he looked forward to the Cornell presidency because research universities "have a tremendous impact on the human species."
"The research that takes place," he said, "in the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, and the professions, all makes a difference in how people live everywhere in the world."

HEADLINE: Economics Remain No. 1 in the Business of College Sports 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
The marketing director from Coca-Cola, John Egan, said, "Corporate involvement means better experiences for more athletes." The president of CBS Sports, Sean McManus, said, "Commercialism is not the opposite of integrity." I thought I was back in Nascar until Jeremy Foley, the athletic director of the University of Florida, said, "You have to look at us as a piece of the pie; we are not more important than the English department."
 The audience, mostly beefy, middle-aged white men, nodded at the inside joke. The English department? How many outdoor stadium seats would those pencil-necks fill, even for the cockfights of literature, a poetry slam? For two days last week at a forum called "Balancing Academic Standards, Athletics and Economic Realities," I could imagine the future underworld of higher education where a football team recruits a university to make it proud. 
 The sensibility of the forum, which was hosted by the indispensible weekly trade paper SportsBusiness Journal, was best summed up by Deborah Yow, the athletic director of the University of Maryland, who said that the responsible A.D. tries to "minimize danger to the brand."
How many Division I-A English departments have to protect a brand after their scholar-scholars are involved in an eligibility scandal, booster payoffs, date rape, drunken binges, a student-betting ring or just tearing down the goal posts?
I needed the pick-me-up. My Heisman Trophy hopeful, Byron Leftwich of Marshall University, hadn't even made the cut of five finalists invited to New York for last night's announcement. Leftwich only led the nation in total offense and completed 69 percent of his passes for 4,019 yards, 26 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.
He looked terrific doing it behind a line that couldn't always protect him long enough and a defense that didn't always get him the ball back quickly. After injuring his left leg a month ago, he kept playing even when teammates had to carry him to the line of scrimmage. But the sportswriters who vote on the Heisman (should they be voting on an award in a sport they cover?) went for better-known players whose major conference schools appear more often on national television. Marshall is in the lightweight GMAC Bowl Tuesday night. But Leftwich need not worry; he is expected to be an early and expensive pro draft choice.
I dwell on this to deflect the accusations of Thundering Herd fans that Leftwich's candidacy was damaged by recent columns here about Marshall's problems with the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Marshall's violations for "impermissible employment of academic nonqualifiers at rates four times the prevailing wage, academic fraud and a lack of institutional control" were punished last year primarily by the loss of a few football scholarships. 
That's old news. What remains interesting is the business-as-usual climate in which the infractions took place. The rich booster who financed the payoffs, Marshall Reynolds, told me he has been hiring athletes for at least 10 years at the athletic department's behest. He paid them $100 a day and didn't dog them if they didn't show up. He was barred from associating with the athletic department for five years.
Reynolds and the compliance officer, David Ridpath, who apparently had no way of knowing about the violations unless the booster, a coach or an athlete snitched, were publicly embarrassed, and may sue. Meanwhile, the men in charge -- most notably Marshall's president, Dan Angel, and the football coach, Bob Pruett -- roll on.
If I had any illusions about Marshall, a lower middle-class striver in this jock-industrial complex, they were purged in the SportsBusiness Journal forum. The event was staged so the paper's publisher, Richard Weiss, and John Genzale, its editor in chief, could mingle with readers like Maryland's Yow, a believer in "reputation management," who in turn could network with the marketing guru Rick Burton, who is concerned about the "eroding brand image because of how athletes are perceived."
College football and basketball players, those "unpaid professionals," as a leading sports economist, Andrew Zimbalist, dubs them, were physically absent. But they filled the empty spaces between thoughtful and provocative discussions about Title IX, gambling, beer money, $1 million coaching salaries and the $200 million needed to bring Ohio State's facilities up to code and fat-cat comfort. If you wanted to see big men squirm, just bring up payment for the "scholar-athletes." 
This is where "amateurism," the 19th-century sports sect whose outworn ideology is still used to control athletes, rubs up against the branding needs of a modern athletic department that has to pay the mortgage on a 21st-century stadium. No wonder it wants to keep its labor costs down with N.C.A.A. rules that forbid slipping the boys some pizza money.
Bill Byrne, the former athletic director at Nebraska, who moved on to the same post at Texas A&M, doesn't even like to call what he does a business. If it were truly a business, he said, he would be able to fire the kid who missed the field goal that lost the big game. Byrne, wry and righteous, was involved in one of the few touchy exchanges among men who want to do business together.
Ralph Cindrich, the former N.F.L. linebacker, was explaining how badly some athletes needed lawyer-agents like him. "Some of these guys can't read or sign a contract," he said.
Byrne of Nebraska snapped, "Speak for yourself."
Cindrich smiled as he said, "I've represented guys from Nebraska."
Now there's a brand.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Almost Traded, Griffey May Still Go

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. could be traded by the Cincinnati Reds at the winter meetings here, he could be traded before spring training, he could be traded before the season begins or he might not be traded at all. But there is no longer doubt about the notion of Griffey's being traded, because the Reds were poised to deal him less than two weeks ago.
 The once-inspiring tale of Griffey's return to Cincinnati for a nine-year, $116.5 million contract at below market value has taken a messy turn. 
 Three years after Griffey's homecoming, the relationship between the franchise player and the franchise has been bruised because the Reds tried to send Griffey to the San Diego Padres for third baseman Phil Nevin. Nevin is a solid player, but he hardly has Griffey's credentials. 
And Cincinnati would surely be thrilled if the Yankees or the Atlanta Braves suddenly had an interest in acquiring Griffey and the $79 million remaining on his contract. Those are the teams Griffey told associates he would prefer if the Reds felt it was necessary to unload him. But Griffey has also told those same people he wants to stay in Cincinnati. 
Griffey did not realize he was almost a Padre until Nevin, who had almost a week to ponder moving, rejected the idea. The Reds told Griffey they were not trying to trade him, even as they were.
"My only problem with the Reds is the lack of courtesy and protocol," said Brian Goldberg, Griffey's agent.
The Reds would have saved about $55 million by exchanging Griffey's contract for Nevin's. Although the Reds will play in the new Great American Ballpark in 2003 and can use an attractive player like Griffey as a centerpiece, they are pleading poverty and pondering moving their biggest jewel.
General Manager Jim Bowden cruised through the crowded Opryland Hotel here Friday, barely stopping for a handful of reporters as he told them he would answer questions later. A few hours later, Bowden declared that he had not come here to trade Griffey. A few seconds later, he added, "That being said, we'll trade anybody if a team overwhelms us."
What is his definition of being overwhelmed? Did the Padres overwhelm him with Nevin, who hit 41 homers and was an All-Star in 2001 and slumped to 12 homers in 2002?
Goldberg chatted with the owner Carl Lindner after the trade evaporated and claimed "there's a lot of disarray" in how Lindner's baseball executives are operating.
John Allen, the chief operating officer, called Bowden "a very aggressive general manager" and praised his creativity. 
Again, this is about finances. Allen said the Reds received $10 million through revenue sharing last season and would receive substantially less in 2003. Cincinnati had a $45 million payroll last season and would need to increase it to over $60 million to keep its remaining team intact. But it is believed the Reds want to keep it at $50 million to $55 million. Trading Griffey would save the most money.
"One of the deals publicized would have saved us $55 million," Bowden said. "That buys a lot of players."
But does $55 million buy another Griffey? When healthy, he is one of the best players in baseball. Obviously, the question is whether Griffey, who has played in 181 games in the last two years, can rebound and remain on the field for 150 games or more. Allen was asked if a stable Griffey would be an excellent ambassador for a new stadium. 
"In a perfect world, if you have unlimited resources," Allen said. "Again, it's how you spend the dollars you have. What do you do with the 50-something million you would have had?"
How did this happen to Griffey? How did he become expendable? After hitting 40 homers and knocking in 118 runs in his first season with the Reds in 2000, Griffey has been hampered by injuries and has been far from a force.
He hit .286 with 22 homers in 2001 and hit .264 with 8 homers last season, incurring the wrath of fans along the way. Before Barry Bonds had two of the most amazing seasons in history in 2001 and 2002, Griffey was considered a better player; he averaged 52 homers and 142 runs batted in over his last four seasons for the Seattle Mariners. Now Griffey is treated worse than Nevin. 
Because the economic climate has changed so drastically, the Reds see Griffey as a 33-year-old player who is making $12.5 million a year and who has not contributed much for two seasons. They see an opportunity to chop their payroll and create flexibility. Allen mentioned the Oakland Athletics and the Minnesota Twins, low-payroll teams that reached the postseason, as clubs to mimic. Neither had a player making as much as Griffey.
"We have limited resources, just like many teams do," Allen said. "It's how we best spend the money we have. That's the key."
Still, one National League executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said: "I think it would be close to a disaster for them to trade him now. They have to give him a chance to come back and show if he's healthy with them."
Griffey declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article, but he told Cincinnati reporters last week that "I haven't gone anywhere" and the trade talk is "over." Not really. Bowden acknowledged that he would discuss potential trades for any player, including Griffey, and Allen said the Reds do not regret nearly completing the trade.
While Goldberg said Griffey was "a little bit hurt," Allen claimed the relationship was not harmed.
"I think we're fine," Allen said. "Junior is our center fielder. He'll be there on opening day. He'll be our center fielder in the Great American Ballpark."
He will? So Griffey is off the trading block? When Allen was asked if he was guaranteeing that Griffey would be a Red in 2003, he hedged.
"I don't think anything will happen, but, right now, that's where we're at," he said. "There are 16 weeks to go before the season starts. That's a long time."

HEADLINE: As State Budgets Break, Pain Trickles Down 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: CORVALLIS, Ore., Dec 9 

 BODY:
Seventh-grade members of Westland Middle School's ad hoc budget committee were deliberating proposals for another round of cuts to present to the school board. The board shut 3 of the city's 15 schools this year. It has cut kindergarten to half a day, eliminated all middle school sports but track and stopped the "drown proof" swimming program that was created to help children survive a fall into the Willamette River.
 "In kindergarten, you would bring a box of Kleenex for everyone to use," Aaron Gable said. 
 "If kids brought in other supplies ---- " Alex Hoffman began. 
"The entire class could use them," Ariel Vance-Borland said. "I think we could have the cleaners not pick up trash."
"Or do the vacuuming," Andrea Kozak said.
"We could do that ourselves," Ariel said.
"We really don't want to lose electives," Andrea said.
"If we want to be an artist, we can take an art class," Ariel said.
"Electives are the most important part of school," Aaron said.
As these 12- and 13-year-olds have learned, these are days of difficult choices in Corvallis, a tidy, comfortably well-off town of 52,000 about 90 miles south of Portland. What they may not know is how much Corvallis is like everywhere else in the country.
In this slow economy, with unemployment up to 6 percent and the big capital gains of the flush 1990's evaporating, tax collections have plunged, forcing most states to grapple with the biggest budget deficits since World War II, according to the National Governors Association.
The effects of the national slump have tumbled to the biggest cities and smallest towns and places between, like Corvallis, where the abstractions of daunting budget numbers have become personal and concrete.
City Hall, in the core of Corvallis's lively downtown, made $482,000 in cuts this year from a $30 million budget, and $2.3 million in cuts are on the list for next year. Revenues are running $3 million less this year than last, largely because of nearly frozen property tax revenues. Cuts in revenues the state sends the city have just begun. The city's rainy-day fund, the savings that cover unexpected spending, had $15 million two years ago and has now all but disappeared.
So far, one of three police officers has been removed from the schools, repainting of lane and crosswalk lines along the often fog-shrouded streets has been stretched to once a year from every six months, and contributions to support a playground, a baseball field and an environmental information center have stopped.
A program to maintain trees downtown and prevent Dutch elm disease has been chopped by $63,390. Volunteers have taken over much of the work in the parks, the library and the fire department. Working 20,000 hours a year, volunteers save the parks department the $350,000 annual cost of 11 employees.
To date, the biggest target has been the fire department. The city has set aside $1.6 million to build a new station in the fast-growing northwestern quadrant of the city. Construction has been delayed because money to staff the station had been purged. Because construction costs are outpacing the interest the city collects on the fund, said Helen Berg, Corvallis's nonpartisan mayor, the station will cost more than the $1.6 million once it can be built.
Construction of a $490,000 fire department drill tower and training center was scratched this year, too. In the face of the deficit's new discipline, the department buys most of its vehicles used. "Why send a brand-new truck into a burning field?" asked Nancy Brewer, the city finance director.
Dan Campbell was promoted to fire chief this year from assistant fire chief. The assistant position might never be filled, he said, because others can take up the slack.
Corvallis is far from alone. Preparation for expected state budget cuts and the cuts arising from other state programs, like the state-run but mostly locally financed public employee retirement plan, and the toll of the property tax referendums in the 1990's, are forcing cuts and disruptions of valued services in local governments all over the country.
"States are pushing their problems down," said Nicholas Jenny, a fiscal analyst at the Rockefeller Institute. Most cities and towns did not share in states' big income tax collections of the 1990's, Mr. Jenny said, and "now they're getting the worst of all worlds."
Mayor Berg said: "I'm discouraged. We pride ourselves as a city that takes care of each other, and we're not going to be able to do as much." 
Corvallis's biggest employers, with about 4,000 workers each, are Hewlett-Packard and Oregon State University. It is a please-and-thank-you, let-me-help-you, low-speed-limit, low-unemployment, quite prosperous town, and nicer than most. In the dead of winter, motels heat their outdoor swimming pools. A sign on the door of a Texaco convenience store says it will not take food stamps. But the sign adds, "Sorry for the inconvenience." 
In the last fiscal year, through June, state tax collection dropped 6 percent while spending rose 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, voters are resisting tax increases to keep the spending going while state advocates of the poor and sick speak of catastrophe and crisis.
Because of plunging tax revenues, a tide of red ink in the state's generous pension program for public employees, and referendums curbing increases in local property taxes, Oregon has been slammed.
Now, for the fiscal year ending in June, analysts in Oregon expect the deficit to exceed $400 million and reach $2.3 billion in the two years ending in June 2004, or 16 percent of projected spending. Like nearly all states and unlike the federal government, Oregon cannot allow deficits to accumulate year upon year, so it must look for a mix of spending cuts and tax increases to bring the budget into balance. The legislature has scheduled a public referendum Jan. 28 on a three-year income tax increase, but polls show it failing.
People here have high expectations for public service. The city's asphalt streets, layered with bicycle lanes and right and left turn lanes, are crack and pothole free. At large intersections, pedestrians press a chrome button big as a lemon to cross. Promptly, the walk sign appears, and an electronic canary chirps them along. On intersection sidewalks, the city has begun laying slightly raised red strips, precisely perpendicular to the street, to help steer blind pedestrians along the crosswalk. 
But for some residents -- students, teachers, the old, the disabled, government workers -- this has become an anxious town. Tim Turcaso, 36, speaks, reads and maneuvers slowly. One afternoon, four days before his high school graduation 18 years ago, he drove into a head-on collision, spun around and slammed into another head-on collision. "My egg -- my brain -- was shaken up," he said. "It put me in a deep coma for a month."
It also put Mr. Turcaso in an Oregon Department of Human Services category called developmentally disabled. After the hospital, he went to a state-subsidized group home. Then he moved into a conventional apartment, where state-subsidized counselors visit to help him get along and manage his money. "I hold money like water," he said. Counselors organize social affairs for him, too, and take him out for breakfast or lunch, one on one.
Mr. Turcaso goes to work now, on a bike, at the Taylor Bakery Oven, a nonprofit, upscale cake and cookie store with round maple tables for customers.
"I'm a dishwasher slash cake maker slash cookie scooper slash and whatever else they want me to do," he said. He makes about $460 a month, less than the minimum wage, but enough to pay most of his way. 
Schools, universities, services for the disabled and elderly, and prison and juvenile delinquency programs are high on the hit list. Among the old, the mentally ill and people with disabilities, "the people the state has targeted to cut are those who live in homes of their own or with their families," said Timothy J. Rocak, the chief executive of Cornerstone Associates, the nonprofit business that operates the bakery and eight other employers of the developmentally disabled in Corvallis. 
To date, Mr. Rocak said, budget cuts have been limited to a halt in cost-of-living wage increases. But if voters reject next month's income tax referendum, the legislature has approved more than $300 million in spending cuts to take effect Feb. 1.
Without the state's support, Mr. Turcaso said: "I'd have trouble staying on track. I couldn't work. For the most part, I'd be hunting for bottles and cans in ditches" to collect the deposit. 
At the fire department, discretionary overtime, used when firefighters come in off duty for training, has been stopped. Some training, too, has stopped. "How do we provide confined-space rescue, like lifting people trapped in manholes?" Chief Campbell asked. "Do we raise our hands and say, 'We can't go there? The money was cut for training for that?' No. We can't say, 'We don't do that anymore.' " Two of three fire prevention officers, who inspect new construction, are high on the hit list. Without them, he asked, how many fires would have occurred?
Cuts are coursing through other budgets that touch the town. Benton County has cut contributions to some nonprofit organizations, like one that traps errant wild animals. The county sheriff has eliminated some command positions. With the bigger anticipated cuts, Patrick Cochran, the county budget manager, said: "State courts, which counties house, are talking about nine-hour, four-day weeks instead of eight-hour, five-day weeks. We could have to hold weekend offenders a day longer."
With the deficits, civic values have begun shifting and clashing. In November, voters rejected a $1 property tax increase on $1,000 of the value of their homes, which would have cost them an average of $170 a year. In May, they rejected a motor vehicle tax. The same voters, however, demand more services. 
"Sometimes the liberal position runs together with the conservative position," said John S. Nelson, the city manager. " 'We want this street repaired.' They agree on that. But we can't agree on a funding source. That to me is an argument that the tax system is broken."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 15 about the effects of the slow economy on one town, Corvallis, Ore., misspelled the surname of a disabled resident who worried that the state might close a program that provides him with counselors, and misstated the name of the bakery where he works. He is Tim Torcaso, not Turcaso; the workplace is Taylor Street Ovens, not Taylor Bakery Oven.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Yao's Success Speeds N.B.A.'s Plans for China

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
When the Houston Rockets won the N.B.A. draft lottery last June, and the right to select Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6 center from China, with the first pick, Les Alexander, the Rockets' owner, said breathlessly in a phone call to the team president, "This is going to be the biggest individual sports story of all time."
 Hyperbole aside, Alexander understood the potential magnitude of Yao's presence in the National Basketball Association and in Houston. Now, six weeks into his rookie season, Yao leads the league in shooting at 59 percent, routinely achieves double figures in points and rebounds, and has impressed opponents with his skillful passing and defense. The Rockets are back in the playoff hunt, attendance is slowly rising and the 22-year-old Yao is the early favorite for the league's rookie of the year. 
 Just as he has changed the opinion of many who doubted him early, Yao has also altered the N.B.A.'s marketing approach in a fundamental way. Primarily because of him, teams realize they have to court ethnic groups in a more urgent and sophisticated manner, at a time when attendance is static or declining in professional sports. Meanwhile, Houston has become the centerpiece of the league's China strategy and its long effort to expand its business into the world's largest consumer market and fastest-growing economy. 
"It's the largest population base in the world by a fair amount; on top of that, we know there are a lot of basketball fans there," said Russ Granik, the N.B.A.'s deputy commissioner. "On any long-term basis, you've got to consider China about as important a market as can be."
Yao's potential to influence fan interest and marketing growth is already being seized upon by the Rockets, other teams and the league itself.
*The Rockets are hiring four Mandarin-speaking executives and have built billboards that are in Yao's native language. They are planning a weekly radio show in Mandarin along with a Web site diary and a weekly videotaped interview with Yao in both Chinese and English. The team also hands out ticket and statistical information in Mandarin at its games.
*The Golden State Warriors, with an Asian population of 1.5 million in the Bay Area, have offered ticket plans of three and seven games linked to appearances by Yao. Public-address announcements were made in English and Mandarin for a Rockets game there on Nov. 27, and Yao delivered a videotaped message thanking fans for coming to see him.
*Of the 120 N.B.A. games that will be broadcast in China this season, 30 will involve the Rockets. Some games have the potential to reach up to 280 million households, roughly equal to the entire population of the United States. This gives corporate sponsors a chance, through advertising placards being shown on television, to gain entry into a consumer market of 1.2 billion people.
*For the first time, Chinese fans will be allowed to vote for the 2003 All-Star team, which could lead to electronic ballot box-stuffing for Yao, though he said he hoped to earn a berth on merit.
Not given to understatement on this subject, but recognizing the enormous new opportunities Yao presents, Alexander, the Rockets' owner, calls his team "the best co-branding opportunity in the world."

An Open Lane to the East
Yao is the most prominent of three Chinese players in the N.B.A., and he represents for many ordinary Americans -- at least American sports fans -- the new openness in China as it enters the World Trade Organization and tries to balance a Communist political system with an increasingly market-driven economy.
"It is a bit of a burden, but I realize it's a responsibility I have to shoulder," Yao said through a translator before collecting 17 points, 15 rebounds, 4 blocked shots and 3 assists and rescuing a 103-96 victory over Sacramento on Tuesday.
He has become hugely popular here for his pleasant nature, unselfishness, work habits and humility ("You can't say I've succeeded; I've just started.") He smiles, patiently signs autographs and answers reporters' questions, speaking some English, putting a human face on China in a similar way that the gymnast Olga Korbut offset the stereotype of the stern Soviet visage with her joy and tears at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Of course, any transition to a new culture, with a new language, presents complex problems. Yao's mother lives with him, providing emotional support and his favorite meals of pork chops and chicken soup, but he admits to being homesick. The constant media attention can be wearing, the personal questions intrusive. He does not like to talk about the wristband that his girlfriend gave him or a special bike being made to fit his long legs. He diplomatically avoids answers to cultural questions that might affront anyone, though he is quick to criticize the notorious Houston traffic, which gives an entirely new meaning to clogging the lane.
Asked about his most difficult or unexpected adjustment to the United States, Yao said, "Having to drive so much in traffic."
He does not yet have a driver's license and is chauffeured by his translator, Colin Pine. Yao does practice driving in his suburban neighborhood. During these times, Pine said: "I sit in the car and fear for my life. Just kidding."
Away from basketball, Yao prefers video games and reading. With one-liners, he has been quick to make light of his cultural adjustment. Yao found the turkey breast somewhat dry during his first Thanksgiving, suggesting that the feet might have been a more prized delicacy, as with poultry back home. An avid Starbucks fan, he joked that he was disappointed on the team's first trip to the coffee capital of Seattle, having expected his favorite frappuccino to be available on the team bench.
"In six short weeks, he went through the same process that many of us went through when we came to this country," said Michael Chang, who immigrated from China 17 years ago, owns a computer business here and has organized the Yao Ming Fan Club. "A lot of us come here to work for corporate America, and we are doubted, yet we are the same caliber in our fields that he is in his. His experience resonates with us."
Houston has growing ties to China with its energy and medical businesses and its port. In 1960, only about 1,000 Asians lived in the Houston area, said Gordon Quan, a Chinese-American who is the city's mayor pro tem. That figure has grown to an estimated 300,000 in and near the nation's fourth-largest city, with the largest Asian groups being ethnic Chinese from Vietnam and immigrants from China. Houston has not one Chinatown but two. And while Asian-Americans have made significant economic and political gains, Quan said they still faced slights that perhaps Yao's presence might help to ameliorate.
"During the spy plane incident, radio D.J.'s were saying don't go to Chinese restaurants," Quan said. "It doesn't take much to stir underlying prejudices. I think people like Yao can build a bridge of better understanding. He will represent what China is to a lot of people -- big, powerful, smart, talented. These are traits people like to be associated with."

A Signature Autograph
The Rockets have put on a full-court press to attract Asian fans locally, nationally and internationally. The team developed an advertising campaign with the slogan "Be Part of Something Big," a reference to Yao's height and the team's expected revival.
Local fans, however, are still growing accustomed to receiving Yao's autograph in Chinese characters. When he signed dozens of life-size posters, the Rockets received two calls from people saying that someone seemed to have been doodling on their souvenir.
Other teams, particularly those on the West Coast with large Asian fan bases, are also attempting to capitalize on the growing interest in Yao. His presence in Seattle drew a block of Asian-American fans and helped the SuperSonics sell out a game the night after Thanksgiving.
The Golden State Warriors drew their largest attendance of the season for that Nov. 27 game against Houston. The team had fans fill out forms to win a Yao jersey in a raffle, and in doing so identified 6,000 new potential ticket-buyers.
"It's becoming a significant evolution, especially in cities with large ethnic bases," Robert Rowell, chief operating officer of the Warriors, said of marketing to ethnic audiences. "I don't think it's different for Eastern European players than Chinese players, but if you have a strong market, you're remiss if you don't tap into it."
Translating fan interest into ticket sales will be a gradual process in Houston, team executives acknowledge. The Rockets entered this week trailing every team but the Atlanta Hawks in attendance; the team was hurt by the arrival of the Houston Texans football team, fallout from the collapse of Enron and complacency that developed from years of sold-out houses in the 1990's.
Still, with Yao's presence, the future appears promising. Television ratings are up 30 percent, attendance is up 1,000 fans a game, and ticket plans involving a full season or partial season being sold to Asian-American fans are up threefold. For a game to be played on Feb. 2, at the time of the Lunar New Year, the Yao Ming Fan Club has reserved a block of 2,000 tickets. In November, the Rockets trailed only the champion Los Angeles Lakers in traffic at the 29 teams' individual Web sites.
Alexander predicts that Yao will be "bigger than Michael Jordan in the world; not in the U.S. but in the world." He added, "There are so many Asians, he'll be the biggest athlete of all time."
No one else will make such assertions, but the basketball and marketing possibilities seem vast. Houston has signed a sponsorship agreement worth a minimum of $1 million a year for six years that will make a Chinese beer, Yanjing, the only imported brew served at Rockets games. Exclusive arena advertising for the beer is provided courtside. Sales in Houston have jumped tenfold in a few months, said Rich DeCicco, president of Harbrew, a Long Island-based importer of the beer.
"Since our affiliation with the Rockets, they literally cannot keep beer on the shelf," DeCicco said. "And we've got an interesting bounce back in China. People are seeing the beer they drink every day on television in the United States. They wonder what's next, air-conditioners, refrigerators?"
Yao's signing by the Rockets has not gone unnoticed by the upper reaches of China's political leadership. On a visit here in October, Jiang Zemin, China's president, said he hoped the Rockets would win the N.B.A. championship. He also met with Yao while delivering an address on bilateral cooperation at Texas A&M. Alexander said he thought that Jiang himself signed off on allowing Yao to play in the United States.
This is hardly a mere cultural exchange. Chinese basketball officials hope that Yao will be groomed to help China win a medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. They are also seeking marketing advice and cash. The Rockets paid $350,000 to Yao's Chinese club team, the Shanghai Sharks, for his rights. According to reports, he will pay half or more of his $15.6 million, four-year contract to Chinese governmental and sports bodies. Chinese citizens are also closely following Yao for symbolic reasons not directly related to basketball, said Steven Lewis, an Asia expert at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
"They are wondering: 'Where do we stand in the world? Are we going to be a great power?' " Lewis said. "Yao is a Chinese person going abroad to live and work among foreigners. The Chinese middle class -- 500 million people -- they look at how they are opening up to the world and they know that they, too, will have to go into the world and face the hardships of competition."

Praise Starts to Flow
In the N.B.A. itself, early skepticism has given way to praise and expectation. After Yao delivered 16 points and 13 rebounds against his Philadelphia 76ers last Saturday, Coach Larry Brown said: "It's hysterical. A kid from China knows how to play and we've got kids in America who have no clue that are playing in our league."
Frank Williams, the coach of the Phoenix Suns, said of Yao: "It is scary. I keep thinking, Shaq might be done in a few years and now we're going to have to deal with him."
If the league's teams do not relish dealing with Yao, the league's front office is fairly panting at the opportunity. The N.B.A. has been conducting friendship tours with China since the mid-1980's and has broadcast its championship series live there since 1994; coincidentally, that is when Houston began back-to-back championship seasons and Yao began to follow Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon. This season, N.B.A. games and programming in China will be carried on 12 networks.
The league has just opened an office in Beijing, is planning exhibition games in China in the near future and will soon begin a Chinese version of its Web site, NBA.com. Traffic from China accounts for the second greatest number of international visitors to the league's Web site.
"What they are starved for is Yao Ming content, and we're producing it," said George Postolos, president of the Rockets. "We're going to find a way to get it to them for promotional purposes, because we know we benefit from people saying this is the most watched team in the world, this is the most popular team in the world, this is China's team."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: THE SCENE; 
Threat of Strike Sends Shoppers Into Early Rush

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
With a transit strike looming in New York tomorrow, battalions of anxious buyers swarmed the city's retail emporiums, toy outlets, bike shops and grocery stores yesterday in a scramble to finish Christmas shopping early, to stock up on food and other supplies and to look at alternative wheels, just in case.
 Despite an overcast sky and a cold, misty drizzle, there was a Christmas Eve mood in the mid-December day, as if thousands of last-minute shoppers had been caught in a time warp 11 days early. Many were lined up for 6 a.m. openings of department stores, and they were out for more than stocking stuffers. 
 Transit strike accessories like comfortable walking shoes, windbreakers, in-line skates and Razor scooters were selling briskly. So were milk, bread, eggs and other perishables that often disappear from supermarket shelves just before a major snowstorm. 
"I think they are going to strike, and we live in Brooklyn, so we had to come today," Art Neri, a tired veteran of the shopping wars by late morning, his arms laden with packages from F. A. O. Schwarz and Macy's, said at Herald Square. "I don't know how long they'll strike, but we are going to be ready."
No breakthrough was reported yesterday in negotiations at the Grand Hyatt Hotel between Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways and buses. Indeed, there were conflicting reports on how the talks were going, with the M.T.A. and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg speaking of progress, and the union accusing management of "bad faith" and saying that the talks were deteriorating. Page 57. 
A strike by 34,000 transit workers would not only paralyze the nation's largest mass transit system, forcing 7.2 million daily riders to scramble for alternate ways to get to work and school, but would also severely damage the city's economy at the height of the Christmas shopping season. The around-the-clock talks were expected to go down to the wire, with the possibility of a strike anytime after the union's contract expires at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. Roger Toussaint, the union president, and Gary J. Dellaverson, the chief management negotiator, were said to be talking intensely, and 21 subcommittees were poring over wages, pensions, worker safety, disciplinary procedures and other issues.
Elsewhere, on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, huge throngs waited to get into Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Disney, J. Crew, Banana Republic, Tiffany and Lord & Taylor. Outside Radio City Music Hall, Salvation Army bells rang and Frank Sinatra's mellow voice filled the air with "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."
"We thought we'd better get into the city before the strike," said Jean Cruthers -- the mother of Frank P. Cruthers, the chief of the New York City Fire Department -- who was waiting for a bus outside St. Patrick's Cathedral with two friends from Long Island. They usually get together just before Christmas, she said, but "we couldn't be doing this if there was a strike."
A survey of bicycle shops around town found some window-shoppers, but few buyers. "They're waiting to see what happens," said Don Muraco, the owner of A-Bicycle Shop on West 14th Street. He added, "I think this could happen all at once -- at 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon."
Times Square was packed with people, and the Toys "R" Us flagship store at 44th Street was jammed elbow-to-elbow. Many shoppers said they would have been out yesterday, with or without a transit strike impending. Some tourists said they were unaware of strike talk, but many New Yorkers in the crowd said the threatened strike nagged them.
"I don't believe it's going to happen," said Eddie Borroughs, of Brooklyn, "but I am usually one of those 'wait until the last minute' shoppers, and this made me come out a little early just to be safe." He had bought a radio and a Nintendo game for his children, and was "90 percent done" with Christmas shopping.
At Macy's Herald Square store, shoppers padded like armadillos against the morning cold were waiting more than an hour before sunrise for the doors to open at 6 a.m. Therese St. Juste, 63, of Brooklyn, was one of them. She spent the morning pushing through piles of merchandise festooned with gilded pine branches and "50 percent off" signs.
"In case of a strike, I have most of the things I must have to entertain," said Ms. St. Juste, carrying packages containing silver salt-and-pepper shakers, gold table linens and a hurricane lamp. Still, she was hoping there would be no strike, so she could return for a soup tureen and a short fur coat.
By 10:30 a.m., another Macy's shopper, Jean Wade, was already heading for the exit, lugging sweaters for her children and a paper shredder for a friend. She had started at 7 a.m., just to be sure. "I don't think there'll be a strike," she said, "but I couldn't take a chance. If the strike is on, my Christmas is made. I'm set."
The line outside F. A. O. Schwarz, on Fifth Avenue and 58th Street, stretched east to Madison Avenue by 9 a.m., and Jim Buonagura, 31, of Babylon, N.Y., said he was glad he had been able to get his family into the city beforehand. 
"If there was a strike, you could be sure we wouldn't be here," he said, as his daughter, Victoria, 4, beamed at the Barbie dolls and his son, Nicholas, 21 months, gurgled at Bob the Builder toys. Mr. Buonagura said they planned to see Central Park, the Bronx Zoo and the tree at Rockefeller Center. "We're going to get it all done this weekend," he said.
A sign in the window at Pedal Pusher Bicycle Shop at 69th Street and Second Avenue's window proclaimed: "Transit strike? Please don't wait until the last minute." Roger Bergman, the store's owner, said he would stay open today as long as there were customers.
Koyo Tamaki and his wife, Momoko, came to the shop to rent an attachment that would convert his bike into a tandem, so that he and his 6-year-old daughter, Sakura, could pedal together two miles to her school on 25th Street. "He said, 'Let's have some fun with this,' " Ms. Tamaki recalled.
Connie Miller, a school nurse for Rodeph Sholom School on West 79th Street, was preparing for a family ride tomorrow, too, if there is a strike. She said she and her daughter, Ingrid, 7, would cycle along the Hudson from their home in Greenwich Village, a distance of about three miles.
Supermarket chains, anticipating the crush, had prepared by ordering extra supplies of staples, aware that trucks would be banned from entering Manhattan from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. if there is a strike.
Many strike preparations were going on behind the scenes yesterday. Some corporations and law firms were reserving hotel rooms for indispensable personnel, and many companies were setting up bicycle storage spaces for those who would be riding bikes to work.
Other quiet preparations were going on in homes, where laptops and other computer hookups might make commuting unnecessary for some.
In a strike, the customary choreography of commuting would be gone, so millions of people who normally worry only about whether their trains and buses will be on time were mapping new personal strategies to get to and from work -- carpools, ferries, company-chartered buses, pickup and dropoff points, walking or biking routes, and the thousands of other mundane and ingenious alternatives to the subways and buses.
Peter S. Kalikow, the transportation authority's chairman, and Katherine N. Lapp, its executive director, went to the Grand Hyatt for the first time yesterday to discuss strategy with Mr. Dellaverson. "The talks are ongoing and are making progress," said the authority's spokesman, Tom Kelly.
Mayor Bloomberg, who has said a strike could cost the city economy up to $350 million a day during the peak of the Christmas shopping season, concurred. "Progress is being made," he told reporters in Queens. "Whether the progress is sufficient to come to a decision by the deadline, I don't know."
But Ed Watt, the union's secretary-treasurer, painted a bleaker picture, saying the authority had offered no counterproposal despite the union's willingness to accept somewhat lower wages. The union originally demanded 8 percent raises in each year of a three-year contract, but has offered to accept annual increases of 6 percent.
While the talks were described as around-the-clock negotiations, both sides said Mr. Toussaint and Mr. Dellaverson were resting from time to time to be fresh and at their shrewdest when the crisis comes tonight or early tomorrow.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: NEGOTIATIONS; 
Talks Continue, Though Sides Don't Even Agree if Progress Has Been Made

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The transit workers union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority held intense negotiations all day yesterday, with the two sides clashing over whether progress was being made.
 Union officials said there was no progress, while a spokesman for the transit system, which faces a possible shutdown at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, insisted that progress had been substantial. 
 The union, representing 34,000 subway and bus workers, has threatened to paralyze the nation's largest transit system through an illegal strike if no new contract is reached.
At an afternoon news conference at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, where the negotiations are being held, the secretary-treasurer of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, Ed Watt, accused management of undermining efforts at progress by taking some proposals off the table. 
"We think they've gone from not bargaining in good faith to actually bargaining in bad faith in these negotiations," Mr. Watt said. "We view this as a bad sign."
Officials with the two sides said that the local's president, Roger Toussaint, had met repeatedly yesterday with Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's chief negotiator.
Shortly after 10 o'clock last night, Mr. Dellaverson held a brief news conference and said that during committee meetings yesterday, "important headway" had been made in three areas: sick leave, discipline and economics." In answer to a reporter's question, he said that by economics, he meant "pay raises."
"I feel quite good about it," Mr. Dellaverson said, but he would not say if the authority had moved off its insistence of a wage freeze in the first year of a three-year contract.
An hour later, Mr. Watt stood at the same podium and said union negotiators "do not share Mr. Dellaverson's optimism at this time."
"There has been no substantial progress to report today unfortunately," Mr. Watt said. He repeated his earlier assertion yesterday that negotiators are "where we should have been a month ago."
The union has sought a wage increase of 6 percent a year for three years, while the authority, saying it faces a $2.7 billion budget deficit, has called for the first-year wage freeze and raises in the second and third years, but only if the union agrees to productivity increases.
Neither side would comment publicly on their widely differing interpretations of yesterday's talks. One M.T.A. official suggested that the union was stressing a negative interpretation to make the authority appear inflexible and help solidify support among moderate union members for a walkout should it come down to that. Union officials explained the authority's more upbeat assessment by saying that it was trying to weaken support among moderates for a strike.
On Friday evening, Justice Jules L. Spodek of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn issued an injunction barring the union from going on strike and saying the workers would face the fines spelled out in the Taylor Law. That law bans strikes by public employees, including transit workers, and fines workers two days' pay for every day they strike. The injunction also raises the possibility that union officials and even members could be jailed for contempt of court if they walk out.
In addition, the city's corporation counsel has filed a lawsuit that seeks a fine of $1 million on the first day of a strike, doubling each day thereafter, from the union. The suit also seeks $25,000, doubling each day, against each worker who strikes.
A lawyer for the union, Arthur Z. Schwartz, said yesterday that he filed papers yesterday seeking to overturn the injunction, asserting that it violated union members' rights under the First Amendment. 
Brian McLaughlin, the president of the umbrella group of city unions, the New York Central Labor Council, held a news conference and, echoing the transit workers' union, called on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki to get involved in the talks.
"It's time for the parties to sit down," Mr. McLaughlin said, "time for the mayor to play a role, time for the governor to play a role."
Mr. Bloomberg declined to get involved, saying, "The governor and mayor really bring only money to the table, and neither of us have a lot of money at the moment." Mr. Bloomberg also said that "progress is being made" in the negotiations.
Responding to accusations from the union that he has increased tensions by directing harsh words and threats at it, Mr. Bloomberg said: "We're not here to inflame the situation. We are here to protect the rights of all eight million people, and we will do that carefully, methodically."
He also responded to a comment Mr. Toussaint had made on Thursday calling for Mr. Bloomberg to "shut up" because, in the union leader's view, the mayor's comments were hurting the negotiations.
"My job is to not shut up," Mr. Bloomberg said. "My job is to represent the interests of eight million people."

Finding Rewards in the Job, Not the Pay

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin 

 BODY:
IF you know how to find out how much money was spent last year on advertising aimed at children or how many foreign students are enrolled in American universities, you might -- just might -- be able to work at Harper's Magazine for a few months. That is, if you could also successfully complete the rest of an elaborate application that tests writing skills as well as detailed familiarity with the magazine.
 If accepted, you will be given interesting assignments enabling you to work closely with the magazine's editors and develop valuable professional contacts. 
 There is a catch, though: you will be expected to work full time without pay. 
Despite this drawback, about 150 people, most of them college graduates, applied for 12 internship slots at the magazine during the past year, said Rachel A. Monahan, an assistant editor at Harper's. "It sometimes frightens me to see what qualified people we reject," said Ms. Monahan, herself a former intern.
It is nothing new for people to work without pay while attending college, say, while studying acting. But in this tough economy, many young New Yorkers find that having excelled at top schools is no longer enough to impress a future employer, and more are seeking unpaid work after they graduate.
"I wouldn't say it's a huge trend," said Jane B. Celwyn, the director of career development at Barnard College. "But the fact that we're hearing it at all is something relatively new."
Graduating seniors are facing the worst job market in two decades, she said. And an already dismal job outlook is expected to worsen. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, a research organization, employers in the Northeast responding to a recent survey said they expected to hire 8 percent fewer graduates this academic year than they did last year.
No one knows the number of unpaid interns in New York, but they can be found at museums, public radio stations and research institutions as well as magazines.
One enterprising Duke graduate and biology major, Ben Tweel, 23, effectively created his own internship at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center by offering to work as a volunteer laboratory technician. While job hunting, Mr. Tweel noticed that interviewers would pull his resume out of a stack of 50 or more. "I realized I had to make myself stand out," he said.
Mr. Tweel finds the work very rewarding and says that after only two months, his job prospects have greatly improved. But he also knows that he enjoys an unfair advantage, since not every job-seeker can afford to work without pay. 
"I am in a pretty fortunate position where my parents have helped me stay on my feet," he said.
One of the Harper's interns, Sam Frank, 22, lives with his mother in Hoboken, N.J. "She knows I'm doing real work here, not wasting my time," he said. "So she's totally fine with it." By contrast, he said, the summer internship he had at the New York Press while he was an undergraduate at Yale consisted mainly of entering listings data and opening mail.
Under the Federal Labor Standards Act, employers who hire unpaid workers are supposed to make sure that they provide useful training. But Rochelle K. Kaplan, the general counsel for the National Association of Colleges and Employers, said the requirement probably did not apply to nonprofit organizations and is virtually unenforceable, anyway. "What intern is going to bite the hand that could possibly feed them?" she asked. 
Even so, employers say they try to make the internships meaningful. At the Museum of Modern Art, many interns get to do research, but they also come in knowing they will be stuffing envelopes and working the copy machine, said Amy Horschak, a museum educator. But supervisors are encouraged to spend time telling the interns what purpose the routine task is serving.
"They would be more than happy to pull out the staples," she said, "if they understood what it was for."
One intern at the Modern, John Migliore, 28, said that he felt fortunate that his job in the film and media department required a minimum of menial work. Still, Mr. Migliore, who got his bachelor's degree from New York University in 1998, when the economy was far stronger, said he never imagined then that he would one day be working without pay.
"If you had said that to me," said Mr. Migliore, who does freelance copywriting on the side, "I'd have laughed at you."

HEADLINE: Questions of War 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Capital Makes Up Its Mind," by Timothy Garton Ash (Op-Ed, Dec. 12):
 Foreign policy discussions today have an almost surreal quality. 
The question of launching a pre-emptive war seems academic. It is too late for pre-emption, as I realize each time I drive on the New Jersey Turnpike and see the "empty sky" in Lower Manhattan. 
 We are at war. The only question is how to hit the bad guys to prevent them from hitting us again. I don't know if war on Iraq will stop Osama bin Laden, but a nuclear-armed Iraq is worth preventing. 
I am against war to correct the mistakes of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, or to ensure the flow of oil, or to distract attention from bad Republican economic policies. However, I think this war is also about preventing Midtown from looking like Downtown and making sure that the Lincoln Memorial doesn't share the Pentagon's fate.

 BUSH AT WAR
By Bob Woodward.
Illustrated. 376 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $28.
 THE 100-day campaign to oust the Taliban from Afghanistan, summed up a year after the fall of Kabul, seems a model of military efficiency and economy. Starting from scratch within a day or two of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, the team reporting to President Bush came up with a plan, recruited allies, persuaded reluctant nations bordering on Afghanistan to serve as launching pads, sent in covert action teams, began bombing the Taliban's paltry handful of military assets on Oct. 7, galvanized the Northern Alliance, sweet-talked Pashtun tribal leaders to switch sides, chased the Taliban out of Kabul on Nov. 13 and installed a friendly interim government under Hamid Karzai three days before Christmas. What could be cleaner than that?
But watched day by day from inside the White House, as recorded by Bob Woodward in his remarkable new book, "Bush at War," the campaign was halting and full of alarms, a hastily assembled patchwork of old ideas. Chief among them were heavy leaning on governments that would have preferred to keep out of it, bombing and then more bombing, stack upon stack of $100 bills for tribal leaders and a strategy of let's-you-and-him-fight. These various strands were held together by a confident president who believes his job is to know what he wants, stay one jump ahead of his team and keep pushing until the team, and then the world, fall into step behind him.
What's remarkable about Woodward's book is the same thing that was remarkable about many of his others -- extraordinary access to secret documents, like contemporaneous notes of National Security Council meetings, and to high officials, including President Bush, who submitted to a 2-hour-25-minute interview of lively give and take. Woodward says he himself asked questions or interjected comments 300 times. Also quoted repeatedly in the book are many other officials -- the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice; Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his deputy, Richard L. Armitage; Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz; Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet and his chief counterterrorism expert, Cofer Black. But the rules of the game mostly prevent Woodward from naming his sources, which, in any given instance, might be an official document or something remembered by a cabinet secretary or the recollection of words overheard by an assistant two or three levels down the food chain.
In one typical example, Woodward describes a National Security Council meeting on Oct. 16 in which Rumsfeld insisted that the military was following the C.I.A.'s strategy in Afghanistan. Oh no, Tenet's deputy, John McLaughlin, said, "our guys work with the CINC" -- that is, the commander in chief in the field, Gen. Tommy R. Franks. "We're supporting the CINC. The CINC is in charge."
"No," Rumsfeld countered, "you guys are in charge. . . . We're going where you tell us to go."
After the meeting, according to Woodward, Rice took Rumsfeld aside and said, "Don, this is now a military operation and you really have to be in charge."
The earlier quotations might have come from N.S.C. minutes, but what about Rice's chiding of Rumsfeld for being sulky? It would be nice to know who told Woodward that, but more important is the question whether it is true. 
Woodward has been writing books in roughly this way for 20 years, and during that time he has rarely been attacked by his subjects for getting things wrong. In the present case Rice and Rumsfeld were both there; either or both could say it never happened, but both have been silent. The lack of protest, combined with Woodward's reputation, inclines me to trust his account as solid until something else comes along that says different with footnotes. Accepting "Bush at War" for what it is -- something akin to an unofficial transcript of 100 days of debate over war in Afghanistan, with omissions of unknown significance -- then what does it tell us about the character of President Bush and his government, and what does it tell us about the war they are planning to fight next? It is my sense that the answer in both cases is: quite a lot.
Over the last several months, as the administration talked first of attacking Iraq without further delay, but then with much foot-dragging agreed to consult with the United Nations and finally to give Saddam Hussein a chance to submit to the Security Council's tough new resolution, I sometimes imagined that it was all an elaborate charade following a well-constructed script. Woodward's account of the internal argument over attacking Iraq, a kind of coda to his book, persuades me it wasn't so. Far from being deeply hidden, what these men believed and wanted was so close to the surface that even the newspaper-reading public knew roughly how the argument was unfolding. Rumsfeld wanted somebody to hold his coat so he could start throwing punches, Cheney growled that inspections were a waste of time, Powell was distressed by his colleagues' apparent willingness to toss 50 years of American commitment to collective security out the window, while Bush, listening to the inner voice he has grown increasingly to trust, gradually tipped in the direction of regime change, and once he got there, said so loud and clear.
It worked pretty much the same way following Sept. 11. As the administration prepared to go to war it was the tough talkers who set the tone, and none talked tougher than Cofer Black, who described the C.I.A.'s plan for a no-holds-barred antiterror campaign to Bush only two days after the fall of the World Trade Center. "When we're through with them," he said, "they will have flies walking across their eyeballs."
But as the war unfolded a degree of caution and restraint emerges in Woodward's description. What the administration mainly feared was the Q word -- quagmire -- meaning American troops in division strength trapped in an indecisive war. But at the same time they wanted "boots on the ground" -- actual Americans carrying guns inside Afghanistan -- lest they be convicted of following the pattern set by President Bill Clinton, frequently derided by members of the Bush team as an ineffectual wimp for responding to earlier Qaeda attacks with a flurry of cruise missiles that blew up empty tents. "Pounding sand" was what Rumsfeld called that. 
Squaring this circle was not easy. First inside Afghanistan, according to Woodward, was a C.I.A. covert action team run by Gary (no last name), an old hand fluent in Dari and Pashto. The team spotted targets for the Air Force, urged on the Northern Alliance and distributed cash to friendly warlords -- not "the usual $200,000," but twice or even five times as much, in foot-high stacks of $100 bills, 20 stacks to the million. The Army was slower off the mark; weather, unidentified logistical problems, the long struggle to get a Combat Search and Rescue Team center up and running in Uzbekistan, delayed boots on the ground until well along in the war. 
Rumsfeld, meanwhile, was focused on "target sets" for American bombers, which the Air Force hit and then rehit while advisers with the Northern Alliance kept asking for strikes on the Taliban forces blocking the road to Kabul. At the time, in October and November 2001, there was much speculation in the press that the Air Force was ignoring the Taliban on the northern front as a matter of deep policy -- a way of convincing Pashtun warlords in the south that defeat of the Taliban did not necessarily mean the triumph of Tajiks in the Northern Alliance. Not so, Woodward says. Rumsfeld was simply preoccupied with crossing off items in the target set; when he finally got around to directing the Air Force to open the road to Kabul, things started to unravel in a hurry. 
It's hard to quarrel with a war won in 10 weeks, but Woodward's book implicitly cautions us not to expect the same in Iraq. Tipping the balance against the Taliban with small, mobile teams worked in Afghanistan, but barely. In Iraq, there is no equivalent of the Northern Alliance; the army may choose to fight instead of run, unwise as that would be; and the Bush team may find itself facing the two things it dislikes most -- American casualties and the prospect of a season in the swamp called nation building. Whatever the difficulties and challenges, Woodward suggests that we should expect the administration to figure them out as it goes along, and not until it has to. 
But for all the lively interest of Woodward's portraits of Bush and his team arguing how to fight the war on terror, perhaps the most important parts of the debate were the things on which "the principals" in the war cabinet had little to say. As you might guess, these are mainly questions with soft edges: In the war on terror who, exactly, is the enemy? What is the source of the anger that prompted Al Qaeda to such bloody attacks? Why does the administration assume that "any serious, full-scale war against terrorism would have to make Iraq a target"? Will victory over the Taliban and Saddam Hussein be the end of it? What is going on in the collective mind of the Islamic world as it watches America crush one Muslim regime after another? Answers to these questions would help us to understand where we can expect to find ourselves in 10 or 20 years' time, but about them, in Woodward's book, President Bush and his team rarely speak.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-15-02; 
War Names

BYLINE:  By Niall Ferguson; Niall Ferguson is a historian at Oxford University and, starting next year, at New York University. His book "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power" will be published in the spring by Basic Books.

 BODY:
In the most famous line of his masterwork "On War," published in 1832, Carl von Clausewitz called war "nothing but a continuation of political intercourse, with the intermixing of other means." He went on (and it's always worth reading on after a famous quotation): "Is not War merely another kind of writing and language for political thoughts? It has certainly a grammar of its own. . . . The Art of War in its highest point of view is policy, but no doubt, a policy which fights battles instead of writing notes. . . . War is an instrument of policy . . . is therefore policy itself, which takes up the sword in place of pen."
 Battles instead of notes? Swords instead of pens? Since 9/11 there has been an unmistakably Clausewitzian flavor to American foreign policy. War, it seems, has made a comeback this year as a legitimate tool for "the continuation of political intercourse." At West Point in June, President Bush revived the traditional 19th-century doctrine of "pre-emptive" war, the argument for which was set forth more fully three months later by the White House in a 33-page document titled "The National Security Strategy of the United States." Because "deliverable weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terror network or murderous dictator . . . constitute as grave a threat as can be imagined," the United States has claimed the right to initiate hostilities to forestall any "mortal threat" to its security. Repeatedly in 2002, key figures in the Bush administration have spoken of the desirability of "regime change" in Iraq, and war is the only plausible means of achieving such a change. 
 The question is, What kind of war? Clausewitz may be able to provide a rationale for war today, but the nature of war itself has changed profoundly since he wrote. During the Napoleonic wars, Clausewitz witnessed a transition from "real," or limited, war, in which small armies fought skirmishes according to genteel laws of war, to what he called "absolute" war, in which nationalism enlarged and motivated European armies. But since then we have lived through the ages of total war (1914-1945), which did much to discredit Clausewitz, and cold war (1947-1987), which seemed to render him irrelevant, and his 19th-century categories bear little relation to the new forms of war that characterize the 21st century.
Lately it has become fashionable to make comparisons between American power today and the power wielded by the British Empire in its Victorian heyday. But those who resisted British imperialism had to resist it on the colonial periphery. The Sudanese Mahdi could not very well charter a steamship and ram it into the houses of Parliament. Likewise, the home-grown terrorists of the Victorian age were armed with mere revolvers and primitive bombs; lethal nerve gas was not an option. The biggest threats to Britain's global power came from other European armies. Today, by contrast, the threats come from shadows. We need new categories to understand the war they are waging against us and the war we have to wage against them.
Consider the war waged by the terrorists. Do they have political objectives in the Clausewitzian sense? Barely. The language of Al Qaeda is a garbled mishmash of Wahhabism and anti-Americanism, at once socially conservative and politically revolutionary. So broad are its aims -- the global triumph of Islam -- and so widespread its foes that it can wage its war wherever and whenever it likes: from Manhattan to Mombasa. And we are all targets -- "soft" targets, since the terrorists (not unlike the air forces of World War II) prefer to kill civilians. The front line now extends to the holiday resorts where we go precisely in order to drop our guard: no longer Beirut; now Bali. This, then, is Random War. It is almost impossible to predict where our enemies will strike next.
Random War is possible because it is also Low-Budget War. The cheapness and availability of military technology make it easier than ever in history to wage a war. All you need is a handful of violent youths, some small arms and some explosives. In the words of the new National Security Strategy, the new enemy consists of "shadowy networks of individuals who can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank." This is the age of the shoulder-mounted antiaircraft missile and the box cutter that killed 3,000 people: Do-It-Yourself War, if you will.
There is no question that Western powers -- including the United States -- bear some of the blame for the ease with which terrorists and the rogue regimes that sponsor them can get their hands on state-of-the-art weaponry. There are firms currently operating in a number of NATO member countries that might as well be called Arms 'R' Us. But restrictions on arms exporters (or at least fewer subsidies for them) will not solve the problem. Just as the suicide bomber will always get through, so, too, will the explosives salesman. So how will the exponents of traditional war -- nation states like our own -- impose their will on the exponents of the new DIY war?
Up to a point, we can respond in ways Clausewitz would have recognized. Let's look again at that parallel between the U.S. and the British Empire. Terrorism is a global phenomenon and so, necessarily, is the war against it. One consequence of 9/11 was to shatter forever the illusion that Americans could retreat to enjoy the fruits of their productivity behind a missile defense shield. For terrorism breeds in precisely the rogue states and strife-torn war zones that some Republicans before 9/11 thought we could walk away from. Intervention to impose the rule of law on such seedbeds of terror is far from an unrealistic project. That was precisely what the Victorians excelled at.
Like the U.S. today, Britain led its world economically, technologically and militarily (or at least navally). Moreover, it was not afraid to use its power to topple what it considered rogue regimes. Take just one example: the annihilation of the Sudanese Mahdists, Islamic fundamentalists whose killing of General Gordon at Khartoum in 1895 was a Victorian 9/11. In all, there were 72 separate British military campaigns in the course of Queen Victoria's reign -- more than one for every year of the so-called pax Britannica. Nearly all of these took place thousands of miles away from the British Isles. The essence of global policing was -- and remains -- Remote War.
Such constant interventions in faraway countries of which Americans know nothing might seem to hold limited appeal. Liberals, most prominently, will fret about the violation of national sovereignty, enshrined in the United Nations charter. But it worked for the British. After Napoleon, the 19th century saw fewer, shorter and smaller wars than the preceding three centuries, not to mention the one that followed. The existence of a military "hyperpower" that really means business -- i.e., that is able and willing to use its superior force -- may in fact be better for world peace than any number of international treaties. Threaten war, and suddenly weapons inspectors are back in Iraq. Carry out the threat, and the Taliban regime is history. That is the Clausewitzian "continuation of politics" with a vengeance.
Long before Clausewitz, the Roman writer Vegetius put it neatly: Qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum. If you want peace, prepare for war. The converse of this might seem even more paradoxical, not to say Orwellian: if you want war, then prepare for peace. In other words, the surest way to make war more frequent would be for the United States to follow the European example and disarm, or simply heed the old isolationist call to bring "our boys" back home. For the enemies of the United States know only too well that the Achilles' heel of American foreign policy is the habitual reluctance of the electorate to risk the lives of American servicemen in far-flung conflicts.
The new war we will wage is Remote War in another sense too. Not all the battles in this war can be watched on CNN. For the campaigns to penetrate and disrupt the terrorist networks are conducted covertly, using a combination of traditional espionage and high-tech surveillance. The battles in this campaign are mostly unspectacular -- an arrest at an airport or in a seedy Pakistani flophouse, perhaps the occasional C.I.A. or Mossad assassination. It is a little like having the espionage of the cold war without any of the front-of-house hardware: no serried ranks of missiles and tanks. Just cameras. Bugs. Spooks. But this, too, has its 19th-century character. In truth, it is the "Great Game" -- once played by Britain and her rivals in the Middle East, Central Asia and Afghanistan -- with gizmos.
So Clausewitz -- and, indeed, the imperialism that flourished in the century after his death -- can teach us how to match Random War with Remote War. Liberals should be more relaxed about this. The bottom line of "On War" is, after all, a perfectly acceptable liberal axiom: namely, the primacy of political decision-making over military expertise. "The subordination of the political point of view to the military would be contrary to common sense," Clausewitz writes, "for policy has declared the War; it is the intelligent faculty, War only the instrument." (To his credit, Clausewitz had no illusions about the nature of that instrument: its violence, its unpredictability, its emotiveness.)
True, the war against terrorism has a novel character -- it is remote both geographically and technologically. It will nonetheless be Clausewitzian in principle, the wholehearted pursuit of a legitimate political objective by, regrettably but necessarily, violent means. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 15 about the changing nature of war, with a comparison between the power and position of the United States today and that of the British Empire 100 years ago, misstated the year that Gen. Charles Gordon of Britain was killed in a Khartoum battle by Sudanese Mahdists. It was 1885, not 1895.

As Foreign Banks Take Flight, Brazil Regroups

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
EQUIPPED with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and several years of experience managing portfolios and advising on deals here and in New York, Bernardo Ouro Preto Santos was ready for a promising investment banking career in Brazil.
 But after accepting a job here with an American bank specializing in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Santos grew frustrated with the slow pace of business and the prospect of no bonus. So he left banking to form a chain of supermarkets. 
 "I feel like I've gone from spending a lot of time behind my desk to an invigorating situation that could end up being quite rewarding," said Mr. Santos, 33. "It's my chance to be part of the economy instead of watching it from the sidelines." 
He is one of the lucky ones. Many other bankers in Sao Paulo, this nation's financial capital, are suddenly finding themselves dismissed in layoffs.
As Brazil struggles with a sluggish economy and uncertainty over the policies of a new president with leftist roots, many bankers are looking for work. Their employers, in most cases international banks, are pulling back -- or even leaving the country.
"We've gone from being the El Dorado of international banking to a system where the players are rushing to the exits," said Erivelto Rodrigues, president of Austin Asis, a company here that analyzes the financial services industry.
Foreign banks can be expected to reduce risks where there is no money to be made, but the fast pace of their pullback has been a surprise to Brazilian clients. Their actions have caused a drought of foreign financing, a shock to an economy that had ample access to international borrowing markets during the last decade.
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the nation's president-elect, whose party still has elements that are skeptical of the activities of foreign banks, personally appealed to President Bush last week during a friendly visit to Washington to encourage the banks to resume lending in Brazil.
The pullback does not reflect a disillusionment by foreign banks with all of Latin America -- the Bank of America Corporation, for example, announced a deal last week to buy a 25 percent stake in Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin, Mexico's most profitable bank, for $1.6 billion. But if Brazil continues to lose foreign bank financing, corporate defaults will increase and the economy, South America's largest, will weaken further. That, in turn, could prolong economic sluggishness on the entire continent and add to the drag on the United States.
JUST a few years ago, international banks were confident that they could help direct Brazil's growing role in the global economy. 
But this year, the lending portfolios and assets of international banks in Brazil's financial system are expected to decline for the first time since 1994, to 28.3 percent of the total from 30 percent last year, according to ABM Consulting, a Brazilian financial strategy firm. Foreign banks have sold almost $5 billion of assets this year.
The turnaround is also a shock for Sao Paulo's sophisticated banking culture, created in the last decade during the flurry of privatization deals. International bank occupancy of the city's modern skyscrapers, equipped with helicopter landing pads and the latest security technology, is declining. J. P. Morgan Chase, for example, recently gave up a floor it had leased in a high-rise in the exclusive Faria Lima financial district. Goldman, Sachs, which once planned to open a large trading operation in Sao Paulo, has set aside that idea.
All of the largest investment banks from the United States and Europe have invested in Brazil, only to be stung recently by its economic volatility. The same has been true for several large consumer banks, especially from Spain, Britain and the Netherlands.
Gone are large sales of state assets, like the government's auction of controlling stakes in Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the largest mining company in Latin America, or Telebras, the former national telecommunications monopoly.
Those deals were coveted for the multimillion-dollar fees generated for the banks that coordinated them. Now there are fewer and smaller mergers, and less lucrative restructuring work at some of the same Brazilian companies that were lured by relatively cheap foreign financing a few years ago. For example, the holding company for Globo, one of Latin America's largest media companies, defaulted on its foreign debt in October after borrowing about $1.2 billion in recent years. Globo hired Goldman, Sachs as an adviser to explore ways to emerge from its financial difficulties.
Job reductions at foreign banks or closings of divisions now routinely roil the financial industry here. Last month, J. P. Morgan shrank its equity capital markets unit in Brazil with layoffs and stopped brokerage services to several corporate customers.
Other banks have faced different problems. Bank of America, which bought Banco Liberal, a boutique investment house in Rio de Janeiro, for more than $250 million in 1998, later accused Liberal's executives in a lawsuit of embezzling nearly $40 million after the deal was completed. The case is still pending.
Some banks are seeking to leave Brazil completely, although the rate of departures is not as high as in neighboring Argentina, where the government's recent default worsened a chronic economic crisis. 
Still, concern over possible economic policy changes in the new administration led by Mr. da Silva has contributed to the international banks' hesitance about Brazil. 
The banks remained cautious even when Mr. da Silva used his Washington trip to announce his nominee for finance minister, Antonio Palocci, a close adviser who is expected to continue the market-friendly policies of the current administration. Although they liked Mr. da Silva's choice to lead the central bank, Henrique Meirelles, the former international banking chief for FleetBoston Financial and a member of the party of the departing president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, some expressed concern about his lack of trading experience.
Some foreign banks have made it clear that they believe the risks outweigh the rewards. The HVB Group, Germany's second-largest bank, last month sold its stake in BBA-Creditanstalt, one of Brazil's most profitable investment banks, in a deal worth more than $900 million. The buyer was Banco Itau, a large Brazilian bank, which has also grown by acquiring the Brazilian banking operations of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. In addition, Itau said on Dec. 5 that it had acquired Banco Fiat, the financing unit of the Italian automaker Fiat. And Banco Bradesco, one of Itau's large domestic rivals, recently acquired Deutsche Bank's Brazilian asset management unit.
Analysts attribute much of the apprehension among foreign banks in Brazil to events abroad, like Argentina's default and corporate scandals in the United States, that have increased an aversion to risky investments.
But Brazil's own weaknesses, like an endemic social security deficit, also loom large. In any case, the banks' concerns, particularly in the weeks before October's presidential election, added to the destabilization in the nation's financial system.
Large banks from the United States led a sell-off of Brazilian securities. J. P. Morgan Chase cut its total Brazil exposure in the last quarter to $1.7 billion, from $2.1 billion at the end of the previous quarter and $3.5 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2001.
Citigroup cut its Brazilian lending exposure by $1.2 billion, to $8.1 billion. Bank of America reduced its Brazil exposure by more than $450 million, to $1.5 billion.
AS financial markets have stabilized in recent weeks on the thinking that Mr. da Silva's government might not make radical shifts, some analysts now say international banks have overreacted.
In fact, there is a growing perception that the actions of the banks in Brazil contributed to the increased market tension. "The foreign banks have handled the situation in Brazil quite badly," said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "It's an example of how Brazil and other emerging-market countries would be well advised not to make themselves so dependent on short-term capital."
If there are any winners in Brazil's economic predicament, they may be the big Brazilian banks, particularly Itau and Bradesco. They have grown considerably by acquiring the operations of foreign banks.
Although earnings at Itau and Bradesco declined slightly in the most recent quarter, the two remain among the most profitable banks in the world, largely from a strategy of investing in high-yield government bonds. 
Few analysts expect foreign banks to increase their lending significantly or to re-expand in Brazil anytime soon. On the contrary, they are expected to remain cautious as the new administration grapples with pressure to pursue a more centrist path. In one telling sign, Fitch Ratings recently lowered ratings of more than 10 international banks operating in Brazil on concern that they would not receive explicit support from their parent institutions.
"The heyday of international finance in Brazil," said Mr. Rodrigues of Austin Asis, "seems to be behind us."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Time and Motion; 
What Firefighters Do The Rest of the Time

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
IMBUED with courage of a bureaucratic sort, the deputy mayor determined that now was the time. The time, 15 months after 343 firefighters died in the World Trade Center disaster, to take on the insular firehouse culture that has vexed New York City officials for so long. 
 He suggested that the Fire Department is a tradition-mired agency of costly inefficiency. He talked about the need to shut down a few firehouses. And he essentially said that firefighters spend about 5 percent of their workdays fighting fires, and the rest of the time not doing much of anything. 
 There was context to Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw's recent comments, of course. Multibillion-dollar gaps in the city budget tend to encourage tough talk, and, besides, he was addressing a like-minded crowd, a nonprofit group that monitors city spending. Still, he was not goading city arborists; he was goading city firefighters -- and the angry fallout extends beyond the guarantee that Mr. Shaw will not be leading the firefighters' pipe-and-drum corps in the next St. Patrick's Day parade.
The New York Fire Department has a complex history of breathtaking heroism and small-minded racism, of resistance to change and awareness of its political clout. It is the largest in the country, with more than 11,000 full-time firefighters and officers, 228 firehouses, and 322 square miles of congested roads and soaring high-rises to protect. And its fraternal ways do not conform readily to distant public-policy analysis; for example, firefighters swap shifts to accommodate second jobs so often that critics wonder which job really is the second job.
That Mr. Shaw's remarks still linger clearly bothered Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration last week, especially given the looming threat of a transit strike. But the fairly new administration might learn some things from this tempest: about the rawness of Sept. 11, about the aura of firefighters and about the public's embrace of certain kinds of government inefficiency. "There really is a need to modernize the deployment of firefighters and manage the department as a work force," said Mitchell Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University and an occasional adviser to Mayor Bloomberg. "But since 9/11, firefighters have gone from sex objects to quasi-religious figures, which makes it even more of a difficult managerial problem."
Terry Golway, the author of "So Others Might Live" (Basic Books, 2002), a history of the Fire Department, said Mr. Shaw was correct about the intransigence of New York firefighters. They were slow to make the transition from horses to motorized engines, slow to adopt various advancements in safety equipment. And at the close of 2002, in the multicultural melange that is New York, the department remains more than 90 percent white male.
But Mr. Golway said Mr. Shaw was off the mark in suggesting that New York's firefighters play checkers 95 percent of the time. "When they are not fighting fires, they drill, they conduct inspections, they make sure fire hydrants are working," he said. "And they are filling in, by the way, for 343 dead colleagues and the hundreds who have retired since 9/11."
Post-9/11, the slightest criticism of Fire Department ways brings angry letters and calls for resignation. Harold A. Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, suggested that Mr. Shaw come down from his office, do a shift in a firehouse and get his, uh, person "on a rig with 75 pounds of bunker gear and crawl through a building."
THE deputy mayor did not respond to a request for comment on whether he meant what he said, or even how bluntly he said it. Instead, an administration official issued a statement saying that because the city has been unable to "achieve efficiencies" in the Fire Department for the last decade -- like increasing inspections in fire prevention -- the city "has to close firehouses."
Mr. Shaw is considered within the city's political circles to be intellectually keen, although some say his recent comments about inefficiency -- which firefighters vehemently dispute -- demonstrate why he rarely speaks in public. People also suggest that his remarks carried the Machiavellian intent of cowing other agencies into cost-saving measures by taking on the sainted Fire Department.
But the lesson may have been Mr. Shaw's to learn. It seems that cost savings are not everything; that the public would rather have its firefighters well-rested, well-fed and ready to jump at a moment's notice than to have them sorting mail between fire alarms.
Steven E. Landsburg, an economist at the University of Rochester, put it this way: "The rubber in my spare tire is a valuable resource that sits around almost all the time doing absolutely nothing. But I'm still glad it's there."
Mr. Schaitberger's analogy was somewhat more flattering. "Firefighting is no different than the military," he said. "What's the amount of time that our soldiers are in direct battle and combat?"
John H. Mollenkopf, the director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said he agreed with Mr. Shaw's contention that the firefighter culture -- from work habits to firehouse locations -- is woefully, even willfully, inefficient. 
"They are a very elite part of the city work force and have privileges that no one else has," he said. "And they have resisted becoming more like what the rest of New York looks like."
But when he shared this opinion last week with a class on public policy, Mr. Mollenkopf said, "I was surprised at how many were so unsympathetic."
"The students advanced a couple of reasons for this," he said. "The fire near you may be rare, but you want to be damned sure that people come quickly. Also, firehouses are part of the neighborhood fabric. People are attached to them, particularly after 9/11."
Simply put, he said, "They like having them around."

HEADLINE: Making the Economy Run on Time 

BYLINE:  By Tom Standage; Tom Standage, technology correspondent of The Economist, is author of "The Victorian Internet" and, most recently, "The Turk."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
President Bush's decision to nominate John W. Snow as his new Treasury secretary may strike some as curious. As the chief executive of CSX, a railroad company, Mr. Snow has years of experience in an "old-economy" industry that, on the face of it, could hardly be further removed from the cutting edge of commerce. Can this really be the right man to guide an economy still reeling from the trillion-dollar crash of the telecom industry? Would it not be better to choose a candidate whose experience shows a deep understanding of the promise of the new economy?
 Perhaps not. For the Internet mania of the past few years has strong parallels with two intertwined old-economy industries from the 19th century: telegraphs and, yes, railroads. Of course, railroads are not as vital to the economy now as they were a century ago. But running a railroad still provides insights into the national economy -- not just its vicissitudes, but its structure -- that will undoubtedly prove helpful to Mr. Snow. And unlike Paul O'Neill, who came from the manufacturing sector, Mr. Snow has expertise in an industry that is oriented toward communications and transportation. 
 In many ways, the railroad industry is a century ahead of the telecommunications sector: All of the wild claims made in recent years about vast new fiber-optic networks, for example -- that they would transform commerce and rewrite the rules of economics -- were made about the telegraph and railroad networks of the mid-1800's. Over a century ago, the combination of near-instant communication and a rail network capable of speeding goods from one place to another caused a flurry of investment, speculation and hype.
The completion in 1858 of the first trans-Atlantic cable prompted jubilation in the streets of New York and spawned telegraphic poetry, sermons and a deluge of instant books. Companies rushed to embrace the technology, fearful of being left behind by more innovative competitors. Traders could buy and sell goods hundreds of miles away just by dispatching a few Morse-code missives. Business use of the telegraph went hand in hand with the growth of America's railroads. During the Gilded Age, anything railway-related was pounced upon by investors, capital was freely available, and 30,000 miles of new track were laid, usually with telegraph wires running alongside. In 1870, William Orton, the president of Western Union, described the telegraph as "the nervous system of the commercial system." Telegraph wires were the nerves; railroads were the muscle. Goods that had previously taken weeks to transport by boat or horse-drawn wagon could be delivered in days.
But the railroad boom was too good to last. Behind the scenes, corruption, speculation and miscalculation were rife. Much more track was laid than was actually needed; supply far outpaced demand. In 1873 the railroad industry abruptly collapsed, and a five-year depression ensued, during which dozens of companies went bankrupt. The parallels with today's situation in telecoms, where far too many companies laid far too much fiber only to find there was insufficient demand, are all too clear.
So it is instructive to examine how the railroad industry got back on its feet. Things finally began to pick up in the late 1870's. Demand came back into line with supply, unused network links were revived and traffic was boosted by new innovations. Railway firms sold land alongside and nearby the tracks in order to generate freight traffic, and they established travel agencies and built resorts to drive tourism and increase passengers.
Some say today's telecom firms should adopt similar tactics, by devising new services to encourage the adoption of high-speed, "broadband" network connections and thus generate traffic to fill their empty fiber-optic pipes. The links between old-economy railroad firms and new-economy telecoms do not end there. Today it is fiber-optic cables, rather than telegraph wires, that run alongside railroad tracks. Mr. Snow's firm, CSX, has been leasing rights-of-way to telecom providers since 1982, in some cases in return for equity. Railroads and telecoms are still closely coupled.
Furthermore, both railroad and telecom firms depend on economic activity upstream to provide traffic over their networks. In 1870, Mr. Orton was the first to note the way that traffic on his network reflected broader commercial activity. "If you will sit down with me at my office for 20 minutes, I will show you what the condition of business is at any time in any locality in the United States," he said.
Mr. Snow could probably make a similar claim. Despite increased competition from trucking firms, CSX and other railroads still carry huge amounts of both raw commodities and finished goods. The passage of goods over their networks provides a snapshot of economic activity on a larger scale and gives railroad managers a panoramic view of the ebb and flow of commerce.
The old economy is not that different from the new -- and it might even offer some ideas about how to remedy today's excesses. So perhaps having a railroad executive in the Treasury Department isn't such a bad idea after all.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Politics of the Economy; 
The Players Are in Place. The Policies Await.

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S replacement of his top economic aides last week showed how seriously he takes the threat that a weak economy poses to his political future. But that concern so far has not extended to reconsidering his core economic policies. Unemployment is rising and growth worldwide appears to have stalled, but almost no one expects the White House to propose major short-term tax cuts or spending to revive the economy.
 Instead, the administration's most important proposal remains a package of long-term tax cuts, directed mainly at the wealthy, a remedy that many mainstream economists say is bafflingly out of step with the problems the economy faces right now. 
 Yet the White House's strategy may be smarter and more effective than the economists give it credit for. To begin with, the president's new team -- John W. Snow as Treasury secretary, Stephen Friedman as chairman of the National Economic Council and William H. Donaldson as Securities and Exchange Commission chairman -- is much stronger than its predecessor, and will be perceived as such, economists and Wall Street strategists said.
"You have a very good combination of market savvy and also industrial experience, and a level of talent that is equal to any administration in the last couple of decades," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and an under secretary of the Commerce Department in the Clinton administration. 
The real question, then, is not about the players but about the policies. With the risk of another recession rising, the administration's main response thus far has been to propose making permanent supposedly temporary tax cuts that were passed last year, and possibly accelerating them.
Those cuts, scheduled to take effect by 2010, are mainly directed at the highest-income Americans. Most mainstream economists say that temporary tax cuts directed at low- and moderate-wage earners or aid to local governments to allow them to avoid raising taxes next year would be much better short-term alternatives.
"The soft patch is principally a function of war jitters," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland and a self-described political independent. "To alleviate that problem, you want to do something that is short term in nature. You don't want to do something that is going to be with us for many years."
Mr. DeKaser said the measures he and many other economists favor include encouraging business investment by allowing companies to take bigger tax write-offs on new equipment, a measure business supports, and extending unemployment insurance for laid-off workers, "who are overwhelmingly inclined to spend every dollar they have."
On the other hand, the promise of tax cuts several years away will do little to increase business investment in 2003 and nothing at all to encourage consumer spending. 
SO why is the White House sticking to its long-term policy? 
It is not necessarily because the Bush administration is in love with supply-side economics -- the notion that permanent reductions in tax rates, especially the higher rates paid by the wealthy, are a solution to every economic problem and pay for themselves by generating more tax revenues through increased growth.
In any case, none of Mr. Bush's new hires are known as supply-siders. "Bush has plucked apparently every surviving member of the Ford administration for his inner circle, ignoring the Reagan guys, who are ideologically committed to the supply side," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "He is giving at least lip service to supply-side ideas but surrounding himself with people who disagree with them."
A better explanation for the administration's policies, economic and political analysts say, is that far from being ill conceived, they are intended to further political as well as economic goals.
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a political action committee that supports candidates who favor lower taxes, noted that tax cuts are intended to spur growth, but also to control the size of government by depriving it of the money needed to create new programs. "Tax cuts create resource constraints on politicians," he said. "And that is a good thing." 
So even if the administration didn't believe tax cuts pay for themselves with stronger growth, it might not care that they will create larger deficits, because deficits keep government from spending more.
THE strategy is a risky one, said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, because without a strong stimulus package, the economy might remain weak in 2003 and even into 2004. "They're throwing the dice a bit here," he said.
But even if the lack of short-term stimulus proves bad for the economy, it could still work politically, said Bill Allison of the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity. 
Lowering taxes on the wealthy and repealing the estate tax are both issues dear to the president's conservative base. And the White House has probably calculated that low- and middle-income voters will give the president credit for whatever tax rebates or cuts they receive next year, even if the Democrats propose them. That happened in 2001, when Democrats insisted that the president's tax cut plan include a $300 rebate for almost every taxpayer.
"That was a Democratic Party idea, and look who got credit for it," Mr. Allison said. "By and large, it was Bush." 
So the White House may expect, and even want, the tax package Congress passes next year to include a temporary payroll tax holiday or extension of unemployment insurance. But it will force the Democrats to ask for those, and extract concessions on other tax cuts as its price.
So far, the strategy seems to have worked, given that opinion polls give Mr. Bush more credit than the Democrats for guiding the economy. "You just have to look at the approval numbers," Mr. Allison said.

If the Scuds Were Going to Iraq

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the United States tries mightily to discourage the trade of high-tech weaponry into unstable regions, the Bush administration had little practical choice last week but to let a shipment of Scud missiles sail on to Yemen from North Korea.
 The initial seizure of the freighter and its cargo was certainly legal: the vessel was flying no flag and its markings were obscured by paint, rendering it a stateless, lawless vessel not unlike a pirate ship. 
 But this commercial transaction for armament between two nations was not barred by any treaty either had signed, and President Bush ordered the ship set free. 
It would have been different had the ultimate buyer proved to be, say, Iraq, or a stateless terrorist network.
If Baghdad was in on the deal, the missiles could have been confiscated under United Nations sanctions on arms sales to Iraq. Or Mr. Bush could have said that Iraq was in breach of United Nations resolutions and that he had grounds for war.
The missiles could also have been seized forever if the buyer was an organization that wasn't a state -- Al Qaeda, for example.
Even with last week's sale, some international lawyers say paperwork could have been thrown at the problem in an attempt to tie up the ship and its cargo for years. Because it flew no flag, the vessel might have been held until its last legal owner laid claim. 
That owner might have given permission to destroy the cargo. Or the cargo might have been locked up, having been shipped under false manifest.
Any idea of trying those tactics, though, fell before the dictates of diplomacy and the logic of maintaining an alliance.
Simply put, Yemen was deemed too valuable a partner in the campaign to eradicate terrorism.
In fact, it was the hunt for Al Qaeda that made the seizure possible. During the war in Afghanistan, the United States organized patrols in and near the Arabian Sea to stop terrorists trying to flee for lawless regions in the Horn of Africa. About 10 countries volunteered vessels.
Even with the dispiriting outcome, last week's maritime seizure had one redeeming effect, administration officials said.
It made it clear, they said, that America can detect clandestine arms shipments and, with its allies, stop them at sea.

Three Targets, Three Strategies

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S diplomatic strategy for December was hardly a mystery: Focus attention on a unique threat posed by Iraq, one that could be neutralized only by disarming the country and deposing Saddam Hussein.
 But last week the two other members of the "axis of evil," North Korea and Iran, suddenly created nuclear-sized distractions, raising a question the White House wants to glide past: Is the threat from Iraq the most imminent threat to America and the world? 
 In quick succession, the United States failed to block a shipment of North Korean missiles to Yemen, North Korea said it was resuming production of weapons-grade plutonium, and satellite photographs showed huge progress in Iran's bomb program. 
"What the president may have just discovered," said Gary Milhollin, the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, "is that Iraq is actually the least complicated of the three cases. And his team is going to earn its pay in the next few months figuring out the other two." 
North Korea may not have Iraq's malicious intent, but it owns at least two nuclear weapons, the means to deliver them, and a huge conventional force facing South Korea, Japan and American troops in Asia. 
But as a senior American official put it last month: "We are taking on Iraq because we can, without doing much damage elsewhere. We are tripping over ourselves on North Korea because there is no military option we can live with, and no diplomatic option that the White House likes."
In fact, there's been a different strategy for each point on the axis. For Iraq, it's confrontation. For Iran, it's hands off. 
"If we get involved, overtly or covertly" in Iran's internal struggles between democratic reformists and hard-liners, a senior aide to Mr. Bush said, "we'll only be hurting our own interests."
In North Korea, the administration has followed a boa-constrictor strategy ever since North Korea admitted in October that it has secretly been working to develop a weapon from highly enriched uranium. Last month, the administration organized its allies to put a slow squeeze on the North Korean economy by cutting off the oil that was supposed to compensate for an agreement to stay away from nuclear power.
Unlike Iraq, argues Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, North Korea has no oil revenue, making it vulnerable to economic pressure. And unlike Iran, she notes, it has no indigenous democracy movement to encourage.
"This time around, the economic carrot and stick will be much more effective," said Han Sung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister. "The North is more dependent on us than it was during the last nuclear crisis," in 1994.
That contention may one day prove true, but so far North Korea has been defiant. On Thursday, it said it was switching on the nuclear reactor that was shut down under the 1994 agreement, which can produce enough plutonium to make a few nuclear weapons a year. The White House described the North Korean decision as "regrettable."
The White House has been even more restrained in how it describes allies that help feed North Korea's nuclear habit.
When American spy satellites detected a Pakistani plane picking up North Korean missiles in July, there was no public criticism, even though the C.I.A. has said North Korea's missile sales pay for its nuclear program. "It's another piece of evidence," one American diplomat said, "that Pakistan may be our biggest problem."
When the same satellites warned that a North Korean freighter loaded with hidden Scud missiles was headed for the Middle East, the United States arranged for Spain to stop the ship last week. The ship was turned over to American forces -- until it turned out that the buyer was Yemen, a new American ally. The Yemenis called Vice President Dick Cheney and the cargo was delivered.
The next day, commercial satellite photographs of Iran's newest nuclear sites were broadcast around the world. Again the White House was silent. 
So what happened to Mr. Bush's declaration that when it comes to fighting terror, and keeping the world's worst weapons out of the hands of the world's worst dictators, nations are "with us or against us"?
It is one of those phrases, administration officials say, that remain a fine statement of national goals. "The execution, however," one senior official concedes, "is a little bit trickier."

HEADLINE: Bush Calls for an Extension Of Unemployment Benefits 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush called on Congress today to act immediately when it convenes next month to reinstate unemployment benefits for 750,000 people whose assistance will run out three days after Christmas.
 Mr. Bush said the benefits should be paid retroactively to Dec. 28 once they are restored. He otherwise offered few specifics of the legislation he wants passed by Congress, where his party will be in control of the Senate and the House starting in January. 
 Unemployed workers "need our assistance in these difficult times, and we cannot let them down," Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address.
"I have shared these concerns with the leaders of the House and the Senate, and they understand the need for early action," he said. "When our legislators return to the Capitol, I ask them to make the extension of unemployment benefits a first order of business. And the benefits they approve should be retroactive, so that people who lose their benefits this month will be paid in full."
States typically provide laid-off workers with 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, and the federal government has routinely extended the benefits in hard periods for the economy. This year, Congress authorized a 13-week extension, but that authorization runs out on Dec. 28.
Mr. Bush noted that the House and the Senate had passed differing versions of legislation that would have extended the benefits again, but had not agreed on a compromise before adjourning last month. He did not mention that Democrats criticized him last month, saying he had not pressed Republican leaders aggressively enough to make a deal, or that they stepped up the pressure on him in the past week to act immediately.
On Friday, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee said they would introduce a bill on the first day Congress was back in session that would provide an additional 26 weeks of coverage to laid-off workers. 
"President Bush has said he is a compassionate conservative, but apparently that compassion does not extend to the unemployed," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. "He stood silent on the sidelines as Republicans in the House blocked an extension of unemployment benefits to millions of laid-off workers. We will introduce legislation to correct this inequity, and we hope he supports it this time."
The unemployment rate last month stood at 6 percent, equaling its highest rate since mid-1994. The figure represents 8.5 million people who do not have jobs but are looking for work. With the the stock market also in the doldrums, the White House has become increasingly concerned about the political implications for Mr. Bush as he heads toward his re-election race in 2004. 
In his radio address, Mr. Bush noted that he brought in a new economic team this week and said there were encouraging signs about the economy, including low inflation and interest rates. 
Critics of Mr. Bush's suggested that he would not push for legislation to assist unemployed workers whose original round of benefits would run out in coming months, or those who had already exhausted the first extension.
"Today's announcement is way too little, way too late," said Maurice Emsellem of the National Employment Law Project, a liberal advocacy group. "It's absolutely no comfort to the one million unemployed workers who already ran out of their extended benefits and the 90,000 each week who will be entitled to no federal help starting January 1st."
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, issued a statement saying the president "must now urge the House Republican leadership to accept the bipartisan compromise" worked out in the Senate last month that would have extended benefits for all unemployed workers for 13 more weeks.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises Abortion Issue At Conference On Families 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Taking its fight against abortion overseas, the Bush administration opened a sharp debate over a landmark family-planning agreement during a United Nations conference this week, angering several of its allies, European and Asian diplomats said today.
 The skirmish has been taking place at a United Nations regional family-planning conference in Bangkok, where the United States has threatened to withdraw its support for a 1994 family-planning agreement reached in Cairo that called for bringing population growth under control by improving the legal rights and economic status of women, as well as broadly expanding access to health care. 
 Administration officials contend that some phrases in the Cairo agreement -- including "reproductive health services" and "reproductive rights" -- can be construed as promoting abortion. The Bush administration has also called for inserting language that promotes "natural" family-planning methods, officials said. 
But an array of Asian and European diplomats attending the conference, as well as representatives of nonprofit organizations observing the event, asserted on Friday that the United States delegation was virtually isolated in its position. These observers said the administration was opposed by the majority of the approximately 30 nations represented at the conference, including India, Indonesia, China and Pakistan.
They also argued that the American delegation's refusal to budge from its demands had stalemated the conference and made discussion of other pressing issues, like H.I.V. and AIDS prevention, impossible. 
"People hoped to discuss very practical, service oriented things: how to develop services to deal with sexually transmitted infections, H.I.V. and AIDS, how to do sex education," an Asian diplomat said. "People's frustration was that we're not able to discuss what we really want to discuss, because the U.S. insists on renegotiating key Cairo concepts which we are not willing to do."
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat who supports abortion rights and who sent an observer to the conference, said, "This is another example of the Bush Administration versus the world that, regrettably, will be at the expense of women."
But a State Department official asserted that "some participants in the conference are seeking to force the United States to agree to language supporting abortion."
"Our goals are to focus on poverty, health and education, respect for women and the family as the fundamental unit of society," the official said. "We seek an outcome that does not support or promote abortion."
The fight in Bangkok comes at a time when the Bush administration has been trying to win international support for its Iraq policies and to dispel the perception that it is increasingly acting on its own. Some delegates argued that the dispute was undermining both efforts.
Those critics also asserted that the Bush White House, like the Reagan White House before it, was carrying the abortion fight overseas mainly to bolster its support among Catholic and fundamentalist Christian voters.
The critics also pointed to the presence of a former adviser to the Vatican, John Klink, on the United States delegation in Bangkok and at previous family-planning conferences. A State Department official said Mr. Klink was serving in a voluntary capacity at the behest of the White House. 
"This is purely about domestic politics," said Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SHOWDOWN: AN ASSESSMENT; 
Workers Weigh the Cost of a Strike Against Years of Feeling Mistreated

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
It may seem irrational on many levels that the transit workers' union would even consider going on strike tomorrow when its leaders and the rank and file face an injunction, immense fines, possible jail sentences and the public's wrath.
 But a subtle calculus explains why, despite possibly stratospheric costs, the city's 34,000 subway and bus workers might still walk out: Proud but feeling largely unappreciated, they may prefer to stand up and show they will not be pushed around rather than accept a contract they feel continues a pattern of psychological and financial neglect. 
 And if they end up getting fined for striking, at least they can tell their children and grandchildren -- as did many transit workers who walked out in 1966 and 1980 -- that they fought the good fight.
Indeed, many of today's transit workers say that a major factor propelling them toward a strike is psychological -- the feeling that neither Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg nor Gov. George E. Pataki nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has treated them with the respect they deserve. 
They feel Mr. Bloomberg slighted them by not attending funeral services for two subway workers who died in separate on-the-job accidents last month. They feel snubbed because the mayor and the governor have rebuffed their requests to come to the bargaining table and to pressure the authority to speed up what the union calls a glacial negotiating pace.
They are angry that they are being called unpatriotic and callous because Mr. Pataki has said a strike would be an act of disloyalty and Mr. Bloomberg has warned that New Yorkers would die in a strike because the streets would be so clogged that emergency vehicles could not get through. 
Robert W. Snyder, a Rutgers University professor who has written a book on the history of the Transport Workers Union, predicted that the members of Local 100 just might shut down the nation's largest transit system because they feel they have been treated shabbily, before and during the current contract talks.
"Respect is in the middle of it," he said. "You have to show people enough respect that they can walk away from the bargaining table with their heads up."
Professor Snyder said that the mind-set of many transit workers mirrored that of miners, another group of workers who face many dangers on the job. Both groups have developed an unusual sense of solidarity as well as a macho defiance, and they do not take indignities lightly.
The transit workers say they were especially insulted the day after the first subway worker died last month when Mayor Bloomberg voiced little sympathy but sternly warned of severe penalties if the union carried out its then-vague strike threat.
Many workers and their union leaders say the authority has trifled with them because 48 hours before tomorrow's 12:01 a.m. contract deadline, management continued to call for a wage freeze in the first year, offered raises in the second or third years only with productivity increases, and demanded givebacks that would cost each worker about $1,500 a year.
The M.T.A.'s chief negotiator, Gary Dellaverson, asserted that the authority's insistence on a wage freeze and concessions had nothing to do with a lack of respect but was caused by the authority's deficit of more than $2 billion. He said that prevents the authority from even coming close to offering the union the 6 percent annual wage increase it is seeking for three years. 
"The union has to recognize the economic realities that we face," Mr. Dellaverson said. 
City officials said Mr. Bloomberg was not slighting or snubbing the transit workers, but just standing up to a union that has threatened to break the law and the authority's budget. 
Workers have also raised racial concerns as a dynamic in the contract dispute. Two-thirds of the union's membership are minorities, with a heavy representation of African-Americans and Caribbean immigrants. 
"The racial subtext to this confrontation should not be ignored," Professor Snyder said. "This is a union of predominantly people of color -- their leader is a black man who immigrated from Trinidad -- and they feel they face a municipal power structure that is overwhelmingly white."
Labor historians say there are parallels to 1966, when Mike Quill, the union's president and an immigrant from Ireland, defied Mayor John V. Lindsay and led a 12-day transit strike. At the time, the union was largely Irish and many members, including Mr. Quill, felt an ethnic resentment from the patrician mayor who personified a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment.
When transit workers see their union offered a wage freeze not long after three municipal unions with white majorities -- the teachers, police and firefighters -- received double-digit raises, some see racial injustice at work.
M.T.A. officials deny that race is a factor in the discrepancy, pointing out that the three earlier contracts resulted from a previous round of negotiations that took place when there were budget surpluses. They also say that the transit workers received a double-digit raise in that round. These officials note that the transit union is the first to go to the bargaining table in a new wave of negotiations, which are taking place against a stark backdrop of large deficits.
Many transit workers complain that they earn less than their counterparts at Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, both of which have a far lower proportion of minority workers. Authority officials acknowledge the transit workers' lower salaries, but say they are offset by higher pensions.
Even the proudest Local 100 worker will have to weigh the threat of high fines in deciding whether to walk out. The state's Taylor Law calls for a penalty of two days' pay for each day of a strike. If the union were to strike for 11 days, as it did in 1980, workers would lose 22 days' pay or nearly 10 percent of their annual wages. 
With this in mind, one adviser to the union predicted that if there was a strike, it might last only a day or two, which would allow workers to demonstrate their unhappiness without incurring a huge financial cost. 
Many labor relations experts predict that the transit workers will not strike if the authority makes a contract offer that Roger Toussaint, the local's president, is convinced shows his members real respect, perhaps by overhauling a disciplinary system that they feel results in far too many citations for petty offenses.
"The final offer has to show a willingness, within the current bad economic climate, to recognize the contribution these workers make to keeping the city going and to recognize it with a pay increase," said Joshua Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College. "If the offer just treats them as if they were troublemakers and problems for the city, that might cause them to walk."

HEADLINE: Chavez Rejects Call by U.S. for Early Vote in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez's government, whipsawed by a 13-day strike that is debilitating the economy, has rejected a Bush administration call for early elections to resolve the political turmoil in this oil-rich nation.
 Government officials said today that an early election, as demanded by the opposition, would be in violation of the country's Constitution, which permits a binding referendum on the president's rule no earlier than August. 
 "I'm sure President Bush is not telling the world that Venezuelans must violate the Constitution," Mr. Chavez told four American reporters in an interview late tonight. "Here, there is no power that can convoke an early election, so I have asked Washington to review our Constitution."
Mr. Chavez's comments came as Thomas Shannon, a special State Department envoy, met with government officials and opposition leaders to discuss possible solutions to a growing crisis that is of deep concern to the Bush administration.
"We came to the conclusion that the situation was sufficiently grave enough that it was important that the Venezuelans understood that we thought moving toward early elections was the best way to resolve this," Mr. Shannon, deputy assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, said this morning as he prepared to return to Washington.
Though Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton explained that he "took into account the ideas and observations" offered by Mr. Shannon, the Chavez administration clearly did not agree with the White House proposal.
"We would have preferred the White House's position be presented in another manner," he said in an interview this morning.
The administration's proposal for "the holding of early elections" was widely viewed here as an endorsement of the opposition's position. Mr. Chavez, though, has said his foes should wait until August for a referendum on his rule, which could revoke his presidency, or the next presidential election, set for 2006.
Mr. Chaderton said he was worried about the precedent that early elections would set, since opposition leaders often point to Mr. Chavez's fall in popularity and governing style in arguing for his removal.
"The problem is, are they going to do elections every time the opposition decides it wants to take power?" Mr. Chaderton said.
He did not rule out the possibility that the government would discuss a path toward early elections, but he said an early election could only happen if the Constitution were amended, the ferociously anti-Chavez news media demonstrated restraint and a new less-partisan electoral board were formed.
His comments underscored the difficult nature of the talks, in which the government views the opposition as coup plotters and the government's foes see Mr. Chavez as a despot taking Venezuela to economic ruin. As increasingly tense protests take place in the street and the economy founders, the two sides remain at an impasse in negotiations being mediated by Cesar Gaviria, general secretary of the Organization of American States.
Indeed, Mr. Chaderton said he believed that while the opposition talks about elections, it was really interested in simply toppling Mr. Chavez. "There is a conspiracy set up to overthrow the government," the foreign minister said.
The Bush administration, though, concluded that Mr. Chavez should convene an early election because the country was reaching the point where the deadlock between the government and its opponents could set off violence.
Mr. Shannon said the United States strongly supports a negotiated solution brokered by Mr. Gaviria, but stressed that it should happen quickly because of the volatile nature of the situation here.
"The level of confrontation could very easily slip beyond the grasp of Venezuela's institutions and its political leadership," Mr. Shannon said.
The Bush administration, worried about Venezuelan oil supplies, appeared to be taking its most forceful stand on the crisis here since April, when the White House tacitly supported the brief removal of Mr. Chavez from office in the wake of a national strike. 
An American official involved in shaping Venezuela policy justified the new position, saying that it was "not sufficient for the government to sit on institutional legitimacy when the country is at risk."
The American call, though, has raised concerns that it might do more harm than good, hurting Washington's standing in Caracas while setting a potentially perilous precedent in other Latin American countries with weak governments and institutions.
"I think the U.S. could be making a bit of the same mistake they made in April, getting more involved than they have to or going further than they have to in expressing their opinions," said Janet Kelly, a political analyst here. "Talking about whether the Constitution is a straitjacket strikes me as untoward."

HEADLINE: Galleria to Be Sold and Spruced 

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., announced on Tuesday that it will acquire the Galleria at White Plains. The company, a real estate investment trust that owns, develops, leases, manages and markets properties, plans to add a fifth floor, a single-screen movie theater, at least one upscale restaurant and a PBS Kids' play area, among other things, to the 22-year-old, 885,000-square-foot Galleria. 
 The company is buying the White Plains property and four others (Broward Mall in Fort Lauderdale; Dover Mall and Dover Commons in Dover, Del., Northpark Mall in Jackson, Miss., and The Esplanade in New Orleans) from Cadillac Fairview Corporation of Toronto and plans to close on the deal by the end of January. It is also buying the 637,000-square-foot Riverside Square mall in Hackensack, N.J. The total acquisition price of all the properties is $621 million, the company said. 
 David Douglass, a spokesman for Mills, said there were no separate figures for the Galleria's purchase price. Sam Bornstein, a spokesman for Cadillac Fairview, said a number of companies expressed interest in buying the five properties, but he would not say why his company, which is based in Toronto, was selling -- only that it "has been rebalancing its portfolio for about 18 months." 
Mr. Douglass said plans for the Galleria included an effort to make it a "more fun place to visit." Mills, a publicly traded company, trademarked the term Shoppertainment, and combines retail and entertainment aspects of shopping. Mills has gone into partnership with a number of brands including ESPN, Crayola and Gibson Guitar to build retail-entertainment attractions. 
Mills's Lakewood, Colo., mall, for example, has an ESPN X-Games Skatepark, a concept developed by Mills and ESPN; its Discover Mills near Atlanta features a Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, where customers can practice fly fishing. Other centers have ice-skating rinks and miniature NASCAR race tracks. 
At the Galleria, which has 130 tenants, Mills plans to add a PBS Kids area and cluster retail outlets specializing in children's items like clothing and toys nearby. Seven months ago, the Public Broadcasting Service and Mills announced a marketing alliance to develop the children's activity areas inside new and existing Mills properties.
The learn-and-play areas feature educational activities for parents and children, presented in conjunction with local public television stations. The areas have jungle gyms, live events, book nooks, computer kiosks and community boards with information on PBS Kids programming and community events. 
The new owners also plan to add a single-screen arts cinema showing independent films.
In another part of White Plains, the developer Louis Cappelli is building a $300 million City Center, an entertainment, retail and residential complex with a 15-screen movie theater. It is expected to open next fall. The Galleria had a movie theater, but it closed in 1991.
The fifth floor that Mills plans to add to the Galleria would be smaller than the other floors at the mall. No date has been set for the new construction. The new owners of the Galleria said they were not planning to compete with any existing or planned shopping centers in White Plains, including the nearby upscale mall, The Weschester. "We're not going to turn the Galleria into something it's not," said Laurence C. Siegel, the chairman and chief executive officer of Mills. "It's kind of pointless for someone to buy the Galleria and try to replicate what The Westchester has done."
The Galleria has Macy's as an anchor and had J.C. Penney as another anchor, until recently. Sears is planning to occupy the space left vacant by J.C. Penney almost a year ago. By comparison, the anchors at The Westchester are Neiman Marcus and Nordstroms, stores that carry more expensive merchandise. 
The Galleria, which was completed in 1980, underwent an $8 million renovation in 1992. Gerald M. Cope, a Philadelphia architect who was responsible for the design changes then, observed at the time that most shopping centers need refurbishing every 10 or 12 years to keep pace with shifts in marketing and consumer trends. When it was built 22 years ago, the mall replaced an old city courthouse, but its presence downtown has been blamed for the difficulties experienced by once-prosperous merchants outside the mall who struggled economically on the streets nearby. 
Mills, a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange typically builds its own shopping centers featuring outlet stores. The deal announced on Tuesday marks its first major foray into acquiring existing shopping centers. Mr. Douglass would not say whether discount outlets would be among a new tenant mix at the Galleria. Overall, the company plans to spend about $350 million to renovate and upgrade the newly acquired malls.
Mills owns 14 shopping centers representing 19 million square feet in 12 states. It has four projects under way or in development in the United States: in St. Louis and Cinncinati, and at the Meadowlands in New Jersey and The Piers in San Francisco. It has a downtown site under development in Chicago. Outside the United States it is developing a mall in Toronto and another in Madrid.
The Galleria and the other malls in its new acquisition package (which range in size from 637,000 square feet to 999,000 square feet) are smaller than Mills's other centers, which range in size from 1.2 million to 2.1 million square feet of space available to be leased.

HEADLINE: Ugly Echoes; 
A Sanitized Past Comes Back to Haunt Trent Lott -- and America

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LAST week Trent Lott, the incoming Senate majority leader, learned the truth of William Faulkner's dictum, so often applied to the South: "The past is never dead. It's not even past."
 But first, the nation needed a crash course in the rougher and more complicated parts of its own history. About the angry rise of the Dixiecrats in 1948. About the role that race played in the Republican realignment of the South. About Senator Strom Thurmond's long defense of segregation, and his final defection from the Democrats in 1964, after they pushed through the landmark civil rights bill opening public accommodations to blacks. About Mr. Lott's own history of opposing significant civil rights legislation. 
 What was striking was not that this past reared its troublesome head after Mr. Lott delivered his praise of Mr. Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign as the nominee of the Dixiecrats, a "states' rights" party devoted to the preservation of a segregated South. What was striking was how long the reaction took to build, how distant the memories had become, how many politicians were initially caught off balance.
Americans often tend to sanitize their past, smooth the edges, develop a happy amnesia about the hardest parts, particularly when the subject is race. In the culture at large, the story of civil rights has become a simple morality tale of a great wrong righted by a just people through the intercession of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But historians say the agonizing struggle and chaos of that era -- when the ultimate outcome did not seem inevitable, when the best way to get there was not apparent and yet many people still had to make a stand -- gets overlooked.
"What's fascinating about the Lott episode is it brings back the reality" that "people had to fight, some had to lose their lives, to win these rights," said Roderick Harrison, a sociologist at Howard University and an official with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that focuses on issues facing black Americans. "That it was bitterly resisted. That Martin Luther King, who is now sanctified, was looked at as a dangerous radical."
The urge to tidy up the story is strong. Consider Mr. Thurmond, who was bid a sentimental farewell from the Senate this month as a kind of national grandpa, the long, morally ambivalent arc of his career turned into an uplifting narrative of a man who changed with the times. "Life is easier if there are no former segregationists around," said David J. Garrow, a civil rights historian. 
Even Dr. King, who now looms as an immense figure in popular history, has been blurred, transformed into a smooth icon of racial brotherhood, rather than the more difficult figure who also challenged the political establishment on the Vietnam War and economic inequity.
Part of the blurring of that era is explained by simple demographics: more than half of all Americans alive today weren't even born in 1964; nearly 80 percent weren't born in 1948.
"I know where I was when I heard of King's assassination, Robert Kennedy's, Malcolm X's," Mr. Harrison said. "These kinds of things are indelible. It is quite different when you are seeing things as historical events."
Moreover, James W. Loewen, a sociologist at Catholic University, argues that such history is often taught "as a parade of dead facts," drained of its relevance, because "teaching the past with relevance to the present is intrinsically controversial." For example, he said, many high school history textbooks skirt the subject of how the modern Republican Party benefited in the South from the votes of defecting Democrats angry over civil rights.
There are, in fact, reasons for both parties to step lightly over this history. Before it adopted a civil rights plank in 1948, the Democratic Party was, for many years, the "white South's instrument for pursuing the goals of white supremacy," as Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University, put it.
Against this backdrop, the furor over Mr. Lott ultimately became a national tutorial. Addressing a 100th birthday party for Mr. Thurmond on Dec. 5, Mr. Lott, a lifelong Mississippian, declared of his state: "When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either."
Mr. Lott said he was simply trying to praise a retiring colleague on his birthday. He maintained that he had made a poor choice of words, but that it was a "mistake of the head -- and not the heart." He insisted he was trying to honor Mr. Thurmond for his work on national defense and fiscal matters, not his defense of segregation. Republicans grumbled that the controversy was fanned by Democrats eager to wound an incoming majority leader after they had suffered big losses in the midterm election.
IT took time for the backlash to develop. As Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University, put it, "you had to know something" about the Dixiecrats, who captured 92 percent of the white vote in Mississippi in 1948, to understand the provocative nature of Mr. Lott's remarks. It took five days for Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, to denounce his comments, and seven days for President Bush to do the same.
"Different Americans reacted differently," said Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., and a professor at American University and the University of Virginia. "Black Americans were angry. White Americans were ashamed. And sometimes, shame makes you push the memory away." He added, "As a nation we're not comfortable with this memory."
Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, agreed that Mr. Lott's casual endorsement of the Dixiecrats ultimately "touched a raw nerve." He was a child in Alabama during the 1948 campaign, but said he remembered it well. 
"Strom Thurmond walked out of the convention in 1948, and the Dixiecrats met in Birmingham, Ala., where he was nominated. It was a period of tremendous fear on the part of African-Americans. There was just fear."
BY week's end, the new majority leader was fighting for his political life, apologizing again, with his political record on civil rights coming under intense scrutiny. "Let me be clear," Mr. Lott said Friday night. "In celebrating his life, I did not mean to suggest in any way that his views of over 50 years ago on segregation were justified or right. It was wrong and immoral then and it is now. By the time I came to know Strom Thurmond -- some 40 years after he ran for president -- he had long since renounced many of the views of the past, repugnant views he had had."
In fact, Jack Bass, Mr. Thurmond's biographer, said he found it interesting that when the monument to Mr. Thurmond went up on the statehouse grounds in Columbia, S.C., a few years ago, "it did not mention his '48 presidential campaign, and he approved the wording of it."

HEADLINE: Rumors of Japan's Recovery Are, It Seems, Exaggerated 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
JAPAN'S lost decade is stretching toward a lost baker's dozen. Forecast growth of 1 percent in 2002 is expected to dribble down to 0.1 percent in 2003, according to a recent survey of economists.
 Political gridlock blocks deregulation, smothering growth opportunities in health, education, housing and travel. As tax revenue dwindles to half of government expenditures, elderly conservative legislators cling to the ancien regime by printing more and more bonds. And the fight against bad bank loans looks like a frantic scene from "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" as deflation and economic stagnation create bad loans as fast as banks can write them off. 
 Japan will remain the world's second-largest economy for at least two decades, but it will not be the locomotive for a world recovery next year. Barring the unexpected, it will not be a caboose. Instead, it will be a series of well-appointed Pullman coaches, where the passengers sense that cracks are appearing in the wheels.
"Japan is like Germany, falling into a dependency on the American consumer," said Kathy Matsui, managing director of Goldman Sachs Japan Ltd. "The only way out is to deregulate. But deregulation is the last option for politicians."
Overpriced housing, overpriced recreation and a looming health care shortage for the growing legions of elderly all offer opportunities for growth if the nation chooses to tackle them. But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has more members in Parliament over 70 than under 40. For the grandfathers wielding behind-the-scenes power in Parliament, Japan, with the world's longest life expectancies, looks pretty good today, compared with their childhoods in the 1940's and 1950's.
Today's politicians do not expect to be around when today's bills come due. The amount of government debt is the equivalent of 140 percent of gross domestic product, the highest ratio for a major market economy. All three leading New York bond rating agencies downgraded Japanese yen ratings this year.
The Japanese miracle was hailed as a triumph of the Japanese people. But the Japanese malaise is now the fault of outsiders. Tokyo's stock markets are dragged down by New York markets. Japan "imports deflation from China" -- a code phrase for the fact that Chinese workers will do the same assembly work as Japanese, but for 5 cents on the dollar.
Like alchemists, financial officials write lengthy newspaper essays, trying to divine a magic monetary formula that will turn recession into resurrection. Voices for deregulation are relegated to the political fringe.
Without much help from the government, Japan struggles to adjust to Asia's great economic fact of the 21st century -- the embrace of market economics by China, a nation with 10 times the population.
While the government worries about dropping prices, the people worry about dropping salaries. White-collar incomes have fallen for 21 months. Summer and winter bonuses, responsible for as much as a third of incomes, are down by a record 5 percent. Next year, the government plans to cut some civil service pay and retirement allowances.
More significant, new workers are having a hard time finding well-paying jobs. In a neat switch, the latest government statistics show that in August there were 420,000 fewer full-time jobs than a year earlier, and 400,000 additional temporary jobs. 
Unemployment is expected to creep up to 6 percent next year, from 5.5 percent now, a post-World War II record. Unofficial unemployment is already at European levels, around 8.5 percent.
If a Dow Jones survey of economists, which pinned growth at 0.1 percent next year, comes true, 2002 will be remembered as Japan's shortest recovery since the war.
"The depth and duration of the next downturn will be shallower and milder than in the last three recessions of the 1990's," forecasts Mikihiro Matsuoka, economist for Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. "Unless deflation is prevented, the disposal of bad loans will be an endless pain."
Kenneth S. Courtis, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia, is one of many foreign financial players who are quietly voting with their feet, devoting more and more time to China and less and less to Japan. 
Bad debts are paralyzing Japan's banking system "in a way which hasn't happened in a major economy since the system broke down in the 1930's," Mr. Courtis said. "Remember Thailand? When it imploded it shook markets from London to Wall Street, yet Japan's economy is 46 times larger."

HEADLINE: In Euro Zone, Woes Abound 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
IF one were to judge Europe's fledgling monetary union by its ability to generate economic growth in member countries, one would have to judge it a keen disappointment.
 The fastest-growing large economy in Europe is Britain, which has so far refused to adopt the euro, the common currency shared by 12 nations, preferring its sterling instead. Germany, home of the European Central Bank and the anchor of the euro zone, is the Continent's economic laggard, with growth for next year projected to be barely 1 percent. 
 Defenders of the euro warn against drawing too many conclusions from this comparison. Germany, and to a lesser extent France and Italy, have structural problems in their labor markets and welfare systems that Britain tackled two decades ago during the free-market revolution of Margaret Thatcher. 
While German leaders seem paralyzed by their country's woes, France has made recent strides in shaking loose its corporate sector, emerging as a modest beacon in Europe's gray economic landscape.
Still, Europe's transition to a monetary union has imposed unique restrictions on governments, tying them to a regionwide monetary policy and a set of fiscal guidelines that require that they keep their deficits below a ceiling and balance their budgets by 2006.
"If you join the union, you automatically lose autonomy in monetary policy and a great deal of flexibility in fiscal policy," said David Walton, chief European economist at Goldman, Sachs in London. Britain must consider this when taking up the issue of joining next year, he said
The European Commission recently reduced its forecast for 2003 growth in the euro zone, to 1.8 percent from 2.9 percent. Even that meager performance is contingent on stock markets and oil prices remaining stable -- no small assumption given the tension between the United States and Iraq.
In Germany, which accounts for a third of the output of the monetary union, the biggest question is whether it will escape its second recession in a year. Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank, predicts that it will slip back into the red by the end of this year.
"We are very close to hitting the wall," Mr. Walter said. "2003 will be the most challenging period of the postwar era for Germany."
Germany's troubles have deep implications for its next-door neighbors and trading partners, Austria and the Netherlands. Larger economies, like France and Italy, are somewhat less vulnerable, while some Central European countries have benefited from Germany's high labor costs, as foreign companies migrate east in search of better opportunities.
A chronically weak Germany, however, could act as a substantial drag on Europe. Mr. Walton of Goldman, Sachs noted that from 1997 to 2002, the monetary union, not including Germany, grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent. Adding in Germany, with its annual growth rate of only 1.6 percent, pulled down Europe's five-year performance to 2.3 percent.
The trouble is, Continental Europe's next-largest economies, France and Italy, are also sputtering. Goldman, Sachs forecasts growth of just 0.9 percent for Italy next year, while France is expected to grow 1.7 percent.
Recognizing the sluggish trend, the European Central Bank reduced interest rates by half a percentage point on Dec. 5. But economists note the impossibility of setting up a monetary policy that suits the needs of all 12 countries, which are growing at different rates and face different inflation concerns.
With Germany, France, and Italy all in bad odor with the European Commission because of their higher-than-expected deficits, there is also little the governments can do to jump-start their economies.
The architects of the European Union may nurture ambitions to build the world's largest economic block. But for now at least, Europe remains dependent on the United States to lift it out of its torpor.

HEADLINE: China's Hot, at Least for Now 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
CHINA's economy has defied the worldwide slowdown and continued its long streak of rapid growth, raising expectations that it has begun to pull its weight as an engine for Asia and the world.
 With the United States, Europe and Japan all experiencing sluggish growth, China is now expected to expand by a robust 8 percent this year, fueled by a surge in exports, soaring foreign investment and a housing boom. 
 Even if growth cools next year, as most economists predict, the country has begun to rival Japan as the pivotal player in Asia's economy. It has become the largest export market for both South Korea and Taiwan, for example, and has elbowed out Japan to become Asia's biggest exporter to the United States. 
"China has already become the largest market for several East Asian countries," said Nicholas Lardy, a leading expert on China's economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "It has become deeply integrated with the region and to an extent is pulling all its neighbors along with it."
Over all, China's economy lags far behind those of Japan and the United States. Its output is about a quarter of Japan's and about a ninth that of the United States. Even if China continues to grow much more quickly, it will take until the middle of the century before it becomes the world's largest economy.
Beijing has also moved exceedingly slowly to tackle the woes of its state banking system and to dismantle money-losing state enterprises. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that both sectors will drag down economic growth the next few years. Some economists argue that bad debts pose a severe long-term threat to China.
Yet those problems have been around for many years, and they have not stopped China from beginning to realize its potential. This year, it appears set to attract a record $50 billion in foreign investment, multiples more than the amount received by any other developing country and perhaps more than the United States.
Much of this investment has gone into bolstering China's position as the world's assembly line. It is now a leader in almost every category of manufactured goods, from shoes to semiconductors.
China produces so much, in fact, that some economists say it has helped create a glut of industrial products that has undermined prices -- hurting profits but helping consumers -- around the globe. China's home market has experienced falling prices for five consecutive years. So far this year, consumer prices have declined 1 percent.
Fierce competition and falling prices have forced multinational corporations to move production lines to China, which can make goods for less than its Asian neighbors can. So, its growth has come partly at the expense of the region. Still, about half of its exports, or about $275 billion last year, consists of products made in China by foreign companies or joint ventures of Chinese and foreign companies.
China has also begun pulling in imports at a record pace. Under the terms of its entry to the World Trade Organization last year, Beijing agreed to reduce tariffs sharply. They now average 15 percent, about a fourth of their peak level in the 1980's. It must reduce them further, to 9 percent on average, by 2005.
One sign of its growing importance to the world economy: China passed the United States this year as the world's largest importer of steel, helping absorb some global overcapacity. China already produces more steel than Japan and America combined, but a building boom and a surge in auto production led to imports of 23 million metric tons in the nine months ended in September, compared with 22 million tons for the United States in the period.
Or consider Asia's tourist industry. The number of visitors to Southeast Asia from both Japan and the United States has fallen below the levels of six years ago, according to Singapore government statistics. But Chinese mainlanders are traveling like never before, with the number doubling the last six years and continuing to grow despite the terrorist attacks in 2001.

For Canadians, A Porous Border

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
DAVID L. MACDONALD prefers not to tell his American customers that Softchoice, the technology reseller where he is president, is a Canadian company.
 "We're known as a North American company," Mr. MacDonald said in an interview. He tells Americans instead that the headquarters are in Toronto. "Most Americans view Toronto as a great city," he said. 
 With 27 of its 32 sales outlets and 70 percent of its sales in the United States, Softchoice is one of a growing band of companies that happen to be based in Canada but pay increasingly less attention to the border.
Some, like the auto parts maker Magna International, the aluminum producer Alcan and the gold miner Barrick Gold, now report financial results only in United States dollars. A growing number also use American as well as Canadian accounting principles in their financial statements.
The number of Canadian companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States has risen from 130 to 240 in the last decade. According to a recent study on North American economic integration by the Bank of Montreal, Canadian companies raised more money outside than inside Canada last year, most of it in the United States.
Citing lower trade barriers and improved transport and communications links between the countries, Tim O'Neill, Bank of Montreal's chief economist, said in an interview: "What you're talking about is treating North America as a single economic entity. In industries where it makes sense to operate as if the border wasn't there, that's increasingly what you're going to see." Mr. O'Neill, whose office is in Toronto, was recently elected president of the National Association of Business Economists, based in Washington.
Canada's shipments to the United States totaled almost 85 percent of total exports in the first nine months of this year, up from 73 percent in 1988, when the two countries signed their first free-trade deal. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which also includes Mexico, took effect six years later.
Canadian National Railway, based in Montreal, has bought two railroads in the United States in the last three years. More than half its revenue now comes from crossborder or domestic American traffic.
Canadian National, which calls itself North America's Railroad, is the only railroad on the continent with tracks linking the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico.
IPSCO, a steel maker, had its head office in Regina, Saskatchewan, but moved its main executive offices to Lisle, Ill., two years ago. Seventy percent of IPSCO's assets are in the United States, it reports in United States dollars and its stock is listed on both the New York and Toronto exchanges.
Since 1996, Canada's five big banks have spent 13 billion Canadian dollars ($8.3 billion) on acquisitions south of the border. For instance, Toronto-Dominion Bank bought Waterhouse Securities Inc., now TD Waterhouse, one of the biggest discount brokerage firms, and Royal Bank of Canada paid 2.3 billion Canadian dollars ($1.4 billion) for Centura Banks Inc., of Rocky Mount, N.C.
Reflecting their broadening horizons, several banks have dropped the Canadian part of their names for day-to-day business. Toronto-Dominion these days usually calls itself TD Bank Financial Group, and Bank of Montreal, which owns Harris Bank in Chicago, has become the BMO Financial Group.
Still, even as these companies spread their wings across the border, a vigorous debate has erupted here over whether North American integration is doing Canadian business more harm than good.
Over the last three years, more than 60 of Canada's biggest companies have disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, with more than half of them taken over by foreign, mostly American, companies. Gordon M. Nixon, Royal Bank's chief executive, told a business group in Montreal earlier this year, "We should be asking why many of our industry leaders are being consolidated rather than doing the consolidating, why we are losing head offices at such an alarming rate, and what is the cost."
But Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, based in Ottawa, said in an interview that taking into account the size of the two economies, Canadian companies have been far more active acquirers in the United States than American companies have in Canada.
"Far from being timorous little mice waiting for the cat to come and eat us," he said, "we have been remarkable for acquisitions south of the border." 
Mr. d'Aquino said that his council's members, who head Canada's biggest corporations, are strong proponents of even more free trade with the United States. The council and its American counterpart, the Business Roundtable, are considering the merits of a North American customs union, with a common external tariff, and the elimination of antidumping and countervailing-duty laws between the countries.
For now, however, many differences remain in laws and business practices. Jack M. Mintz, president of the CD Howe Institute, a policy research group based in Toronto, said, "We now have what's called a North American company, but in practice, instead of 10 different provinces and 3 territories in Canada, they have to think of 63 different jurisdictions."
Softchoice's Web site is divided into American and Canadian sections, and users switching from one to the other are warned that "you will lose your shopping cart and some products may not be available in the other country." Mr. MacDonald says he has also learned that being a North American company means "you have to be sensitive, like don't plan anything around Thanksgiving weekend."

HEADLINE: If There's a Global Rebound, The U.S. Will Have to Lead It 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
IN the election for the country most likely to drive a global economic recovery, only one candidate is receiving any votes: the United States.
 It does not matter that the nation's growth was just moderate this year, with more of the same expected for 2003 -- Britain, France, Germany and Japan all performed worse. Only China is emerging as a formidable contender, but its time to seize the limelight may still be several years away. 
 "There's very little chance that you're going to get a global recovery led by anybody except the United States," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist of Salomon Smith Barney. Europe's economies, he said, underperformed throughout the recent economic cycle. Limping Japan, which once contributed to the expansion of the global economy until it fell into a slump in the early 1990's, is still hampering growth in Asia, he added. 
Among wealthy countries, only Canada and Australia will grow faster than the United States in 2002 and 2003, according to most forecasters. Yet their economies are far too small to pull the rest of the world along by investing in industries abroad and by importing goods and services. Combined, they are worth only one-seventh as much as the United States.
The lack of speedy growth in Japan and Western Europe is a source of consternation for John B. Taylor, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. "Every country in the world should grow faster than the United States," he said.
Bad policies have slowed several big economies down, Mr. Taylor explained. "The Bank of Japan has made conditions very difficult for growth in Japan," he said. Without fixing the downward spiral of prices, he said, the country cannot expect to revive.
Germany, Mr. Taylor continued, has failed to duplicate American gains in productivity, the amount of goods and services workers can generate in a set period of time. He also criticized restrictions on hiring and firing, saying they make Germany's economy unresponsive to changing conditions.
Germany, France and the rest of the euro-currency countries may also be held back by overly conservative monetary policy, said David Dodge, the governor of Canada's central bank. "Obviously, they are running considerably below capacity," he said. He suggested that the European Central Bank could lower interest rates without raising the threat of inflation, but he bemoaned the imperfections of the regional system. "You've got monetary policy which is too tight for Germany and too loose for Ireland."
Though there may be only lethargy across the Atlantic, across the Pacific there is a flicker of hope -- one that promises to burst into a blaze. "There is another huge driver out there in Asia," said Gerard J. Kleisterlee, president and chairman of Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands. "It's called China."
Official figures for economic growth in China have averaged from 7 percent to 8 percent, adjusted for inflation, in the last several years. Measured in dollars, the Chinese economy is only about one-ninth the size of the United States'. It is about half the size when adjusted for differences in prevailing prices. China's biggest import partners include Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the United States. But imports amount to about 5 percent of China's gross national product, versus 11 percent in the United States, and living standards are only about one-eighth as high.
China might not yet be ready to power economic growth abroad, but companies from around the world are already latching onto the growth potential of its market. Carlos Ghosn, president of Nissan Motor, said that China's demand for motor vehicles had risen faster than anyone expected. More than three million units have been sold this year, with Nissan's own sales up 80 percent. By 2010, Mr. Ghosn predicted, China would demand five million units a year.
With China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, tapping the country's market should become easier. But Mr. Ghosn warned that companies that did not already have good relations with the Chinese government might have a hard time entering the fray. 
In addition to emphasizing China, Mr. Kleisterlee said, Philips is developing new products for India and other big markets with expanding middle classes. Mr. Ghosn said that Iran and Iraq, which he expects to become commercially inclined democracies, could join that group before too long. Brazil, despite questions surrounding its new populist leadership, could also present valuable opportunities once its economy stabilizes, Mr. Dodge said.
For at least the next couple of years, though, the onus of global economic leadership rests squarely on the United States. That role may come at a cost.
The trade deficit, which has risen for a decade to set new records, can increase only if the United States continues its importing spree and remains the most attractive country for foreign investment. If Mr. Taylor's contention -- that every country should grow faster than this one -- ever comes true, that status will change.
At that point, which may come far in the future, foreigners will prefer to put their financial capital elsewhere. The United States will lose a crucial source of financing for investment and will need to save more, rather than consume more, to keep growing.
With less demand for American stocks and bonds, there will be less demand for the dollars needed to buy them. The dollar will therefore lose ground in currency markets. Though a weaker dollar would spur exports, it could also push prices up in the United States, leading the Federal Reserve Board to clamp down on the economy for a prolonged period. But as foreigners switch to buying America's goods and services -- things with real, intrinsic value -- instead of its securities, the trade deficit will disappear.
Mr. Ghosn, whose company is based in Japan, said he was not worried about that turn of events because of Nissan's productive capacity in the United States. If the dollar tumbles, the cost of a car built in the United States will not change much. Walter B. Wriston, former chairman and chief of Citicorp, went a step further. The trade deficit, he said, is one of "the two numbers that mean the least," along with the federal budget deficit.

People Are Talking About Looser Wallets

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
VANILLA will be the scent of the year for 2003, according to Mintel, a research company, and citrus the flavor of the year. Green in all shades will be the color in home furnishings for 2003, the trade association Cotton Inc. says. But when it comes to forecasts for advertising spending, the crystal ball clouds over.
 As one of the most unsettled years in memory comes to a bumpy conclusion, Madison Avenue is anticipating an improvement; big advertisers -- buoyed by an economy that by some measures appears to be emerging from its sluggishness -- are looking to increase their marketing budgets. 
 So most forecasts call for a moderate increase in ad spending next year of 3 percent to 4 percent over this year, which is likely to end with a gain of 2 percent to 3 percent from 2001. The dean of forecasters, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president at the giant New York media agency Universal McCann, is more optimistic, predicting an increase of 5 percent in 2003 from 2002. 
The recovery in ad spending may be uneven, however, as it was this year. Some marketers in categories like automobiles, entertainment and fast food reopened their wallets faster than others and allocated ad dollars to some media, like television and radio, ahead of others. That is one reason several forecasters like John Perriss, chief executive at another media giant, ZenithOptimedia in London, are projecting an increase of 1 percent to 2 percent in 2003, with a full recovery not until 2004.
There is also enough general uncertainty, centered on a possible war with Iraq and further terrorist attacks, to cause the upbeat predictions to be qualified with phrases evocative of the old railroad timetable admonition that train schedules are subject to change without notice.
"We all live with our fingers crossed today," said Gary Fries, president and chief executive at the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York, the trade group for local and national radio stations and networks.
"Planning seems to be getting back to normal and confidence seems to be returning," he added, "short of a devastating event." Such events caused ad spending in 2001, already lagging because of a faltering economy before Sept. 11, to decline 6.5 percent from the record results of 2000. That was the steepest percentage decline since the Depression year of 1938, when ad spending dropped 8.1 percent.
Even with the gains expected for 2002 and 2003, "we're still behind 2000," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, the industry trade organization. "But up is still better than down. It could be a lot worse."
"The term I use about next year is 'reasonably optimistic,' " he added. "It won't be gangbusters, but it will be better than 2002."
Explaining his rational exuberance, Mr. Drake said that "employment has finally stabilized and agencies will start to do some hiring."
Even the markets "that have been hardest hit with cutbacks, New York and San Francisco, are starting to come back," he said.
"I think it's going to be O.K.," Mr. Drake added, with one large caveat: "If we go to war with Iraq, all bets are off."
Assuming no war or terror, Lauren Rich Fine, the analyst who follows the advertising industry for Merrill Lynch, said that "it feels as if there's going to be enough of an ad recovery that we could measure it." She forecasts an increase in ad spending of 4 percent next year, compared with a projected gain of 0.7 percent for 2002 over 2001.
"The big theme for me is that a lot of industries have excess capacity in an environment of low inflation," she added, and that "could lead to extra spending in advertising to gain more market share."
Such spending is already coming from marketers in crowded categories that also include banks, drugs, health care, mortgage lenders, packaged foods and retailers.
"Advertising is strengthening across categories," said Mr. Fries of the radio bureau, "which creates pressure on demand." He is predicting a percentage increase in spending for radio commercials in 2003 "in the high single digits." So far this year, ad spending for radio is up 5 percent.
For online advertising, a forecast from eMarketer, a research company in New York, puts the increase in spending at 5 percent next year. Though not robust, that would be the first percentage gain since 2000."Overhype of the Internet is a wound that hasn't been fully recovered from," said David Hallerman, senior analyst at eMarketer, "but with the ad industry strengthening along with the economy, there will be relief" for the interactive media.
One reason for the slow rebound is that younger executives "more comfortable with the Internet" are moving into senior posts at consumer product companies, Mr. Hallerman added, "and that 'comfort factor' cannot be underestimated."
Whether or not paired with the Internet, television advertising has been the standout story of 2002. Robust demand for commercial time, particularly on national broadcast networks, began in the spring and gained momentum through the year. Almost every forecast for 2003 includes similarly strong gains for television ad spending.
It's a "flight to safety," said Chris Rohrs, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, the trade association for local TV stations, echoing an observation made by many executives and analysts.
By that, Mr. Rohrs said, he means that when ad dollars are scarce and marketers are "desperate to make sure what they do works," they tend to shun the more experimental media -- even if they cost less -- in favor of proven mainstays.
Television may be "the most expensive in raw dollars," he added, but it is also "the least expensive in cost efficiency."
TV, along with radio, also benefits in uneasy climates because of the shorter lead times required to book spots. Conversely, that works against print media, particularly monthly magazines, which in some instances have closing dates up to three months before they are published. No surprise, then, that through the first 11 months of 2002, magazine ad pages fell 4.5 percent from the period a year ago, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
"People say, 'When are magazines going to catch up?' " said Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the Magazine Publishers of America in New York. "It's always a little bit difficult to predict because of the closing dates for the monthlies."
"We're encouraged," she added, "that recent months have indicated an upward trend" in categories including magazines for parents, teenagers and young men, as well as those focused on the home, "which are benefiting from the 9/11 nesting effect."
In another encouraging sign for magazines, several are increasing circulation guaranteed to advertisers in 2003.
For all the positive indicators, the twin shadows of war and terror tower over everyone's forecast. What happens, for example, "if people spend more time listening to news on AM radio than to music on FM radio?" or "if everyone turns to CNN?" asked Michael J. Russell, the advertising analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Without domestic terror or an overseas war, Mr. Russell forecasts ad spending to increase 4.2 percent in 2003.
"We had a couple of years when we overindexed," he said, referring to the unusually robust gains of 1999 and 2000, "and we had a couple of years we underindexed," referring to 2001 and 2002.
"Now we're looking right down the middle," he added. "In these uncertain times, I don't know if it's encouraging as much as reassuring."

Amid Financial Despair, Argentines See a 'Little Summer'

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
ARGENTINES have struggled to overcome the worst depression in their history this year, an economic crisis so contagious that every neighboring country has been affected to some degree. But a year after the financial system here collapsed and Argentina defaulted on most of its $141 billion public debt, there are finally signs that the worst may be past.
 Granted, Argentina is still a financial pariah, and will remain so until it can negotiate an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. But a year-old freeze on billions of dollars in bank deposits was lifted in early December, and recent increases in consumer spending, exports and government revenues have all contributed to what hopeful Argentines are calling el veranito, or the little summer. 
 Transforming that tenuous comeback into a full-scale recovery is complicated, however. In theory, Argentina is brimming with investment opportunities: the same peso that traded at parity with the dollar a year ago is now worth just over 28 cents, meaning that local companies can be bought at bargain prices. But capital remains scarce here because Argentine savers no longer trust banks, and foreigners suffered big losses in the default.
As a result, the interim president, Eduardo Duhalde, spent much of the year trying to coax the monetary fund into restoring the line of credit that was suspended in December 2001. But while Brazil received a record $30 billion loan from the monetary fund at the height of its difficulties in August, Argentina has endured months of off-again, on-again talks with its creditors and ended the year in default with even the World Bank.
Nor is Argentina alone in its financial despair. 
The crisis has dealt a devastating blow to Mercosur, the South American common market comprising six nations with a combined gross domestic product of over $1 trillion and a population of 250 million. Compared with its peak, for example, annual trade between Brazil and Argentina, the group's two biggest members, has dropped 50 percent, to $7 billion.
Even Chile, the region's most open and vibrant economy, had its growth rate drop by more than half this year. But a free trade agreement with the European Union that goes into effect on Jan. 1 promises a new burst of investment and exports, and Chile and the United States agreed on a similar accord last week. It is expected to be approved by the congresses of both countries during the first half of 2003 and to go into effect in 2004. The Bush administration hopes it will become the springboard for negotiating a broader agreement for the entire Western hemisphere.
But the political uncertainty that has plagued Argentina throughout this year, helping delay an economic recovery, is expected to continue in 2003. The election to choose Mr. Duhalde's successor is scheduled for April 27 (with a second round on May 18 if needed), and until a president is sworn in for a four-year term on May 25 and the new government's policies become clear, even domestic investors are unlikely to make any big commitments.
South America's largest economy, Brazil, faces a different set of problems, but recession is not likely to be one of them. President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party, elected in a landslide in late October, has promised measures to stimulate growth, including providing incentives for domestic industry and a lowering of interest rates, which are among the highest in the world. He predicts a quick turnabout from the stagnation of recent years.
"Only development can guarantee stability," said Antonio Palocci, whom Mr. da Silva has designated as finance minister, in a recent interview. "Brazil is ready to return to the growth rates of 7 or 8 percent a year" that it enjoyed during the "Brazilian Miracle" of the 1970's.
There are concerns, though, that too much stimulus will result in increased inflation, Brazil's traditional bugaboo. Mr. Palocci vowed that the new government would hold inflation to single digits, but the year is ending with a worrying surge in prices, provoked largely by a weakening of the Brazilian currency, the real. That makes imported items like gasoline and wheat more expensive, and many analysts are predicting inflation rates in the teens for 2003.
Mr. da Silva's government will also inherit a complicated debt problem, which has led some analysts to argue that a debt rescheduling is inevitable. The real declined in value against the dollar some 30 percent during 2002, in part because of persistent skepticism in the financial markets about the Workers' Party. Since much of Brazil's internal debt is linked to the exchange rate, domestic obligations have soared accordingly.
Brazil thus begins the year with total debt of more than $250 billion, which could rise if the real continues to weaken. In early December, J. P. Morgan Research ignited a controversy with the new government when it urged investors to lower their exposure in Brazil, arguing that Mr. da Silva is "going to disappoint the market and will provoke a fall in foreign bonds and an increase in country risk."

Key Questions on Tax Breaks: How Big? Who Gets Them?

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
WITH more tax breaks for business a near certainty now that Republicans control both the administration and Congress, the issues are how big the cuts will be and which companies will reap the savings.
 Individual taxpayers might also obtain some breaks because of a growing view in Washington, promoted by the three leading business lobbies, that the best way to stimulate the economy would be to provide something similar to the advance refunds of up to $300 a person that were mailed out after Congress passed the Bush tax cuts in 2001. 
 Whether the new device would take the form of a brief holiday from Social Security and Medicare taxes, a step that could let employers obtain half the tax break, or of a cut in the lowest tax bracket to 5 percent from 10 percent will almost certainly become a crucial issue between Republicans and Democrats.
Now that the federal budget surpluses that extended as far as the eye could see last year have turned into great waves of red ink, it is unclear how willing the more fiscally prudent members of Congress will be to borrow to finance tax cuts. The costs of security after last year's Sept. 11 attacks, not to mention the looming prospect of war in Iraq, could quickly wash Washington in still more red ink. 
Even with no new tax cuts, corporate income tax collections next year are expected to be only a bit more than 1 percent of the gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in 2000 and 4.1 percent in 1965. Corporate income taxes are about 3.4 percent of the economies of the other industrialized countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, yet American business leaders continue to say that they are at a disadvantage compared with foreign companies when it comes to taxes.
The sharp drop in corporate tax receipts is partly because of smaller profits. But it is also a result of widespread tax shelters, increased aggressiveness in claiming deductions in the face of a business-friendly Internal Revenue Service and a heavy sprinkling of favors for business scattered through the Homeland Security Act and other legislation.
The United States Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Federation of Independent Business contend that more tax cuts are needed to stimulate the economy.
"We are most interested in a stimulus package," said R. Bruce Josten, the executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, which represents three million businesses, from mom-and-pop stores to industrial giants.
"We have an uneven and momentumless economy," he added. "We need stimulus."
Mr. Josten said most people had spent the advance refund checks of up to $300 apiece that they received last year. The refunds resulted from the creation of a new 10 percent tax bracket. The first part of everyone's taxable income is taxed at the lowest rate, and since that had been 15 percent until the Bush tax cuts were enacted in June 2001, taxpayers received a refund for money already withheld. That experience suggests that raising the limits on the income taxed in the 10 percent, 15 percent and 27 percent brackets may also stimulate the economy, Mr. Josten said, especially since there are no tax rate reductions scheduled in 2003.
Some Democrats are considering the idea of cutting the 10 percent tax rate in half, which would put up to $300 more in tax cuts on the table for all individual taxpayers with at least $6,000 of taxable income and for married couples with at least $12,000. 
The drive for cuts for big business will almost certainly focus attention on the huge backdoor tax cut that Congress approved last year. In 2002 and the two following years, companies receive "bonus depreciation" that speeds up the write-offs of capital equipment. That subtle change amounts to a 25 percent tax cut for corporations during the three-year period, and businesses hope that the change will be extended or even made permanent.
Even though the 2001 tax cuts were a significant victory for President Bush, the law has a sunset provision: the cuts are to expire on Dec. 31, 2010. Now the biggest items on the president's agenda are getting new legislation to make the cuts permanent and enacting an estimated $20 billion worth of tax breaks in the energy policy legislation that was put on the back burner after 9/11.
The administration contends that making the cuts permanent and perhaps speeding up some provisions would be a stimulus. But economists like Eric M. Engen of the American Enterprise Institute and William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution say such steps would do little to strengthen the economy in the short run and could add to the government's red ink in the long run unless they spurred huge economic growth. 
Making the Bush cuts permanent would result in growing federal budget deficits that in 2012 would reach $866 billion, the Congressional Budget Office reported this month.
Discussing another break favored by business, Mr. Josten said that increasing the amount of capital equipment that businesses could write off immediately, rather than depreciating it over several years, to $50,000 from the current $22,500 would stimulate investment by small businesses. And he said the chamber advocated that the size of businesses allowed to use cash accounting be doubled -- it is now limited to concerns with less than $5 million in revenues -- and that limits on money set aside in retirement plans be raised.
Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 privately owned businesses, said the federation also wanted to see the capital write-off limits raised. "Our members feel strongly about increasing expensing," he said. "We are very much supportive of a move up to $50,000, but we think that unless it is a real asset, like a new building, that you should be able to just write off a new truck or computer or whatever, in the first year."
He said that typical family-owned businesses, unlike public companies, were not trying to show a profit to shareholders. Family businesses generally seek to increase asset values, or wealth, he said, while keeping profits as low as possible to keep taxes down.
Since Mr. Faris was interviewed, the organization's chief lobbyist has called for raising the capital write-off expensing limit to $100,000 -- a proposal that indicates growing ambitions for business tax cuts. 
The administration's proposal to make permanent the repeal of the estate tax is also hotly disputed. Many Democrats attack the proposal as a tax break for the rich, but many business owners support the president's plan because they hope to be able to pass intact businesses on to heirs. 
Another major issue facing Congress will be a ruling by the World Trade Organization that a 15 percent income tax break on export goods is illegal. Unless Congress resolves this issue next year, it is widely expected that the trade organization will impose sanctions on the United States.
There is also strong support among investors for allowing more net investment losses to be deducted from ordinary income like salaries. Current law allows a $3,000 deduction for capital losses, a figure that has not changed since its enactment more than two decades ago. Although losses can be carried forward without limit, it would take someone with a $60,000 loss in the stock market and no future capital gains 20 years to deduct all the losses.

Can a Bloodied S.E.C. Dust Itself Off Now and Get Moving?

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN William H. Donaldson enters his cavernous corner office on the sixth floor of the Securities and Exchange Commission early next year, he will head an agency at one of its lowest points since its creation nearly 70 years ago.
 Lawmakers and White House officials expect Mr. Donaldson to be confirmed as the commission's 27th chairman shortly after Congress convenes in a few weeks. He joins an agency that has been rudderless and plagued by staffing and budgetary problems as it has struggled to keep up with the wave of corporate scandals. 
 Although the agency brought a record number of cases and approved a significant number of new rules in the last year, two divisions -- enforcement and compliance inspections -- are understaffed and have been unable to open many of the investigations that officials say are necessary. 
Its corporation finance division cannot keep up with the deluge of company filings. And its market regulation division has spent years trying in vain to persuade the commissioners to adopt rules of enormous consequence to the way stock markets set prices.
Both the big and small issues before the S.E.C. in the next few months will have lasting implications for the agency's future and determine whether it can regain the role it has played since the Depression as the enforcer of clean markets and the confidence builder for investors.
"This is the year in which the agency defines itself for the next decade," said James D. Cox of the Duke University School of Law, an authority on corporate law and author of a textbook on accounting. "Without gaining public support for its mission, it runs a very substantial risk of being marginalized in Washington. It is already being marginalized outside of Washington by a number of aggressive attorneys general."
Signs are emerging of a new direction by the commission. In a speech last week before the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Stephen M. Cutler, the director of the enforcement division, advocated bringing more cases against accounting firms, rather than just against the firms' partners, for serious violations.
"It is time to adopt a new enforcement model -- a new paradigm: one that holds an accounting firm responsible for the actions of its partners; one that reverses the current presumption against suing firms for an audit failure," he said.
"The current practice of suing individual auditors without also charging their firms may not adequately reflect, at least in some cases, the role and responsibility of firms in these matters," Mr. Cutler added.
Still, it is not known how committed Mr. Donaldson, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange, will be to substantial new regulation. He unsuccessfully fought efforts to hold foreign companies to the same tough accounting standards as domestic ones. And he has been sharply critical of the regulation that prohibits companies from discriminating in the way they disclose information to the marketplace.
As a result of the past year's corporate scandals, both the commission and a new board overseeing the accounting board face a number of complex and far-reaching policy decisions in the next year. These decisions could determine the regulations of every major component of public corporations -- from executives and boards, to auditors and lawyers, stock analysts and credit rating agencies.
"If you look at the mess that we've been through, it's like any disaster," said Ronald J. Gilson, a corporate and securities expert who teaches at the law schools at Columbia and Stanford universities. "It was the simultaneous failure in every market and governance area that we all rely on. That means we're looking at significant change and possible reform at every level."
"All of the main components of corporate governance are still in play," he added. "What is stunning is that I can't remember a time in modern business history when more than two of these areas were in play at the same time."
Many new regulations are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a landmark corporate law adopted in July in response to the corporate failures and accounting breakdowns. Experts say the commission's decisions over the next few months will have profound implications for investors and public companies, as well as for the agency itself. 
The accounting board is expected to begin its operations early next month and faces several important decisions. It must hire a staff, decide how it will inspect the nation's largest accounting firms and determine whether it will set new auditing standards or rely largely on the standards that have been set by the profession. 
In the coming months, the commission must decide what a corporate lawyer who discovers evidence of fraud or other violations must do. The agency must develop rules for treating financial transactions that have been kept off the balance sheets of public companies. The agency must also conduct a potentially crucial study about whether it is time to move away from a system that uses accounting rules to one that employs more generalized principles.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also authorized a 77 percent increase in the agency's budget and a substantial jump in the size of its staff. Until last week, the White House appeared reluctant to push for such a large increase, and the new Republican Congress has other priorities that could leave the agency with many of its old problems even as it struggles to pump out new regulations. 
In announcing the selection of Mr. Donaldson, President Bush tried to put the budget issue to rest by vowing to seek a substantial increase next year. He said it would be "nearly double" last year's budget. White House aides said the proposal would be for more than the $776 million that was authorized by Congress but never received by the commission.
The main problems with the agency have not been with its bureaucracy but with its budget and its leadership. The commission and the accounting board lost their chairmen last month when Harvey L. Pitt and William H. Webster resigned in the political turmoil over Mr. Webster's selection by the commission. With the selection of Mr. Donaldson, commission officials say that even before his confirmation, he will consult with the other commissioners to find a successor to Mr. Webster.

Corruption, Crime, Chicanery: Business Through the Ages

BYLINE:  By CHARLES P. KINDLEBERGER; Charles P. Kindleberger is emeritus Ford professor of international economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

 BODY:
THE accounting scandals involving Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom, Qwest Communications, Tyco and other once highly regarded companies have caused a crisis of confidence among many Americans. Some ask whether the problems are so severe as to represent an irreparable fault in the economic system.
 From a historical perspective, the answer is that economies are capable of recovering and making progress, even after near devastation -- not only from war, as in the case of Germany and Japan after World War II, but also from economic chicanery, which is scarcely new. 
 After bubbles collapse and interfere with economic growth, the resulting loss of income stimulates efforts to maintain and increase income, both honestly and in corrupt ways. 
Starting in 1600 with the establishment of the British East India Company, followed by its Dutch counterpart two years later, Europeans learned how to extract great wealth from the Far East. Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of India, and Robert Clive, a civil servant with the East India Company who became known as "the conqueror of India," were perhaps the earliest private malefactors of great wealth. Hastings accumulated $:200,000 in India and transferred it to England in the 18th century; in the same period Clive transferred $:280,000.
Edmund Burke, the 18th-century statesman, argued that Clive ought to be removed. At the same time Lord North, who served as Britain's prime minister from 1770 to 1782, contended that Hastings's $:200,000 was not excessive.
A few hundred lesser employees of the company also did well. On nominal salaries, clerks (known then as writers), cadets, assistant surgeons, ship captains and ship husbands, who handled charters, all found opportunities to acquire wealth. 
Human nature has not changed. Andrew S. Fastow -- who, while serving as Enron's chief financial officer, was also running partnerships, particularly LJM2, set up by Enron to keep debt off the books -- has been indicted on 78 counts of fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. The East India employees smuggled goods to Europe and dealt in opium with China. The role of ship commander was bought and sold, typically for $:2,000 to $:5,000, but sometimes for up to $:10,000 and once for double that.
So egregious were their activities that British historians were not the only ones to single out Hastings and Clive. A German economic historian, Jacob van Klaveren, writing in the 1950's on the origins of corruption between the state and private business, asserted that corruption in business had begun with the East India Companies.
By the 19th century, business corruption was so much a fact of life that it became a prominent theme for European novelists. Among them were Honore de Balzac in "The Human Comedy"; Charles Dickens, "Little Dorrit"; William Makepeace Thackeray, "The Newcomes"; Anthony Trollope, "The Way We Live Now"; Gustav Freytag, "Soll und Haben"; Alexandre Dumas, "Black Tulip"; and Emile Zola, "L'Argent." 
And like many European fashions, swindling found its place in America by the 19th century, where Mark Twain and Theodore Dreiser included it in the plots of their books, while Boston produced Charles Ponzi, a swindler so prominent that his name became synonymous with one type of chicanery. He borrowed money for 45 days at 50 percent interest and paid early investors with cash from later suckers whose money he kept.
The writers had abundant examples to inspire them, including Eugene Bontoux, founder and director of Union Generale, a French bank that collapsed in 1882, and in the United States, Daniel Drew, James Fisk Jr. and Jay Gould, who manipulated the stock of the Erie Railroad.
Financial scandals abounded on both sides of the Atlantic in the 20th century, as well. Among the perpetrators were the cabinet members involved in the Teapot Dome scandal during the administration of President Warren G. Harding; Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish Match King, who put together an empire of companies and became a private lender to governments before the empire collapsed, fraudulent accounting was exposed and he committed suicide in Paris in 1932; Robert L. Vesco, who looted Investors Overseas Services, the Swiss-based mutual fund empire founded by Bernard Cornfeld; Michele Sindona, the financier behind the Franklin National Bank in New York and Banca Ambrosia in Milan; and Nicholas Leeson, the rogue trader who brought down Barings Bank.
Two famous 18th-century swindlers -- Sir John Blunt, chairman of the South Sea Trading Company, and John Law, a Scot, who persuaded the French government in 1716 to let him open a bank that could issue paper currency in Louisiana, which France owned -- might be said to have a modern counterpart. Sir John's stock manipulation led to what became known as the South Sea bubble and produced the crash of the London stock exchange. Law's issuance of paper money, which was used to drive up shares that then plunged, became known as the Mississippi bubble.
Before the bubbles burst, each took vast earnings and invested in real estate. Sir John had six contracts to buy estates when the South Sea bubble burst in 1720; Law owned one-sixth of the Place Vendome in Paris, plus a dozen estates in the French countryside, when the Banque Royale and the Compagnie d'Occident failed that same year.
Some figures in current scandals have also shown an eye for real estate. One of them is Kenneth L. Lay, the former chief executive of Enron. He acquired a multimillion-dollar penthouse in Houston, his home city, plus three large houses in Aspen, Colo., worth more than $5 million each, along with a building site valued at more than $1 million. 
Investors have good reason to worry that next year may produce new disclosures of illegal insider trading, overstated profits and other dubious accounting practices. But the year could also bring new rules for corporate accounting, as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the new Public Accounting Oversight Board, federal and state governments, the courts and securities exchanges take up the issues raised by the scandals. Although it is too early to say whether they will succeed in overhauling the rules and restoring public confidence, it is fair to say that after disclosure of history's past swindles, public outrage led eventually to reform.

After a Boom, There Will Be Scandal. Count on It.

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
IT was, it seemed, the year when corporate America went crooked as it never had before, when chicanery took the place of integrity, when wrongdoing exploded in ways that could not have been anticipated.
 Then again, maybe it wasn't. 
 Despite all the surprise and anguish set off by corporate scandals, for many Wall Street historians and fraud aficionados, the year almost fits into a pattern, as the re-emergence of a moment that has become something of a tradition in the financial world. Most everyone knows of the business cycle of boom and bust, but what is less well known is capitalism's cycle of scandal. 
"I can't think of a previous boom period, whether it was the 20's, the 60's or the 80's, where it hasn't ended up a bloody mess, with declining asset values and cases of fraud," said Charles R. Geisst, a Wall Street historian and author of "Wheels of Fortune," a history of the futures markets published in September by John Wiley & Sons. 
Indeed, experts said, the emergence of frauds after the end of a market bubble is a predictable result of human nature. 
"Fraud scandals follow bumps in the market as night follows day," said Stephen L. Meagher, who has taught courses on fraud and punishment at Stanford University. "Once there are pressures put on profits, the obvious incentive for management to maintain their lifestyle or their stock prices is to fiddle with the books."
And so, long before the names Enron and WorldCom became shorthand terms for accounting misdeeds, other names in just the last century came to be used to describe whole categories of fraud.
Take Charles Ponzi. Mr. Ponzi opened up shop in Boston with an outfit named -- with what might appear a sense of future irony -- the Securities and Exchange Company. By the summer of 1920, he was soliciting investors with offers of "international postal reply coupons" -- in Mr. Ponzi's description, postage stamps that could be sold again and again. He promised 50 percent returns in 45 days and as much as 100 percent in 90 days.
Tens of thousands of investors poured millions of dollars into Mr. Ponzi's company, with the inflow eventually reaching as much as $250,000 a day. But the money was not actually being invested in anything. Instead, Mr. Ponzi simply paid early investors their returns with the money he received from later investors. But the game could not last forever, and eventually, after a Boston newspaper disclosed the truth about the scheme, Mr. Ponzi was sent to prison.
The market boom later that decade was a bubble of almost breath-taking proportions. Even regulators who should have known better were unwilling to put on the brakes. When the Federal Reserve in Washington decided to try to raise interest rates to cut short the stock rally in March 1929, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York countermanded the directive, instead injecting more money into the system to keep the euphoria going.
After the stock market crash, Senate hearings led by a special counsel, Ferdinand Pecora, were opened, and the American public heard horror stories about insider trading and stock manipulation by Wall Street insiders.
But Mr. Pecora's first witness, Richard Whitney -- the president of the New York Stock Exchange and a man of stature and high repute in the investment world -- seemed above reproach. Under cross-examination, Mr. Whitney defended the exchange's performance in the markets, proclaiming it to be "a perfect institution." There was no need, he proclaimed, for Congress to set up an agency to police the exchange; it could do the job itself.
A few years later, the exchange did ferret out a crook: Mr. Whitney himself. Throughout the boom years of the 1920's, the patrician trader had been an aggressive speculator in penny stocks, and he was hit with mammoth losses in the crash. To hide his failure, Mr. Whitney started stealing cash. He stole from his customers, including the New York Yacht Club, and he stole from a fund set up to aid the widows and orphans of brokers. And then he stole some more.
Caught by the exchange in 1938, Mr. Whitney eventually pleaded guilty to theft charges. He was the only prominent person to be imprisoned for fraud stemming from the crash; he served about three years in Sing Sing.
Some schemes, in retrospect, should have been obvious from the beginning. So it is with the one perpetrated in the late 1950's and early 1960's by Anthony DeAngelis, now known as the great salad oil swindler. Ultimately, he cheated giant financial institutions out of $175 million.
Mr. DeAngelis was the president of Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining, which had been formed to buy surplus vegetable oil from the government and sell it for export. Soon, Allied was borrowing millions of dollars, which it used to speculate in the futures market for vegetable oil; to secure the loans, Mr. DeAngelis pledged salad oil that the company had purportedly stored. The American Bureau of Statistics reported that the amount of oil handled by Allied was larger than the country's entire production of the commodity; still, no one blinked.
Eventually, in 1963, the truth came out -- the tanks of salad oil were mostly filled with water. The loans were secured with nothing. Mr. DeAngelis went to prison for a crime that nearly bankrupted two large investment houses.
Ten years later, as the boom of the 1960's gave way to the bust of the 1970's, the next big scandal emerged, involving a company called Equity Funding. For years, that company sold a hybrid package of mutual funds and insurance. Dividends from the fund paid the insurance premiums, and Equity Funding then sold those policies to reinsurance companies. But eventually, the folks at Equity Funding decided to focus on just the last step and started selling reinsurers the policies of customers who did not exist. 
Fake insurance policies -- financed by nothing and for the benefit of no one -- proved enormously profitable until 1973, when a company insider blew the whistle. The fraud ultimately opened a floodgate of lawsuits against the company's accounting firm and led to a number of changes in the ways accountants deal with their clients.
The merger boom of the 1980's produced an array of scoundrels, many of whom were discovered only after their co-conspirators betrayed them. It all started in 1986, when Dennis B. Levine, an investment banker from Drexel Burnham Lambert, was accused of engaging in illegal insider trading based on information he gleaned from his job. 
Mr. Levine had not been alone in his efforts, and quickly named others with whom he had swapped information or cash. The biggest fish he named was none other than the country's most prominent arbitrager, Ivan F. Boesky. 
When the government picked up Mr. Boesky, he in turn named others who had participated in illegal activities with him, including Michael R. Milken, who led Drexel's junk bond operation. A scandal that began as one involving just insider trading rapidly exposed a series of conspiracies that had festered on Wall Street, resulting in market manipulation, companies' being tricked into mergers and secret deals that allowed insiders to profit. Mr. Levine, Mr. Boesky, Mr. Milken and numerous others went to prison; Drexel ultimately went bankrupt.
The lesson of all this, experts said, is that investors should never grow so comfortable as to believe that the financial markets have been cleansed of potential scandal. Another will come along, on another day in another industry. The only question is when.
"This cycle goes back at least 300 years," John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University Law School, said of the constant re-emergence of scandal in the financial world. "It's just part of capitalism."

Variations on a Theme
A BIG lesson of 2002 is that engaging in corporate fraud is a little like skinning a cat -- there are plenty of ways to do it.
While scandals have ensnared many companies, the accusations of fraud run the gamut. While there are some similarities among the cases, there are also substantial differences.
In the Enron case, for example, Andrew S. Fastow, above left, was charged with using off-the-books partnerships to funnel corporate money to himself while disguising the company's deteriorating finances.
The only pure accounting case involved WorldCom, and its former chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, right. Mr. Sullivan is accused of illegally shifting expenses so that billions of dollars of costs went unreported.
The most similar criminal cases involve L. Dennis Kozlowski, top right, the former chief executive of Tyco International, and John Rigas, left, the former head of Adelphia Communications. Both were accused of looting their companies of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Finally, the insider-trading case against Samuel D. Waksal, above center, ImClone's former chief executive, was a bit of nostalgia for fraud aficionados, He is accused of selling shares of ImClone after he learned that the company's new cancer drug would not be approved.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 2, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Outlook issue of Business Day on Dec. 16 about past scandals on Wall Street misstated the timing of testimony in 1932 Senate hearings concerning the crash of the stock market. Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange, testified before Ferdinand Pecora became special counsel for the hearings. Mr. Whitney was not Mr. Pecora's first witness.

Big 3 Automakers Are Likely toSwerve Into the Slow Lane

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
HEADING into this year, a question hung over the Motor City: Could the boom-time sales pace of recent years, fueled by the mighty growth of sport utilities, possibly continue? 
 The answer for much of 2002 was a resounding yes. So now analysts are asking the same question about 2003. And this time even auto executives are bracing for a slump. 
 "Consumers are evidently responding to a sluggish economy," said Scott Sprinzen, a credit analyst for Standard & Poor's, in a recent report that suggested that a slump evident in recent months would be likely to continue into next year. "After a string of exceptionally good sales years, the market is evidently saturated." 
Last year, the terrorist attacks emptied car lots of potential buyers until General Motors refilled them quickly with its "Keep America Rolling" advertising and incentive campaign, which included offers of interest-free financing. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, quickly followed suit, and the ensuing price war made October 2001 the best month in industry history. By the end of last year, analysts worried that buoyant sales could not possibly continue in balky economic conditions and with spending money drained in a bear market. 
But they did. 
For much of the year, the Big Three price war kept people buying, providing a spot of hopefulness in a doleful economy. At least until October, the industry's worst month in more than four years. Though sales recovered somewhat in November, they were still off 13 percent from the robust levels of November 2001. 
Is this a hiccup or a harbinger? 
There is hardly a consensus. On the bullish side is Scott Hill, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, who predicts industry sales of 16.7 million vehicles next year, compared with the 16.5 million to 16.8 million expected for 2002. 
Mr. Hill cites a combination of factors, from an economy that he believes is stabilizing to consumers' desire to swap cars more often because of a glut of new products and new features, coupled with low prices. Demographic trends are also favorable, he says, because two big generations -- baby boomers and their children, Generation Y -- are entering crucial car-buying years. 
"Peak buying is around age 47," Mr. Hill said. "That's the absolute peak of automotive consumption. The percentage of the population moving into that area continues to rocket."
Members of Generation Y, he added, are moving into a period of heavy used-car buying and are also probably buying more new vehicles because of cheap offerings from Hyundai and its Kia brand. 
Other analysts, like Ronald A. Tadross of Banc of America Securities, are pessimistic. Mr. Tadross says sales are likely to be no higher than 16 million and possibly as low as 14 million next year, the latter number being something of a doomsday prediction considering that sales peaked in the United States at 17.4 million in 2000 and were 17.1 million in 2001. 
Mr. Tadross predicts that a dropoff in leasing in recent years will mean that 500,000 to a million fewer cars will come off leases next year -- and thus will not need replacing. He also says booming sales of recent years have left many people with young cars that work fine and are not worth trading in because resale values are depressed by a flood of new and used cars. 
"We already are hearing reports from dealers of trade-in-value shock on the part of consumers," he wrote in a recent report.
Whatever the level of sales diminishment, most agree it will come largely from the hide of the Big Three, which have been losing market share to foreign brands for years. Top foreign brands have managed to outsell Detroit despite having far lower incentive offers. In October, for instance, Honda's sales fell 5.6 percent, far better than the industry at large, even though the company's incentive costs, be they rebates or reduced financing, amounted to only $416 a vehicle, according to the Autodata Corporation.
By comparison, sales fell 32 percent at G.M. and 34 percent at Ford despite incentive spending of $2,575 and $2,392 a vehicle, respectively. These levels could be pushed higher if demand diminishes because competition is only increasing as foreign automakers like Nissan, Toyota and Honda continue to build more plants and push more vehicles in the United States, by far the most lucrative market.
And these are only the beginning of the Big Three's headaches next year. 
"Pension expenses will be higher," said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, "some raw-materials costs will be higher, like steel, and we'll probably see an increase in wage and benefit costs," because a new contract will be negotiated with the United Auto Workers. 
"Even before the sales outlook, things will be tough," he said.

Biotech and F.D.A.: Blame Game

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
IT'S been a tough year for the biotechnology industry, with plunging stock prices, widespread layoffs, shortages of cash, a major scandal and numerous failures of drugs in clinical trials. When industry executives look for a source of all the troubles, they often point to the Food and Drug Administration.
 The agency, industry executives often complain, has become too cautious in approving drugs. In part, they say, the situation is a result of the agency's having been leaderless for most of the Bush presidency. And the division that handles many biotechnology drugs has been particularly slow and short of employees. 
 But much of that might change in 2003. Mark B. McClellan, a physician and economist, took office last month as the F.D.A. commissioner and has pledged to speed up drug approvals.
"There's a lot of optimism," said Carl B. Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the industry's main lobbying group. "We've been through this long period since the Bush inauguration of a headless agency, and that's over."
Also, under a recently announced reorganization, protein drugs, the type typically developed by biotechnology companies, will now be regulated by the same division that handles the chemical drugs made by big pharmaceutical companies. 
That could mean speedier reviews, but in the short run lead to an exodus of top regulators from the agency. Kathryn C. Zoon, the director of the division that regulates biotechnology products, told colleagues on Friday that she is leaving to join the National Cancer Institute, in part because of the reorganization, according to current and former F.D.A. officials.
Only 15 novel drugs had been approved through late November this year, down from 24 for all of 2001 and from 53 in 1996. The time taken to approve drugs, which fell sharply during most of the 1990's, has edged up a bit in the last two or three years. 
F.D.A. officials acknowledge that they are paying more attention to interactions among drugs and to certain side effects, including one associated with irregular heart rhythms, as knowledge of those side effects has grown. But the falloff in drug approvals, they contend, stems mainly from a decline in the rate at which the industry is coming up with new drugs, a slowing that many industry executives acknowledge. 
Some say that the agency is being made a scapegoat and that the real problem is that companies are rushing their clinical trials and producing inadequate data. "I don't think there's ever been a time when the industry isn't whining about the F.D.A.," said Ira S. Loss of Washington Analysis, a research company specializing in regulatory matters. 
The most notable example was ImClone Systems, whose application for a cancer drug was rejected by the F.D.A. on grounds that the tests were sloppy. Still, the rejection and ensuing insider stock trading scandal and Congressional investigation focused attention on complaints that the F.D.A. was denying drugs to cancer patients who had no other hope. 
Other companies with setbacks include Genentech, which was told to do more study on drugs for psoriasis and asthma. Competing drugs by Genzyme and Transkaryotic Therapies for Fabry disease, a rare inherited disorder, have not been approved, although they are available in Europe. Shares of Alkermes plunged after it and Johnson & Johnson failed to win approval for Risperdal Consta, a longer-lasting version of an existing schizophrenia drug, because the F.D.A. had concerns about tests done in animals.
Executives and analysts will be watching the agency closely next year as it rules on many of the drugs, like Amevive, Biogen's psoriasis drug that was recommended for approval by an advisory panel in May. 
Another closely watched case will be that of Iressa, a pill to treat lung cancer developed by AstraZeneca. 
The reorganization of the F.D.A. will shift protein and antibody drugs from the division that handles biologic products -- those made from living things -- to the division that handles more conventional drugs. 
The announcement was initially welcomed by the industry. But now executives are concerned that F.D.A. officials with expertise in biologic drugs, unhappy at the reorganization, will leave. In addition to Dr. Zoon, who was in charge of all biologic products, Jay P. Siegel, who was in charge of reviewing protein drugs, also announced that he would retire. He cited the revamping as a reason.
"My concern is that they not lose the people with biologics expertise," said William H. Rastetter, the chief executive of Idec Pharmaceuticals.
Mr. Loss said regulating biologic drugs in the same department as chemical drugs could eventually hurt the industry by undermining the argument that biologic drugs are so complex that generic versions should not be allowed.

HEADLINE: This Testy Economy Refuses to Be Charmed 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
FOR the United States economy, the Champagne stopped flowing more than two years ago. Unfortunately, the hangover has not gone away.
 The statistics say that businesses and consumers are at least holding their own. The economy is expected to grow a solid 3 percent next year, with low inflation and strong productivity. At 6 percent, unemployment is moderate; the jobless rate was higher for most of the 1980's and early 1990's. Housing foreclosures, the ultimate sign of financial distress, are flat, and the rise in consumer debt has slowed. Japan and Western Europe would love to have the American rates of inflation, growth and unemployment. 
 But the national mood does not match the numbers. After the boom of the 1990's, when fortunes were made on every corner and the laws of economics seemed to have been repealed, the prospect of another year of middling growth is deeply unsatisfying. 
"People are facing up to the fact that the good old days aren't coming back," said Byron Wien, the senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "And if they've had their bonuses cut and the person next door has been laid off, that's going to put them in a bad mood, even if they still have their jobs."
Mr. Wien expects the economy to grow at almost 3 percent in 2003 and stocks to rise 8 to 10 percent. "We're going to have reasonable growth, a reasonable stock market," he said. "We just have to set our sights on more modest returns."
Making matters worse, the regions that were giddiest in the late 1990's -- the Northeast, Northern California and Texas -- have suffered the most in the bust that followed. Residents of New York, San Francisco and Dallas can be forgiven for feeling they have a severe case of whiplash.
Still, the transition has been painful everywhere. Since early 2000, consumer confidence has plunged. Despite a tepid rally this fall, when the markets close on Dec. 31, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will almost surely have fallen three years in a row, the first such decline in 60 years. And even the most jaded investors have been dismayed by the widespread revelations of dishonesty and greed in corporate America.
Worriers had new reasons to stay up late this fall. While most forecasters continued to expect the economy to expand next year, sputtering growth in October and November heightened the risk of a "double dip" recession. Some economists warned that the housing industry, which for two years has been the strongest sector of the economy, was overdue for a significant slowdown. With overcapacity in many industries and businesses unable to push through price increases, the risk of deflation -- a cycle of falling prices that encourages consumers to hold off on buying products or services because they expect prices to fall still further -- appeared to be rising, though it is still small.
Businesses, meanwhile, remain reluctant to make significant new investments. And after cutting short-term interest rates 12 times in two years -- to 1.25 percent now, their lowest level in four decades -- the Federal Reserve is almost out of obvious ways to stimulate the economy. The federal budget, which had a surplus of more than $200 billion in 2000, may have a deficit at least that large next year. In the short run, the increase in government spending has propped up the economy, but over time big government deficits drive up interest rates and crowd out private investment.
And while they have little economic impact, the threat of terrorism and the potential for war with Iraq (not to mention revelations of North Korea's nuclear capabilities) have not helped the uncertain national mood. The potential danger from Al Qaeda, which seemed to have faded a bit last summer, is again making headlines, with warnings from the F.B.I. too vague to be helpful but too dire to be ignored. And the United States is moving steadily closer to a war with Saddam Hussein that experts say may involve biological or chemical weapons.
Fundamentally, the United States has a confidence problem. Thanks to the Fed's aggressive easing and the stimulative effect of the budget deficit, the economy is not in awful shape. But it is not in great shape either, and should it begin to slip, the obvious remedies -- reducing interest rates and increasing government spending -- will have little effect because they are already being used. With recoveries like this, who needs recessions?
The most important question facing the economy, said William H. Gross, a money manager at Pacific Investment Management, is whether the low rates and big deficits will provide the momentum needed to put to rest the possibility of a double-dip recession.
Like many investors whose taste runs to bonds, Mr. Gross says he is cautious by nature and is not optimistic about next year. He predicts that growth will slow as the effect of lower interest rates and bigger deficits fades.
The stimulus will "work for a while, and then we'll have to see," he said. Government action cannot replace the willingness of investors and companies to take risks, Mr. Gross said.
The economist John Maynard Keynes spoke famously of the "animal spirits" that moved investors to buy shares and companies to invest. "We've got problems unless 'animal spirits' catch a bit," Mr. Gross said.
But his pessimism is not shared by everyone. Most economists and strategists expect the economy to gain momentum in 2003.
The flood of corporate and accounting scandals this year blinded investors and consumers to the fact that the United States is already recovering from the relatively mild recession it suffered in 2001, said David Roberts, senior international economist at Banc of America Securities. As the memory of corporate misbehavior fades next year, growth will accelerate, he said.
He forecasts that growth will rise steadily in 2003, from an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter to 3.7 percent by the fourth. "We've been in recovery," Mr. Roberts said. "It just hasn't been a recovery that's proceeded rapidly or in a straight line."
Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis-based economic forecasting firm, said growth this year had been stronger than most consumers realized. "The economy has grown 3.3 percent in the last four quarters," from October 2001 through September 2002, Mr. Varvares said.
During that time, the United States "has obviously had some significant headwinds to deal with -- the equity bubble, Enronitis and Sept. 11," he added. "Three major body blows to the economy through the stock market, and I'd say we did pretty well."
With unemployment rising and retail sales flattening, the economy has slowed in the current quarter, Mr. Varvares said. "We're in a little weak spot here," he said. But he does not expect the weakness to last. Both consumers and businesses are on relatively firm footing, and next year, he said, the economy will grow more than 3 percent.
Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland, said: "My assessment is that it is war jitters that are giving the economy a soft patch. Because of the nature of the problem, people have to entertain, realistically, worst-case scenarios." Those include terrorism or oil supply disruptions.
But Mr. DeKaser said that he thought those events were unlikely, and that by the spring consumers and businesses would have regained the certainty they need to make new investments and rebuild their inventories of supplies. "In my view, the economy is going to start a comeback in February or March or April of next year as those uncertainties fall away," he said.
If Congress and the Bush administration can move quickly on a short-term economic stimulus package, including tax cuts for middle-income workers and write-offs for businesses that invest in new equipment, the economy could recover even more quickly and strongly, Mr. DeKaser said. But he added that the White House appears less interested in short-term stimulus measures than in making permanent the tax cuts that were passed in 2001 and will not take full effect for several years. "Unfortunately, the things that I'm hearing discussed are not those things," he said of short-term stimulus.
Donald Straszheim, president of Straszheim Global Advisors and a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch, said he did not know whether a package of tax cuts and spending would be passed in time to help the economy through its current weakness. But he said he expected a strong recovery beginning in the summer in any case.
"This economy is going to do quite nicely in the second half, and 2004 and 2005, untouched by human hands in Washington, is solid," Mr. Straszheim said.
In one promising sign, the University of Michigan reported Friday in its monthly consumer confidence survey that Americans' faith in the economy had climbed to its highest level in four months. A preliminary reading of consumer sentiment rose to 87 from 84.2 in November, its second consecutive monthly increase. Still, the index is not far from the nine-year low it touched in October.
The gap between what the statistics are saying and what investors and consumers are feeling is reminiscent of the early 1990's, another period of slow growth that felt like a recession to many Americans.
Then as now, the Federal Reserve seemed to have lost its power over the economy. The Fed cut short-term interest rates to 3 percent by September 1992 from 8.25 percent in July 1990, yet growth remained anemic, and corporate giants like I.B.M. made highly visible job cuts. The economic pain was a crucial factor in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential victory over George Bush.
That parallel heartens some analysts, who note that the restructuring of the early 1990's set the stage for the phenomenal growth the United States posted later in the decade. The current weakness could be nothing more than a similar transition period, as telecommunications, energy and technology companies work down the glut of excess capacity they created during the bubble.
After two years of job cuts and delayed investments, "businesses are running lean," said James Paulson, chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "An extra dollar of sales is going to go right to the bottom line. Profits could revive much faster than people think, at least for a while."
Mr. Paulson predicts that the economy will grow extremely strongly next year. Pessimists have focused too much on the apparently limited effectiveness of Fed rate cuts, he said. But for most of the last two years, the economy has faced other trouble spots that have blunted the Fed's moves, including a strong dollar, which hurts exports, and high real long-term interest rates. Now the dollar has weakened, and in the fall interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note slipped below 4 percent, their lowest levels since 1962.
"We're finally giving the economy the policy it needs," Mr. Paulson said. Even a war with Iraq could be good for the economy, by providing extra stimulus as soldiers send their salaries home and military contractors win business, he said.
He expects economic growth to top 4 percent in 2003, and said it could reach 6 percent if business spending revives quickly and the trade deficit narrows thanks to the weaker dollar.
But like the pessimism of Mr. Gross, the optimism of Mr. Paulson stands on the far edge of the bell curve of economic opinion. In the words of Tobias M. Levkovich, the United States equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, the most likely course for both the economy and the stock market in 2003 is another year of "muddling through."
And muddling through may have to do.

Yes, It Was a Dismal Year for Airlines. Now the Bad News.

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
AS bad as 2002 was for the airline industry, with two big bankruptcy filings, next year might be worse.
 Continued financial turmoil, growing labor-management confrontation, unhappy passengers and possible international conflict are looming. Even the most optimistic people involved with the industry have little clue about when a turnaround might come. 
 "No one that I know of is predicting an opportunity for the industry to get out of this," said Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel departments and business travelers. "Even if the economy were to nicely firm up, that's an insufficient catalyst for recovery." 
The most immediate concern, though, is whether another airline, most likely American Airlines, will follow United Airlines and US Airways into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Already, the United bankruptcy announcement on Dec. 9 and the US Airways filing in August have set in motion extensive industrywide cost-cutting measures. This year, airlines are expected to have the deepest losses in aviation history.
Just days before United filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors, American's chief executive, Donald J. Carty, began meeting with employees to ask for a freeze on wages and further cuts aimed at reducing expenses $4 billion a year.
"The restructuring of our labor agreements is inevitable and fundamental to our long-term goal of remaining competitive and restoring profitability," said Mr. Carty, who, like other senior managers at American, is forgoing a raise for a second year.
If United is able to reduce labor costs in bankruptcy court over the next few months, management at its competitors will certainly ask union leaders for similar concessions.
But capitulation may not be automatic. "Airline employees are not going to want to change the conditions that have grown up over all the years since World War II, but they have to change, and change very dramatically," said Robert L. Crandall, a retired chairman and chief executive of American.
The industry views the tough bankruptcy experience that US Airways has had as a cautionary tale. Going into its filing, US Airways seemed to have done everything right: it had won provisional approval for federal loan guarantees, unlike United, whose application to a federal loan board was rejected. US Airways also won concessions from its union, and engaged the Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm that has invested in several troubled airlines, to prepare its reorganization.
Texas Pacific, however, was outbid by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which will take voting control of the airline once it emerges from bankruptcy. Before that happens, however, US Airways is trying to wrest more wage and benefit concessions from its unions. It has a real incentive in the threat by the retirement systems' chief executive, David G. Bronner, to withdraw its financing and send the airline into liquidation if the unions do not comply.
Management is not the only group facing turmoil. Passengers are feeling the pinch of the airlines' drastic actions as well. Beginning Jan. 1, a number of big airlines will institute $100 fees for passengers who want to stand by for a different flight. (One exception is United, which decided to cancel the fees after passengers complained.) Airlines are putting in place "use it or lose it" policies, rendering nonrefundable tickets completely worthless if a passenger does not travel. They are not even good for a credit against future travel, as they have been in the past.
Along with those changes, airlines are beginning to take aim at their frequent-flier programs as well. Delta Air Lines is leading a drive to give greater rewards to passengers who pay more for their tickets, bolstering mileage awards to full-fare coach and business-class passengers, and reducing them for customers who seek the cheapest fares.
Given that miles have been one of the airlines' best tools for generating loyalty, Mr. Mitchell predicts the Delta move will further fuel the shift of passengers to low-fare airlines, which have their own frequent-flier programs. The low-fare carriers expect to pick up business in the year ahead.
Southwest Airlines, which began transcontinental service this fall, will focus on adding flights from the cities it already serves, rather than adding destinations. That is a blow to the 115 cities on its waiting list for new service, but the strategy will give Southwest an even better chance to take on big carriers. One such is American, which competes with Southwest on 70 percent of its routes. Unlike its rivals, Southwest has been working on its labor situation all year. It has reached agreements with pilots and, most recently, ground personnel, which could prove to be great timing if other airlines are affected by labor strife.
JetBlue, meanwhile, will be expanding service, too. This fall, after National Airlines went out of business, JetBlue was able to get a head start on service to Las Vegas, which had been planned for 2003. National had offered the only direct flights between New York and Las Vegas. JetBlue plans to add even more Las Vegas flights in coming months and has its own list of cities trying to win its business.
Not all is rosy for the low-fare carriers, however. Both Delta and United have announced plans to create their own low-fare carriers, something they have tried and failed to accomplish in the past. The Delta low-fare airline, which has yet to be named, will operate between New York and Florida, using Boeing 757 jets that will be reconfigured to seat 199 coach class passengers. United plans to restart its West Coast shuttle, which was a success in its early years but ultimately fell victim to the dominance of low-fare carriers on California routes.
The one unpredictable factor hanging over the industry, affecting both airlines and passengers, is what will happen in the case of a war with Iraq. With companies already cutting travel budgets because of the weak economy, any outbreak would provide another excuse for businesses to keep managers at home. Though leisure travel has largely bounced back from the September 2001 attacks, airlines fear that any level of uncertainty could cause people to put off trips until they feel more comfortable about flying.
The uncertainties are one reason Mr. Bronner pushed management at US Airways to prepare a plan to deal with a war. Competitors probably have their own contingency plans by now, as well. Compared with war, the usual things that disrupt travel during coming months, like snowstorms, may seem easy to bear.

Supersize American Dream: Expensive? I'll Take It

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
OF all the forms of exhibitionism -- wearing clothing that clings or plunges, parading one's erudition, hooking up a Webcam -- is there any more compelling than showing off the size of one's bank account?
 Apparently not. Even though the economy is still in a fizzle, wretched excess sizzles. 
 A little history: It looked as if the 80's were the age of excess, when Ivan Boesky told us that "Greed is healthy" and Tom Wolfe treated readers to "The Bonfire of the Vanities," where Masters of the Universe bond traders made hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. 
Then the fortunes of the 90's made those 80's go-go-getters seem like so many collectors of Green Stamps. Dizzying stock prices created paper billionaires by the bushel. And they engaged in really, really conspicuous consumption. They bought mansions. Jets. Islands. They bought, in other words, a lot of "Giffen goods," the economic term that applies to perverse products that defy the general rules of demand -- including luxury items that people buy precisely because they cost more.
Some economists say that explains why consumers buy Johnnie Walker Black, when the less-expensive Johnnie Walker Red is about as good. No surprise that in the 1990's, then, Johnnie Walker brought out an even more expensive label: blue. Each bottle costs about $180 in stores. Other Giffen goods abound: Cellphones from Vertu, a high-end company started by Nokia, can cost $19,450, the price of a Toyota. A jewel-encrusted brassiere and panty set from Victoria's Secret costs $10 million, which would buy a lot of Toyotas.
The thing about outlandish spending behavior, though, is that you expect it to go away when the money disappears, the way a party dissipates after the keg floats.
The opportunities for spending way too much money have persisted well beyond the bust. Check the prices of Krug Champagne at the new Manhattan club that calls itself Powder. (Certainly not a drug reference, nope nope nope.) Even at today's low rates, the bottle will set a buyer back about a month's mortgage payment on a $200,000 house. A bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue costs $700 there. Blame refinancing for some of the extended binge; squeezing dollars from the still-rising value of housing has allowed many Americans to dig themselves far deeper into debt in style.
Or here's another idea: maybe it's about sex. With pornography freely available online, maybe the spending is a way to compensate for the falling of taboos, a way to revitalize the forbidden. A good deal of the outrageous spending is about sex, like those $10 million undies. Marketing is, at some level, about selling sex in other forms. Ads for diamonds sell the prospect of sex only slightly less blatantly than ads for beer, and cars? Just think of any Beach Boys song. A Hummer H2 is, after all, the automotive equivalent of a codpiece, whether it's being driven by a man or a woman. 
Still, the lesson of the 90's and their free-spending coda is that you don't have to be super-rich to live large. Any American can eat like a king -- well, the really gluttonous monarchs, at least -- by spending a few extra dimes and supersizing her fast-food orders, larding on the extra patties, cheese and fries to make every meal a life-shortening experience.
In any case, the beginning of the 21st century is turning out to be yet another cavalcade of "bling bling." And while this page doesn't quite celebrate the trend, it at least offers some recognition that nothing exceeds like excess.

Far From Corner Offices, Scrimping and Improvising

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
OVER the last year, fallen chief executives and falling stock prices have been in the spotlight. Yet even people who are somewhat removed from the corporate realm have been affected by the collapse of business ethics and the economy. And from the outside looking in, the business world appears a shady realm in need of some good old-fashioned values. 
These corporate outsiders described their own struggles with economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, and offered some prescriptions for cleaning up business, whether through more campaign finance reform -- to reduce the influence of powerful corporate donors -- or by making a general call for executives to move away from their lust for money and power.

A Palette in Search of Green
 Charles Shedden acknowledges that he had it pretty good during the boom. An art student at Cooper Union in the East Village in Manhattan, he had a part-time job at an Internet company that paid him enough to enjoy a modest but comfortable lifestyle. He looked forward to making his living selling his paintings to wealthy patrons. 
 Then the bubble burst. Mr. Shedden, now 22, lost his job in November 2001, when the Internet company, Digital Club Network, laid off much of its staff. "I don't have a job; I have no money," Mr. Shedden, who graduates next spring, said with an air of resignation. "I'm just treading water until I finish."
He has been able to land sporadic work through school, he said, putting together and dismantling art exhibits. Yet that has not been enough to pay the bills, so Mr. Shedden has resorted to becoming a seller on eBay. His 90-year-old grandfather, who is clearing out his house for sale, has allowed Mr. Shedden to auction some of his possessions, from old liquor bottles to eight-track stereo equipment. His best sale to date: a 1914 Singer sewing machine that fetched $196. "If you get rid of enough stuff," he said, "you can at least eat for a week."
Around the same time, Mr. Shedden's roommate lost his job at a jewelry showroom. So the two took in a third roommate for the two-bedroom apartment, with a loft, that they rent in TriBeCa. 
"I was really worried after I lost my job and my roommate lost his job," Mr. Shedden said. Fortunately, he said, he had family members, including his grandfather, who would help. But he has had to adjust his lifestyle. "There's a lot less hanging out and spending money," he said, "and a lot more reading, listening to music, talking to friends and painting."
Mr. Shedden said he still hoped to find patrons to support a painting career after graduation, and he has been preparing a body of work. "The people who buy art still have money," he said, almost wishfully. Still, he was disgusted by the greed that led to the downfall of many wealthy chief executives and their companies. "If you're in a position of power, you can hide anything," he said. "It's not a cool situation."
His work, meanwhile, has started to reflect what he says is a preoccupation with money. He just finished a series of paintings on canvases in the shape of diamonds, rubies and other gems. "It's definitely the money thing," he said. "If it's on your mind . . ." He paused and thought of a better way to explain it: "It's like the Abbott and Costello episode, where they're trapped on a deserted island and Abbott keeps imagining Costello as a hot dog."

Anxious Times at a Charity
Louise Franklin has felt corporate America's pain, not least because the charity where she runs day-to-day operations and raises money, the Center for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito, Calif., has been directly affected by its misfortunes.
"After Sept. 11, there was an outpouring of support from donors and agencies, but then with the impact of the economy coming on the heels of that, it was the opposite."
Donations have been down sharply this year from corporations. "We're not giving this year" is a common refrain, she said, from public foundations that dabbled too deeply in the stock market. 
About half the center's financing is from individuals who usually wait until year-end to give, so Ms. Franklin will not know the center's full financial picture until January. "I'm a little anxious because everyone's feeling the pinch," she said. Ms. Franklin, 50, who lives in Inverness, Calif., with her daughter, Alexandra, said she had also felt the pinch in her retirement account.
"It's a shame how much these big corporations affected so many people and the quality of life," said Ms. Franklin, who owned a successful graphic design company before joining the center full time in 1987. "They should be more responsible." 
The Center for Attitudinal Healing, founded a quarter-century ago to help children cope with life-threatening illnesses, now offers support and counseling to a wide range of age groups faced with death or crisis. The center, with 200 volunteers and 130 affiliates around the world, focuses on helping people have a more positive outlook about their situation. 
That attitude spills over into Ms. Franklin's own perspective. Still, she sees plenty to worry about in the coming year. "I like to think positively, but I'm guarded," she said, because she does not have much confidence in the country's leadership. "I wonder about the situation in the Middle East, about war. It's very difficult to predict what will happen and what the impact will be."
She says campaign finance reform is essential to restoring confidence in business and keeping corporate crime at bay. Unscrupulous corporations, she said, "get off easy because of their donations."

Turning 30 in a Downturn
Growing up in Columbia, S.C., Eric Williams said, his father, a car salesman, always told him to save money, pay his bills on time and avoid debt. These days, Mr. Williams said, "I listen to my father a lot more."
Mr. Williams, 30, is a volunteer coordinator at Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School, matching volunteer tutors, social workers and legal advisers with the school's students, typically young adults who are going back to complete their degrees or immigrants for whom English is a second language. He sees how the economic malaise is affecting the students, who are now more likely to take jobs flipping burgers, work they would have shunned a year ago.
Now it is starting to worry him, too. "Turning 30, combined with the downturn in the economy, has me being a little more conservative," he said. He is still paying back student loans that put him through Harvard, where he graduated in 1994 with a degree in African studies. Although steep cuts in the city's education budget have not yet affected him directly, he said, they are "sobering, to say the least." Both his girlfriend and the roommate who shares his East Harlem apartment work in school systems, too. "We're all in a similar predicament," he said.
"There is a general apprehension," Mr. Williams said. "And having a government that doesn't seem to be focusing on these things is not reassuring." 
Nor was the meltdown of corporate ethics in the last year. Mr. Williams took particular note of the fate of Enron employees whose 401(k) savings evaporated overnight along with the company's stock price. "I'm paying attention to that now," he said. "I don't want to lose what little I have."
The corporate world, however, seems a long way off to Mr. Williams, who has spent his entire career in the nonprofit sector. "I've always been socially conscious and concerned about my fellow man," he said. "It's really satisfying; it keeps me going." He had been contemplating a career change, possibly into the private sector, but is now leery.
He is following his father's advice, "cutting corners here and there." That includes eating out a little less, saving more and making do with what is in his closet rather than buying new clothes. He says he has even begun opening the packets of coupons that arrive in his mailbox every month instead of tossing them out.
Still, he is doing nothing drastic yet. "It's not like I'm going back to eating Ramen noodles three times a day," he said.

Thankful, Nonetheless
Does the economy have you down? In need of an attitude adjustment? You could talk to Joseph H. Gelberman. At 90, he is the rabbi at the New Synagogue for New York City, a practicing psychotherapist, a prolific author, the founder of two interfaith seminaries and a frequent guest lecturer at ashrams and before other groups. But it is his outlook on life, more than his considerable accomplishments, that inspire others to look at the bright side.
"I believe in joy," he said. "Anxieties, frustrations -- yes, all of those things exist. But that's outside of you. You don't permit it to get inside. Worry, hate -- all of these things poison. I want to enjoy life."
Rabbi Gelberman acknowledges that it is a difficult time -- for him, for his congregation, for the world. He has lent money to dozens of people who have come to him for help recently, including one who was evicted from his apartment. More people are coming to him for counseling, he said, looking for direction.
"You lose your job -- of course it's a problem," he said. "But you can't become a prisoner of yourself. Fear is not going to help, kvetching is not going to help."
To accommodate those struggling financially, he has adopted a sliding scale of fees for his counseling sessions as well as his lectures on the cabala, the Jewish mystical tradition. "I tell them in case you can't afford it, put whatever you can afford, even a penny, in the envelope, and write on it 'I am the rabbi's guest.' "
Rabbi Gelberman said he had felt the downturn personally but considered himself blessed. Most of his income comes from lectures and the seminary he heads. Like other homeowners in New York City, he faces a steep increase in property taxes, but he says he is fortunate to have bought his spacious Central Park West apartment 30 years ago for a song when the building became a cooperative. And he and his wife, Jan, plan to spend the winter in Florida.
But then, he has weathered worse blows.
Born in Hungary to a Hasidic rabbi, Rabbi Gelberman lost his first wife and child, as well as his father, mother and 12 of his 19 brothers and sisters, at Auschwitz. "We don't always understand all of this," Rabbi Gelberman said. "These are bad times, no doubt about it. But we are still a rich country. People all around the world are suffering. Even tonight, more food will be thrown out here than some countries have."
People forget, he said, that everything is connected, and that the welfare of others should be of utmost concern. Invoking the biblical tale of Cain and Abel, he said, "Yes, I am my brother's keeper."
He says many Americans, whether regular workers or corporate executives, look for happiness in fleeting, external things like possessions and fame. Corporate chiefs whose greed drove them to cheat shareholders, he said, were looking for superficial happiness, not realizing it can be taken away at any time. True joy, he said, can come only from within. He tells of his father, who became a successful businessman, only to lose everything. "Still, he was joyous," he recalled.
Rabbi Gelberman says he considers the act of waking each day a miracle. He is even grateful for the inevitable aches and pains. "If I weren't alive, I wouldn't feel anything -- isn't that wonderful?" he asked, with a twinkle in his eye.

HEADLINE: Patents; 
After 13 years of ruminating, the UnitedStates agrees to join a global trademark system.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand; Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trade mark Office, Washington, 20231.

 BODY:
AFTER 13 years, the United States is finally joining a one-stop shopping system for managing trademarks that more than 65 other countries have adopted since 1989. But even though the new rules had vigorous support among American trademark holders and applicants, and even though they have been practically inevitable for over a decade, they will not go into effect until November 2003.
 The new procedures are called the Madrid Protocol, after an earlier treaty drawn up in 1896. Under them, trademark applicants need file only one application to win protection in the countries belonging to the pact, instead of having to file separate applications with each nation. 
 This is a sweeping change for American applicants. Under the new system, an applicant can file an international application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. On the form, he would indicate the countries belonging to the Madrid Protocol in which he wanted protection. The form can be submitted in French or English, eliminating the need for applying in multiple languages. The Patent and Trademark Office then forwards the application to the World Intellectual Property Organization, and WIPO sends out an international registration for the mark.
That is not the end of the process, however. WIPO will then send the application to the relevant countries, where trademark examiners will analyze the application. Each country may take 18 months to make a final decision, or longer if the application is opposed. If the trademark is approved, the Madrid Protocol gives it a life span of 10 years plus one renewal, for which an owner must pay a $100 renewal fee.
It is a chain of paperwork, but is still an easier, cheaper and more efficient way for trademark holders to secure worldwide protection than submitting separate applications to each country involved. For small companies and independent inventors the rule should make it feasible to invest in international trademarks by significantly reducing the red tape, local agents, language requirements and fees involved.
In 2000, the government estimated that an American trademark owner who wanted to register his mark in 10 countries faced $14,000 in fees for 10 separate applications. It said the Madrid Protocol would bring that cost down to about $4,700.
But the new rules also mean that trademark applicants will have to search not only United States trademark archives but an international register of archives from all Madrid Protocol countries when checking whether the mark they want already belongs to someone else.
"It is really going to make changes in terms of the way searches are done," predicted Susan Reiss, a trademark lawyer at in New York. Ms. Reiss is also editor in chief of an industry journal, The Trademark Reporter.
"Right now, if you have a trademark in the United States, your main concern is what marks are in use here," she continued. "Now it means United States trademark owners must be very much concerned with what's out there in the world. They need to decide whether to file in the United States and extend their application to the Madrid Protocol."
Some nations have looser trademark requirements than the United States, so American applicants can often obtain broader trademark protection abroad than here. Thus, trademark lawyers will have to consider whether it makes sense for their clients to apply for a one-stop international application under American laws, or to approach more liberal countries directly.
In addition, the protocol retains a five-year period during which any successful challenge to an original trademark application would nullify all international trademarks.
"For the first five years, your international registration is wholly dependent on your home-base application," Ms. Reiss explained. "If I could find a grounds of attack and have it canceled, then all the countries to which you have extended your trademark would fall, too."
Those 60 applications could still "be converted into national registrations" in each country, she added.
Although the protocol had vigorous support from business and industry, and from organizations like the International Trademark Association, which sought greater overseas protection for brand-name goods and services, it was also so tangled in American foreign and economic policy that it languished in Congress through three administrations. For several years, the sticking point was a provision giving the European Union a vote along with its 15 member nations. The United States said that gave Europe a double vote and set a precedent for other treaties. So for more than 10 years the Madrid Protocol led to little more than rumor, debate, lobbying and frustration among supporters.
In February 2000, the voting dispute was officially resolved to American satisfaction when the idea of giving the European Union a separate vote was dropped. Protocol supporters stepped up their lobbying and everyone agreed there was no significant remaining opposition in Congress, but it still took more than two years before the United States formally joined the protocol.
Finally, in October, President Bush signed the Justice Department Reauthorization Act, and buried in it, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. The law gives the Patent and Trademark Office at least a year to put the new rules into effect.
"We will definitely take the whole year," said Lynne Beresford, the deputy commissioner for trademark policy, with a planned starting date of Nov. 2, 2003. The agency must write new regulations and it is planning to set up a new computer system to handle international applications. Although applications for a basic American trademark can still be filed either on paper or electronically, the international ones will have to be filed electronically.
"We've been talking about the Madrid Protocol for 10 years, and it wasn't happening," Ms. Beresford added. "So when do you decide to put the people and time into it? The answer is: not until you have the law."
The changes will give American trademark holders "layers upon layers upon layers of protection," Ms. Reiss said. "Now it's possible to get a community trademark in the 15 countries of the European Union. So a company could have a national registration, a C.T.M. and an international registration.
"The bottom line is, the Madrid Protocol should help small trademark owners," she added, "because individuals and small entities that can't have all these layers will opt for international protection, to the extent that 60 countries is worldwide."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Nine Tales From the Underside, Where the Talk Is Terse

BYLINE:  By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
WHEN THE WOMEN
COME OUT TO DANCE
By Elmore Leonard
228 pages. William Morrow. $24.95.
 Let the last line of dialogue from Elmore Leonard's new short-fiction collection sum up Mr. Leonard's great gift: "He could tell a story." More precisely, he can invent coolheaded characters who leap off the page, equip them with pricelessly terse dialogue and dream up the kinds of plots that might have worked for O. Henry, if O. Henry had had a serious interest in lowlife, double-crossing and crime. 
 The short-story format brings out these strengths to a surprising degree. Mr. Leonard's longer plots can resemble strings of interlocking vignettes, but the compact tales in his new collection carry no such baggage. Most are short and sweet, though this nine-part collection also includes two novellas. One of those, "Tenkiller," and the diabolical title story, "When the Women Come Out to Dance," are the only selections that have not been published before.
"When the Women Come Out to Dance" is a model of interpersonal relations, Leonard style. Mrs. Wasim Mahmood, who looks like Jill St. John (the author often uses real actors' appearances as shorthand), is hiring a maid. The setting is Palm Beach, but the new employee, Lourdes, comes from Cali, Colombia, a place well known for drug-related violence. What's more, Lourdes came to Florida as the mail-order bride of a Mr. Zimmer, who wound up buried in a pile of cement out by Hialeah.
"It's Ginger," Mrs. Mahmood says, introducing herself. "Well, actually it's Janeen, but all of my friends call me Ginger. The ones I have left." It develops that Ginger is a former stripper and that she is not one to mince words. She claims to be afraid of her husband, a Pakistani plastic surgeon. "A guy gets tired of his wife in Pakistan?" Ginger says. "He burns her to death. Or has it done. I'm not kidding, he tells everyone her dupatta caught fire from the stove."
Lourdes observes, "Ah, that's why you don't cook." 
Soon Ginger is dropping hints as to what she wants. "How much does a load of concrete cost these days?" she wonders. She supposes that Lourdes knows how to make husbands disappear, and to some extent she's right. But Ginger, like an O. Henry heroine and most of the book's main characters, gets something slightly different from what she bargained for.
The main character in "Tenkiller" is a stuntman and rodeo rider whose actual name is Ben Webster. He took the Indian name of the title so that he could land a role in "Dances With Wolves," his first movie; since then, he has been shot in "Air Force One," run through with a sword in "The Mask of Zorro," stepped on in "Godzilla," and so on. He has also suffered in the real world, having very bad luck with women. This seems to be a Webster family curse.
Tenkiller's Webster family heritage also includes a pecan farm in Oklahoma. And when he comes home to the place, he finds unexpected no-good tenants on the premises. It turns out that the farm has been sublet to them by a real estate agent named Denise, who was known as "Denise the piece" when Tenkiller had a high school crush on her. Now the two are reunited in such a mad, hasty tryst that they have time for small talk only afterward. That talk is economical, and pure Leonard, too: "You look better than ever."
"I like your hair like that."
"You're not married, are you?"
"Would it matter?"
Sudden passion also figures in this book's other novella, "Fire in the Hole," set in Kentucky coal-mining country. Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder once dug coal together; now Raylan is a lawman, Boyd a neo-Nazi. ("Has his own army now, bunch of serious morons sieg-heilin' each other?" Raylan says.) And things get complicated between them after Boyd's brother, Bowman, is shot by Bowman's wife, Ava. Before killing him, she made him a big ham-and-yam dinner, because she wanted him sitting down.
Why did she do it? "He'd get on me for the least thing," Ava explains to Raylan, once these two develop a shared attraction. "Like if he found a hair in his baked possum? Or I didn't get out all the scent glands?" Mr. Leonard has a classic deadpan way of making such details funny and credible, too.
"Fire in the Hole," like most of the stories here, boils down to a showdown between two highly determined characters, ending in something unexpected. So does "Karen Makes Out," featuring the same hot-blooded United States marshal who was a character in "Out of Sight." Another of Mr. Leonard's novels, "Tishomingo Blues," is evoked by "Chickasaw Charlie Hoke," a short story that contains the seeds of that book. And in "Sparks" Mr. Leonard presents his own abbreviated version of the film "The Last Seduction." A woman said to resemble Linda Fiorentino in that film works a kind of witchcraft on the fire inspector trying to determine why she burned down her house in Malibu.
There are some oddities here: "Hanging Out at the Buena Vista," a tight and very brief sketch of the pragmatic courtship of two elderly people; "Hurrah for Capt. Early," in which a black soldier under Theodore Roosevelt's command at San Juan Hill contends with his white comrades' refusal to acknowledge him; and "The Tonto Woman," about a man named Ruben in Arizona and a white woman ostracized for her contact with Indians. In Mr. Leonard's witty, well-balanced scheme of justice, Ruben befriends the Tonto Woman and feels that it would be only fair to steal her husband's cattle at the end of the story.

HEADLINE: A 'New Economy' Editor at Time to Oversee AOL Integration 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Time Inc. is expected to announce today that Ned Desmond, currently president of the company's Business 2.0 magazine, has been chosen to oversee the integration of Time Inc. content into the AOL service, according to company executives.
 As executive editor of Time Inc. Interactive, a new job, Mr. Desmond will move to the AOL unit's headquarters in Dulles, Va., where he will work closely with the online service's programming executives. 
 His presence there will represent a new level of cooperation between the often fractious divisions of the parent AOL Time Warner and further evidence that under the company's new management structure, Time Inc. expects to have a substantial hand in determining AOL's editorial direction.
Early this month, AOL Time Warner disclosed a plan in which content from Time Inc. magazines that particularly appeal to women, teenagers and children -- including People, Entertainment Weekly, InStyle, Teen People and Time for Kids -- would become available on the Web primarily through AOL.
Company officials, speaking in background interviews pending the announcement, said that Mr. Desmond had been selected as Time Inc.'s chief liaison with AOL because he had extensive relationships with much of the unit's business and editorial leadership along with experience in digital publishing at Infoseek and the Walt Disney Company.
Mr. Desmond will report to John Squires, an executive vice president at Time Inc., and John Huey, the editorial director, and will also have a yet-to-be determined reporting relationship with Ted Leonsis, the vice chairman of AOL. Although he will remain a Time Inc. employee, Mr. Desmond will be working with Jim Bankoff, executive vice president for operations at AOL, and David Gang, AOL's executive vice president for product marketing, on editorial programming for the entire service.
A senior business executive at Time Inc. said, "Ned has a great deal of credibility within Time Inc., but has spent enough time in the online world to have credibility at AOL as well."
As president and former editor of Business 2.0, one of the so-called new economy magazines, Mr. Desmond has had a close look at the exaggeration and subsequent disappointment of the digital revolution. A former bureau chief for Time magazine in New Delhi and Tokyo, he also covered Silicon Valley and the Japanese economy for Fortune magazine. 
Mr. Desmond served as vice president at Infoseek and played a central role in developing the Go.com portal for Disney, blending Disney's various brands onto a highly promoted and costly site that eventually failed. Time Inc. had its own lesson in the perils of online-content creation with Pathfinder, a $100 million attempt at a Web portal site that led to little more than unfavorable headlines.
Since the merger of AOL and Time Warner nearly two years ago, the relationship between Time Inc. and America Online has been a troubled one. Officials of Time Inc. considered the editorial programming at AOL generally an extension of marketing requirements and were not eager to put control of the magazine's content in AOL's hands. 
But the departure of Robert W. Pittman, the former chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, and the appointment of Don Logan, the former Time Inc. chief, as chairman of the company's media and entertainment group, including the AOL service, has created a more cooperative relationship.
Executives at Time Inc. said that the appointment of Mr. Desmond, long a favorite of Mr. Huey and of Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., indicated that Time Inc. was serious about improving the relationship and making content from the magazines a significant part of the proprietary service. They added that his role would include shaping the digital strategies of magazines, like Time and Sports Illustrated, that are not now scheduled to become part of AOL.
"In order to make those kind of changes happen, you have to have someone who can break down the inherent tribalism, title by title and discipline by discipline," an editorial executive at the company said. "It is unrelenting, difficult work, but this is not some midlevel initiative we are involved in. The impetus for all of this comes right from the top of the company."
Although Mr. Desmond has the confidence of the leadership at AOL Time Warner, it has been a rough ride at Business 2.0. Mr. Desmond was the founding editor as well as president of eCompany Now, which became Business 2.0 after Time Inc. acquired the magazine for $68 million in June 2001. As the digital economy began to fall apart, Business 2.0 suffered. In April Mr. Desmond was replaced as editor by Josh Quittner, a former technology editor of Time magazine.
In his new job, Mr. Desmond will be refereeing between the sometimes disparate interests of AOL and Time Inc. The magazine unit's editors are concerned with protecting journalistic brands that have been decades in the making, while AOL wants a splashy welcome screen with news from many different brands. Mark Golin, an AOL executive who has been on loan to Time Inc., will work closely with Mr. Desmond in developing approaches to content that aim to make AOL more than a service largely used for e-mail and chat. 
Ann S. Moore, chief executive of Time Inc., has made it clear she thinks that a true partnership with AOL -- what she calls "sharing, not synergy" -- is critical to both divisions. She has suggested in conversations with editorial and business executives that Time Inc.'s resources could be used to build up digital franchises like a beefed-up homework site on America Online or a college ranking system that would have user feedback and might rival that of U.S. News & World Report.

HEADLINE: Law Schools Urge Graduates to Start Small and Think Local 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lutece, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab.
 A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple "in the service of justice," as many of the schools put it, instead. 
 Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. 
This is not pro bono legal work; it is "low bono," a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away -- or at least as few as possible. 
"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel," said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. "But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar." 
The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.
Mixing foundation money with their own to go beyond the standard curriculum, the schools are teaching the nuts and bolts of running a business, setting up client referral networks for fledgling practitioners and holding seminars to tackle the mundane challenges of going it alone that are often considered superfluous to the study of law.
As further encouragement for the 200 or so followers they have picked up already, the consortium schools have given their graduates Palm organizers, paid for companies to help with their billing, and offered free legal research and even yoga and meditation classes, almost anything to help make life a little easier for those trying to hang out their shingles. 
"We're talking about training real community lawyers," said Stuart L. Deutsch, dean of the Rutgers School of Law in Newark. "The perception is that the solo practitioners are the ones who got C's, the second string who didn't excel enough to get to the big firms. We're trying to say that solo practice can be among the highest forms of public service, and is the only channel possible to serving low-income people."
True or not, there is little debate that most low-income clients, and many in the middle class, find lawyers well outside their financial reach. Even at the smallest of firms, the median hourly rate starts at roughly $130 an hour and passes $180, according to a 2002 survey by Altman Weil, a legal consulting company. For firms with more than 150 lawyers in tow, the range is from $200 to more than $320 an hour, the survey found, not counting the dinners, taxi rides and other extras that are often tacked onto the bill.
At those rates, perhaps it should come as no surprise that 71 percent of low-income people and 61 percent of moderate-income people with civil troubles end up without representation, according to the American Bar Association. For the truly poor, meaning they earn no more than $11,075 a year, there are government-financed legal aid agencies to turn to, 172 in all, but these offices are so overwhelmed that only one in five people who qualify for help actually gets any. 
By contrast, big law firms are slowly stepping up their commitment to free services, after 10 years of pulling back. Yet their lawyers still spend less than 42 hours a year doing pro bono work, far short of the profession's guidelines to perform at least 50 volunteer hours each year. Even during more charitable times, the bar association says, most of the free or less costly work is handled by small firms and solo practitioners, making them a natural target for the consortium's sights.
"A lot of students still go to law school because of their ideals, and they're willing to bite the bullet, drive old cars, not buy a home and keep living a student's life for a few more years until they get settled," said Lovely Dhillon, the former San Francisco assistant district attorney who heads the consortium. "It's incumbent on us to help them." 
The consortium certainly has a lot to overcome, most notably the pull of big law firms. Twenty years ago, three times as many law school graduates went into solo or tiny practices as went to firms with more than 100 lawyers, according to the National Association for Law Placement. By last year, the two poles had flip-flopped, with the biggest firms attracting 30 percent more graduates than the smallest, and given the difference in pay it is not hard to see why. 
Joining a firm with fewer than 10 lawyers means starting at $43,000 a year, the association says. The bigger a practice gets, though, the higher its starting salaries climb, topping out around $125,000 a year at the largest firms. Considering that law school tuitions have roughly doubled in the last decade, pushing the median student debt past $84,000, it is understandable why some question how far the consortium can spread. 
"It's a great idea, but the pressure of academic debt really leads people to big firms in big cities," said Theresa J. Bryant, executive director of the career development office at Yale Law School, which is not part of the consortium. "When you're standing $90,000 in debt, going small may present a bit of a challenge."
Fair enough, the consortium says. Not all graduates will be able to scrounge for the years it may take to build a clientele, nor should they. But since as many as 30 percent to 40 percent of the graduates at schools like CUNY go into small or solo practices within a few years of graduating, the deans argue, it seems folly not to teach them how to stay afloat financially and take on low-income clients at the same time. 
How do you advertise? How do you bill clients and, perhaps even trickier, get them to pay? How can you remain affordable and still pay your rent? What kind of office software will you need? How about malpractice insurance? Such are the sobering questions, rarely highbrow enough to find their way into legal pedagogy, that the consortium seeks to help their graduates tackle. 
"Important as they are, these issues are low on the academic pecking order, and not what get most faculty recognized," said Deborah L. Rhode, former president of the Association of American Law Schools and a professor of law at Stanford University, also outside the consortium. "The truth is, legal education is partially responsible for the disconnect between what ordinary Americans need and what educated lawyers can supply."
Even for the most intrepid and socially conscious of graduates, starting a practice requires a giant leap of faith, and more than a little guesswork. Charging sliding-scale fees means coming up with a new wage for almost every case one takes, and seldom can practitioners rely on anything more solid than their own judgment. 
"How much will we charge?" Tristan Da Cunha, one of the new graduates starting Cates, Katalinic & Lund asked with a shrug, furrowing his brow as if the question had never come up. "I think it's fair to say we'll be heavily discounted."

PERSON: Eli Ginzberg 

HEADLINE: Eli Ginzberg, 91, Economist at Columbia And Adviser to Eight Presidents, Is Dead 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
Eli Ginzberg, an economist who taught at Columbia University for more than six decades, advised eight American presidents and led pioneering research efforts in employment and health care, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
 Dr. Ginzberg first showed his bent for applied economics during World War II, when he moved from his home in New York to Washington and served the federal government in a variety of positions. He built on that experience for decades, supervising studies designed to reduce the waste of manpower, publishing many books and articles and later advising governments and corporations. 
 "What Eli had was an enormous command of the facts and a remarkably down-to-earth practical sense of what was possible, politically and economically," said Robert M. Solow, who received a Nobel in economics in 1987. "He was sort of the guardian of common sense in the areas of manpower problems and health care."
As a consultant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on military personnel during the war, Dr. Ginzberg wrote a study that helped lead to the removal of 250,000 civilians from the Army payroll and the more efficient deployment of soldiers.
He also worked in the government's hospital division and the surgeon general's office in the War Department, where he coordinated the extensive medical preparations for the D-Day invasion of France in 1944. He was awarded the medal for Exceptional Civilian Service from the War Department in 1946.
After the war, he returned to teaching, and he served as director of staff studies at the National Manpower Council from 1952 until 1961. He wrote about the importance of integrating women and racial minorities into the work force, and in the early 1950's he played a role in the desegregation of the United States Army as an aide to Secretary of the Army Frank Pace Jr.
He also applied his knowledge of economics to the health care system, writing books and dozens of articles for publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Eli Ginzberg was born on April 30, 1911, to Louis and Adele Ginzberg in New York City, where he grew up just a few blocks from Columbia University. His father, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary, was one of the foremost Talmudic scholars of the 20th century. Their home was a gathering place for renowned scholars, and that atmosphere helped inspire his own ambitions, Dr. Ginzberg later wrote. 
He attended DeWitt Clinton High School and Columbia University, where he stayed on to earn his doctorate in economics in 1934 and joined the faculty in 1935.
In that year, with the country in the grip of the Depression, he completed a yearlong tour of 40 American states. His observations formed the basis for a set of recommendations on reforming the regulatory and monetary systems, published in 1939 as "The Illusion of Economic Stability." 
After the war, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to represent the United States at a conference in May 1946 on victims of German actions who could not be repatriated. He also continued to provide advice to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who became president of Columbia in 1948.
In 1950, Dr. Ginzberg was appointed to the staff of the Conservation of Human Resources Project at Columbia's Graduate School of Business, a research effort founded by General Eisenhower that involved the federal government, business groups, foundations and trade unions. Dr. Ginzberg was a co-author of its first major study, "The Uneducated," which argued for a greater federal role in education.
In the early 1950's, Dr. Ginzberg was sent to Europe by the Pentagon to help break the resistance of the Army senior staff to desegregation. His first experience with Army segregation had come during the war, when he discovered a group of black and white wounded soldiers being treated in separate hospital wards in South Carolina. He ordered that the wards be integrated, leading to a complaint from the state's governor. He and his colleagues at the Conservation of Human Resources Project later wrote about the problems of the segregated Army in a three-volume study, "The Ineffective Soldier: Lessons for Management and the Nation."
Dr. Ginzberg continued to advise state and federal governments on health issues and advised presidents through Jimmy Carter. He also contributed many books on subjects like the supply of doctors and managed care, which he viewed skeptically.
Dr. Ginzberg was married in 1946 to Ruth Szold, who was an editor at the Conservation of Human Resources Project.
In 1974, he helped found the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit group dedicated to testing rigorously public policy ideas on subjects like welfare and the reintegration of former prison inmates.
Like his parents, Dr. Ginzberg was active in Jewish causes, volunteering for the United Jewish Committee and serving as a member of the board of governors of Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the 1950's. The first of his two memoirs, "My Brother's Keeper," published in 1989, deals mostly with his family and his Jewish heritage. The second, "The Eye of Illusion," published in 1993, is mostly about his professional career.
Dr. Ginzberg's wife died in 1995. He is survived by his three children, Jeremy, of Portland, Ore.; Abigail, of Albany, Calif.; and Rachel, of Philadelphia, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Chance to Learn 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GASTON, N.C. 

 BODY:
The first thing you notice about the school is how quiet it is. The kids are absorbed in their studies and except for the low roar of conversation in the cafeteria during lunch, or the enthusiastic screeching of band practice, you hardly hear a sound.
 The Gaston College Preparatory School in this rural town just across the border from Virginia is housed in a new low-rise building on land that until recently was a peanut and soybean farm. Farm equipment outlets and a cotton field or two line the roads leading to the school. 
 There are only two grades, fifth and sixth. A seventh and eighth grade will be added over the next two years.
I wanted to visit Gaston College Prep because I'd heard it was a remarkable school. It's in a region that is struggling economically and is not known for its academic excellence. Most of the students at the school are black and nearly all of them are poor. Most of the other schools available to them are burdened with problems that show no signs of easing.
At Gaston Prep, which the kids call G.C.P., the atmosphere is almost idyllic. The children are well behaved and the classroom work is intense. "We don't have any fighting here, or any of that picking-on-people stuff," said Shanequa High, a sixth-grader whose reading ability improved dramatically in just one year, and who was the lead dancer in the school's production of "The Lion King" last year.
Another student, 12-year-old Paris Gatling, said, "We're here to work, and we work hard."
Gaston Prep is one of 15 KIPP schools in the United States. KIPP is short for the Knowledge Is Power Program, an effort that began in Houston and has grown into one of the most energetic and academically sound public school programs in the nation.
The key to the success of the schools seems to be the requirement that there be a strong commitment in the very beginning by pupils, parents and a team of extremely dedicated teachers to put forth whatever effort is necessary to enable the children to learn.
KIPP schools are not for the faint of heart. The school day lasts from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., which allows time for additional classroom work and extracurricular activities. After that there are two hours of homework. The kids also attend classes every other Saturday. And there are three weeks of summer school.
The payoff? KIPP students routinely do better than most of their public school peers. In each of its first seven years the KIPP Academy in Houston has been named a Texas Exemplary School. The students there consistently score among the highest in the annual statewide exams.
For five straight years, the KIPP Academy in the Bronx has outperformed all other public middle schools in the borough in math and reading. The student orchestra, considered one of the finest in the nation, recently performed at Carnegie Hall.
Applicants to KIPP schools are chosen by lottery. The program does not seek out the so-called top students. Several of the kids at Gaston Prep are special education students. But in its short tenure, the school has thrived. In the year before they attended Gaston, only 53 percent of the first class of fifth-graders had passed the North Carolina statewide reading test. After one year at Gaston, 93 percent passed, including 82 percent of the special education students. Gaston Prep is already the highest performing public school in all of the four counties from which its students are drawn.
I don't know how easy it would be to repeat KIPP's early success on a massive scale. With so much work involved, I wonder how much of a commitment could be secured from parents in general, or from teachers in general, or students in general. Young Paris Gatling was not kidding when he said, "We work hard."
The hard work was exactly what Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin, two Teach for America alumni, had in mind when they created KIPP in 1995. "We are never going to end the day shrugging our shoulders and making excuses," said Mr. Feinberg. "If there's a problem, if something is impeding the success of our kids, that needs to be solved one way or another."
Long hours. Hard work. Discipline. Like I said, I don't know how easily that gets replicated. But schools that thrive in the inner city and in poor rural areas deserve, at the very least, some very close attention.

HEADLINE: Market Booms While Zimbabwe Prepares for the Bust 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The ministers tending Zimbabwe's ailing economy have proposed a quick-fix remedy of price controls, wage freezes and the creation of collective farms, even though price controls are exacerbating food shortages, and a chaotic land redistribution program has devastated commercial agriculture.
 Meanwhile, hundreds of companies have gone broke, unemployment is soaring, and the country is teetering at the edge of famine. 
 So, with the economy in shambles, why is business booming at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange?
In recent months, the market has reached record heights. This year, while the economy was contracting by about 12 percent, the stock exchange's market capitalization was doubling, surging to its highest level since it was established in 1896. 
What's more, sales of middle-income and luxury homes in the country's wealthy suburbs are surging. People with cash are snapping up televisions, luxury cars and stereos.
The paradox stems from distortions in the controlled economy.
With inflation at more than 144 percent and currency values plummeting, Zimbabweans are putting their money into assets they believe will increase in value -- stocks, real estate, foreign currency, even refrigerators -- rather than bank accounts.
The government has kept interest rates low, so borrowing has been relatively cheap. And these days, many Zimbabweans are buying whatever they can, betting that they can sell the items later at a higher price, often on the black market.
"It's unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable," said Emmanuel Munyukwi, the chief executive of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. "People think there's no economy in Zimbabwe. It's actually embarrassing when you have to tell them that we're doing very, very well."
The contradictions abound. While supermarkets routinely run out of bread, milk and sugar, the city's most expensive restaurants are packed, offering imported seafood and wines. Mercedes-Benzes cruise on potholed roads with broken street lights. Houses on prosperous tree-lined streets are selling quickly, and real estate brokers are scrambling to keep up with the demand.
"People are not necessarily buying houses to live in," said Patson Mtare, a broker whose company has sold about 200 houses this year, compared with 100 houses in a normal year. "People are buying to sell."
People with access to foreign currency are buying even more.
The government insists that $1 is equivalent to 57 Zimbabwe dollars, even though $1 goes for as much as 1,600 Zimbabwe dollars on the black market these days. So even some government officials ignore the official exchange rate and change money on the street to make huge profits.
Callisto Jonkonya, who manufactures and exports refrigerators, has bought a new house and several apartments. Raymond Chamba, who runs an employment agency in the United States, bought one 52-inch television, three 43-inch flat-screen televisions and a DVD player all in one day.
He carried his cash in a suitcase.
"Serious money you don't keep in the bank in Zimbabwe," said Mr. Chamba, who has spent the last six months with family in Zimbabwe. "My televisions, they're my bank here."
Most Zimbabweans, however, are too poor to hoard televisions or cars. Over the last three years, the economy has contracted by more than 20 percent. More than 500 companies have closed. Unemployment stands at 60 percent. Most struggling citizens wait for hours in long lines to buy scarce gasoline or bread.
The combination of drought and land reform has left about 6 million people -- roughly half the population -- in need of emergency food aid. Foreign donors have contributed food but refuse to offer financial assistance to the government, which has condoned violence and land seizures.
President Robert Mugabe insists that his controlled economic policy will fix the problem. He has called on the police to crack down on hoarding and black market sales.
But Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa disagreed with this strategy last month when he told Parliament that price controls were leading to "shortages of critical basic necessities on the formal market" because they failed to address the rising costs of production.
Mr. Murerwa said black-market dealers were the chief beneficiaries of price controls, while the poor were suffering. The government has acknowledged that corrupt officials are hoarding and then selling price-controlled goods on the black market.
There are few indications, however, that Mr. Mugabe plans to change course.
So Mr. Munyukwi has decided to delay the celebration for his stock exchange's success.
"It's very difficult to celebrate when your country is hungry," he said. "The stock market is supposed to reflect what's happening in the economy. But we know our economy is in shambles."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
A Family of 5 Struggles To Deal With Traumas Of Sept. 11, With Help

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO

 BODY:
The night of Sept. 10, 2001, Pedro Pichardo worked overtime cleaning the stairwells in the north tower of the World Trade Center to prepare for an inspection. The next morning, he was exhausted; he did not feel like going to his job at American Building Maintenance, where he had worked for 13 years. 
 "Go by yourself," he told his wife, Manuela, 35, who had started working there three weeks before. 
 "She said, 'If you're not going, I'm not going,' " Mr. Pichardo, 36, recalled. 
In the end, though, they went to work together. 
And together, they survived the collapse of those towers.
And together, they are now struggling to keep their family from crumbling, too.
When the couple arrived at the trade center at 7:30 that morning, their focus was on their jobs, on the daily routine. Mrs. Pichardo punched in and went to work. Mr. Pichardo did, too, and was assigned to pick up trash on the 58th floor of the south tower. 
But as he boarded an elevator, "something shook it, " he said.
"When I went out I saw a lot of people looking out the window of a conference room," he said. "The only thing that came to my mind was to find Manuela."
Mrs. Pichardo was on the 81st floor of the south tower. As the first plane struck, she was looking through a window at the city and the north tower in quiet introspection, waiting for her assignment.
"You know, you always like to take a look at the city," she said in her native Spanish. "I just saw something going so fast, and suddenly, smoke."
She took the elevator to the 78th floor, where a security guard told her to go back. But she was too shaken. She continued her escape by the stairs. At every floor, three or four people joined her. They were jumping from the tops of the stairwell to the bottom. She was thrown to the floor, hurt her ankle and dislocated her toes.
"The first thing I thought was that I was going to die there and leave my kids," she said.
But she managed to stand and the force of the growing crowd carried her down. 
Meanwhile, with the service elevators full, Mr. Pichardo took the stairs. Somewhere between the 37th and 30th floors, he felt the building shake again. 
For 15 excruciating minutes, he waited at the PATH train for his wife. He waited while the throngs of people diminished. Soon, the grim news began to spread: the buildings were falling down. Losing hope, Mr. Pichardo fled. The force of the collapse threw him to the ground; he was unaware that as his wife was rushing out, the building was falling behind her. 
Independently the Pichardos made their way back to Brooklyn, Mrs. Pichardo to her brother's home, Mr. Pichardo to pick up their children from a baby sitter. They didn't talk on the phone, didn't know if the other was living or dead, until 9 that night.
These are the couple's memories of 9/11. They can't be forgotten. But together, they are trying to put them a safe distance in the past.
Their worker's compensation and disability started in February of this year. Mr. Pichardo now receives $400 a week and his wife receives $270.28 a week. Before that, Mr. Pichardo also received small sums of aid from various groups -- $250 from the Salvation Army, $700 from the Red Cross. They were also eligible for a one-time allotment of $2,500 from Safe Horizons, a nonprofit victim assistance agency.
But both lost their jobs and both are disabled from injuries received in the stairwells. Mr. Pichardo has neck injuries from rolling down the stairs when people panicked. He has a bone chip in his left knee and needs a cane to walk. Mrs. Pichardo's ankle injury makes it painful for her to walk. 
The Pichardos bought their house in Ozone Park, Queens, in May 2000, and a new car soon after. They have three children to provide for: Kristine, 14; Peter, 11; and Algenis, 2. 
Still, it is the emotional trauma that weighs most heavily. She has fainted on the subway. He has had panic attacks between stops. They are afraid to leave their home.
But when the Red Cross directed them to a list of charities, they found the support they needed to overcome the traumas of the last several months. Mr. Pichardo applied for help from the Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven local charities that participate in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
"At that time we had the 9/11 Neediest Fund," said Rosa Orihuela, the Pichardos' caseworker, referring to the The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund of last year.
With money from the 9/11 fund and the Neediest Cases Fund, Catholic Charities has made three mortgage payments for the Pichardos, $1,864.02 each. It also gave them $956.94 to pay overdue gas and electricity bills. It helped with Kmart gift certificates for toys and clothing for the children, and has assisted the family with $100 in food vouchers and food from the agency's pantry. It has also made two payments totaling $772.72 on the Pichardos' car.
"FEMA is taking on the mortgage payments," said Mrs. Orihuela, who helped with the arrangements. If Mr. Pichardo can recover from surgery before the payments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency end, the Pichardos have a chance of getting their lives back and moving on -- together.
"They helped us a lot more than anybody else," Mr. Pichardo said. "Sometimes I feel bad because it's not easy for me and some other people have a hard time."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The South; 
As Post-Boom Dust Settles, The South Grimly Downsizes

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
If the nation boomed in the 1990's, Atlanta exploded.
 Tourism, transportation and technology made its economy a triple threat. Hotels sprang up like jack-in-the-boxes as the city became a leading venue for conventions and trade shows. Business travelers jammed Hartsfield International Airport, pushing it past Chicago's O'Hare Airport as the world's busiest. And with precious little fanfare, Atlanta gained possibly more high-tech jobs than any other city in the nation. 
 But what fueled Atlanta's eye-popping growth in the 1990's has proved the city's economic undoing in the last year and a half. Cuts in business travel before the Sept. 11 attacks emptied Atlanta's hotels. The aftershocks forced Delta Airlines, the city's largest employer, to cut 18,000 jobs nationwide and other airlines to scale back operations here. 
Telecom and Internet companies suffered the same fate as high-tech companies everywhere, causing wrenching readjustments.
Van Black, a 17-year employee of Nortel Networks, moved here from St. Louis with his wife and two children in April 2000 to become a manager in optical networking, then Nortel's hottest division. He lured hundreds of other workers to Atlanta, but by early 2001 most of them had been laid off, and that July so was he. 
"I wish I hadn't moved to this hot thing," Mr. Black says now. "It was literally feast to famine in a couple of months."
Across the South, the economic landscape has turned upside down. Atlanta, where all arrows once pointed up, is hurting most: 61,800 jobs were lost in the 12 months that ended in October -- more than in any other city in the country, according to the federal Department of Labor. And the job losses are continuing. 
Even North Carolina's powerhouse area, Raleigh-Durham, which is normally all but immune to hard times thanks to a largely tenured work force of university and state government employees, has seen its unemployment rate double this year. In Hickory, N.C., and the surrounding area, entire fiber-optic cable factories have been mothballed in recent weeks, and 3,200 jobs have been cut since spring 2001.
In Louisiana, where the oil-and-gas industry typically buoys the state during national recessions, anxieties about a conflict with Iraq appear to have held up new investment -- and job growth.
But in Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas -- where foreign-owned factories are turning out luxury cars and food processors are churning out products less vulnerable to cyclical pressures -- it is a different story. The economic pain has been less acute. 
The simplest explanation for the regional trends, economists say, is that the most diversified economies, like Georgia's, are suffering along with the nation through the lingering slowdown that has kept prosperity well around the corner.
Elsewhere in the Southeast, manufacturing generally makes up close to 20 percent of employment. But while that sector has been hit hard by the downturn, economists say, it is also likely to pick up quickly once the outlook for business investment brightens.
"This is a recession that's really picked its spots," said John Robertson, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. "Diversity's a good thing in the aggregate, but it's not so good if you're in the wrong tail of that diversity distribution. On the other hand, Alabama and Mississippi aren't exactly going like gangbusters, but they never really have."
The hard times are playing havoc with state and local budgets across the country, and the South is no exception. Revenue shortfalls in nearly every Southern state have forced legislatures to cut spending, slow or table construction projects and trim payrolls, though as yet without mass layoffs.
In Tennessee, the only state in the region with no income tax, lawmakers in July approved a penny sales-tax increase to generate $933 million. Not surprisingly, officials everywhere in the region but Tennessee reported concerns or pessimism about declining tax revenue in a survey last month by the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Brisk auto sales, fueled by low interest rates and zero-percent-financing deals, have held the drop in sales tax receipts to an average of 2.7 percent in 13 Southern states, according to a Georgia State University study. But plummeting corporate profits -- one of the hallmarks of the national slowdown -- resulted in an average shortfall of 14 percent in corporate income tax collections, the study found.
In Georgia alone, for example, state officials said on Dec. 9 that total tax collections were down 5.2 percent for the first five months of the fiscal year, but that corporate income taxes had plunged 38 percent. Altogether the state is running more than $275 million behind tax-revenue estimates.

A Changing View of Growth
For Atlanta, the severity of the downturn may even be affecting the city's self-image.
For decades, though the carcasses of speculative real estate projects periodically piled up along Peachtree Street, this sprawling metropolis seemed to bull its way through bear-market cycles. 
The 1996 Summer Olympics helped immeasurably. Infrastructure and commercial construction projects begun before the Games eased the early-1990's recession and probably sustained the boom for a few more years, said Jeffrey M. Humphries, director of the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth. "Unfortunately, we didn't have another Olympics in 2002," Mr. Humphries said.
Atlanta now faces traffic density that the roads and highways cannot handle, threats to air quality, looming water shortages, and -- unfathomable a few years back -- a groundswell of opposition to the city's grow-at-any-cost religion. Mr. Humphries said, "It's being brought about by the stresses of the economic boom we've just gone through, but it's affecting our reputation as a good place to do business."
He added, "Atlanta is just not as hungry for growth as it was even recently."
In some parts of the South, tourism has been slowly picking up again, particularly along the South Carolina coast, where resorts and hotels in places like Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head may have benefited from any lingering post-Sept. 11 concerns about air travel or about avoiding big cities that could be terrorist targets.
"I don't think golfers were afraid that terrorists were going to come hit the golf course," said Mark P. Vitner, senior economist at the Wachovia Corporation.
But in Atlanta, where the travel is overwhelmingly business-related and visitors more often than not walk the streets wearing name tags, the slump in corporate profits has been devastating because it has prompted companies to reduce travel expenses.
One in nine of the metropolitan area's jobs are in tourism, transportation and hotels, Mr. Vitner said, and occupancy rates for the city's major convention hotels have fallen to below 60 percent from the high 80's. "These are the lowest vacancy rates since we've been tracking, going back to the early 1960's," he said.
The terrorist attacks put the finishing touches on Atlanta's tourism crash, which has affected everyone, including hotel clerks and taxi drivers, who now wait in lines for hours at the airport and hotels for a single fare.
Northwest Airlines recently said it would close its Atlanta hangar, which employs 1,600 mechanics and other workers.
But the impact on Atlanta has been far greater from the red ink at Delta Airlines, which has lost more than $2 billion in the last seven quarters. Before Delta responded by cutting 18,000 jobs nationally, it was Atlanta's largest employer, with 30,000 workers at its Atlanta headquarters and flight hub. The Atlanta workers made up 44 percent of Delta's payroll.
Fayette County, south of Atlanta, may be absorbing the worst of Delta's woes. As many as 1 in 10 Delta workers live there, many of them in the planned, patrolled, sparkling subdivisions of Peachtree City. One is Grady Boyce, 34, a pilot who moved here with his wife and son in 1998 to better his chances in the airline industry.
It worked, at least for a while. Delta hired him in 2000. But in November 2001, Delta began furloughing pilots, and Mr. Boyce was let go in May. He was the 722nd pilot let go.
Mr. Boyce now has three other mouths to feed -- a wife, a 4-year-old son and a 20-month-old daughter born with birth defects requiring operations and daily therapy -- and he wrestles over whether he ever should have moved to Atlanta. "Depends on the day you ask me," he said.
Mr. Boyce has been looking for a job to tide him over until Delta revives and he can return to flying. But few employers have been receptive. "You start submitting your resume to people and they say, 'What do you do besides fly?' " he said, "and I try to talk about my business and management training, but employers focus on the flying thing. They say, 'You're just a pilot, what could you possibly do for me?' "

Moving In, Losing Jobs
Atlanta was originally a railroad town, and it remains one of the country's five largest distribution centers, with 420 million square feet of industrial space in warehouses lining the three interstates that converge in the city.
But 18.1 million square feet are vacant now, a result of the largest drop in business inventories in history, said Charles B. King Jr., chairman of a leading industrial realty brokerage concern here. "That's more vacant space in Atlanta than the entire market in Jacksonville, Fla.," he said.
"We've had six straight quarters of negative absorption," Mr. King said. "We've never experienced that before. It's much worse than it's ever been. It hurts the truckers, the forklift drivers, the warehouse folks -- that whole distribution arm."
In the same way, Atlanta's real estate market for office space -- which grew to meet the demands of the metropolitan area's many Fortune 500 corporations, fewer only than New York and Chicago -- is now burdened with surplus space available for sublease at below-market rents. 
"It used to be the only time they got into trouble was when they overbuilt real estate," Mr. Vitner said. "Not in this case. This time it was overleased space -- companies that thought they were going to grow like crazy, then they dumped it on the market."
Still, the most poignant illustrations of the downturn are the roughly 20,000 highly skilled but suddenly unemployed workers who were laid off from telecom and technology companies with headquarters or major operations in Atlanta. The companies include Cingular Wireless, WorldCom and Internet Security Systems, and even national consulting concerns like Accenture.
About 150,000 people a year moved to Atlanta in the 1990's. One was Karl W. Gross, 28, who brought his M.B.A. here from Virginia in 1999 and went to work on computer systems for such Accenture clients as Bell South and United Parcel Service. He quickly found himself interacting with top-level executives and earning enough money to buy a condo and a BMW.
But even as Accenture was about to go public, Mr. Gross recalled, he and other junior employees read the news of falling stock prices with growing unease. 
"It was just a matter of time before some of these companies said, 'We'd love to keep you guys but we have to cut back,' " he said. "There were signs. I remember at Bell South one day, they said you can't use the color copier."
Mr. Gross lost his job in August in Accenture's second round of layoffs, and figured he would land a new position quickly. He is still looking -- doggedly, using 15 headhunters and checking a half-dozen Web sites daily.
"It's been a smack in the face that, hey, this is the way things are," Mr. Gross said. "I know how this works; companies do not want to hire you around the holidays for a lot of reasons. So I've got my fingers crossed that in January some jobs will start to open up."
One job application led to a surreal outing, he said, when a recruiter sent him to check out a prospective job. He shadowed a commission-only saleswoman for a company hired by Bell South -- Mr. Gross's former client -- as she knocked on doors in Gainesville, Ga., hoping to persuade people to switch their telephone service.
"There would be churches that were, like, locked and she'd try to kind of break in, thinking there might be somebody inside who could want service," he said, chuckling. "You see what bad times do to people."
Now, Mr. Gross drives his BMW to the state unemployment office, and he looks differently at Atlanta's street people. "Now I see them and I think, wow, I'm about four, five, six months away from potentially being in that position," he said.

Riding on Auto Sales
Georgia's economy lives or dies with Atlanta's. The capital city and surrounding counties account for 55 percent of the state's jobs. Elsewhere in the South, no other city or region is as important to a state's economy, as the nation's financial woes have hit some places with fury and barely affected others. 
Perhaps the best example of this is in the automobile industry, which has brought assembly lines and thousands of jobs to once-poor parts of Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi. Georgia, Arkansas and Louisiana are seeking to join that group, but no Southern state has missed the auto industry's expansion entirely. 
One recent study of the BMW plant that South Carolina won in 1992 after offering $150 million in incentives revealed that neighboring North Carolina had actually received more of the resulting benefits, in jobs and contracts for auto suppliers.
With interest rates low, homeowners across the country have been refinancing mortgages and using the proceeds to buy new cars and other durable goods, experts say. That has helped those auto plants.
More than any state, Alabama has been buoyed by the auto industry in recent years, with Honda and Mercedes factories already open and Hyundai and Toyota plants in the works. 
Gary Shoesmith, director of Wake Forest University's Center for Economic Studies, said Alabama was doubly fortunate in that the makes and models of the cars rolling off the assembly lines in the state have been fairly immune from the downturn. "The people that lose their jobs aren't buying Mercedes," Mr. Shoesmith said.
But auto plants are hardly a panacea. Tennessee, which makes Saturn and Nissan cars and Peterbilt trucks, has increasingly mirrored the auto industry's cyclical fortunes, said Matthew N. Murray, an economic forecaster at the University of Tennessee. 
"We really welcomed the auto industry when it moved down here, suppliers and all, but we're paying a bit of a price," Mr. Murray said. "Despite what's going on in auto sales, both the state and the nation are losing jobs in transportation equipment, because of cost-cutting and efficiency, and cutthroat competition on the supply chain."
Indeed, the transportation employment picture in Tennessee improved this year, but it was hardly cause for celebration. The year-to-year decline in transportation jobs went to 1.8 percent from 7.5 percent.
"We're still in the red," Mr. Murray said. "I'm not sure I'm feeling any better about it -- I'm starving to death, I'm losing weight -- I'm just not losing as much weight as I was last week?"
Like other economists, Mr. Murray questioned whether the nation's torrid auto sales could continue much longer, or whether most new car buyers had already made their purchases, lured by low interest rates and financing incentives. 
"The concern I have is the dramatic sale of new cars in the last year, and what that means for auto sales the next couple of years," he said. "What does the future hold when every garage has got a new car in it?"

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 16 about the economy in the Southeast included an erroneous reference to a study of the economic impact of a BMW auto plant in South Carolina. The study, by the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina in 2002, showed that BMW's investment supported 16,691 jobs and produced $691 million in annual wages and salaries in South Carolina. The study did not examine the benefits to North Carolina and did not show that North Carolina received more jobs and contracts for auto suppliers than South Carolina received.

Living Under the Virtual Volcano of Video Games This Holiday Season

BYLINE:  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
Playboy Magazine has yet to do a pictorial called "Women of the Xbox," starring characters that appear in video games running on Microsoft's popular game console. But in its newest issue, Play Magazine features a double-page screen shot taken from a new video game called "DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball." The photo spread shows a bikini-clad young woman whose face, in its Stepford-like innocence, seems contradicted somehow by the remarkable authority of her body. Technophiles and sophisticated gamers have been marveling at the software engineering that has gone into making such a sublime creation. Then their eyes snap back into focus and they simply marvel. She was once a deadly fighter in a previous version of the game. Now she and her colleagues play volleyball -- realistic volleyball -- for the masses. The player gets to choose the swimwear. 
 It's no wonder that this season marks another pinnacle in video game revenues, on the order of $10 billion in 2002. The degree of realism and fantasy -- and demented irony -- in video games has never been higher. But ever since the days, 20-some years ago, when the Atari 2600 took over living rooms across the country, Americans have been crazy for video games. Just how crazy is captured by a few numbers. Some 145 million Americans now play video games regularly, in arcades, on personal computers or on so-called next generation consoles like Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube or Microsoft's Xbox. According to industry analysts, the average age of a modern gamer is 28, and slightly more than half of them are men. These numbers are only likely to grow larger as the world of video games moves online. 
 But what matters even more than the size of the video game world is its depth and complexity. It's a world where time has been captured, where nearly every console or game cartridge lives on in one form or another, as a venerable relic being sold on eBay or as an emulation for modern computers. If you plunge into the gaming world you discover a riot of hardware platforms and software influences, a jabber of languages deriving from a hundred mythical worlds, as well as from the lexicon of game programming and game marketing itself. 
The imaginative and economic power of the leading game designers has had a profound effect on Hollywood, and for good reason. The depth of illusion in the newest games is truly cinematic. Each of this season's blockbuster movie franchises -- Harry Potter, James Bond, J. R. R. Tolkien -- is spawning a video game, as is nearly every other movie with a plausible action theme. If you're a serious gamer, it's hard to go to the movies without reaching around for the game controller, without feeling as if you're stuck watching a one-way plot. 
But if you've played any of the new-generation video games -- titles like "Splinter Cell" or "Blinx the Time Sweeper" or almost anything else released in the past year or two -- you quickly realize that they create a sense of perceptual reality that is far more intense than anything the movies offer. No matter how much a movie absorbs you, you never really break the plane of the movie screen. But if they're about anything, video games now are about breaking the plane, taking the player into a world whose dimensions you can feel, almost as if they were real, when you close your eyes. Gamers are forever talking about the intricacies of those worlds, the qualities of the game-play, the subtleties of the rendering, the raw imagination on display. But what underlies it all is that visceral sense of having walked through a door into another universe. 
And that, of course, is precisely what troubles critics of video games. A good number of the doors you walk through lead to mayhem of the worst kind, to what the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates each game, calls "Animated Blood" or "Gore" or "Strong Sexual Content." These are universes where no one dies a natural death, where limbs fly and heads erupt, and the women -- well-armed heroines, many of them --are drawn by men who have mastered the art of what the industry calls "breast physics." No game is inherently amoral, because the play of the game imposes its own self-contained rules on how behavior is rewarded. But a game like "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" or the notorious "BMX XXX" certainly qualifies as amoral by any real-world standards. 
In a way, nothing can teach you more about the modern obsession with entertainment than a sojourn in the world of video games. The best of them take hours of practice to get good at, and they contain hundreds of hours of play once you do get good. The real question is always, "What are you getting good at?," and "virtual volleyball" just doesn't seem like answer enough. But there are at least two good answers to that question, neither of them very satisfying to critics. The first is that every human activity, serious or playful, eventually ramifies into a world of its own, a self-contained cosmos of enormous complexity. The other answer is $10 billion.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Site, Round 2: New Designs to Be Unveiled Wednesday 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
When seven teams of architects unveil their designs for the World Trade Center site on Wednesday, the public will be treated to a unusual seminar on innovative design and architecture that is rarely a part of normal civic life.
 A news conference to introduce the designs -- a three-hour presentation, to be broadcast live on local television and edited into a videotape that will be available at every public library in the city -- will include discourses from the architects themselves, models of their work and drawings of views from the tops of buildings and upon emerging from the subway. 
 The plans themselves "present a dazzling diversity of geometric configurations, ranging from conventional building shapes to highly unorthodox structural forms," said John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
Yet for all their certainty about the success of the designs, rebuilding officials and professionals in architecture and urban design are concerned about how the public will decide which ones it likes -- and whether it will ignore considerations of architecture and urban design in favor of a simplistic beauty contest. 
Which raises the question, how are citizens who might not know or care much about the difference between urban design and architecture supposed to look at these models? How does a viewer translate a scale rendering into a perception of what it would be like to stand within this new streetscape, for example, or make sense of why one concept might work while another would not?
The key is to "try to imagine living in the space," said Marcie Kesner, an architect and co-chairwoman of New York New Visions, a group of architecture and design firms that worked with the development corporation in organizing the current round of designs. "Try to imagine yourself walking through these streets or trying to get from one part of Lower Manhattan to another," she said. "Visualize what that experience might be like."
Rather than just looking at the designs of buildings, or being enchanted by spinning models or subtle watercolors, Ms. Kesner said, "think about where the cars are going to go, or how the spaces connect to the surrounding neighborhoods." And do not be intimidated by a lack of formal training. After all, she said, "in New York, all of us to an extent are experts in urban living."
It is a difficult challenge that some architects doubt the public is up to. 
"What the public understands is pretty pictures," Hugh Hardy, a New York architect, said recently at a symposium in Lower Manhattan sponsored by the American Institute of Architects. "It's extraordinary to see how visually illiterate the public at large is and how dependent they are on renderings."
"That's a problem that has run through this whole process," added Mr. Hardy, whose firm, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, oversaw the restoration of Radio City Music Hall. "We've got to help and bridge the gap between what the public expects as a language and what, in fact, the issues are."
The development corporation's vice president for planning, design and development, Alexander Garvin, who oversaw the design competition, said that although Mr. Hardy's comments might be blunt, they could not be ignored. "But I have faith in the public," Mr. Garvin added. "I think the public came back the last time we put things out and was incredibly perceptive in what they wanted and didn't want."
Rebuilding officials concede that they will be fighting against their experience with the first set of designs, which was released in July and quickly derided as ugly and uninspiring. Those designs were what architects and designers call "massing models," layouts that show where buildings sit but do not try to define what the buildings themselves would look like.
"We're not going to make that mistake again," said Roland W. Betts, a director of the development corporation who has overseen the board's site-planning committee. "There is going to be a higher level of articulation in these designs."
And while the development corporation intentionally gave those previous designs a uniform look, Mr. Garvin said of the new designs, "I think you will be quite amazed at how different one is from the next."
Some people who have been active in the public discussion about rebuilding Lower Manhattan say that the public must look harder at the broader implications of the designs for the trade center site.
"I'm sure there are going to be plenty of beautiful forms and shapes," said David Kallick, a senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute and a coordinator of the Labor Community Advocacy Network to Rebuild New York. "But what's important is not just what the site is going to look like, but what it is going to do to the economy and what it is going to do for the city."
Mr. Kallick said that the fact that the designs were being unveiled just before many people went on vacation for the end-of-year holidays was likely to make it more difficult than usual to get adequate, informed public participation. Viewers should also recognize that anything planned for the site will be phased in over several years, during which the site will be part of an active community. The architects were asked, therefore, to preview what the site would look like in 2 or 5 or 10 years.
In total, the seven teams have produced nine plans for the trade center site, which will be on display at the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center from Friday through Feb. 3. The designs will also be on the development corporation's Web site, www.renewnyc.org, and comments can be submitted at both places. 
Raymond W. Gastil, executive director of the Van Alen Institute, a nonprofit center for architecture that is named for the designer of the Chrysler Building, said viewers should be aware that what they saw in the designs was still not intended to be exactly what would be built.
Those decisions are years away, he said, although the drawings are likely to be experiential. "They will show you, for example, that this is the central square," Mr. Gastil said, "and this is what it is like to be in the central square. Or this is what it is like to be in this tower."
As such, viewers should first consider the renderings by taking them at face value. "That's the question -- would these plans make a place where people actually want to be?" Mr. Gastil said. "Is that a special enough place to go to live or to work or to play? It requires using one's imagination as to what the experience of being there would be."
Second, viewers should consider the designs' more technical aspects -- if a rendering shows a sunny, lovely square, for example, is it surrounded by 800-foot towers that will make it a gloomy, dismal place?
One way to consider those aspects, Mr. Gastil said, is to compare the redesigned trade center site with other well-known public places in the city with similar attributes, like Times Square or Union Square or Fifth Avenue at 59th Street.
Finally, Mr. Gastil said, consider the designs' poetics -- does it create an icon for the skyline, for example? If a design calls for an important public space on the 100th floor, will it realistically be like what the designer imagines? 
"It's hard to know exactly what works and what doesn't," Mr. Gastil said. "But you can use common sense. Imagine going from this point to that point to get on the train." 
The seven groups of architects were instructed not to design the memorial that will be built at the site but simply to plan for it, and some plans are likely to be more extensive than others. 
Many people have asked whether the memorial will be separated from the surrounding commercial areas, and what a person will experience approaching the memorial. Can it be entered from anywhere else on the site, for example, or does it require passage through a sort of ceremonial entrance so that the experience is relatively similar for all visitors?
Rebuilding officials have not shied away from raising expectations about the plans or their unveiling this week, and while no plans will satisfy every viewer, Mr. Garvin said he thought that most people would be pleasantly surprised.
"As a piece of theater and as an inspirational day," he said of the day the designs will first be presented to the public, "you probably are not going to have a day like this again in your life."

Decade-Long Shopping Spree Is Expected to Slow in 2003

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
A WIDELY expected drop in consumer spending has been the American economy's version of Godot.
 The fizzling of the stock market bubble, starting in early 2000, raised some of the first fears that consumers would put away their credit cards. The widespread layoffs of 2001 heightened the concern, and when the attacks of Sept. 11 accelerated the layoffs, the end of the spend-a-thon seemed likely. 
 But with the help of low interest rates and a tax cut, consumers have kept shopping. The recession that began in March 2001 now stands as the only one since the 1940's in which household spending did not decline during a single quarter. 
Consumers are expected to keep the streak intact next year, having already weathered a decline in the stock market and a sharp increase in unemployment. Low interest rates will help, making houses, cars and other big-ticket items seem affordable, and Washington policy makers are planning another tax cut.
Still, economists and business leaders do not expect households to be the source of strength that they have been in recent years. "We have perennially underestimated the consumer," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. Nonetheless, he said, "spending is going to slow down." 
The decade-long shopping spree is also vulnerable to an unexpected shock, like a spike in oil prices caused by a war in the Middle East. Unemployment is likely to stay near its current 6 percent next year, keeping raises moderate. Debt levels remain high. The tax cuts under consideration would pump less money into the economy than was the case this year. The increase in housing prices is slowing, and the sharp decline of stocks since 2000 still weighs on many people.
Most people adjust their spending months, or even years, after the value of their portfolios change. Sydney C. Ludvigson, an economist at New York University, said the rise in stock values the last decade would help support current consumer spending levels, but the more recent decline would be a drag on growth.
Dean Maki, an economist at Putnam Investments in Boston, said, "The biggest impact is happening right now."
The rapid increases in home prices, which has mitigated some of the stock losses, appear to be ending, although few economists expect sharp drops in 2003.
With mortgage rates near a 40-year low, the typical monthly housing payment has increased no faster than income in many cities. Forecasters say immigration and the aging of the population, pushing more people into peak home-owning ages, will keep demand high enough to avoid a big drop in home prices.
Even in places showing signs of a housing bubble -- Boston, Denver, New York and many cities in California -- prices are unlikely to fall as rapidly as the Nasdaq composite index has, because people do not sell houses as rapidly as they sell stocks.
House prices "tend to ratchet up during booms and they hold their value during busts because sellers won't sell," said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. 
Of course, many forecasters also argued that stocks were not overvalued three years ago, and some of the few who cried bubble then are doing so now about the housing market. 
Dean Baker, one of the bubble spotters and an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, says that since 1995, house prices have increased much faster than inflation for the first time in decades. If inflation remains low, it will not effectively reduce monthly house payments in future years, as it once did, Mr. Baker added.
Many baby boomers will also need to sell their houses to afford retirement, and that means prices should fall, whether in 2003 or later.
Either way, consumers will probably not refinance their mortgages, and receive extra cash, at the same pace they did this year, when interest rates were falling and home prices were increasing. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America predicts that total mortgage lending will fall about 25 percent next year.
But wealth, in the form of stocks and homes, affects consumer spending less than income does. The biggest reason that households have continued to send money out their doors is that it continues to flow in.
Although the unemployment rate, at 6 percent, is at an eight-year high, it remains low for a period shortly after a recession. More people have left the labor force than in past decades, making economic health worse than the jobless rate suggests. But the job market is tight enough that employers continue to give raises. 
Average weekly wages for workers who are not supervisors increased about 3 percent in the last year, to $510, while the inflation rate was 2 percent, according to the Labor Department. In past slowdowns, wages have often fallen, after adjusting for inflation.
Even if business leaders remain skeptical of the economy's health and unemployment keeps rising in early 2003, the moderate gains in income could continue, economists say. But this year's large jump in after-tax income will probably not repeat. Not only did tax rates fall for most workers in 2002, but the law also created new breaks that led to sizable refunds.
After-tax income jumped more steeply in the first half of the year than it had at any point in the last 15 years, Mr. Maki said.
But households are also less willing to spend their money than they once were. With retirement approaching for older baby boomers and the Standard & Poor's index 41.8 percent below its peak in March 2000, people are stepping up their saving.
The trend is likely to continue, because the current saving rate -- 4 percent, up from 2 percent in the late 1990's -- is still too low to allow many people to pay for their retirement.
"It's a slow, upward grind from here," Mr. Maki said.

President's Top Priorities: Tax Cuts, but No Quick Stimulus

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IF experience is any guide, President Bush will get most of what he wants next year when he pushes for a package of tax cuts. But what he wants may not be the same as what he says he wants.
 For all the talk about trying to jolt the economy out of its current sluggish state, Mr. Bush's top advisers are much more preoccupied with the broader goal of reducing taxes in general than they are with providing short-term stimulus. 
 Mr. Bush's decision to install a new economic team -- John W. Snow as Treasury secretary and Stephen Friedman as his top economic adviser at the White House -- was perhaps most important as a sign that the president is taking more direct grasp over economic issues than he has in the past. 
He will propose, and probably succeed in pushing through Congress, a package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The Bush proposal is expected to emphasize lower taxes on corporate dividends, an acceleration of tax cuts that had been scheduled for 2004 and 2006, and more generous depreciation write-offs for corporations.
And although the White House will inevitably have to make some compromises with Democrats, who want to focus tax relief on poor and middle-income people rather than on corporations and the wealthy, the compromises are most likely to be on the margin.
To Mr. Bush's great advantage, Republicans reclaimed a paper-thin majority in the Senate and widened their majority in the House of Representatives in the November elections. Senate Republicans caution that they do not have carte blanche, because they do not have the 60 votes needed under Senate rules to cut off debate and prevent Democratic filibusters.
But even the power to block by filibuster provides the Democrats with only limited leverage, and Democratic leaders have already conceded that tax cuts of some kind will be on the agenda as soon as the new Congress convenes in January.
"In the past two years, the president has pretty much gotten what he wanted," said Bill Frenzel, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who is now a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.
The bigger question is the nature of Mr. Bush's agenda.
It is now a cliche that Mr. Bush has vowed not to repeat his father's mistake as president, which was to be perceived as passive and ineffective in the face of an economic slowdown.
At almost every possible chance Mr. Bush and top administration officials repeat that the economy is "headed in the right direction," then quickly add that it is not headed there quickly enough and that Washington therefore needs to deliver more tax relief.
Yet many administration officials are quietly skeptical about the need for or effectiveness of short-term stimulus measures. Indeed, White House officials ardently discourage the very word stimulus because it sounds like Keynesian fine-tuning.
Many economists, both supporters and critics of the Bush administration, argue that tax cuts and other forms of short-term stimulus are unlikely to jolt the economy out of its lethargy.
They note that the weakest element of the economy, business investment, appears to have little to do with the cost of capital and hence would be unlikely to be encouraged by more tax breaks. Thanks to the Federal Reserve, which has reduced interest rates to their lowest level in four decades, the cost of capital is lower than it was in the middle of the economic boom.
"Investment is lagging right now because there is a very high level of unused capacity, the highest level in almost two decades," said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, who contended that none of the Bush administration's expected proposals would provide short-term stimulus.
"If you look at what they're actually doing, they're probing for weak spots in order to cut taxes," he said. "That's consistent with a long-term agenda that is to starve the government of resources."
Supporters of the administration insist that certain forms of tax relief favored by the White House would have a big stimulative effect. Lowering the tax on corporate dividends, they argue, would immediately give investors a bit more money, make stocks more attractive and reduce distortions in the tax system that encourage companies to borrow money rather than to raise it from investors.
But even supporters say Mr. Bush's real goal is longer-run tax reduction. "My guess is that their proposal will take the form of tax reform that helps economic performance rather than traditional short-run stimulus," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at the Bank of America.
Perhaps the biggest question in 2003 will be whether Mr. Bush and his new economic team can devote the necessary attention and the political capital to the economic agenda.
The expected package of tax cuts would be only a small step toward the wider overhaul of the tax system that stirs the passions of people like R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Even a package worth $300 billion over 10 years, the number currently being rumored, would pale in a system that takes in more than $1.8 trillion a year.
What really excites people like Mr. Hubbard is the thought of a systemic overhaul to replace today's income tax system with either a variation on the flat tax or one that is based primarily on a sales or consumption tax like the value-added taxes in effect in many other countries. That kind of system would sweep away much of the different tax treatments for different forms of income and the maze of deductions, tax credits, exclusions and loopholes that are integral to the current system.
To pursue such an agenda would require an enormous investment of time and energy, as anybody who worked to pass the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the most sweeping tax legislation in a generation, will quickly attest.
During Mr. Bush's first two years in office, his economic policies were much more driven by opportunity and short-term political considerations than they are likely to be in the next two years. With a recession looming when he took office, Mr. Bush pushed through, under the mantle of stimulating economic growth, a tax reduction for individuals -- complete with $300 rebate checks for single taxpayers and $600 for couples last year -- and a host of other tax breaks that are to be phased in over the next several years. Some of those, like repealing the estate tax in 2010, the final year for the 2001 legislation, will have no impact on short-term growth but have been on Republican wish-lists for years.
White House officials are clearly hoping the new team will bring greater coherence and discipline. Mr. Snow, chairman and chief executive of the CSX Corporation, the railway company, is said to be smoother and more likely to be gaffe-free when dealing with Congress and the public than was his predecessor as secretary of the Treasury, Paul H. O'Neill. Mr. Friedman, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, is supposed to bring tighter organization to economic policy planning and communicate better with Wall Street than his predecessor, Lawrence B. Lindsey.
But both new members of the economic team are pragmatists, not passionate advocates of big economic ideas. And if Mr. Bush ends up leading a war against Iraq, he may not be able to focus on economic ideas either.

What the Public Sees May Not Be What It Gets

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
When official Washington was hot with rumors last week about who would be the next Treasury secretary, President Bush and his chief political aide, Karl Rove, rolled out a classic Washington feint. 
 Each appeared publicly last Sunday afternoon with a much-mentioned finalist for the Treasury job, even though by that time, another candidate, John W. Snow, a railroad executive, had already accepted the position. 
 As if to throw reporters off the scent -- or to suggest that an also-ran was still in favor at the White House -- Mr. Bush alighted that afternoon from Marine One on the South Lawn with Donald L. Evans, his commerce secretary and best friend in Washington, who had spent the weekend with him at Camp David. 
A little farther up the Potomac, Mr. Rove was at that moment having brunch at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown, a commissary of choice for the nattering class, with another finalist, Gerald L. Parsky, an assistant Treasury secretary in the Ford administration who ran Mr. Bush's California campaign in 2000.
Mr. Parsky was quick last week to deny any underlying motive for the meal and insisted that sometimes brunch is just brunch. "He and his family are very close friends, and my family and his family had lunch," Mr. Parsky said.
Whatever it was, it was hardly new. Politicians have been engaging in Washington feints probably since the dawn of the nation, and maybe up until this weekend, when Al Gore guest starred on "Saturday Night Live" as a presumed 2004 presidential candidate and then announced yesterday that he was not running.
Still, it was Lyndon B. Johnson who established the feint gold standard. In the summer of 1964, Johnson had decided to make Hubert H. Humphrey his running mate, but worried that a done deal would make the Democratic convention in Atlantic City too boring. To inject some suspense, historians say, he decided to make it look as if it had not been decided. So he ostentatiously flew on Air Force One to the convention with both Humphrey and Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut, even though he had no intention of picking Mr. Dodd.
"He also didn't want Humphrey to think he had it in the bag, so this was his way of making Humphrey feel insecure down to the last minute, and then later on more grateful when he got it," said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian and Johnson biographer. 
Similarly, Mr. Beschloss said, Richard M. Nixon had already decided before the 1968 Republican convention in Miami that Spiro T. Agnew would be his running mate. Nonetheless, Nixon invited influential Republicans into his Miami hotel suite, where he casually asked their opinions of candidates he had no remote intention of selecting, like Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York. But the feint ensured that Republicans would trundle out and leak the names to the news media. 
"The idea was to keep people off the trail," Mr. Beschloss said.
At other times, presidents used feints to cover up national security secrets. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy canceled campaign speeches in California and elsewhere, claiming that he had a bad head cold. But the real reason, historians have written, was to allow the president to be in Washington to confer with aides about intelligence reports of Soviet missiles in Cuba.
President Bill Clinton used the feint at least once to have an "accidental" encounter in 1993 with Salman Rushdie in the Old Executive Office Building. At the time, Mr. Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses" had been condemned as blasphemous by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran and Mr. Rushdie was in hiding for his life. To the White House, a "chance" meeting between the president and Mr. Rushdie would convey the administration's abhorrence at Iran's refusal to lift the death threat against the novelist, but might not alienate the Muslim world as much as a full-dress Oval Office encounter.
A White House Letter last week about the size of President Bush's Christmas card mailing list mentioned that the one million cards were postmarked from Crawford, Tex., the one-stoplight town seven miles from the president's ranch. Indeed they were, but not one was actually mailed from the tiny town.
James Coultress, a Texas postal spokesman, said last week that 1.2 million White House Christmas cards were mailed from Austin, but with a special Crawford postmark stamp made specially to attach to the Austin mail equipment. The postal service reached the decision, Mr. Coultress said, because the Crawford post office has only two employees, who would have suffocated under the mountain of White House cheer.
The specially designed Hallmark cards don't seem to have been near the White House at all. They were printed at a Hallmark facility in Lawrence, Kan., and then dispatched straight to Austin. 
"I don't think they ever made the trek to Washington," said Deidre Parkes, a Hallmark spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: More Than Words to Fight AIDS 

 BODY:
Earlier this month Colin Powell and Tommy Thompson gathered representatives from 86 countries to lecture them on the importance of political leadership in fighting AIDS. Make AIDS a global priority, said Secretary of State Powell. Invest in global health, implored Health Secretary Thompson. Their message was important and well timed -- but should have been directed at Washington. 
 The administration is not blind to the catastrophe. The president and his top officials speak about AIDS in the most apocalyptic terms, and Mr. Powell called the disease a more important challenge than terrorism. But when it comes to financing, urgency vanishes. Mr. Bush is likely to visit Africa next month. He should be carrying with him an AIDS initiative backed with real money. 
 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has just started to give out its first grants and is already broke. As Washington and other donors demanded, the fund has designed a rigorous process and has received dozens of well-designed proposals to fight disease. But it must now tell countries there is no money to finance them. The administration makes much of the fact that the United States, which has pledged $500 million over two years, is the largest donor. But when measured by the size of the economy, it is actually giving half as much as Europe. Washington's contribution needs to be $2.5 billion a year to make a difference.
The administration's showpiece program on AIDS this year was an initiative to combat the transmission of the disease from mothers to babies. That has only served to undercut a better proposal within Congress. Mr. Bush's plan superseded a Senate proposal, backed by Jesse Helms, that would have spent $500 million on these programs. Then the president vetoed the appropriation containing the first year's payment. Politicians lament the tragedy of babies with AIDS, but their concern has so far produced not a cent of new money. And shamefully, on the last day of the Congressional session, Senate Republicans killed a bill agreed on unanimously in the House and Senate that would have provided $4 billion over two years to fight global AIDS.
Administration officials and members of Congress argue that there are other things to spend money on. None are more urgent. The Central Intelligence Agency is warning that AIDS in China, India and Russia, as well as in Africa, is a mounting security threat for the United States. AIDS is already destabilizing Africa. It is a major cause of a hunger crisis now affecting 38 million Africans. The world, and the United States, cannot afford to let Mr. Bush go to Africa without a real plan to put cash behind the administration's statements on AIDS. American officials should not be giving anyone lectures while Washington's response to the major catastrophe of our time remains limited largely to words.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: HOLLYWOOD; 
Actor Follows His Own Script on Iraq and War

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
As Sean Penn packed last week for a journey into the politically fraught landscape of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, he said today, he pondered the history of Hollywood actors who had wagered their celebrity in lands locked in enmity with the United States.
 Like a lighthouse on jagged rocks, there was the case of Jane Fonda and her Christmas visit to North Vietnam in 1972, when her firebrand condemnation of the American war effort earned her, from troops fighting the Vietcong, the sobriquet of Hanoi Jane. In the 1920's and 1930's, there were the Hollywood actors, writers and directors who visited Stalin's Russia as the Great Terror loomed, and found nothing much to their distaste. 
 Mr. Penn, a onetime Hollywood bad boy who was rarely known in the earlier stages of his career for his forbearance, arrived here on Friday for a three-day visit after an open letter he addressed to President Bush in October in the form of a $56,000 advertisement in The Washington Post. Speaking of Mr. Bush's threat to invade Iraq, he condemned the president for "a simplistic and inflammatory view of good and evil." He added, "Sir, I beg you, help save America before yours is a legacy of shame and horror." 
In faxes, open letters and antiwar statements within the last month, he has been joined in his opposition to a war in Iraq by Barbra Streisand, Kim Basinger, Mia Farrow, Martin Sheen, Olympia Dukakis, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover and Ms. Fonda -- and more than 4,000 others, in an advertisement published in The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
But if Mr. Penn's letter seemed to set the stage for fireworks, the 42-year-old actor worked his way through his days here with a restraint a world away from the edgy, often truculent characters he has played in films from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" to "Dead Man Walking."
Iraqi officials who thought giving him a visa would assure a highly publicized reprise of the October salvo -- as has happened when American peace groups have come here and angrily denounced Mr. Bush -- found themselves dealing instead with The Quiet American.
Chain-smoking, self-questioning and insisting he had come to Iraq "to learn and not to teach," the actor shunned television cameras and pursuing reporters until a news conference, and accompanying interviews, he gave a few hours before he left tonight.
Even then, he was a disappointment to anybody expecting him to follow the example of American protesters who, in their zeal to condemn Mr. Bush, have sometimes seemed eager to embrace Mr. Hussein, or at least to ignore some of the less savory aspects of his rule.
Instead, Mr. Penn chose the diplomat's path, sparing both Mr. Bush and Mr. Hussein the full power of the "conclusions" he said he had reached in the momentum toward war. "Can I think of more extreme things to say?" the actor said, referring to Mr. Hussein's rule, during an interview in a suite in the government-owned Al Rashid Hotel that offered a twinkling nighttime panorama of Baghdad's palaces, party buildings and mosques Mr. Hussein has built in the bulldozed heart of old Baghdad. "You bet I can."
He added, "You come here on a Friday, you leave on a Sunday, and you start throwing out flamboyant and inflammatory messages -- that doesn't seem to be of advantage to anyone." Where Iraq is concerned, he said: "I can read something one day, and the next day I read something else, and I think, 'Oh God, I didn't even think about that,' and that's humbling. So I'm afraid of saying something that might hurt somebody, and then find out I was wrong in the first place."
He said he thought out the approach intensively before setting out from his San Francisco-area home. He said he had talked with some of "my peers" in Hollywood who had been burned by involving themselves in high-profile political disputes. He considered the impassioned climate in America since Sept. 11 and the "legitimate worries about what we don't know" about Iraq and its secret weapons programs; and weighed the concerns of his wife, the actress Robin Wright Penn, who, he said, had "her fingers crossed" as he left for Baghdad.
He had also reflected, he said, on the bitter experience in the 1950's of his father, the film director and television producer Leo Penn, who was blacklisted by Hollywood studios for five years after refusing to testify during the Communist scare of the McCarthy years. More recently, he said, there had been the experience of directing an 11-minute film that was the American contribution to an 11-nation French-led collaborative film titled "11.9.01" that offered differing and often questioning perspectives on the events of Sept. 11 -- only for the film to find no distributor in the United States, nearly three months after its Paris premiere.
But perhaps most of all, Mr. Penn seemed to have thought over what happened to Ms. Fonda. Without mentioning her name, Mr. Penn said in the interview that her experience in Vietnam, and her apology to American veterans' groups more than a quarter of a century later, had been a caution to him. "I thought, there will clearly be those who will say that coming to Baghdad is insensitive to American troops," he said. "But I don't imagine I'll be apologizing as she did at some far point in the future."
Mr. Penn's trip here, arranged at short notice, was suggested to him by the Institute for Public Accuracy, an organization founded in San Francisco in 1997 that spends a $350,000 annual budget on offering "analyses, perceptions and information that rarely make it into the public domain," according to the institute's founder and executive director, Norman Solomon. Mr. Solomon, 51, said Mr. Penn paid his own expenses for the trip.
In Baghdad, Mr. Penn followed an itinerary set by the Iraqis, and was accompanied, like all foreigners here, by a government "minder," whose tasks include approving visits and monitoring conversations. The actor began with a visit to Al Mansour children's hospital on Friday, touring wards filled with children said by the Iraqis to have fallen sick with cancers, malnutrition and other afflictions caused by United Nations economic sanctions. Over the weekend, he visited a dilapidated school in the Baghdad suburbs, and a water treatment plant on the Tigris River bombed by American aircraft in 1991.
He also met Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister who is one of Mr. Hussein's closest aides, and toured Saddam City, a teeming Baghdad slum that has been a center of underground resistance to Mr. Hussein. Late on Saturday, the actor eluded his minder and hailed a taxi for a second trip to Saddam City, where he walked the streets taking photographs and talking to people who recognized him from the video cassettes and DVD's of American movies that are wildly popular in Baghdad. One film frequently mentioned, he said, was "Dead Man Walking," a dramatization of events leading to the execution in Louisiana of a rapist and murderer played by Mr. Penn.
Before leaving, the actor relented a little on his self-denying ordinance about keeping his political opinions to himself until he returned to the United States. In the interview, he said at one point that "if it didn't involve killing" Iraqis with American missiles and bombs, "there's a lot of things I'd like to change in this country." He added, "If I was a citizen of Iraq, I'd consider all options on behalf of my country." 
He also appealed to Mr. Bush to release whatever evidence he had to support American charges that Iraq was hiding banned weapons programs, saying, "It's very hard to believe that the American people could find a justification for war if it were to be the case that there were no weapons of mass destruction."
As for Mr. Bush's desire for new leadership in Iraq, he said that was a matter for Iraqis, not Americans. "I do not believe that it is the manifest destiny of the United States to police the world," he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 16 about Sean Penn's visit to Iraq misstated the timing of an earlier trip by a Hollywood actor to a land in hostile confrontation with the United States -- Jane Fonda's visit to North Vietnam in 1972. It was in July, not at Christmas.

HEADLINE: BOWING OUT: THE OVERVIEW; 
Gore Rules Out Running in '04 For President

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Al Gore announced last night that he would not run for president in 2004, apparently ending a political career that thrust him into the middle of one of the most disputed presidential elections in American history, while recasting the coming contest among the half-dozen Democrats seeking to take on President Bush.
 Mr. Gore, the former vice president, said in an interview on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" that he was intent on seeing Mr. Bush unseated, and believed he could be defeated. But Mr. Gore suggested that he might not be the strongest challenger in what early polls show would be a difficult task for the Democratic Party, because of the way he lost to Mr. Bush in 2000. 
 "I personally have the energy and the drive and the ambition to make another campaign," Mr. Gore said, speaking slowly and firmly in an eight-minute interview taped yesterday afternoon at CBS studios in New York. 
"But I don't think it's the right thing for me to do," he continued. "I think that a campaign that would be a rematch between myself and President Bush would inevitably involve a focus on the past that would in some measure distract from the focus on the future that I think all campaigns have to be about." Excerpts, Page A19. 
Mr. Gore, who mocked himself in an appearance on "Saturday Night Live" the night before, said he viewed this decision as effectively ending his career in elective politics. "I make this decision in the full knowledge and awareness that if I don't run this run this time, which I'm not going to run in 2004, that's probably the last opportunity I'll have had to run for president," he said.
For Mr. Gore, the 54-year-old son of a senator who devoted nearly half his life to trying to become president, the announcement was the end of what friends have described as two of the darkest years of his life. Mr. Gore won the popular vote in 2000, but lost the presidency because of a vote count in Florida that he and other Democrats assailed as illegitimate. It was an embittering experience that was the prime reason many Democrats thought Mr. Gore would and should run again, a point of view that Mr. Gore rebutted last night.
For many Democrats, Mr. Gore was viewed as the strongest candidate in the field, if only because he was so well known and enjoyed what early polls pointed to as wide support among Democratic primary voters. As a result, his decision also scrambles the state of play in the Democratic presidential primary, forcing nearly all of the Democrats who have been considering a run to rethink their strategies for a presidential contest in which two candidates have already announced they are running.
It clears the way for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who was Mr. Gore's running mate in 2000, to run. Mr. Lieberman had said he would not run for president this time if Mr. Gore did. Mr. Lieberman's associates, ecstatic at the news, said he would announce that he is running in the next few weeks.
But for some Democrats who are in or about to enter the race, the decision by Mr. Gore is possibly an unwelcome development. All of them had devised campaign strategies based on the premise that they would either defeat or come close to defeating Mr. Gore in one of the early primary states, and as a result vault to the head of the Democratic pack.
A senior adviser to one of the likely candidates, asked what he would do now, sighed and responded, "I'm going to go have another beer."
Two people have taken official steps to enter the race: Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont. Other likely candidates include Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the former House minority leader, and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader who is soon to become the Senate minority leader, is also considering a race.
'Without Gore, I think it's going to be a very even field," Steve Elmendorf, a senior adviser to Mr. Gephardt, said. "You have five or six candidates, all of whom are pretty strong and well matched."
The question of just how strong a Gore candidacy might be has been the subject of considerable debate among Republicans. Some party officials described him as their favorite opponent, noting his high unfavorable ratings. Other Republicans, though, described Mr. Gore as an experienced and potentially cunning opponent, and said they would prefer not to run against him again.
"We're agnostic as to whomever ultimately emerges to challenge President Bush," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "It's an internal Democratic matter."
By contrast, Democrats applauded a man who has become the face of one of the bitterest defeats the party has ever suffered. "Public service is more than a job for Al Gore, it's a way of life," Mr. Edwards said tonight. "I am confident he will continue to be a valuable contributor to the national dialogue, providing leadership for the country for years to come."
Mr. Dean said: "He worked hard in 2000, but was poorly served by the election process. I wish him well in whatever endeavor he attempts."
Mr. Gore's friends and associates had in recent days said that they considered it increasingly unlikely that he would make what would have been his third bid for president in 14 years.
The former vice president, they said, had seemed in conversations to become much more excited when talking about his life outside of politics -- he is teaching, giving lectures and working at an asset management firm -- than he was in contemplating a return to the campaign trail. In addition, Mr. Gore had not taken any of the steps that someone preparing to run for the White House would take, from calling fund-raisers to cultivating Democratic leaders.
Still, Mr. Gore's decision to announce his intentions last night caught many of his closest friends and advisers, who heard the news from reporters, by surprise.
In recent days, he had set up a schedule of telephone calls to friends and supporters for next week that his associates had assumed were intended to solicit their advice in preparation for an announcement that he had said would come in early January. He had said he would give two major speeches in January, one on health care and the other on the economy, and schedule appearances on television programs for that month.
One associate described Mr. Gore's decision to go on "60 Minutes" as impulsive. Some Democrats complained that Mr. Gore had made his announcement in a way that might overshadow what had been a difficult day for Republicans struggling with a potential challenge to Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader. But a Gore adviser said Mr. Gore had decided that there was no purpose in delaying the announcement until next year.
"I've decided that I will not be a candidate for president in 2004," Mr. Gore said. "My family all gathered here in New York City over the last few days, and I found that I've come to closure on this."
Mr. Gore said that he was convinced Mr. Bush could be defeated, notwithstanding the president's high standing in the polls now, and that he would do what he could to help his party take back the White House in 2004. But Mr. Gore said he decided that, given the turmoil stirred by the 2000 campaign, he should not run again against this president.
"The last campaign was an extremely difficult one, and while I have the energy and drive to go out there and do it again, I think there are a lot of people in the Democratic Party who felt exhausted by that -- who felt, O.K., I don't want to go through that again," he said. "And I'm, frankly, sensitive to that feeling."
Mr. Gore said that he did not know which of the Democrats in the field would have the best shot against Mr. Bush, and if he had a favorite among them, he did not share that last night. Once the interview was done, the former vice president headed for the airport and returned to his home in Virginia -- a quick turnaround before returning to a tour to promote his book first thing this morning.

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Leader Says He'll Weather Strike by Opponents 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
Two weeks into a broad-based national strike aimed at ousting him, President Hugo Chavez said today that he would consider resigning if Venezuela was embroiled by violence and became ungovernable. 
 But Mr. Chavez, a left-leaning former paratrooper who has remade Venezuela's social order in four tumultuous years, asserted that his government was bringing the crisis under control. He said it was reactivating the oil sector and contracting with other countries to ferry in food, which is becoming in short supply. 
 The strike has closed banks, stores and factories in the country, which has Latin America's fourth-largest economy, and nearly shuttered an oil industry that provides 14 percent of the petroleum that the United States imports. There have been waves of generally peaceful demonstrations against Mr. Chavez, including one on Saturday that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets of this capital. 
In the interview, he claimed continued support among the poor and vowed to outlast opponents, who have pledged to maintain the strike until he agrees to early elections and resigns. 
"If I realize that I have failed, the president could resign, but not if they put a gun to his head," Mr. Chavez, speaking in the third person as he often does, told a group of American reporters. "That is an option that is there, but of course I would fight with all the force I have." 
Wearing jeans, a bright yellow, blue and red windbreaker -- the colors of the Venezuelan flag -- and smoking Belmont Extra Smooth cigarettes, he appeared confident and assured as he assessed the crisis, which is the most serious since he was briefly overthrown in April.
He was in a playful mood as he spoke in a garden at the presidential palace, telling reporters with a laugh: "You have been here two weeks? Waiting for the coup?" It was his first interview with American newspaper reporters since the strike began, and it lasted more than three hours, from Saturday night until nearly 2 a.m. today. 
Unlike his boisterous appearances on national television, the interview had Mr. Chavez, 48, speaking calmly, making references to the novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, French philosophers and books about the Venezuelan outback. 
He acknowledged the force of an emboldened opposition and said the strike had battered Venezuela, leaving the oil industry debilitated.
But he said that if his foes were not ready to end the strike, his government would weather what he called an "economic war" meant to topple him.
"I think the country has the capacity to withstand all these pressures," he said. "Our people are people who are able to endure," he said. "Our people, especially the poor, have resisted hunger and misery for decades."
Opponents reacted irritably to the words of Mr. Chavez, whom they describe as an authoritarian who will say anything to remain in power as he takes Venezuela on the path to economic ruin.
"What he says is not true," said Julio Borges, a congressman and leader of Justice First, a political party opposed to Mr. Chavez. "The country has gone from less paralysis to more. Even before these protests, the situation in the country was one of ungovernability."
Mr. Borges, who is one of the leaders in an umbrella group of anti-Chavez organizations that began the strike, said in an interview that the best solution was for the president to resign. "It is what any democrat would do in this situation," he said.
But Mr. Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, was defiant. He strongly rejected the call by the opposition and the Bush administration that he call early elections. He restated that the Constitution did not permit presidential elections before 2006. 
If the Constitution was amended to allow early elections, as some government officials say is possible, its effect would have to be delayed until his successor comes to power, Mr. Chavez said. "There are not retroactive laws," he said. 
The Constitution, however, does allow for a referendum halfway through the president's term, which in Mr. Chavez's case is next August. "Why not wait until August?" he asked. "That is the most logical thing. But they do not act logically." 
The opposition does not want to wait that long and in any case argues that he cannot be trusted to keep his word and abide by the referendum. They vowed to maintain their strike.
"We are at the point of no return," said Carlos Fernandez, president of Venezuela's most powerful business federation and a strike organizer. 
The potential for instability is of deep concern to the Bush administration, which weighs the possibility of an oil crunch if the United States wages war on Iraq. Mr. Chavez, mindful of Caracas's normally close relationship with Washington, said he should have worked harder to build ties with the United States.
"I do not want to clash with the Washington government," he said. "What I want is for them to understand me. What we want here is democracy." 
In contrast to his foes, he said the economic situation had improved in the last week through a patchwork effort undertaken by government officials. To keep food shortages from worsening, he said, Venezuela has contracted with Colombia and the Dominican Republic to import large amounts of beef, milk and rice.
Venezuela's all-important oil sector is slowly coming back, he contended, after its production plunged by 70 percent, to one million barrels a day, because of worker walkouts.
He acknowledged that of the country's three principal refineries, the huge Paraguana refinery remained inactive, as did a smaller one of the three, El Palito.
But the president said that another refinery at Puerto La Cruz was at 80 percent production, and that four tankers carrying two million barrels had left port in the last three days to deliver exports.
To provide gasoline for the internal market, he said, the military has started sending fuel from storage centers to gas stations nationwide.
Mr. Chavez cast the turmoil in epic terms, and promised that victory was at hand. 
"We are right; we are not perfect, but we are on the right path," he said. "I say this because I feel it. We are on the same path as Christ."

TRANSIT WORKERS 'STOP THE CLOCK' ON STRIKE THREAT

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Union officials representing New York City's 34,000 subway and bus workers announced early today that they were continuing negotiations past today's 12:01 a.m. strike deadline because progress was being made in contract talks.
 Officials with Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union declined to say how long they would continue negotiations past the deadline before deciding whether to call a strike. 
 "We'd like to announce that we have made sufficient progress to stop the clock," the local's secretary-treasurer, Ed Watt, said at a brief news conference at the Grand Hyatt Hotel moments after midnight. "This progress has been made primarily in the noneconomic areas of dignity and respect for our members."
There was no immediate comment from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses and subways. 
Subway and bus workers have long complained that the M.T.A.'s disciplinary system issues far more citations each year -- some 15,000 -- to them than it does to workers of Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road.
Mr. Watt's announcement came after a sense of optimism grew during the evening, but union officials said it remained unclear that a settlement would be reached, with wages remaining one of the key stumbling blocks. 
The last public statement from the president of Local 100, Roger Toussaint, came at a late-afternoon news conference at the hotel where he told reporters, "We intend to and still expect that our contract will be resolved before midnight tonight." 
Mr. Toussaint's remarks came about an hour after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki publicly warned the union of severe penalties if it carried out its threat to walk out.
Mr. Toussaint and other union leaders and local lawmakers spent much of the weekend pressing the mayor, and especially the governor, to get involved to resolve the dispute.
Throughout the day, union leaders said little about the threatened strike even though members voted overwhelmingly last weekend to authorize their leaders to call a strike if no contract was reached by today. 
Tommy McKeon, a negotiator in the union's track maintenance department, said he was glad about the decision to stop the clock, describing the feeling among workers as increasingly positive but still tense. "I haven't heard exactly what they were offered," he said, "but it's always encouraging to keep on talking."
At the Transport Workers Union hall on the Upper West Side, where dozens of transit workers had gathered, some also expressed optimism after Mr. Watt's brief announcement.
"For now, it's good enough," said Henry Williams, a signal maintainer for the last 22 years. "We're going to be moving passengers" today. Speaking of transportation officials, he said, "I wouldn't say they're negotiating in good faith but better than they have been."
"Now," he said just before 12:30 a.m., "we're going to go home and get some sleep."
Earlier yesterday, one union adviser, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said one option under consideration was to delay a walkout until the middle of the week.
The union spent early yesterday putting City Council members and state legislators before television cameras to urge Mr. Pataki to use his powers to bring about a deal. But Mr. Pataki, who controls the M.T.A., which runs the city's subways and buses, sought to avoid being drawn into the dispute, saying, "There is no person capable of riding in on a white horse with a bag of money to resolve this contract."
The governor appeared with Mr. Bloomberg at the 4:15 p.m. news conference at the Office of Emergency Management in Brooklyn, where the mayor warned New Yorkers to be prepared for a strike. "You should not go to bed assuming that you will be able to go about your business in the regular way," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
City officials spent yesterday honing their contingency plans, which include requiring most automobiles entering Manhattan to carry four passengers and allowing limousine and livery car drivers to pick up passengers who hail them. Many New Yorkers were busy arranging car pools, buying staples and oiling the chains on their bicycles to help cope with what would be the first transit strike in New York in 22 years. 
At his news conference, Mr. Toussaint sought to place the blame for any walkout on the M.T.A., which runs the nation's largest transit system, carrying more than seven million riders a day. He said it had not responded to the union's request to begin negotiations in the spring and "resolve the contract long before the Christmas season."
"We believe the M.T.A.'s responsible for pushing transit workers to the brink," he said. 
Mr. Toussaint said substantial gaps remained between the two sides on many issues, including wages, safety, the disciplinary system and the union's demand that the authority help pay for prescriptions for retirees.
As for wages -- the issue that many labor experts expect will be hardest to settle -- he said the agency was still calling for a wage freeze in the first year of a proposed three-year accord.
"For the M.T.A. to put zeros on the table for all the hard work the transit workers give to this city is unacceptable," said Mr. Toussaint, who was wearing a navy blue suit, having jettisoned the black leather jacket he wore on Thursday when he told the mayor to "shut up."
A union adviser said last night that if the M.T.A. did not budge on its insistence on a first-year wage freeze, the union would definitely walk out.
The union, whose members average $44,000 year in base salary, originally sought an 8 percent raise each year for three years but later lowered its proposal to a 6 percent raise each year. Besides the wage freeze in the first year, management has called for raises in the second and third years but contingent upon the union's agreeing to productivity increases.
The authority has also asked for many givebacks, including having workers contribute $1,000 more to their pensions each year.
With many transit workers complaining that the mayor and governor had criticized them day after day, Mr. Pataki offered some kind words yesterday. After praising the courage that many transit workers showed on Sept. 11 and in the days after, the governor said: "I have tremendous respect for the people who drive the buses and run the subways. They have shown their commitment to the people of the city of New York in the past 15 months. I hope they will show it again by not engaging in strike activity."
Mr. Pataki urged the union not to forget that the M.T.A., the state and the city all faced large deficits, and he issued a stern warning: "There are severe penalties to engage in an illegal strike."
Mr. Bloomberg vowed to seek damages against the union, whether or not there is a walkout. City officials, who predict the city's economy would lose $100 million to $350 million each day of a strike, have filed a lawsuit seeking $1 million from the union on the first day of a walkout, doubling every day thereafter; $25,000 against each member, doubling each day; and $5 million for the costs it says it has incurred preparing for a threatened walkout.
"You can rest assured whether there is a strike or not, we will do a careful accounting and we will try to recoup all those expenses," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We don't have the money to go and waste."
The M.T.A. has obtained a court injunction ordering the union not to strike. Under the state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes by public employees, the workers could be fined two day's pay for each day on strike.

On the Long Flights, Take Steps, Lots of Them

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
A word to the wise for anyone planning a winter vacation or business trip to distant lands: a few simple steps can go a long way to keep you free from an admittedly rare but sometimes deadly complication of long trips, especially those taken by air.
 That complication is a blood clot called deep vein thrombosis, or D.V.T., which can result in a dangerous or even deadly pulmonary embolism in about 10 percent of cases. 
 It has been variously called "coach class thrombosis" or "economy class syndrome," because confinement in narrow coach seats limits opportunities for protective movement. But in fact the problem can afflict those traveling in roomier seats, as well. 
The problem is not limited to planes. Those who sat for hours in cramped air raid shelters in London in the blitz in World War II had a sixfold increase in sudden death from pulmonary embolism.
Although experts continue to debate the extent of the risk, particularly the risks linked to long plane trips, others have documented that the clots occur rather frequently, even though they do not often cause symptoms that require medical care. Also not in question is that some people are especially susceptible to the complications.
No one, however, is truly immune. A case in point was the death two years ago of a healthy 27-year-old from a pulmonary embolism immediately after debarking in London from a flight from Australia. Former Vice President Dan Quayle developed pulmonary embolisms twice after long flights. Indeed, business travelers who fly frequently are among the most vulnerable.
A major problem in documenting the frequency of deep vein thrombosis related to air travel is that patients disperse rapidly after flights, and complications can occur days or even weeks later, with neither patients nor doctors necessarily linking it to earlier trips.

How Clots Can Occur
Deep vein thrombosis is different from thrombophlebitis, a swelling in a superficial vein, often with an accompanying clot. Although painful and needing prompt medical attention, thrombophlebitis is usually not life threatening.
D.V.T., in which a clot blocks a major vein, causes death in 1 percent of patients. It usually starts in the lower leg but sometimes can begin in the thigh or pelvis. If the clot breaks loose and travels to an artery that feeds the lungs, a resulting pulmonary embolism can shut off the blood supply to the lungs. Although most such clots begin to dissolve immediately, large ones can cause death in minutes or hours.
In a recent article in The Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, Dr. Daniel J. Brotman and Dr. Amir Jaffer noted that long plane trips clearly set the stage for the development of deep vein blood clots. Passengers are typically sitting immobile for long periods, when blood can pool in the veins of the legs.
Pooled blood moves slowly, increasing the risk of clot formation. Pressure from the seat against the back of the legs, particularly a problem for short people and those who are obese, may irritate the lining of the popliteal vein, which runs behind the knee and can be a factor in clot formation.
The problems can arise from long trips by car, train or bus. But in a plane, other factors kick in to make matters worse, said Dr. George Geroulakos, a vascular surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital in London.
The decreased air pressure in the cabin reduces the anticlotting ability of blood and may also relax the walls of the veins, further enhancing the pooling of blood, Dr. Geroulakos wrote last year in BMJ, a British medical journal.
In the low-pressure environment of airliners, factors that activate blood clotting may increase twofold to eightfold, he stated.
Dehydration, a chronic problem on long flights, adds to the problem. The dry air on planes; consuming alcohol, caffeine and salty snacks; and inadequate intake of hydrating fluids thicken the blood and increase its tendency to clot.
The chance of venous thrombosis is greater than average in people who are obese, as well as those who have recently had major surgery or trauma, especially hip or knee surgery; people with heart failure, poor circulation or a personal or family history of venous thrombosis; patients with current cancer; and women who are pregnant, recently had a baby or take oral contraceptives, estrogen or a modified estrogen like raloxifene (Evista) or tamoxifen.
Age also has a role. People over 50 face a greater risk than younger people. On long flights, as many as 10 percent of people with one or more such risk factors develop venous clots that can be detected in X-rays, the Cleveland doctors reported.
Clearly, the length of a trip is a big factor. Dr. Frederic Lapostolle of Bobigny, France, and colleagues studied all cases of pulmonary embolism that occurred on arrival at Charles de Gaulle Airport from November 1993 to December 2000. Fifty-six patients who required medical attention within an hour of a flight were identified among 135.3 million passengers. 
The study most likely underestimated the risk of D.V.T., because those who died on flights or developed it after leaving the airport were not included.
All who developed pulmonary embolisms had traveled at least 2,480 miles, about the distance between New York and Los Angeles.
One was a passenger who had traveled less than 3,107 miles. Four had flown 3,107 to 4,660 miles, and 51 had flown at least 4,660 miles. The risk of severe pulmonary embolism after flights longer than 6,214 miles was 400 times as great as it was for flights less than 3,107 miles.

Reducing Risk
Much can be done to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis resulting from long trips or prolonged confinement anywhere.
When making a reservation, request an aisle seat, which will allow you to get up easily and move about. Try to walk around as much as possible, preferably at least once a hour. If walking is not permitted, at least flex and stretch your leg muscles periodically.
Avoid dehydration by limiting the intake of alcohol, caffeine and extremely salty or sugary drinks and snacks.
Drink lots of plain water often. Eight ounces an hour is ideal (and that will probably force you to get up periodically to use the lavatory). The wise traveler will take along a large bottle of water.
If you have one or more risk factors for clot formation, consider wearing medically prescribed compression stockings on long trips. In at least one study, they protected fully against thrombosis, though they did cause a few cases of superficial phlebitis.
High-risk people may also be given a low-dose anticoagulant like low-molecular-weight heparin, although that has not been shown to be more effective than compression stockings.
Aspirin, however, is not recommended, because in one good study it provided no protection.

Looking to the Past to Project the End of Pax Americana

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
THE END OF THE AMERICAN ERA
U.S. Foreign Policy and the Geopolitics of the 21st Century
By Charles A. Kupchan
391 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
 The vision of the future set forth in Charles A. Kupchan's new book, "The End of the American Era," is a startling and often puzzling one: he predicts that a "decline of American hegemony will play itself out over this decade and the next," with the United States "losing interest in playing the role of global protector of last resort" and the European Union "becoming a new center of global power." 
 "The stability and order that devolve from American preponderance will gradually be replaced by renewed competition for primacy," he writes. "The unstoppable locomotive of globalization will run off its tracks as soon as Washington is no longer at the controls. Pax Americana is poised to give way to a much more unpredictable and dangerous global environment. And the chief threat will come not from the likes of Osama bin Laden, but from the return of traditional geopolitical rivalry." 
In these pages Mr. Kupchan -- a professor of international relations at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -- tries to articulate a hugely ambitious vision of global geopolitics; he not only aspires to chart America's role in the coming century, but also attempts to set forth a theory of historical change, ranging from the days of hunters and gatherers through the dawning of the digital era. He wants to assess the consequences of what he sees as post-cold-war complacency in American foreign policy and to promote his own brand of "liberal internationalism" that might guide the country toward "multilateral engagement through international institutions." 
"The End of the American Era" attests to a wide-ranging historical intelligence and a dedicated study of strategic issues. But while Mr. Kupchan has important and timely things to say about America's time-honored traditions of unilateralism and isolationism, weaknesses in his central thesis (and his tendency to subordinate empirical evidence to that thesis) are pointed up by developments that have taken place in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (dealt with in this book mainly in brief asides) and more pointedly in the last few months with the Bush administration's move against Iraq.
Mr. Kupchan dismissively contends that "the appropriate analogy for the battle against terrorism is the war on drugs or the effort to combat organized crime," and he worries that the events of last year will make it "even less likely that the United States will bring into focus more profound, even if more distant, threats to America's well-being." 
He also predicts that in the face of terrorist threats, America will "rein in its overseas commitments in an attempt to cordon itself off from such threats," that in the post-cold-war era, the United States "will no longer feel compelled to play the role of global guardian" and will instead pursue "a more diffident" foreign policy, predictions that fly in the face of President Bush's aggressive new doctrine of pre-emptive action, and his determination to go after Saddam Hussein.
At the same time the president's avowals that the United States will go it alone against Iraq if necessary underscore the relevance of the many discussions in this book about America's "long-standing aversion to multilateral institutions": its "unwillingness to compromise the freedom of unilateral initiative" and the possibly dangerous consequences of this stance. Mr. Kupchan reminds us of the Bush administration's decision to withdraw from both the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the International Criminal Court. He describes the resentment that such stands have engendered among our allies, and he suggests that such behavior could undermine the international institutions the country "worked so hard to put in place after World War II." 
"The United States may have the luxury of being headstrong," he writes, "while it still enjoys primacy; smaller states have little choice but to play along. But when America's dominance is less pronounced and other centers of power have the wherewithal to stand their ground, its unilateral impulse will serve only to guarantee the return of global geopolitical rivalry." 
In the course of this book Mr. Kupchan does a nimble job of exposing the obvious flaws in Francis Fukuyama's "End of History" argument: a willfully sunny thesis that sees democratic states coming together in a new era of peaceful global order. But he is considerably less adept at taking apart Samuel Huntington's theory that rancorous fault lines are bound to emerge between clashing civilizations, bluntly and improbably stating that "there is scant evidence to support the claim that other cultures will clash with the West." 
Mr. Kupchan's method throughout this book is to use historical analogies to shed light on contemporary problems: he draws comparisons between the unification of Germany and the emergence of the European Union, between the boom and bust of the 1920's and 30's, and current economic woes. The problem with this approach, however, is that it plays down enormous changes in the historical environment -- from the spread of democracy to advances in technology -- and it also lends itself to alarmist sentiments. 
For instance, in discussing the growing power of Europe and its growing estrangement from Washington, Mr. Kupchan ominously urges us to remember "the rapid demise" of the Roman empire, "after the founding of a second capital in Constantinople." 
Mr. Kupchan believes that "the United States cannot and should not resist the end of the American era," and he concludes this provocative but unconvincing book with the wildly broad assertion that the "end of the American era" will also mark "the end of the era that America has played such a large role in shaping -- the era of industrial capitalism, republican democracy and the nation-state." It's an assertion -- like much of the more speculative theorizing in this book -- that is not supported by the marshaling of persuasive evidence.

HEADLINE: The Heavy Cost Of Chronic Stress 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
In this season of bickering relatives and whining children, of overcrowded department stores and unwritten Christmas cards, it is instructive to consider the plight of the Pacific salmon.
 As the fish leap, flop and struggle upstream to spawn, their levels of cortisol, a potent stress hormone, surge, providing energy to fight the current. But the hormone also leads the salmon to stop eating. Their digestive tracts wither away. Their immune systems break down. And after laying their eggs, they die of exhaustion and infection, their bodies worn out by the journey. 
 Salmon cannot help being stressed out. They are programmed to die, their systems propelled into overdrive by evolutionary design. 
Humans, on the other hand, are usually subject to stresses of their own making, the chronic, primarily psychological, pressures of modern life. Yet they also suffer consequences when the body's biological mechanisms for handling stress go awry.
Prolonged or severe stress has been shown to weaken the immune system, strain the heart, damage memory cells in the brain and deposit fat at the waist rather than the hips and buttocks (a risk factor for heart disease, cancer and other illnesses), said Dr. Bruce S. McEwen, director of the neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Rockefeller University and the author of a new book, "The End of Stress as We Know It." Stress has been implicated in aging, depression, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, among other illnesses.
Researchers have known for many decades that physical stress takes a toll on the body. But only relatively recently have the profound effects of psychological stress on health been widely acknowledged. Two decades ago, many basic scientists scoffed at the notion that mental state could affect illness. The link between mind and body was considered murky territory, best left to psychiatrists.
But in the last decade, researchers have convincingly demonstrated that psychological stress can increase vulnerability to disease and have begun to understand how that might occur.
"If you would have said to me back in 1982 that stress could modulate how the immune system worked, I would have said, 'Forget about it,' " said Dr. Ronald Glaser, an immunologist at Ohio State University.
The more researchers have learned, the clearer it has become that stress may be a thread tying together many illnesses that were previously thought to be unrelated.
"What used to be thought of as pathways that led pretty explicitly to one particular disease outcome can now be seen as leading to a whole lot of different outcomes," said Dr. Robert M. Sapolsky, a professor of neurology at Stanford.
Central to this new understanding is a novel conception of stress, developed by Dr. McEwen, who has been studying the subject for more than three decades. According to his model, it is not stress per se that is harmful. Rather, the problems associated with stress result from a complicated interaction between the demands of the outside world and the body's capacity to manage potential threats. 
That capacity can be influenced by heredity and childhood experience; by diet, exercise and sleep patterns; by the presence or absence of close personal relationships; by income level and social status; and by the piling on of normal stresses to the point that they overload the system.
In moderate amounts, the scientists argue, stress can be benign, even beneficial, and most people are equipped to deal with it.
Preparing to give a speech, take a test or avoid a speeding car, the body undergoes an elaborate series of adjustments. Physiological processes essential in mobilizing a response -- the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the endocrine glands and brain regions involved in emotion and memory -- are recruited into action. Nonessential functions like reproduction and digestion are put off till later.
Adrenaline, and later cortisol, both stress hormones secreted by the adrenal glands, flood the body. Heart rate and blood pressure rise, respiration quickens, oxygen flows to the muscles, and immune cells prepare to rush to the site of an injury.
When the speech is delivered, the test taken or the car avoided, another complex set of adjustments calms things down, returning the body to normal.
This process of "equilibrium through change" is called allostasis, and it is essential for survival. But it was developed, Dr. McEwen and Dr. Sapolsky point out, for the dangers humans might have encountered in a typical day on the savannah, the sudden appearance of a lion, for example, or a temporary shortage of antelope meat.
Blaring car alarms, controlling bosses, two-career marriages, six-mile traffic jams and rude salesclerks were simply not part of the plan.
When stress persists for too long or becomes too severe, Dr. McEwen said, the normally protective mechanisms become overburdened, a condition that he refers to as allostatic load. The finely tuned feedback system is disrupted, and over time it runs amok, causing damage.
Work that Dr. McEwen and his colleagues have conducted with rats nicely illustrates this wear-and-tear effect. In the studies, the rats were placed in a small compartment, their movement restricted for six hours a day during their normal resting time. The first time the rats were restrained, Dr. McEwen said, their cortisol levels rose as their stress response moved into full gear. But after that, their cortisol production switched off earlier each day as they became accustomed to the restraint.
That might have been the end of the story. But the researchers also found that at 21 days, the rats began to show the effects of chronic stress. They grew anxious and aggressive. Their immune systems became slower to fight off invaders. Nerve cells in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory, atrophied. The production of new hippocampal neurons stopped.
Dr. Sheldon Cohen, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, has found that people respond much the same way. Among volunteers inoculated with a cold virus, those who reported life stresses that continued for more than one month like unemployment or family problems were more likely to develop colds than those who reported stress lasting less than a month. The longer the stress persisted, the greater the risk of illness.
Allostatic load is often made worse, Dr. McEwen said, by how people respond to stress, eating fatty foods, staying late at work, avoiding the treadmill or drinking to excess. "The fact is that we're now living in a world where our systems are not allowed a chance to rest, to go back to base line," he said. "They're being driven by excess calories, by inadequate sleep, by lack of exercise, by smoking, by isolation or frenzied competition."

The Chemistry
Shrinking Cells, Turned-Off Responses
Doctors sometimes dismiss stress-related complaints as "all in the patient's head." In a sense, they are right. The brain, specifically the amygdala, detects the first signs of danger, as demonstrated in now-classic studies by Dr. Joseph LeDoux of New York University. Other brain areas evaluate the threat's importance, decide how to respond and remember when and where the danger occurred, increasing the chances of avoiding it next time.
So it is not surprising that when the stress system is derailed, the brain is a target for damage. A decade of research has demonstrated that sustained stress and the resulting overproduction of cortisol can have chilling effects on the hippocampus, a horseshoe-shaped brain structure intimately involved in memory formation.
Scientists say they believe that the hippocampus plays an active role in registering not only events, but also their context, an important task in the face of danger. In stressful situations, the hippocampus also helps turn off the stress response after the threat has subsided.
But high levels of cortisol, studies have shown, can shrink nerve cells in the hippocampus and halt the creation of new hippocampal neurons. These changes are associated with aging and memory problems. Some evidence also links a smaller hippocampus with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and sexual abuse in childhood, though the meaning of this size difference is still being debated.
Like other hormones, cortisol normally rises and falls with daily rhythms, its production higher in the morning and lower in the evening. Prolonged or severe stress appears to disrupt the cycle. Chronically stressed people sometimes have higher base line cortisol levels and produce too much or too little of it at the wrong times.
One result, recent studies indicate, is that fat is deposited at the abdomen rather than the hips or the buttocks. One of cortisol's primary functions is to help mobilize energy in times of acute stress by releasing glucose into the blood. But when cortisol remains chronically elevated, it acts, along with high insulin levels, to send fat into storage at the waist. This makes sense if a famine looms. But it is bad news for anyone who wants to minimize the risk of heart disease, cancer and other illnesses.
Studies have shown that excess cortisol secretion in animals increases visceral fat. And Dr. Elissa S. Epel at the University of California at San Francisco has found that even in slender women, stress, cortisol and belly fat seem to go together.
The notion that being stressed makes people sick is a popular one, and most people subscribe to some version of it. Come down with the flu in the midst of a messy divorce or a frantic period at the office, and someone is bound to blame stress.
But it was not until the 1980's and early 90's that scientists began to discover the mechanisms that might lie behind the mind and body link. Investigators uncovered nerves that connect the brain with the spleen and thymus, organs important in immune responses, and they established that nerve cells could affect the activity of infection-fighting white blood cells.
Scientists also found that cytokines, proteins produced by immune cells, could influence brain processes. Among other things, the proteins appeared able to activate the second major phase of the stress response, the so-called hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or H.P.A., axis. In this chemical sequence, the hypothalamus, situated in the forebrain, dispatches chemical signals to the pituitary, which in turn secretes the stress hormone ACTH, prompting the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.
Much remains unknown about how the brain, the endocrine system and the immune system interact, and some of what is known is not well understood. For example, high levels of cortisol have long been known to shut off the production and action of cytokines, which initiate the immune response. At normal levels, cortisol can enhance immunity by increasing the production of inflammation-fighting cytokines. Yet in some cases, it seems, cortisol does not properly shut down the immune system under stress, allowing the continued production of cytokines that promote inflammation. These cytokines have been linked to heart disease, depression, stroke and other illnesses.
Still, scientists can watch stress hammer away at the immune system in the laboratory. Dr. Glaser of Ohio State and his wife, Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, found that small wounds took an average of nine days longer to heal in women who cared for patients with Alzheimer's disease than in women who were not under similar stress. In another study, arguments between husbands and wives were accompanied by increases in stress hormones and immunological changes over a 24-hour period.
Stress also seems to make people more likely to contract some infectious illnesses. Dr. Cohen of Carnegie Mellon has spent years inoculating intrepid volunteers with cold and influenza viruses, and his findings offer strong evidence that stressed people are more likely to become infected and had more severe symptoms after becoming ill. 
A direct link between stress and more serious diseases, however, has been more difficult to establish, Dr. Cohen said. Recent studies have provided increased support for the notion that stress contributes to heart disease, and researchers have tied psychological stress, directly or indirectly, to diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, severe depression and other mental disorders. But the influence of chronic stress on other diseases like cancer remains controversial. All the same, Dr. Cohen said, "The evidence that stress puts people at risk for disease is a lot better than it was 10 years ago."

The Risks
From an Early Start, Lifelong Effects
Why do some people seem more vulnerable to life's pressures than others? Personality and health habits play a role. And severe stress in early life appears to cast a long shadow.
Dr. Michael Meaney of McGill University and his colleagues have found that rat pups intensively licked and groomed by their mothers were bolder and secreted lower levels of the stress hormone ACTH in stressful situations than rats lacking such attention -- an equanimity that lasted throughout their lives. (Cuddled pups, the researchers found in another study, were also smarter than their neglected peers.)
In humans, physical and sexual abuse and other traumas in childhood have been associated with a more pronounced response to stress later in life. In one study, Dr. Charles Nemeroff, a psychiatrist at Emory University, and his colleagues found that women who were physically or sexually abused as children secreted more of two stress hormones in response to a mildly stressful situation than women who had not been abused.
Yet perhaps the best indicator of how people are likely to be affected by stress is their position in the social hierarchy. In subordinate male monkeys, for example, the stress of being servile to their alpha counterparts causes damage in the hippocampus. And dominant monkeys who are repeatedly moved from social group to social group, forcing them to constantly re-establish their position, also exhibit severe stress and are more likely to develop atherosclerosis, according to studies by Dr. Jay Kaplan of Wake Forest University School of Medicine.
Being low in the hierarchy also affects reproduction, presumably because evolution dictated that in times of stress, other factors were more pressing than procreation. In a recent study, Dr. Kaplan found that the constant low-level harassment by dominant female monkeys shut down reproductive function in subordinate females and built up fat deposits in their arteries.
It would be nice to think that humans are less chained to their social rankings. But alas, researchers have found this not to be the case. A wealth of studies shows that the risk for many diseases increases with every step down the socioeconomic scale, even when factors like smoking and access to health care are taken into account.
A real estate mogul living in a Park Avenue penthouse has a better health prognosis than the head of a small company in an upscale condo a few blocks away. And a renter in a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan will be a tier or two lower still in health expectations.
Even people's perceptions of their relative standings in society affect their disease risk. In one study, led by Dr. Nancy E. Adler, also at the University of California at San Francisco, women who placed themselves higher on the social ladder reported better physical health and had lower resting cortisol levels and less abdominal fat than women who placed themselves on lower rungs.
No matter what one's circumstances, of course, some stress in life is inevitable. But illness is not, Dr. McEwen said. A variety of strategies can help reduce disease risk.
Reaching for a gallon of ice cream to soothe the tension of a family argument is not one of them, however, nor is forgoing exercise in favor of curling up on the sofa for an eight-hour marathon of "Law and Order."
The best ways to cope, Dr. McEwen said, turn out to be the time-honored ones: eat sensibly, get plenty of sleep, exercise regularly, stop at one martini and stay away from cigarettes. "It's a matter of making choices in your life," he said.

F1) Chart: "A System Designed to Cope"The body's stress response is protective under moderate stress and short periods of intense stress. But the same system can cause damage and illness when subjected to long-term stress, either physical or psychological. REACTING TO STRESSIN THE BRAIN -- The stress response evolved as the body's way of identifying potential threats, deciding how to respond and remembering when and where the danger occurred. The hypothalamus directs the release of stress hormones from the adrenal glands. Adrenaline is released first. Cortisol follows, produced in response to prompting by ACTH, a stress hormone secreted by the pituitary. The brain also releases endorphins, pain killing hormones. THE AMYGDALA -- Sends nerve impulses, setting off fear and the fight or flight response and cementing memories of how and where the danger occurred. ADRENAL GLANDS -- Stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol are released. CIRCULATION -- Heart rate and blood pressure increase, sending oxygen to muscles. Blood vessels constrict to reduce bleeding; fibrinogen is released to speed up clotting. BREATHING -- Lungs take in more oxygen, which helps keep the brain alert. GIRDING FOR ACTIONStored glucose is tapped for energy along with fatty acids from stored fats. The immune system sends immune cells where they are needed to fight pathogens. DIVERTING RESOURCESSome body functions are put off: In acute stress, digestion is slowed; during severe or prolonged stress, the reproductive system is suppressed. HARMED BY STRESSChronic or severe stress overloads the stress system, disrupting its normal rhythms. Elevated cortisol levels can cause bone loss, increase abdominal fat, damage memory cells in the hippocampus or stop production of new hippocampal neurons and interfere with immune function. Too much adrenaline keeps blood pressure elevated and can damage vessels in heart and brain and lead to hardening of arteries. (Source: Dr. Bruce S. McEwen, Rockefeller University)

HEADLINE: At the Beauty Counter, Its Bait, Hook and Reel Them In 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
It was noontime last Thursday in the beauty department at Bergdorf Goodman, and Ken Wolf and Everett Lassman were parked in a corner, two hapless victims of the latest retail campaign to woo shoppers. "We're like prisoners of war," said Mr. Wolf, who owns a commodities brokerage firm in Florida, as he and Mr. Lassman, a stockbroker, waited for their wives to redeem their $25 gift cards that the store was handing to anyone who walked in the door.
 "I just got off the plane from Miami, and he just got off the plane from Paris," said Mr. Lassman, in a tone of Jean Shepherd wonderment. "And here we are." 
 Mr. Wolf added, "We took the Concorde so we could get here early."
And the funny thing was they had no idea, at noon, how crazy things would get. By 9 p.m., when the store closed and the waiters had passed the last of the cranberry vodka drinks, 10,000 people had streamed through the doors.
From where he sat, Mr. Wolf could see the beauty of the free gift card. He could see the women in furs lining up for eye creams and sea-kelp scrubs, women like Denise Kraft, a Manhattan homemaker, or Caron Gelineau, a law firm manager, who used her card to buy more than $100 of makeup.
Mr. Wolf could see that. Yet weighing everything on the bigger scales of life, he said, chuckling, "It only cost me $50,000 this week so I could come here and save $25."
These are tough times for the $37 billion beauty business, which has had to adopt more aggressive tactics to lure consumers into stores because of the economy and competition from mass merchants. "This has been the most highly promotional season I've seen in the business," said Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a cosmetics newsletter, noting that Macy's had recently offered shoppers 12-inch televisions for $15 with a $50 cosmetics purchase.
Sales of makeup and other beauty products account for 12 to 15 percent of a department store's total annual business, said Timra Carlson, president of NPD BeautyTrends, a market-tracking company, and a third of all perfume sales are rung up in December. "Last year was very difficult because of 9/11 and the recession," said Ms. Carlson, who predicted that total beauty sales will be down about 3 percent this year. 
It may be hard to fathom, as John Demsey, the president of M.A.C. Cosmetics, said, why "a woman in sable would spend $15 in cab fare to come to a store just to save $25." 
"I shop here all the time, but I'm here today because of the gift card," said Ms. Gelineau, buying Chanel makeup and Kiehl's skin-care products. Another shopper, who declined to give her name because she said she was skipping out of work, bought her favorite Origins shampoo. "Twenty-five dollars makes the difference," said the woman, who works in fashion. "Especially on cosmetics, because they're rarely on sale."
Indeed, cosmetics, which typically have a profit margin of about 40 percent -- or, somewhat less than those of accessories and clothing -- constitute one of the last bastions of full-priced retailing. Many stores and cosmetics makers routinely employ promotions, like a "gift with purchase" or a free consultation with a visiting makeup artist. At Barneys on Thursday, you could have a free facial. And at Bendel's, you could not only have a free facial but also a free manicure, a free eyebrow shaping and a free lip analysis to see what kind of personality you have, if you were still in doubt.
But a number of Bergdorf's competitors questioned whether the gift card promotion, which the store has offered on several occasions since last fall, isn't really a form of upscale discounting. "We try not to do those things," said Kate Oldham, divisional merchandising manager for cosmetics at Saks Fifth Avenue. "Our customers come to us for a reason -- for personalized service and the best of the best brands."
Ronald Frasch, the chief executive of Bergdorf's, said his customers are motivated by service, too. But because all stores in New York, a hub of cosmetics sales, are competing for customers, he said, retailers increasingly have to come up with more imaginative, and often more entertaining, ways to attract shoppers.
Although he declined to reveal what the gift card promotion cost the store, he said it has helped draw customers to the store's new basement-level beauty area. "It's been our best-performing area of the store," with sales up 50 percent over the last fiscal year, he said. "The biggest challenge to us was to take a high impulse-purchase business and make it a destination business." 
More significantly for Bergdorf's, the gift card promotions have allowed the store to capture more new names "for a relatively small investment," Mr. Frasch said.
There's something to be said for any promotion that creates an atmosphere of excitement, especially during the key selling weeks around the holidays -- though industry analysts are skeptical that this holiday season will provide the increase that stores have come to expect. "Of course, I buy more," said Kelly Fazio, who sells radio airtime, as she was having her makeup done at Bendel's. "You see other people buying, so you buy." And though companies like M.A.C. emphasize products rather than promotion, introducing new items every two weeks, a store appearance by its makeup artists can increase sales, Mr. Demsey said.
"It's really entertainment that has to ring the register now," said Ed Burstell, the general manager of Bendel's.
To that end, the crowd at Bergdorf's was having a good time, grabbing canapes as sales staff patted down women's cheeks. 
C. Z. Guest, the socialite and gardener, who can recall going to Bergdorf's when it had a custom salon, was selling her line of scented candles the other night. She is now a veteran of the new promotional wars. "You cannot believe what goes on here," Mrs. Guest said. "When I left the last time, I said to the doorman, 'Why is the revolving door on Fifth Avenue closed?' And he said, 'So many ladies got stuck.' "

HEADLINE: Bumpy Market Has Many Delaying Retirement, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Among workers 50 to 70 years old who said they lost money in the stock market in the last two years, about one in five said they had postponed retirement because of the losses, according to a survey released today.
 The stock market decline has had a "sobering effect" on older Americans, according to the study released by AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, with three-quarters of those who lost money in the market saying that their losses had altered their standard of living, work plans or expectations about retirement. 
 Seventy-seven percent of those surveyed said they had lost money in the stock market since 2000. While 54 percent said they had losses of less than 25 percent of the money in their accounts, 9 percent said their investments had fallen by more than 50 percent. 
"These dramatic findings reinforce our view that we need stronger investor and pension protections, as well as better financial education," said David Certner, AARP's director for federal affairs. 
This market volatility, Mr. Certner said, points to the need for a viable Social Security program, which "remains for most the only source of guaranteed, lifelong, inflation-protected income in retirement."
Nearly 30 percent of those who reported stock losses said they have either postponed retirement, returned to work, started to look for work or are considering one of these steps.
Of those who lost money in stocks and are still working, 21 percent said they had postponed retirement. Among this group postponing retirement, the survey found that more than 22 percent said they now expected to retire after reaching age 69; only 1 percent of these people said they had originally intended to work that long.
The survey, conducted by telephone from Nov. 15 through Dec. 5, involved interviews with 1,013 people aged 50 to 70 who said they owned stocks -- either as individual stocks, mutual funds or other types of investment accounts like a 401(k) or an individual retirement account. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.
Nearly 60 percent of the respondents said they had budgeted their money more carefully because of dwindling investments.
Indeed, more than 4 in 10 of those who said they had lost money in the market said they felt they would be less comfortable in retirement than they had previously expected, and 2 in 10 said they expected to have difficulty paying for health care and prescription drugs.
Millions of Americans entered the stock market in the last decade. The proportion of households that own stock directly or indirectly -- rose to 48.8 percent in 1998 from 40.4 percent in 1995 and 31.6 percent in 1989, according to the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Did the Wright Brothers Make a Bad Money Move?

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
"I'VE been on 180 flights so far this year," said Thom Nulty, who had just stepped off another one in Washington yesterday afternoon. "That means I've spent every other day on an airplane, including weekends," he said. 
 Mr. Nulty, 57, recently announced his retirement as president of Navigant International, the Denver-based travel-management company. A former executive with American and Continental airlines, Mr. Nulty has long been regarded as a prominent and always quotable figure in the business-travel industry. The fact that he is calling it quits -- to spend more time with his family, he says -- says something about the air travel industry as it nears the end of another bad year. 
 It says, in a sentiment echoed by industry executives, mileage kings and queens, flight attendants and pilots, that air travel simply isn't as much fun as it used to be.
The year nears its end with almost one-third of the domestic airline industry's capacity in bankruptcy, as represented by United Airlines' nearly 20 percent market share and US Airways' 10 percent share. 
An epoch, meanwhile, is commemorated today with the 99th anniversary and the start of the centennial commemoration of the first powered flight by the Wright Brothers in 1903.
It's an occasion for celebration, naturally, but also one that will prompt industry cynics to recall the wisecrack often made by the investor and lifelong aviation buff Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Buffett has joked that from the perspective of strictly financial-performance prudence, shooting down the Wright Brothers would have made more sense than encouraging them. In its 100 years, that is, the airline business has not made one nickel of profit over all.
I asked Mr. Nulty to reflect back on this year. What stands out?
"Other than the fact that one out of every three passengers is now riding around on an airplane owned by a company that's in the middle of bankruptcy reorganization, the most significant event, certainly for the travel trade, was that airline commissions actually did really go to zero this year," he said.
In corporate and leisure travel, travel agents big and large "have all converted to a fee-for-service business model, so that the commission reduction down to zero has really ended up being a price increase for customers," he said.
"The airlines, meanwhile, are doing everything they can to try and crank revenues up, and they're losing ground every step they take."
Any bright spots? Absolutely, said Mr. Nulty. Southwest Airlines has for years been an example of a low-cost airline that can prosper in the worst of times. But this year, a relatively recent start-up, JetBlue, and other longer-established discount airlines like Frontier Airlines have shown they can establish traction in both the leisure and business travel markets, he said.
Asked to define one thing that stands out among the numerous abominations, annoyances and other negatives surrounding air travel this year, business travelers themselves overwhelmingly put at the top of their lists the "use it or lose it" rule changes that airlines announced in September.
The rules, which make it more expensive to reuse a nonrefundable ticket if it isn't used for the original flight, were intended to penalize the large numbers of business travelers who abandoned top-dollar fully refundable business fares for nonrefundable advance purchase discount fares starting last year.
"The airlines seem to be determined to chase their best customers away," said Michael Sommer, a technology consultant in Jacksonville, Fla., who said he had two million frequent-flier miles on United Airlines alone.
Other frequent fliers cited a worrisome trend they see developing in the industry, as some major airlines have recently begun signaling that currently generous policies for awarding frequent-flier program status-level mileage might be tightened next year.
Typically, airlines award frequent-flier miles, which business travelers often value less for free trips than for their value toward qualifying for yearly status levels with benefits like free upgrades, based on the number of miles flown, period. Last week, however, Delta Air Lines said that next year, passengers who fly on the cheapest discount fares will earn a half-mile in status-level credit for each mile flown, while those flying the most expensive coach fares will earn a mile and a half.
Other airlines have not copied Delta's move so far. In fact, several have recently made it easier for customers to buy extra miles to add to their elite-status accounts, usually at about $25 for each 1,000 miles. But with fewer big planes being flown, and revenue squeezes worsening, many industry experts say that tighter restrictions are coming across the board next year on status miles and the availability of upgrades.
Mr. Sommer, meanwhile, does have one good year-end thought about an airline, United. A week ago, he boarded a plane and found on his seat a personalized letter -- "hand-signed and hand-typed, which I could tell because it had a typo in it," he said -- from the inflight service manager for United at Philadelphia International Airport.
"It was a note thanking me personally for being a valued customer," Mr. Sommer said. "O.K., big deal, a letter, right? But let me tell you, I'm going to remember next year that a United employee took the trouble to do that. It'll remind me that I've always considered United's inflight service, including its flight attendants, one notch above the rest."
We'll continue with this year-end review next week, and I hereby invite readers to send me their own comments on what was memorably good and what was memorably bad about business travel this year, in the air or on the ground.

On the Road appears each Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Saudi Idlers Attract Radicals and Worry Royals 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
At the Liwan tea and water pipe parlor on a rooftop near the airport here, young Saudi men, many of them unemployed, while away the evenings puffing fruit-laced tobacco, drinking sugary tea and wondering about their uncertain future.
 "Can you give me a job?" asks Khalid al-Harib within minutes of the arrival of a rare Western visitor. 
 Mr. Harib, 27, is wearing the elegant white robe with starched white collar that distinguishes Saudi men from the Egyptians, Syrians and Lebanese who work in the country. He explains that he cannot afford to get married, let alone move out of his parents' house. 
He is one of millions of economically distraught, educated young Saudis who form a restive core in this oil-rich land. Their idle presence represents a prime recruiting ground for radical Islamists and is a growing source of anxiety for the ruling royal family.
Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis, mostly middle-class young men who veered into religious extremism before becoming terrorists. 
"Unemployed young people could turn into a huge problem affecting our security," said Sultan bin Saleh, a prominent Saudi businessman, during an interview at his office in Riyadh. "You don't want to create this terrible war between the haves and the have-nots."
More than half of Saudi Arabia's estimated 16 million people are under 20. Their prospects are bleak: unemployment is 28 percent among 20- to 24-year-olds and at least 10 percent among 25- to 29-year-olds, according to estimates by Saudi American Bank.
Moreover, the economy is growing far more slowly than the population, which means young Saudis entering the work force each year outnumber the jobs being created.
Economic distress has already forced many poor Saudis into the arms of Islamic charities, something that Mr. Saleh said made him and his peers "fearful, because that invites other things."
Like religious-based charities elsewhere, conservative Islamic charities often carry a politically laced message, and for them it is sometimes anti-Western. The United States has charged that some of the charities provide financial support for terrorist organizations.
Many Westerners' impressions of Saudi Arabia were minted during the 1970's and early 1980's, when oil prices were high and wealthy Saudis traveled the world leaving hundred-dollar bills behind them like confetti. Almost any Saudi could get a piece of land and an $80,000 interest-free loan to build a home. The government even subsidized rice, sugar and cooking oil.
But all of that disappeared when oil prices collapsed nearly 20 years ago and today the fabled land of gold bathroom fixtures is filling up with young men and women who cannot find jobs.
Even for employed Saudis, salaries are half what they were during the country's heyday, or only a quarter if adjusted for inflation.
The government, which spends billions of dollars more than it earns each year trying to keep its increasingly twitchy population happy, is deeply in debt. It now owes almost as much as the entire country produces in a year.
Many Saudis worry that the wobbly economy, still reeling from the gulf war, in 1991, could worsen if a new war with Iraq removed Saddam Hussein from power and started Iraqi oil flowing freely again.
After being largely stanched for years by United Nation sanctions, Iraqi oil could drive global prices lower, shrinking Saudi government revenues -- three-quarters of which come from the sale of oil -- and crimping the government spending that supports many Saudis.
The kingdom's brief economic history traces an acute arc, from the Bedouin camel trade at the country's founding, in 1932, to the 1973 oil embargo, which sent oil prices soaring, to the oil price collapse in the mid-1980's that left the Saudi government with a mounting public debt.
The country squandered its few fat decades at the top of that curve importing the best of everything money could buy. Airports, seaports and shiny shopping malls proliferated, many of them ill-conceived opportunities for corruption. Kickbacks were part of the game.
But little was put into developing domestic industries or educating pampered youth. "We didn't prepare a horse to pull the beautiful golden carriage," Mr. Saleh said.
Companies turned instead to imported labor; today, Africans or Asians do most of the work and send their salaries home. By some estimates, Filipinos, Indians, Bangladeshis and other expatriates drain the kingdom of $16 billion each year.
Saudi businessmen, discouraged by the local economy and attracted by better prospects elsewhere, send still more money out of the country.
In a country steeped in fundamentalist Islam, there is little besides prayer to occupy idle minds. There are no movie theaters, bars or dance clubs, and flirting is technically forbidden. Young men with cars cruise the streets in a Middle Eastern equivalent of America's Midwestern teenagers. Many older men spend their evenings in water pipe parlors sharing a $2 bowl of tobacco.
Mr. Harib, a thinly bearded man with a fast-receding hairline, said he graduated more than a year ago with a bachelor's degree in business administration. The only work he has found is as a temporary secretary at a magazine published by the school.
The job pays 3,500 riyals a month, or about $930, which he says is barely enough to cover living expenses, let alone raise a family. He said he would take a lower-paying job if it had a future, but would not work for less than 3,000 riyals a month.
That is a problem in a country with no minimum wage and few immigration restrictions on educated Filipinos, Indians or Pakistanis who are willing to work for half as much.
"This country is full of job opportunities, but Saudis won't accept any kind of job," said Khaled al-Kourdi, a member of the government's advisory Supreme Economic Council.
"Who built my house?" he asked, waving a hand at the vaulted brick ceiling of his private den. "They were all foreigners. Young Saudis only want white-collar jobs."
Everyone agrees that the education system is partly to blame. English, for example, a key to employment in many industries, is taught in high school, but not as a serious subject, and powerful religious scholars have blocked a proposal to teach it at the elementary level. Universities, meanwhile, turn out plenty of graduates, but few emerge with skills relevant to the jobs at hand.
"We only graduate officers, but we need foot soldiers," Mr. Saleh said.
Alarmed at the rising unemployment, the royal family has begun demanding that employers hire more Saudis instead of relying exclusively on foreigners.
Under the "Saudization" plan, Saudi citizens must account for at least 30 percent of the employees at all companies with 20 or more workers by the end of this year. The percentage is supposed to increase by five points a year. The plan also reserves some industries exclusively for Saudis. By the middle of next year, for example, only Saudis will be allowed to drive taxis.
But many Saudi economists and businessmen argue that the program is a short-term patch for an economy that has never had a long-term development plan.
"Localizing jobs is different from job creation," says Hussein Shobokshi, a Jidda businessman.
With little more than 10,000 companies of that size employing fewer than 300,000 people, the plan will not begin to solve the problem unless it is extended to small businesses, which can ill afford hiring unwanted or unneeded employees.
The Shura Council, which advises the royal family, is considering a plan to tax the income of foreign workers. But few people advocate barring foreigners or implementing a minimum wage because without the cheap foreign sweat, the Saudi economy might stutter to a standstill.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Discounts Flow asHotels Vie for Corporate Clients

BYLINE:  By DREW LIMSKY

 BODY:
In negotiations with the big hotel chains for next year's rate packages, corporations are playing hardball -- and winning.
 Desperate for business in a buyer's market, many hotels are offering reductions of 1 percent to 5 percent from this year's rates -- sometimes without even being asked. And as the bargaining intensifies in the final weeks of 2002, they are throwing in all sorts of concessions, from providing free newspapers and breakfasts and even chauffeurs to waiving fees for health clubs and other amenities. 
 "Until last year, the preponderance of power was on the side of the hotels, but the balance has changed," said Bjorn Hanson, a PricewaterhouseCoopers analyst who tracks corporate lodging. "More and more are decreasing rates and eliminating phone and fax charges. It's unprecedented." 
The continuing downward pressure on room rates, which have now fallen two years in a row, is good news for businesses that are struggling their way out of lean economic times and are squeezing budgets for what is typically their No. 2 expense, business travel.
They are in no mood to be overly sympathetic to the hotels' financial plight, either. "Hotels expect corporations to feel sorry for them," said Clive Armitage, the director of purchasing for AstraZeneca, the Wilmington, Del., pharmaceutical giant, who oversees its negotiations with hotels. "But corporations have long memories, and know that they've been gouged when life was good for the hotel business."
Ruth Philpott, a manager for American Express who handles hotel negotiations for corporate clients, says she is seeing initial bids from hotels that are either flat or 1 to 5 percent lower than last year in the United States, and 15 to 25 percent lower in Latin America. 
"Hotels are pulling out all the stops," Ms. Philpott said. Her advice to corporations? "Understand your value in the marketplace and communicate that to the vendor."
Corporations apparently are doing that rather forcefully in the annual negotiating period known in the industry as R.F.P., for "request for proposal," that will draw to a close in January. "It's an extremely rigorous season, and much more competitive, as everyone is vying for a piece of 2003," said Katie Callahan-Giobbi, area director of sales and marketing for the five W hotels in New York City that are owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. 
Ms. Callahan-Giobbi declined to discuss rates. As for extras, she said, the W hotels would keep their $25 to $35 fee for a package of high-speed Internet access, a wired mousepad and free local and domestic phone calls, but would be flexible about waiving the $15 fitness-center fee and charges for breakfasts and dry-cleaning.
Daren Kingi, the marketing director of sales for New York City Marriott Hotels, says his main concern in dealing with "very aggressive" corporations is to keep rates high enough to protect employees' jobs. He says the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan has not laid off any workers since the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Corporations actually want us to reduce rates, but we're trying to stay in business and meet the needs of our employees," Mr. Kingi said. He said the Marriott is willing to negotiate Internet access and health club fees. And, he says, it is offering a bonus that other chains do not, giving guest-loyalty rewards points to business travelers in corporate-discounted rooms.
Besides demands for lower prices, another problem for many hotels is the move by corporations to switch at least some of their business to cheaper rivals. Tom McCabe, the global director for travel services at PerkinElmer Inc., a maker of electronics and laboratory equipment in Boston, says he is moving business from high-end to midrange properties so he can save his company $30 to $50 per room night.
And that is despite the low bids that hotels have come in with this year. "We hadn't even asked for them, but we're seeing cuts of $10 to $15 a night," he said. The chain that offers the lowest rate gets the most volume, he says.
Hotels have already given up on early check-out fees, the penalty for leaving before the agreed-upon checkout day, Mr. McCabe says, and he is also asking for free local calls and free breakfasts and for waivers of health club fees. But he does try to keep his "hardballing" in check, he says. "We want the hotel to be there next year and not go out of business," he said.
Many hotels are also surrendering in their annual battle with corporate clients over the so-called last-room- availability clause, or L.R.A. Much like seats on an airplane, hotel rooms get more expensive as they become more scarce, but corporations always try to get a commitment from hotels to keep rates at the contracted price until the last room in its class is sold out.
"In the past, it's been close to standard for a hotel to refuse to offer the L.R.A.," said Ms. Philpott of American Express. Now, however, she said, hotels are increasingly giving ground in that area.
It is not as though corporations do not care whether they stay on the good side of the hotels. They do, because they know the chains will probably be calling the shots once the economy rebounds. And one way to maintain their good will is to stick to their pledges to fill a given number of rooms per year in return for their rate discounts.
"The hotels take you to the cleaners when it comes to pricing, but on the other hand, I sympathize with them," said Mr. Armitage of AstraZeneca. He said he "understands their distrust" of corporations because so many companies renege on their commitments.
"They contract for 500 room- nights a year, come up with 200, and still expect the discount based on 500," he said. Because his company meets its obligations, he said, it is in a much better bargaining position than those who do not.
Peter Buchheit, the corporate travel manager for Black & Decker, a maker of power tools in Baltimore, says he believes that his company's reliability in filling the promised quota of rooms will help it negotiate reduced rates for next year.
Black & Decker, which puts up large numbers of its managers in cities like Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Los Angeles; and Chicago, where it has factories, and in China and Mexico, where it has subsidiaries, has tightened up its hotel policy, Mr. Buchheit says. It has cut its list of hotels so it can increase the number of room nights in each one and, thus, get better rates, he says, and it has instructed employees to stay in those hotels rather than straying to more expensive lodgings.
But saving money is not the only factor he considers, he says; he also tries to land the best rooms, including those farthest away from elevators and soda machines and, in hotels in the midst of renovations, those that have already been upgraded.
Not all hotels are feeling financial pain, and thus not all hotels feel the need to make major concessions. While hotel rates in New York City fell 7 percent in the second quarter of 2002 from a year earlier for corporate clients of American Express, the city may be rebounding: rates rose 5 percent from the first to the second quarter of 2002. Mr. Kingi, the marketing director, says the occupancy rate at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan has remained steady at more than 90 percent for the last two years, so he sees no reason to underbid. If there is a recession in New York City, he says, he has not felt it.
"You should have seen the lobby today," he said.

HEADLINE: Variations on the Family Car: Porsche Offering an S.U.V. 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HOFHEIM, Germany, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
When Joachim Groh invited 350 of his best customers to see Porsche's new sports utility vehicle at his dealership here last weekend, he was floored by the turnout.
 More than 700 people came, many of them families. Parents were delighted by the roomy luggage compartment and easy-to-install child seats, while their children played hide-and-seek among the 911 and Boxster sports cars. "I was running a kindergarten," Mr. Groh said with a pained smile. 
 Is Porsche, the German car known as testosterone on wheels -- driven by professional ballplayers, software tycoons and who-knows-how-many successful men in the midst of a midlife crisis -- finally settling down? 
The Cayenne, which made its debut in Germany this month and will go on sale in the United States in March, is the first family car ever designed by Porsche A.G. It is further proof of the triumph of S.U.V.'s, not just in America, where they account for more than half of all auto sales, but in Europe, where they are turning up more and more on narrow city streets.
It is also testimony to the power of women as auto customers, particularly in the United States, which Porsche says will be the Cayenne's prime market. Women's preferences, company officials say, were a critical factor in their decision in 1996 to build a sport utility vehicle rather than a station wagon or sedan.
"Women liked it the most of all the categories we tested," said Hans Riedel, executive vice president for sales and marketing. "We think they will object less when the old man says he wants to buy a Porsche." More than 85 percent of Porsche drivers are men. By producing a car that appeals to women as well as men, the company hopes to break out of its cozy, but confining niche as a maker of masculine sports cars. Porsche is mimicking bigger manufacturers like Toyota and DaimlerChrysler, the maker of Mercedes, which have competed across a broader range of automobile categories.
"Let's be honest, it's the first Porsche that actually makes sense to drive," the company's chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, said in an interview. "All our other cars are driven on the basis of emotion."
Porsche's appeal to female buyers carries risks. The last thing the Cayenne needs is to be tagged as a car for soccer moms, even if it has a 350-horsepower, V-8 engine, and a top speed of 150 miles an hour.
"The problem for S.U.V.'s is that they are becoming an alternative to minivans," said Paul Eisenstein, publisher of an Internet news service called the Car Connection.com. "If Porsche isn't careful, the Cayenne could be exposed as a very fast 'mom-mobile.' "
For all these reasons, the Cayenne (whose name is taken from the fiery herb, which Mr. Wiedeking grows in his garden) has been perhaps the most closely watched new car in Europe this year.
Critics say venturing beyond sports cars could dilute the purity of the Porsche name. They also complain about the car's design, which awkwardly transposes the low-slung headlights of the 911 to a much higher front end.
"I was skeptical, too, when I first saw the pictures," said Mr. Groh, whose dealership is in an affluent suburb of Frankfurt. "I thought it looked like an oversize station wagon. But the car does not have an aggressive feeling. It has an emotional feeling."
Porsche said it had already taken 25,000 orders for the Cayenne, the entire planned production for the first year. Mr. Groh, who sold his initial allotment of 60 vehicles on the first weekend of sales, thinks it may end up being the most popular Porsche since the iconic 911.
Yet, such advance orders do not guarantee that the Cayenne will be a hit. Porsche has a reservoir of loyal owners who were likely to buy its newest offering regardless of the reviews. Porsche will face brisk competition from BMW and Mercedes, which sell popular sport utility vehicles, as well as from Volkswagen and Volvo, which are rolling out their own S.U.V.'s.
Still, in designing a vehicle that is smaller, sleeker and less rugged than a typical American S.U.V., with family-friendly touches like the child seat, analysts say Porsche is aiming for the right audience.
"If you're not tapping female buyers, you're missing out on a huge part of the market," said Graeme Maxton, an analyst at Autopolis, a consulting firm in London.
Financially, the Cayenne is the biggest risk in Porsche's 54-year history. The company and its dealers have poured $1.5 billion into the project, upgrading their dealerships, engineering the vehicle from scratch and building a new assembly plant in the eastern German city of Leipzig.
To defray some of the cost, Porsche teamed up with Volkswagen. The Cayenne's frame is produced in a VW plant and shipped to Leipzig, where the wheels, suspension, drive train and engine are added.
Volkswagen uses the frame for its new S.U.V., known as the Touareg, which also just went on sale here. The Touareg is cheaper than the Cayenne ($38,000 versus $55,900 for the basic model of each) and has earned better reviews for its design, only adding to the challenge facing Porsche.
Some analysts question whether Porsche risks cheapening its name by yoking it to a mass-market manufacturer like Volkswagen. Executives at Porsche say that the engine, components and the design of the cars are utterly different. So, too, they think, will be the customers.
"It was a difficult decision, of course," said Wolfgang Durheimer, the director of research and development. "To be completely on your own would be the best course. But we thought it was a good solution to join forces in areas the customer cannot see or touch."
Considering the bottom line, it was also a necessity. With revenue of $4.87 billion in the 2002 fiscal year, Porsche is a minnow compared with whales like DaimlerChrysler or Ford. The company thought it could not afford to bear the entire cost of the project.
Part of that reticence stems from Porsche's near-death experience in 1993, when its brand became synonymous with crass, 1980's-style consumption, and the market for sports cars all but collapsed.
Porsche executives still talk about those days with a shiver in their voices. Among other things, it made the company zealous about controlling costs. It has also made the marketing executives vigilant about protecting the Porsche name, even as they extend it into new categories.
"At that time, Porsches were owned by people who wear gold chains," Mr. Riedel said. "It's not the fast money that is buying Porsches anymore. It's not the aspirers. It's the people who have arrived."
Mr. Riedel describes his typical customer as "an outperformer in his or her most productive years, with family obligations and transportation-intensive hobbies." Unlike the 911, with its comical backseat, the Cayenne can comfortably hold three children and golf clubs, and also tow a boat.
Despite the weak economy and stock market meltdown, Mr. Riedel figures there are 2.7 million Americans with a disposable income of $1 million or more a year. Selling 25,000 a year, he said, is a conservative objective.
All told, Porsche sold 54,234 sports cars in fiscal 2002, a decline of 0.6 percent from the previous year. The company offset the lower volume by selling a higher percentage of 911's, its most expensive model. That drove up its operating profit by nearly 40 percent, to $840 million.
Executives at Porsche insist they are not interested in increasing production for production's sake. But they are weighing a plan to introduce a fourth new model to complement the Cayenne, the 911 and the somewhat cheaper Boxster, which is intended as an entry-level Porsche.
For now, the company is pouring its energy into the Cayenne. Mr. Riedel has traveled relentlessly to promote the car with Porsche's 590 dealers, 450 of them in the United States. His pitch: the car is not so much a rival of the Ford Explorer as a muscle-bound cousin of the 911.
Along the way, Porsche has devised ready answers to the inevitable questions about Cayenne's odd-looking snout. The Boxster, it says, drew catcalls when it first appeared in 1996. Now, it is widely admired.
"This happens all the time with new Porsches," Mr. Wiedeking said with slight impatience. "A good design needs time to understand. To fall in love overnight is not always a good thing."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Gains 193 in Rebound From Two Weeks of Decline

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Bargain hunters yesterday bought up stocks discounted by two weeks of declines, sending the Dow Jones industrial average soaring more than 190 points. 
 "What we have is a rebound from Friday; the market is in a really oversold condition," said Peter Cardillo, president and chief strategist of Global Partner Securities Inc. 
 The Dow closed up 193.69 points, or 2.3 percent, at 8,627.40, more than wiping out Friday's loss of 104.69 points. The Dow ended last week down 2.5 percent, its second consecutive weekly decline. 
The broader market was also higher yesterday, coming after two consecutive losing weeks. The Nasdaq composite index rose 37.91 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,400.33, having lost 4.2 percent last week. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 20.92 points, or 2.4 percent, to 910.40, after last week's loss of 2.5 percent. 
Investors sold shares in the previous two weeks to take profits from two months of rallies, which were based on hopes that earnings and the economy would rebound in 2003. Analysts said optimism had overshadowed pessimism in the market. 
"Earnings are improving and consumer spending is hanging in there," said David G. Sowerby, the chief market analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company. 
"Capital spending is slowly beginning to accelerate," Mr. Sowerby said, and there is the feeling that "we will have a positive environment for the economy and corporate earnings and that stocks will respond favorably." 
Upgrades from brokerage firms also gave the market some of its lift yesterday.
CSX, the railroad company, rose $1.32, to $29.15, after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock. Delta Air Lines advanced 59 cents, to $12.75, after an upgrade from Credit Suisse First Boston. 
J. C. Penney rose $1.15, to $24.75, after saying that sales at stores open at least a year were ahead of projections for December. 
Wal-Mart Stores, the discount retailer, climbed $1.40, to $51.94, despite saying that it expects December sales at stores open at least a year to be at the low end of its forecast. It had expected growth of 3 percent to 5 percent. 
The technology sector enjoyed the biggest gains yesterday, in keeping with how it has fared throughout the market's fourth-quarter rallies. Analysts say that investors' preference for technology shares is a sign of how bullish they are feeling going into 2003. 
Technology shares that advanced yesterday included Dell Computer, up 93 cents, to $27.56, and Broadcom, up 88 cents, to $17.11. --------------------

Treasury Prices Drop
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury prices fell as stocks rose and a report showing an increase in New York manufacturing damped demand for fixed-rate government securities.
"There's a lot of talk about the economy gaining some footing in the new year, and that's putting pressure on Treasuries," said John Poole of Mellon Private Asset Management in Boston. 
Demand for Treasuries also dropped after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its manufacturing index for New York State rose to 10.6 this month from 9.7 in November.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32, to a price of 98 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.15 percent, from 4.07 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32, to 105 10/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.02 percent, from 4.95 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Kmart Studies List of Stores As Candidates For Closing 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Kmart executives have begun assessing the chain's 1,832 stores to decide which ones they may close, a company spokeswoman said yesterday. One retailing consultant said that the company may close as many as 598 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico.
 The company, which has said it wants to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy by July, closed 283 stores in March and laid off 22,000 workers. 
 In recent days, a list has been circulating among real estate brokers and others, said the retailing consultant, Burt Flickinger III. The list includes dozens of stores in fast-growing states like Texas, Florida and California, as well as in Midwestern states like Illinois, Ohio and Michigan, where Kmart has historically had a large following.
Another 28 stores in North Carolina are also on the list, including Kmarts in Concord and Greensboro, where Wal-Mart has recently opened large stores. Five Kmarts in Puerto Rico and four in Alaska are also on the list, Mr. Flickinger said.
"Wal-Mart is clearly winning in the Southern states and the Great Lakes region," he said. At the same time, he added, none of the Kmarts in Arkansas, where Wal-Mart has its headquarters, are expected to close, suggesting that Wal-Mart will have competition closer to home.
The Kmart spokeswoman, Lori McTavish, said the company did not plan to close "nearly that many stores." She said the list was not Kmart's total but confirmed that stores are being evaluated for various criteria as part of the giant discounter's reorganization.
"We have said that the process will be completed sometime in the new year," she said, adding that the criteria include sales growth, profitability, "the competitive environment" and performance during this year's holiday season. By the end of January, which is also the end of Kmart's fiscal year, the store evaluations will be finished, she said.
Before closing the 283 stores earlier this year, Kmart circulated a list of 327 stores, Mr. Flickinger said. James B. Adamson, Kmart's chief executive, has said the company plans to close as few stores as it can and still turn the business around.
Any store closings could affect Kmart's exclusive partners as well, which include Joe Boxer, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and the Walt Disney Company. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia signed a contract last year that calculates royalties paid to the company based on sales in Kmart stores. Fewer stores could mean a reduction in that income, although there is a guaranteed minimum payment. (A spokesman for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia said the company had no comment.)
Also yesterday, Kmart said that it was told that its stock would no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. After trading below $1 a share for more than a month, the company was told that it would be delisted, Ms. McTavish said. The delisting takes effect Thursday.
Kmart also filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an extension of the deadline for filing its latest quarterly report, Ms. McTavish said. "We just need some extra time," she said.

Mets Fans Should Be Very Grateful

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
FOR five aimless seasons, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays have been a franchise in search of a mission. Caught somewhere between contraction and mediocrity, they have been awaiting their destiny.
 Now it has happened. The Devil Rays have emerged as the kindly Samaritans who took in Rey Ordonez when the fans in Queens had seen quite enough of him. 
 Such are the new economics in baseball. The wealthy teams -- all four or five of them -- can afford to eat their mistakes by shipping both the mistake and a Humvee full of cash to a needy franchise somewhere in the hinterlands. 
The new labor agreement has not really closed the gap between rich and poor. The new luxury tax merely makes the handful of cable-enriched teams considerably more blase toward stalwarts like Tom Glavine, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Stanton, and totally cold-blooded toward overpriced millstones like Ordonez.
Addition by subtraction. Never has Branch Rickey's theory been more applicable than in the Mets' pruning of Ordonez. Who will play shortstop for the Mets on opening day while they are waiting for Jose Reyes to emerge? Doesn't matter. Somebody. Anybody but Rey. That's how bad it had gotten.
The Mets were willing to pony up $4.25 million of the $6.25 million salary Ordonez must earn next season, courtesy of a contract issued by Steve Phillips, who is still the general manager of the Mets. 
Ordonez was never worth that much money. A career .245 hitter with no power who cannot bunt is not worth $6.25 million, even if he is consistently brilliant like Ozzie Smith, which Ordonez was not. 
Most teams have one player like Ordonez, who makes fans groan even when the team is going well. Fans of the football Giants cover their eyes when Ron Dayne rumbles out to running back. Knicks fans ran Mark Jackson out of town the first time -- maybe at the cost of a future championship. 
Mets fans were all over Ordonez, even before he labeled them "stupid" at the end of last season. It was the other way around, actually. New York fans know their sports and do not tolerate knuckleheads or drugstore cowboys. 
The fans were on to Ordonez even before Phillips gave him that $6.25 million price tag and left Bobby Valentine to explain away the mental mistakes. (Valentine is no longer the manager; did I mention that?)
The lasting impression of Ordonez came during the 1999 playoffs, when the Mets lost the first three games of the National League Championship Series before carrying the Braves into extra innings in the sixth game. 
In the middle of it, Ordonez bungled what now seems like a dozen bunts. And at 31 last season, he was also an immature presence in the clubhouse. 
Basta. Enough. Now Lou Piniella can hector him in Spanish, and maybe it will work. Meanwhile, Ordonez at $2 million will be better than what the Devil Rays had at shortstop. In the current inequity of baseball, this is a trade that helps both teams. Now Phillips must unload a couple of two-time Mets like Roger Cedeno and Jeromy Burnitz.
The Mets managed to depress the skills of Alfonzo by putting him on the shuttle from third to second and back again. Then they let him walk, but the Giants were willing to pay $26 million for four years.
This is the way it works these days. Mindful of the new luxury tax for any payrolls over $117 million, the rich clubs cannot afford to be loyal to even their most loyal players. 
In one minor way, the labor market has been enlarged by a few more Japanese position players considering playing in North America, after the success of Ichiro Suzuki in Seattle. Hideki Matsui and Norihiro Nakamura might come at a relatively inexpensive price, given their eagerness to test themselves here. It's a fair, open market, but it does create problems for incumbents like Alfonzo. 
Stanton was much like Alfonzo, in that he lives in the area and did not want to leave. Insulted by the Yankees' tactics, he signed with the Mets yesterday for $9 million for three years. 
This gives the Mets four -- count 'em, four -- lefties who have been active in the players association: John Franco, Al Leiter, Glavine and Stanton. They could stage chapter meetings in the clubhouse.
The Mets will have a more mature clubhouse and a better team from this day forth. When Shea Stadium opens next spring, somebody ought to fly a banner honoring the Devil Rays.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Strife Pushes Crude Oil to $30 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Oil prices shot to their highest level in two months yesterday as traders grappled with the severity of reduced crude oil supplies caused by strikes in Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest oil exporter.
 The price of crude oil for January delivery rose $1.66, to $30.10 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, an increase of 5.8 percent. 
 It was the biggest single-day gain since January. Oil prices are now up more than 50 percent from those a year earlier. 
The strikes in Venezuela have been led in large part by the managers and white-collar workers at the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. Their walkout, which entered its seventh day yesterday, has brought the Venezuelan oil industry to a standstill, and exports have plummeted from about 2.7 million barrels a day to sporadic shipments of less than 500,000 barrels, estimated George Beranek, manager of market analysis at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group.
Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, accounting for 9 percent of its daily crude oil supply. Oil traders initially reacted with calm during the first 10 days or so of strikes and supply disruptions, convinced that the conflict between supporters and opponents of President Hugo Chavez would be resolved relatively quickly, as were strikes last spring. Instead, both sides have hardened their stances and the chances seem remote for a quick, peaceful resolution to the standoff that would start the oil flowing again, traders and industry analysts said.
"If both sides stick to their guns, it wouldn't be out of the question for the price of oil to get up to $35 by the end of the week," said John P. Kilduff, senior vice president for energy risk management at Fimat, the commodities trading arm of Societe Generale. "This is significant for U.S. supplies in particular. Really bad, in fact."
Consumers may see the effect of the price increases as early as the end of this week or the beginning of the next, traders and industry analysts predicted.
Venezuela is a major exporter of gasoline to the United States, and last week, prices at New York Harbor, a wholesale pricing point, had begun to rise.
Moreover, a large refinery that supplies gasoline to the United States, the Hovensa plant in St. Croix, V.I., announced last week that it would reduce output because of shortfalls in Venezuelan crude oil.
The Venezuelan shutdown comes at a time when stockpiles of crude oil and petroleum products are already low compared with last year's levels, thanks in great part to the export cuts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has made this year and to increased consumer demand.
Last week, OPEC, at a meeting in Vienna, said that its members would supply more crude oil to the market if the shutdown in Venezuela persisted. But traders and analysts pointed out that such a move would not immediately damp oil prices.
"OPEC has very small levels of excess production capacity outside the Persian Gulf," Mr. Beranek said, "and with the 40-plus days it takes for tankers to sail from there to here, it's not a source of short-term relief for the market."
Oil selling for $30 a barrel does not threaten a return to recession, economists said, but "it is certainly enough to forestall a more sustained recovery in the economy when the recovery is still very tepid," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Prices at $35 to $40 a barrel are much more of a threat, economists said. While that may seem far-fetched now, continuing conflict in Venezuela could combine with war in Iraq to disturb oil supplies so profoundly that even OPEC would lack the spare production capacity to make up for shortfalls, industry experts warned.
"Generally, I wouldn't be concerned if it were just Venezuela," said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. "But combine that with what's happening in the Middle East, and if you're not nervous, you're not paying attention."
Murmurs are already rising in the oil markets that perhaps the Bush administration should consider releasing oil from the nation's 598-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve if the Venezuelan shutdown continues. 
The Energy Department has already said it will allow oil companies that owe oil to the reserve in the near term to defer those deliveries until later in 2003 to keep more crude oil on the market.
"The S.P.R. is probably the only thing in the short-term that has so much oil so close by that it can get the oil into market quickly enough," Mr. Beranek said.

PERSON: Thomas Howard Kean 

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
Winning Pretty; Thomas Howard Kean

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The 1971 state elections left the New Jersey Assembly so evenly divided that neither party could muster a majority to elect a speaker. Then Thomas H. Kean went to work.
 Mr. Kean, a Republican, put together a deal with a handful of North Jersey Democrats who voted for him as speaker in return for rewards like committee chairmanships and money for staff members, which gave the editorial writers conniptions. But it worked. Not even 40 years old, and after only two terms in office, Mr. Kean had vaulted himself into the second most powerful position in the state. 
 Official Washington may wonder how a sweet-tempered, gap-toothed patrician like Mr. Kean, without a law degree or a background in investigations, is going to manage the tangle of blame-shifting and injured reputations involved in investigating the events leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks.
But to hear the people who worked with him in Trenton, Mr. Kean always plays to win, only with kid gloves.
"Watching him deal with the opposition, whether on legislation or some outside group, was absolutely fascinating," said Carl Golden, Mr. Kean's spokesman when he was governor from 1982 to 1990. "He would bring them into his office and work his charm on them, and they would leave thinking what he wanted was all their idea in the first place."
Thomas Howard Kean was born in New York City on April 21, 1935, into an old and wealthy New Jersey family, its fortune based on ownership of utilities, banking and real estate. His father was Robert Winthrop Kean, who had represented his northern New Jersey district in Congress for 20 years. Mr. Kean adopted the centrist Republicanism of his place and time, favoring spending on education and the environment and strongly supporting the civil rights movement. When, later in life, he wrote his political manifesto, he titled it, "The Politics of Inclusion."
Mr. Kean graduated from the St. Mark's School and Princeton and went to Columbia to get his master's in government. While at Columbia, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to run a summer camp for poor city children. After a brief teaching stint at St. Mark's, he moved to heavily Democratic Essex County and ran for the Assembly. 
He won five terms.
It was as speaker that Mr. Kean gave an illustration of his way of bringing balky problems to heel. New Jersey was trying to lure the New York Giants away from New York City, to a new stadium and sports complex to be built in the former hog-farming stretches of the Hackensack River meadowlands. But New York's banks, under pressure from Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and his brother David, who were loath to lose the team, balked at underwriting the bonds for the new stadium. At the same time, the insurance companies that were considering buying the bonds insisted that the stadium bonds be backed by the "full faith and credit" of the state. 
Mr. Kean considered the project too risky and refused to let the bonding legislation reach the floor, until, with his own ambitions for governor drawing into sharper focus, he finessed the issue and passed a bill vaguely pledging the "moral credit" of the state. That satisfied the insurance companies, and the Meadowlands sports complex, now with two New York football teams, has flourished.
Mr. Kean lost in the 1977 primary for governor but fought his way through a crowded primary field to win the nomination in 1981. He went on to beat James J. Florio, then a young congressman, by 1,797 votes, said to be the narrowest margin on record. 
As governor, Mr. Kean demonstrated that his Republicanism was more a matter of birth and tradition than of ideology. He pushed through higher subsidies for public education, making New Jersey's public school teachers the best-paid in the country. He signed new environmental legislation, including laws to protect the Jersey Shore from overdevelopment and pollution. The economy allowed Mr. Kean to cut taxes deeply, which pleased party conservatives. But he often crossed the Republican right, as well, as he defended abortion rights and supported the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. 
He created a famous tourism commercial featuring himself in some luminous shore setting and, in his cultivated purr, saying, "New Jersey and you: perfect together." The campaign was so effective that the phrase, or its variations, is still a part of the state's political dialogue.
He presided over a 24 percent increase in state employment, leaving future governors to struggle with the costs of his generous employment practices.
Mr. Kean won a second term in 1985 by nearly 70 percent, including 60 percent of the black vote.
As open-handed as he was with state spending, Mr. Kean had a reputation for being tight-fisted with his own money. People who worked with him swear, laughing, that Mr. Kean would dump his overcoat in the car trunk to avoid having to tip the coat-room attendant, or feign slumber when the car he was in rolled up to a tollbooth.
Although Republicans have begged him on any number of occasions to run for office again, Mr. Kean has spent his years out of state government as president of Drew University, where he has almost tripled the endowment and promoted a number of undergraduate programs, with an emphasis on foreign study. He served on several national commissions and travels frequently abroad, including twice to China with Henry Kissinger.

HEADLINE: Egypt-U.S. Relationship Is Strained by Iraq Crisis 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented a new program last week to build democratic institutions and fight poverty in Arab countries with $29 million in fresh annual aid, the reaction from Egypt was about as welcoming as a hot gust of wind in the desert.
 An article in Al Akhbar, the government-owned daily, dismissed the bid to improve America's image in the region, "given that it lacks honesty, justice and transparency." The article said the plan "confirmed the belief long upheld in the region of how Israel currently controls the decision-making process in the U.S." 
 Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher was somewhat more diplomatic, saying that "it does not touch on the basic problem which is the cause of the other problems, and that is the lack of a Middle East settlement." 
Egypt remains Washington's strongest ally in the Arab world, but the two countries appear exceptionally out of step at the very moment the Bush administration is preparing for a possible invasion of Iraq. 
President Hosni Mubarak has made his position clear for months that an attack on Iraq could let loose a virulently radical backlash across a region already incensed by the Israeli crackdown in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
That is not an unusual stance in the Arab world, but it comes in stark contrast to Egypt's position preparing for and fighting the first Persian Gulf war a little over a decade ago. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Egypt persuaded several Arab countries, including Syria, to join the American-led coalition and contributed 36,000 ground troops.
Egypt was handsomely rewarded for its role in the war, with Western creditors forgiving two-thirds of the nation's debt, which in turn led to an opening of the Egyptian economy, higher growth rates and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the mid-1990's.
The Egyptian economy -- now sputtering from a loss of tourism revenue and lower tolls on the Suez Canal, among other reasons -- could use another boost. But Egyptian officials say the prospect of increased Western help would not be worth the risk of going to war again.
Egypt strongly supports United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for Iraqi disarmament and vigorous examinations by weapons inspectors of suspected Iraqi armament plants. But Egypt has made it abundantly clear that it will not contribute troops or active military support to a second gulf war.
Officials here note that the Suez Canal remains open to American warships moving into the gulf, but they refused to pledge that Egyptian waters and air space will remain open to American military operations if a prolonged war produces a heated reaction against the United States and its allies in the region.
"There is a difference between then and now," said Nabil Osman, the government spokesman, "because then there was an Arab country invaded, occupied, swallowed and erased from the map overnight."
With a population of 70 million, Egypt remains the intellectual, cultural and political capital of the Arab world. As an ally of the United States that has received $2 billion in annual aid from Washington since it made peace with Israel in the 1970's, Egypt continues to be a bridge between the rest of the Arab world and the West.
It is a balancing act that is particularly delicate at this juncture.
Mr. Mubarak has not talked to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in more than a decade, according to his aides, but his emissaries helped persuade Mr. Hussein to allow the United Nations weapons inspectors back into his country. 
Now Egypt is pressing the United States to give the inspectors enough time to do their work, even if that puts off an attack indefinitely.
"If America wishes to keep its credibility in the area, an unjustified war should not be in the cards," Mr. Osman said in an interview. "The area is pregnant with tension. We have our hands full, and we don't need more tension. We feel a military strike could unleash violence and terrorism, which will definitely spill over beyond the area."
Mr. Osman said the first Bush administration had wisely tamped down regional passions by expressing an intention to address Palestinian aspirations.
Egyptian officials said Mr. Mubarak laid out a host of concerns in several meetings with the current President Bush this year, including fears that broad antipathy among Arabs about how Israel is dealing with the Palestinians would provide ample tinder for terrorists.
They also said they feared that any American invasion of Iraq would be a much more deadly and prolonged battle than the first gulf war, with possible reaction from the large Palestinian population in Jordan and from radical movements like Hezbollah, based in southern Lebanon.

HEADLINE: TUNNEL VISION; 
High Drama and Comic Relief: Diary Entries From a Transit Strike That Wasn't

BYLINE:  By Randy Kennedy

 BODY:
As high theater, even the most exciting political campaign has nothing on a bare-knuckled labor negotiation. Both events feature crucial issues, round-the-clock television coverage, expensive hotels, artificial suspense, mind games, posturing, rumors, evasions, exaggerations and outright lies. But campaigns generally do not hold out the dramatic possibility that tens of thousands of angry workers could leave their jobs a week before Christmas, paralyzing America's largest city and prompting its mayor to ride a bicycle to work.
 In the interest of fully chronicling the latest three-day performance of "The Trials and Tribulations of the Transit Contract," here is a highly subjective diary of happenings behind the curtains, in the cheap seats and at the stage door. 

SATURDAY, 10:05 P.M. After a day of quick, mostly cryptic statements, Gary Dellaverson, the chief negotiator for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, emerges from negotiations to say that progress has been made on "economics." For half an hour afterward, reporters debate whether he also used the words "pay raise" or "pay raises" before hurrying from the room.

SATURDAY, 10:20 P.M. People attending a hospital benefit honoring Andrew Farkas, a residential real-estate mogul, become confused and wander into the press area at the Grand Hyatt hotel looking for their coats. Some admit they have not taken a subway or a bus in years.
One woman in a sequin-spangled backless red dress stops and stares quizzically at a bank of 10 television cameras.
"Why is this press-worthy?" she asks. She is told that especially tense transit talks are going on upstairs.
"Oh, I thought you were here for this cockamamie benefit. Thank God."
Another woman, on her way out, asks, "Strike or no strike?"
Paul Fleuranges, the spokesman for New York City Transit, parries deftly with his own question, "Mink or chinchilla?"
The woman wrinkles her nose. "Chinchilla? Please."

SATURDAY, 11:05 P.M. After milling around in the hall to burn up five minutes, Ed Watt, the secretary-treasurer of the Transport Workers Union, Local 100, sweeps into the press room in shirt sleeves just as the television news reporters are beginning their live shots on the 11 o'clock news. They all break away for Mr. Watt's announcement, which is that as far as the union is concerned, nothing significant has happened.

SUNDAY, 10:15 P.M. After a poker game breaks up, photographers gather to take pictures of another photographer who is asleep on the floor of the hotel.

MONDAY, 12:01 A.M. The contract expires, but on the subway platform at Grand Central it is very hard to tell. A transit worker pushes a huge blue floor polisher over the tiles. Four police officers relax over a stair banister, like cowboys in a saloon. A teenage couple is making out nearby, and a man with blond dreadlocks is talking to himself.
On the uptown No. 4 train platform, Hensley Tappin, a taxi dispatcher, is reading a newspaper's sports pages and worrying because he just missed a train at midnight. "I figured if I was on that one, I'd be O.K.," said Mr. Tappin, who lives near Van Cortlandt Park. "Look around here," he said, surveying the nearly empty platforms. "Everyone cleared out early. Nobody wanted to get caught down here. I didn't want to, but I did."
At 12:06, a No. 4 train pulled in and he stepped aboard. "I think I'm going to be O.K.," he said.

MONDAY, 3:30 A.M. There is a flurry of activity as Tom Kelly, the chief M.T.A. spokesman, arrives at the lectern in the press room. He announces he is going to bed.

MONDAY, 8:30 A.M. Millie Mendez, a platform conductor at Times Square, reports that passengers entering the shuttle to Grand Central have been questioning her closely about the negotiations.
One man, a regular shuttle rider with thick-rimmed glasses, first asks her jovially, "Can you hail me a shuttle, Miss?"
Then he leans in close and asks in a knowing tone, "Is today going to be a good day?"
Ms. Mendez, a transit employee for 15 years, leans in and replies. "We're alive and kicking, ain't we? That's a good day."
The man walks off with a half-smile.
"They're all just happy to see me here today, working," Ms. Mendez says.

MONDAY, 2 P.M. Ken Sunshine, the union's public relations strategist, tells a reporter that he is leaving the negotiations to fly to Los Angeles for the premiere of "Gangs of New York," starring another of his clients, Leonardo DiCaprio.

MONDAY 7:25 P.M. Roger Toussaint, the union local's president, and Peter S. Kalikow, the M.T.A. chairman, looking less sleep-deprived than expected, arrive in the press room to announce the agreement. Mr. Kalikow says it feels as if he, Mr. Toussaint and Mr. Watt have been weekend roommates at the Grand Hyatt. "And I'm going to tell you that I don't miss going home tonight," Mr. Kalikow says.
Mr. Toussaint wishes New York a Merry Christmas and leaves the room.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Questions Need For a Waterfront TV Tower 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
Since late summer, two New Jersey cities, Bayonne and Jersey City, have been waging a public tug of war to become the site of a television tower to replace the antennae that toppled with the World Trade Center. But now a third party has weighed in, the state environmental commissioner, who is questioning the project's value for state residents, whatever the location.
 In a letter sent on Friday, the commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, directed a consortium of 11 New York television stations that want to build the tower to justify the choice of a site for the 2,000-foot, $200 million project, and to explain its benefits to the state. The consortium, the Metropolitan Television Alliance, has said it favors Bayonne. 
 Mr. Campbell told the group that the state wanted documentation that the tower would provide a "substantial public benefit" to New Jerseyans. He also wrote that the state wanted a public explanation of the merits of any site competing for the soaring tower.
"There is currently no record to support the conclusion that siting the proposed tower in New Jersey, let alone at a particular site in New Jersey, is a sound public policy choice," he wrote. News of his letter was reported yesterday by The Star-Ledger of Newark.
Mr. Campbell posed 14 questions about the proposed tower and its location, asking for answers by Jan. 8. He asked the alliance to compare its preferred site and any alternate sites on several grounds, including the tower's benefits to local and state residents, as well as environmental impact, engineering challenges, aesthetics, security and local support.
Alliance officials expressed surprise about the timing of the letter because talks with state officials have been under way since late summer. "We're going to respond to the state and lay out our criteria," said the group's president, Edward Grebow. 
The tower, which the alliance says would be the world's tallest free-standing structure and an instant tourist attraction, would replace the 360-foot television antennae mast once perched atop the north tower of the trade center.
Since 9/11, the alliance said, about 700,000 people without cable television in the metropolitan area, many elderly and poor, have been denied quality reception of noncable stations.
Initially, the alliance wanted to build in New York City, on Governors Island or in Long Island City. But when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rejected both proposals, the alliance turned to New Jersey -- specifically to Hudson County, because it satisfied a federal requirement that the new tower be within 3.2 miles of the trade center.
That touched off a squabble in a county known for generations for its squabbles. Jersey City proposed a site in Liberty State Park, near the Liberty Science Center. Bayonne proposed the tip of a 430-acre peninsula that was once home to a military shipping and storage installation, the Military Ocean Terminal. Bayonne is planning to turn the peninsula into a major new shipping port and hub of offices, homes and commerce, and says the structure would become a catalyst for the renovation.
Bayonne has an important ally in its quest for the tower: United States Representative Robert Menendez, who is arguably the most powerful and prominent politician in Hudson County. He said Bayonne's site was superior to Jersey City's because the tower would be a key element in a major economic revitalization project. He also said the Bayonne site, unlike Jersey City's, did not require a cleanup of environmental contamination and was farther from highways and thus more secure.
Mr. Grebow, of the television alliance, said the group favored Bayonne for some of the same reasons cited by Mr. Menendez. In addition, he said, the Jersey City site was too small, was privately owned, and was too expensive. He also said Jersey City wanted an observation deck on the tower for sightseers, which, he said, would require restrooms and probably a restaurant.
"The state would have to subsidize a deck," he said. "We're not prepared to do that."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Limits Sought On Net Access Without Wire

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The Defense Department, arguing that an increasingly popular form of wireless Internet access could interfere with military radar, is seeking new limits on the technology, which is seen as a rare bright spot for the communications industry. 
 Industry executives, including representatives from Microsoft and Intel, met last week with Defense Department officials to try to stave off that effort, which includes a government proposal now before the global overseer of radio frequencies. 
 The military officials say the technical restrictions they are seeking are necessary for national security. Industry executives, however, say they would threaten expansion of technology like the so-called WiFi systems being used for wireless Internet in American airports, coffee shops, homes and offices. 
WiFi use is increasingly heavy in major American metropolitan areas, and similar systems are becoming popular in Europe and Asia. As the technology is installed in millions of portable computers and in antennas in many areas, industry executives acknowledge that high-speed wireless Internet access will soon crowd the radio frequencies used by the military. But industry executives say new types of frequency spectrum sharing techniques could keep civilian users from interfering with radar systems.
The debate, which involves low-power radio emissions that the Defense Department says may jam as many as 10 types of radar systems in use by United States military forces, presents a thorny policy issue for the Bush administration. 
Even as the armed forces monitor United States air space for signs of military or terrorist attacks and gear up for a possible war with Iraq, the nation's technology companies hope that the popularity of wireless Internet access will help pull their industry out of its two-year slump. New limits on that technology could help undermine the economic recovery on which the administration is also pinning its hopes.
"Nobody, including the Pentagon, doubts that this is important for consumers and industry," said Steven Price, deputy assistant secretary of defense for radio spectrum matters. "The problem comes when it degrades our military capabilities." 
So far, though, there have been no reports of civilian wireless Internet use interfering with military radar, Edmond Thomas, chief of the office of engineering and technology for the Federal Communications Commission, said.
Industry executives say that military uses can coexist with the millions of smart wireless Internet devices that can sense the nearby use of military radar and automatically yield the right of way. These devices are in use in Europe and will soon be used in the United States.
But Pentagon officials say that the new digital technologies are unproven and could interfere with various types of military radar systems, whether ones used for tracking storms, monitoring aircraft or guiding missiles and other weapons.
The Pentagon wants regulators to delay consideration of opening an additional swath of radio frequencies in the 5-gigahertz band that is eagerly sought by American technology companies and is already in civilian use internationally. 
In this country, industry executives and some members of Congress see new spectrum-sharing technologies as a way to jump-start innovation and commerce. Last month, for example, Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California, and her Republican colleague Senator George Allen of Virginia, said that they would introduce a bill in the next session of Congress to expand the radio spectrum available for wireless Internet use.
The military-industry debate also involves the merits of a technical standard known as dynamic frequency selection, which is being used by advanced wireless Internet radios overseas to avoid interference.
Military officials are asking the American industry, and companies in other countries, to create and install even more sensitive versions of dynamic frequency selection -- something that the companies say may cause the technology to operate incorrectly. American executives say that the military's demands may also curtail the capacity of wireless Internet services and could even force a complicated redesign of millions of computer communications systems already in place or nearly ready for shipment.
An estimated 16 million WiFi-enabled computers and other devices are already in use in this country and overseas. And in the coming year, Intel plans to put currently designed WiFi technology on all of the microprocessor chips it ships for tens of millions of desktop, laptop and hand-held computing devices. 
"This is a hugely important issue to Intel," said Peter Pitsch, Intel's communications policy director in Washington. "I'm hopeful at the end of the day, the U. S. government will accept a reasonable compromise." 
The dispute may also foreshadow a coming battle over the airwaves as traditional broadcasters and communications businesses like cellular companies confront a dazzling array of new digital communications technologies that can potentially use the spectrum far more efficiently by permitting it to be shared by different types of users. 
The roots of the dispute lie in an effort that began during the Clinton administration and which has continued at the Federal Communications Commission under the current administration, to permit civilian use of portions of the airwaves without licenses.
"The unlicensed spectrum is a hot-bed of entrepreneurial activity and one of the few bright spots in our high-tech economy," said Tom Kalil, the former deputy director of President Bill Clinton's National Economic Council and an early advocate of unlicensed spectrum of radio frequencies. The Bush administration, he said, "should be trying to increase the amount of spectrum for unlicensed devices, as opposed to imposing new, retroactive restrictions right as the market is taking off."
Earlier this month, the United States presented the Pentagon position at an international technical meeting in Geneva of the World Administrative Radio Conference, the body that oversees radio frequency allocations and standards.
European governments hotly disputed the United States position at the meeting, but it was nonetheless included as a footnote in the planning document that resulted. The issues will be confronted directly, and perhaps decided, in June at the World Administrative Radio Conference in Geneva. 
Industry officials said that the Defense Department position had little chance of gaining international support. As a consequence, they said, the existing radio bands would probably become more congested, and the Pentagon would face even more sources of interference internationally.
There is a need for global coordination, executives acknowledge, but they say the Defense Department is going about it the wrong way.
"The idea is to get the world on a single page, and Europe is way ahead of the U. S. in understanding these interference issues," said Rich Redelfs, president and chief executive of Atheros, a Silicon Valley maker of chips used for WiFi systems.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the Pentagon's efforts to limit the expansion of the so-called WiFi technology, which permits wireless access to the Internet, referred incorrectly to an effort by Intel to use it. The company is incorporating WiFi into chips that would be used alongside microprocessors -- not into the microprocessors themselves. Intel plans to add WiFi to chips for portable computing devices only, not for desktop computers.

Israeli's West Bank Wall And the Images It Evokes
With a West Bank wall, Israel is seeking to create a physical separation between Israelis and Palestinians as stark as the social one between them has become. From the Palestinian side, the wall looks like a land grab, as clear and pure as hate. But from the Israeli side, its meaning is more layered. The wall represents a tortured compromise with the politics, values and history of Israeli Jews. With conflicting views, the wall is developing as an uneasy hybrid. A1

Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip shot and killed three Palestinians. Two of the dead men were later found to have been carrying a large bomb, the Israeli military said. The militant group Hamas said the men were part of their organization. A16

Venezuela's Battlefield
A vanguard of white-collar rebels have vowed to remain true to a national strike that has paralyzed oil exports from the world's fifth-largest supplier, now in its 15th day, and severely debilitated the oil industry. Coupled with the threat of war in Iraq, the strike has driven up world oil prices to a two-month high. A15

White House: No Lying
The White House distanced itself from a proposed secret Pentagon directive that would authorize the military to carry out covert operations to influence public opinion and policy makers in friendly and neutral countries. Spokesman Ari Fleischer said that President Bush would not approve of anything that involved lying. A17

U.S. Pressure on Japan
The United States won a commitment from Japan to continue taking a hard line toward North Korea that would bar any bargaining or talk of economic incentives until the government in Pyongyang agrees to shut down its nuclear weapons program. A17

Egypt and U.S. Out of Step
Egypt remains Washington's strongest ally in the Arab world, but the two countries appear exceptionally out of step at the very moment when the Bush administration is preparing for a possible invasion of Iraq. Egypt's position is in stark contrast to its support for the gulf war in 1991. A16

Wiesel Speaks at Serb's Trial
Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace laureate who survived Nazi death camps, testified at a sentencing hearing for a former Bosnian Serb leader before a United Nations war crimes tribunal. He urged strong punishment and said the sentence the tribunal imposed would set a standard for centuries. A10

Test of Rights in Russia
Two forensic psychiatrists testified that a Russian Army colonel was insane when he strangled an 18-year-old Chechen woman nearly three years ago, appearing to pave the way for his acquittal. The trial has become a yardstick for Russia's ability or willingness to control rights abuses by its military. A5

Republicans Say Lott Has Lost Bush's Support
Republicans with close ties to the administration say that Senator Trent Lott has no chance of survival and that the White House wants him out as majority leader. President Bush, they said, would not intervene to save, but neither would he take any overt actions that would be seen as forcing him from his position. Republican Senators were planning to meet on Jan. 6 to decide Mr. Lott's future in the Senate. A1

Senator Lott appeared on Black Entertainment Television in yet another appeal for forgiveness, but behind the scenes fury has been building among black Republicans who feel he has significantly damaged their standing in the party and among African Americans. A31

Kean to Lead 9/11 Inquiry
President Bush named Thomas H. Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, to replace Henry A. Kissinger as chairman of an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. A21

HEADLINE: City Ranks Among Safest On Crime Rate 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Since he took office in January, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has repeatedly called New York the safest big city in America. Now, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided mathematical confirmation of that.
 Statistics released yesterday by the F.B.I showed that New York's overall crime rate is the lowest among the 25 largest cities in the United States. It is last in forcible rape, burglary, larceny and auto theft and near the bottom in murder, robbery and aggravated assault, according to a police analysis of the federal statistics. 
 While total violent crime and property crime reported to law enforcement agencies across the country during the first six months of this year increased by 1.3 percent compared with the same period last year, reported crime in New York during that period dropped by 6.5 percent, the figures show -- one of the sharpest declines on record.
And while that trend is not new, the numbers released yesterday laid bare a significant byproduct of the city's prolonged bucking of the national crime trend: New York has also dropped far below a number of much smaller cities in the crime rate per 100,000 residents. In terms of its crime rate per 100,000 people, New York City (population 8,023,018) is now ranked 197th of 216 cities with at least 100,000 residents. It is set squarely between Provo, Utah, (population 106,891) and Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., (130,117), the police analysis of the federal statistics shows.
Regarding murder, often considered the bellwether crime, the point is stark. New York is now ranked 107th among the largest American cities, with 270 murders, or a rate of 3.4 murders per 100,000 people, in the first six months of 2002, the numbers show. That is less than most big cities, like New Orleans (ranked second, with 114 murders or 23.5 per 100,000 people) and smaller places, like Spokane, Wash. (ranked 81st, with 9 murders or 4.5 per 100,000 people), the figures show.
Amid a bleak economy and anxiety about terrorism, an increase in homelessness and a brief threat of a transit strike, the new figures provided a sliver of good news. A challenge now, criminologists and officials in New York said, is maintaining the historic crime reductions, especially at a time when Mr. Kelly has had to divert resources to preventing possible terrorist attacks and has been forced to deal with budget cuts that, combined with attrition, have reduced the force to about 38,000 officers from its peak of 40,800 in 2000.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Kelly said he was not surprised by the news, which he called "terrific." Mr. Kelly and law enforcement experts say that the decline of crime in the city is a product of a sustained investment in the number of police officers that the city undertook more than a decade ago, and the department's continued effort to map crimes, hold commanders accountable and focus on quality-of-life violations.
Mr. Kelly said he believed that the drop in the city's crime rate was even more substantial in the second half of this year, as a result of aggressive policing. He said he would continue to work in innovative ways to ensure that crime drops even further in the days ahead, in part by continuing to focus on recidivists and the so-called worst-of-the-worst criminals, and by maintaining a robust antinarcotics effort and continuing to be successful in getting guns off the streets.
"You have to strive to drive it lower," Mr. Kelly said of the crime rate. "You can never rest and accept a number as a floor. You have to do everything you can, with the resources you have available, to continue to drive it down."
Outside analysts said it would be a feat to hold the crime rate steady in the face of a decaying national economy, a local budget deficit and other factors considered outside the Police Department's control.
"The economy continually tanking, and unemployment rates increasing, cannot be a good thing in terms of crime, and it is one of the things, obviously, that police can't control," said Michael P. Jacobson, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
Thomas A. Reppetto, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said the numbers proved that New York had been successful in driving crime down. The challenge gets harder as the numbers get lower, he said, though he added that the city would continue to see declines if the Police Department could maintain enough resources to actively patrol the streets rather than just responding to 911 calls.
F.B.I. statistics released in October for the 2001 calendar year showed that crime rose nationwide for the first time since 1991, and yesterday's numbers showed that trend continuing, with homicides up 2.3 percent, compared with the first half of last year.
The latest numbers showed that violent crimes dropped 1.7 percent nationally. But that decrease was more than offset by a greater number of property crimes,which contributed to the overall increase. Crime increased in large cities and the suburbs, but fell in rural areas and in small towns, according to the numbers, and crime increased in the West and South but decreased in the Northeast and Midwest.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SETTLEMENT: THE IMPACT; 
The Walkout Was Averted, but the Talk Wasn't Cheap

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
It turned out to be only a phantom transit strike, but the walkout-that-wasn't cost New York's economy millions of very real dollars.
 Westchester County, home to 115,000 commuters, spent $17,650 to rent lights and set up special park-and-ride locations. New York Waterway, the ferry company, spent $400,000 on, among other things, renting 31 private boats to supplement its normal fleet. 
 And St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital spent almost $10,000 on 250 cots for employees who feared they wouldn't be able to get to work. 
Calculating the ultimate economic effects of the almost-strike will take time -- if it is possible at all. But all the contingency plans were clearly costly, whether they involved the $50 one couple paid their baby sitter to spend the night to the $5 million that the city government says it spent developing plans to cope with a commuting crisis. And that does not include the mayor's new $663 bike.
Companies and concerned commuters spent a lot of money on hotel rooms, which was bad for them but good for the hospitality business. All of the rooms were sold out at three local Marriotts -- in the financial district, Brooklyn and Jersey City -- which normally would have been about 80 percent full, said Kathleen Duffy, a Marriott spokeswoman.
But some tourists canceled their reservations for the Marriott in Times Square, she said, because "they didn't know if they would be able to move around the city once they got here."
Buses were a big expense. Companies rented out almost everything within the region with wheels (the Clearing House, an association owned by big banks, hired 55 all by itself). Elaine Brennan, senior vice president for operations at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said the hospital paid about $12,000 to rent three 47-passenger buses and a half dozen smaller vans that would have been used to pick up employees and patients.
Planning was elaborate, and not just in New York City. In Jersey City, where Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham expressed concern that the city's streets would be clogged with commuters' (illegally parked) cars, some 200 extra police officers were alerted to be ready for overtime, as were all of the city's 10 approved, private towing companies.
Jersey City, the site of PATH stations, ferry piers and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, is already feeling rather overrun.
"We aren't saying that those who come here have to turn around and go home," Stan H. Eason, a spokesman for the mayor said yesterday before the tentative deal was reached. But, he added, the city was prepared to reroute drivers. 
Parents spent hours trying to find child care in case their baby sitters couldn't get to work (ChildrenFirst, which offers backup child care for companies, said reservations at its Rockefeller Center location doubled this week). Colleges and universities spent hours finding ways for their students to take their final exams.
And all that time counts as a cost, too, economists say, as does all the time people spent planning and complaining and watching news of the negotiations on NY1. In fact, a back-of-the-envelope calculation using employment and pay data for the city works out to $68 million, "if everyone who works in New York City spent one hour of time dealing with this," said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
For Robert Kelley, an analyst with Mercer Management Consulting, the cost was measured mostly in exhaustion. To make sure he got on a 6:30 a.m. flight to Nashville on Monday morning, Mr. Kelley got up at 4 a.m., and agreed to pay a car service double the usual fare. 
"Everyone was preparing for what essentially would be a siege," he said, adding that he spent yesterday's ride to the airport wishing he had gotten the extra sleep.
Some groups said they didn't have to spend much at all to get ready for a strike. "We're prepared to do this," said Abigail Adams, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, which had planned to have 10 emergency response vehicles stationed around Manhattan as well as one in each of the other boroughs.
And the Port Authority's plans were limited to things like adding pickup lines for the taxis. "That's like throwing an orange cone out there," said a spokesman, Steve Coleman.
In addition to questions about costs, there are also questions about who exactly will foot the bills. The Visiting Nurse Service of New York required home health aides for 201 of the 24,000 patients it serves in New York City and Nassau County to stay on after their shifts ended on Sunday. They ended up spending the night in the patients' homes rather than risk not being able to get there the following day, said Lyle Churchill, vice president for marketing and development, adding, "I don't know who's going to pay for that."

GOODYEAR TO LAY OFF 460 WORKERS AT TENNESSEE PLANT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company will lay off 460 workers and scale back shifts at a Tennessee factory after its sales declined last month. The layoffs, covering 12 percent of the 3,800 employees at a plant in Union City, Tenn., will start Jan. 20, a spokesman, Clint Smith, said. Goodyear's October sales of replacement tires for cars and light trucks fell less than the industry's 4 percent slide, while sales directly to automakers failed to keep pace with the industry's 12 percent gain.

ICT, A CALL CENTER OPERATOR, PLANS TO CUT JOBS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The ICT Group, an operator of call centers for large companies, said yesterday that it planned to lay off workers and expected a fourth-quarter loss of 46 cents to 59 cents a share. The company did not say how many jobs it would cut. 
It will close some call centers in the United States and Europe, moving operations to places with lower labor costs like the Philippines, ICT said. In October, the company forecast net income of 27 cents to 29 cents a share for the quarter. Demand for capacity, which ICT expanded after sales picked up at the beginning of the quarter, slowed in the second half of November, the company said. Stock in ICT, which is based in Newtown, Pa., fell $3.69, to $10.15 a share.

MetroStars' Goalie Eyes Big Contract Extension

BYLINE:  By JACK BELL

 BODY:
TIM HOWARD of the MetroStars is close to signing a contract extension with Major League Soccer that would make him the league's highest-paid goalkeeper.
 "The league has been good to me, but nothing has been finalized and it may go down to the last minute," Howard, 23, said. "There's no guarantee I'm going to sign. Right now, my No. 1 priority is to be in goal for the U.S. in 2006 in Germany." 
 Howard, a native of North Brunswick, N.J., has one year left on his current M.L.S. contract and is looking to supplant Kansas City's TONY MEOLA as the best-paid keeper in the league. Meola makes about $250,000, people familiar with the league's salary structure said. Howard has had nibbles from overseas -- he recently trained in the Netherlands with Feyenoord -- and has made no secret of his desire to prove himself in Europe, particularly in England.
 "England fits my style; it's the best league in the world," he said. "I'm an athletic keeper. I can kick, make saves and grab crosses. It sounds simple."
 What will make it simpler for Howard to play in Europe is the Hungarian passport he will soon carry. (His mother is from Hungary.) It would make him eligible to play in any European Union country without first obtaining a work permit; Hungary is scheduled to become an E.U. member in 2004.
 Howard played in 27 matches last season for the underachieving MetroStars and had a 1.61 goals against average playing behind a shaky defense. As a young American, he has been perfect for M.L.S.: an inexpensive talent who is also a good citizen.
 "The league has evolved, and now there's more of a feeling that we should be giving better salaries to our young Americans and try to keep them here," Trey Fitz-Gerald, a league spokesman, said. "If we take care of them, they will be more inclined to stay."
 And Howard is savvy enough to know that he has to play regularly to stay in the plans of Coach BRUCE ARENA for the 2006 World Cup. He will have stiff competition from ADIN BROWN and the incumbents, BRAD FRIEDEL and KASEY KELLER.
 "Wherever I go, I have to be able to play," Howard said. "Of course finances matter; anyone who says differently is lying. I work hard, and I believe anyone who works hard is underpaid."

M.L.S.
 Major League Soccer is expected to announce later this week the renewal of its loan agreement with Bayer Leverkusen, which will keep LANDON DONOVAN in the United States for the next couple of years. Donovan is signed to that German club through 2007, but he has said that he wants to keep playing for the San Jose Earthquakes in his native California.
 MetroStars defender STEVE JOLLEY signed his new contract late last week and is now unlikely to be included in the proposed trade with D.C. United for EDDIE POPE and JAIME MORENO. Jolley's signing leaves two players, JEFF MOORE and MARCELO BALBOA, with contracts that expire at the end of the year. The MetroStars have only 14 players on their current roster, 12 under contract for 2003.
 BOB BRADLEY, the new MetroStars coach, has settled on his coaching staff. The club signed the former Scottish international MO JOHNSTON yesterday. In 1989, Johnston became the first Catholic since World War II to leave Glasgow Celtic to play for Rangers, which is supported by Protestants. Bradley will also retain DES McALEENAN as goalkeepers coach.
 Columbus midfielder ROBERT WARZYCHA, who played 47 times for Poland's national team, has retired and will become of the Crew's assistant coaches.

SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA
 Santos, a club with an average age of 23, won its first Brazilian championship since 1984 with its 
 3-2 defeat of Corinthians in the second leg of the finals. (Santos won the first game, 2-0.) The club was sparked by the 18-year-old striker ROBINHO and the 17-year-old midfielder DIEGO. Santos is coached by the former Brazilian international player EMERSON LEAO. Santos had won only two regional tournaments since PELE left the club in 1973. Corinthians, coached by CARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRA, had won the Rio-Sao Paulo tournament and the Brazilian Cup in the first half of the season.
 JOSE CARDOZO, who plays internationally for Paraguay, scored in his 15th straight game as Toluca beat Santos Laguna, 2-1, to advance to the Mexican final by 7-4 on aggregate. Cardozo, who scored twice in the game, has scored 35 goals in 23 games during the Mexican League season. Toluca will face Morelia, which lost to UNAM but advanced by 5-2 on aggregate, in the final this weekend. Three clubs that were eliminated from the quarterfinals fired their coaches last week: Cruz Azul (JOSE LUIS TREJO), UAG Tecos (JULIO CESAR URIBE) and Chivas (DANIEL GUZMAN).

CORNER KICKS
 American officials will hold a conference call tomorrow, probably to announce the re-signing of BRUCE ARENA as coach of the men's national team. . . . The American JOVAN KIROVSKI scored the game's only goal, his first in the English Premier League, in Birmingham City's 1-0 victory over Fulham.
 In Italy, ROBERTO BAGGIO scored his 200th goal in Serie A in Brescia's 3-1 victory over Perugia. The Italian leagues start their winter break after Sunday's matches. Struggling A.S. Roma has asked Italian officials not to assign Referee PIERLUIGI COLLINA to its matches. Collina, who called the 2002 World Cup final and is considered one of the best officials in the world, was the official in 9 of Roma's 14 matches this season, none of them victories (five losses and four ties).

HEADLINE: An Owner of Global Crossing Surprises With Its Latest Bid 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
ST Tele-who?
 After working in the shadow of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his flagship company, Hutchison Whampoa, to snatch majority control of Global Crossing for $250 million in August, the little-known Singapore company has surprised the telecommunications industry again, bursting into the limelight over the weekend with a $631 million winning bid for a controlling stake in Indonesia Satellite, known as Indosat. 
 The Indonesian government's auction of its 42 percent stake in Indosat, the country's No. 2 telecommunications company, is raising vital cash at a time of dwindling foreign investment and rising political uncertainty. But it is also the latest in a string of successes by Singaporean companies working to offset their exposure to Singapore's small, competitive market with strategic investments abroad.
"We want to build our business outside of Singapore," said Melinda Tan, a spokeswoman for ST Telemedia, formally called Singapore Technologies Telemedia. "Singapore is a small market, and we need to grow." 
But the political implications of the deal are raising questions about ST Telemedia's intentions. Suddenly, a company few people had ever heard of is poised to control an important chunk of the phone network in the world's most populous Muslim nation. With its stake in Global Crossing, ST Telemedia already controls a fiber optic network linking 200 cities in 27 countries with a customer list that includes the United States Navy.
ST Telemedia is a black box to most telecommunications analysts. It is owned by the Singaporean state and does not report financial results publicly. Even in its home country, it has little brand recognition. 
One thing it is not is a unit of Singapore's state-controlled phone company, Singapore Telecommunications, though it is sometimes confused with one in foreign press reports. Rather, it is the eight-year-old telecommunications offspring of a different and even bigger government-owned company, Singapore Technologies, a nebulous conglomerate with $5 billion in annual revenue and interests sprawling from military equipment to cable television to real estate and ship repair.
Singapore is a staunch American ally whose population is largely of Chinese extraction and whose economy is among the most modern and affluent in Asia. But it is situated uncomfortably close to places where terrorists are active and where Muslim radicalism is a significant force. Authorities here say they have already thwarted several planned terror attacks here.
Singapore's prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, was in Jakarta today, the first foreign head of state to visit Indonesia since the Bali attack in October. ST Telemedia said the timing of the visit was a coincidence and that its investment in Indosat was not politically motivated.
But analysts said that whatever the motive, the acquisition was the next best thing to handing President Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia a check. Indonesia has been trying for years to privatize Indosat, as called for in the $5 billion economic rescue package the country received from the International Monetary Fund. It tried to sell 11 percent of Indosat earlier this year but managed to find buyers for only 8.1 percent.
Analysts had expected this month's auction to bring prices below 12,000 rupiah a share, but ST Telemedia ended up offering 12,950 rupiah a share, a 51 percent premium on Indosat's closing stock price last Friday.
ST Telemedia outbid three rivals, including the country's largest phone company, Telekom Malaysia, which is state-controlled. It did not say how it would finance the deal. After the sale, Indonesia will be left with just 15 percent of Indosat.
To some analysts, the premium showed Singapore's expansionary zeal. "They're sort of desperate to expand overseas," said Karen Ang of Salomon Smith Barney.
Some analysts and investors say Singapore Telecommunications overpaid when it bought the Australian cellular operator Optus last year for $7 billion; others cited DBS Bank's acquisition of Dao Heng Bank in Hong Kong and the 1999 purchase by Singapore Airlines of a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. 
At home, ST Telemedia already has stakes in data and Internet services, local and overseas call services and a cellular operator. Many analysts were at a loss to explain how its latest investments fit into a coherent strategy.
"I don't see any link," said Bertrand Bidaud of Gartner Inc., the market research firm. 
By contrast, Singapore Telecommunications has tended to buy like businesses -- generally cellular companies -- in several countries and use its scale to cut costs.
Yet as a purely speculative play, buying into Indosat may make sense, analysts said. Once a tottering overseas-call monopoly, Indosat has shifted direction, buying Deutsche Telekom's 25 percent stake in a cellphone joint venture known as Satelindo. The cost -- $325 million -- put Indosat in the red but gave it control of a business whose sales grew by 70 percent last quarter.
Given that growth, "I wouldn't say it's an overpayment," Ms. Ang at Salomon said of ST Telemedia's investment in Indosat.

To the Editor:
 The federal government provides no financing for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Week in Review, Dec. 15). 
Subway commuting is far safer, more environmentally responsible and more economically efficient than driving. Why, then, does the federal government pour money into the dangerous, dirty and expensive Interstate highway system? 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and the people of New York City must demand a more equitable and more sensible allocation of federal expenditures. We pay our share of federal taxes; we deserve our share of benefits.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Japan Says Nuclear Effort In Korea Merits Hard Line

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The United States won a commitment from Japan today to continue taking a hard line toward North Korea that would bar any bargaining or talk of economic incentives until the government in Pyongyang agreed to shut its nuclear weapons program.
 Taking a break from their meeting at the State Department with Japan's senior Defense and Foreign Ministry officials, both Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz repeated the administration's policy of last week, that it was up to North Korea to ease tensions in the region. 
 The American and Japanese comments amounted to the latest rebuff to appeals by North Korea for negotiation on the nuclear issue. Today North Korea again called for a nonaggression treaty with the United States, saying it was the only way to prevent war on the Korean Peninsula. Secretary Powell dismissed the plea. 
In reiterating its call for a treaty with the United States, political experts say, North Korea could be seeking to influence the outcome of South Korea's presidential election, which takes place on Thursday.
South Korean news reports are saying the race has become too close to call. The governing party candidate, Roh Moo Hyun, has urged continued aid and engagement with North Korea, in line with the so-called sunshine policy of his mentor, President Kim Dae Jung, who is barred by law from seeking a second term. Although the publication of polls is banned in the final phase of the campaign, it has been widely reported that Mr. Roh's narrow lead has shrunk in the wake of the perceived North Korean belligerence.
Mr. Roh's main opponent, Lee Hoi Chang, of the conservative Grand National Party, has sought to soothe concerns that his approach toward North Korea would be dangerously confrontational. The 67-year-old Mr. Lee said of Mr. Roh, "The future of the Korean Peninsula will be perilous if we elect as president the candidate who is the inheritor of the failed sunshine policy and who will continue sending cash aid to North Korea despite its nuclear arms development."
As for Japan, it has officially declared agreement with President Bush on the approach to North Korea, but many voices of dissent exist within and outside the Japanese government. Some Japanese, and also some South Koreans, fear that a confrontation could backfire and deepen the crisis over North Korea's nuclear programs.
All talk of differences between the United States and Japan were dismissed today. Asked about the differences between the countries, Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi rejected the premise of the question. "Actually, between our two governments, there is no difference -- no fundamental difference of position, absolutely none," Ms. Kawaguchi said.
Secretary Powell smiled and added: "I agree completely with my colleague. Our positions are identical."
But there have been clear disagreements since October, when it was first disclosed that North Korea was embarking on a nuclear weapons program, despite promises it made in a 1994 accord with the United States and other countries in the region.
At first, for example, Japan joined with South Korea, Russia and China in quietly arguing that it would be better to continue economic assistance to North Korea while resolving the nuclear crisis.
American allies in the region, too, are said to lean toward upholding another part of the 1994 accord -- helping North Korea build two light-water nuclear reactors that could supply some of its energy needs without a risk that they could be converted to nuclear weapons production.
The United States wants to cut off all such aid, except for food assistance to civilians, to protest North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Asian diplomats say the next pivotal moment on North Korea will come after presidential elections in South Korea on Thursday.
Some in the Bush administration say that, without taking sides, they hope Mr. Lee, the hawk, will win the election.
By the same token, they want to encourage the Japanese to stand up to North Korea and not give in to its demands for more economic benefits in return for halting its weapons program.
The Japanese minister of state for defense, Shigeru Ishiba, was also at the meeting in Washington today. 
He and Ms. Kawaguchi said they also favored proceeding on a program to develop a missile defense system that would shield Japan and other countries from missile attacks from North Korea or other countries.
They also said they supported United States policy on Iraq, particularly on returning to the United Nations Security Council if the inspections imposed by the Council are rebuffed by Baghdad.
Secretary Powell declined to speculate on how Japan might help in any military effort against Iraq. In the past, Japan has shied from participation in direct military action. But in the Persian Gulf war, in 1991, Japan contributed several billion dollars to the war effort waged by the United States and its allies.
Japan has continuously asserted that its postwar Constitution, written by Americans during the occupation, bars the use of its armed forces in anything but direct self-defense.
"We are in the closest coordination," Secretary Powell said, "and it is up to the government of Japan, the people of Japan, to determine how they might respond in the face of a mandate from the international community to do something about Iraq's lack of cooperation."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SETTLEMENT: THE DEAL; 
Transit Strike Averted After Tentative Deal Is Reached

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Averting a threatened strike, the transit workers' union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday announced a tentative agreement that calls for a 6 percent raise over three years and an overhaul of a disciplinary system disliked by the workers.
 With New Yorkers bracing for days for an illegal strike that could have paralyzed the city, the two sides reached an accord that gives the authority one of its main objectives: a wage freeze in the contract's first year. 
 Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union had vowed not to accept a pay freeze, which was one of the last issues settled, but the M.T.A. sought to soften the blow by giving the city's 34,000 subway and bus workers a one-time $1,000 payment in the first year. Such a payment could ultimately save the authority tens of millions of dollars, because that percentage would not become part of the workers' base pay in future years. 
The agreement gives major gains to each side, with the union agreeing to several important measures to increase productivity and management promising to contribute more than $300 million to assure the solvency of the union's health insurance plan. 
At a news conference at 7:25 last night announcing the deal, Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, said, "We think today marks a turning point in the relationship of the authority and its union. We want to go from confrontation to cooperation."
The tentative agreement calls for a pay freeze in the first year, 3 percent in the second year and 3 percent in the third. Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's chief negotiator, estimated that each 1 percent increase in the workers' pay costs the authority $20 million a year.
The accord was reached after officials from the authority and union closeted themselves since Friday in the Grand Hyatt hotel in Midtown.
At the hotel, 21 committees met to reach accords on issues large and small, like safety and sick leave, while the union's president, Roger Toussaint, met repeatedly with Mr. Dellaverson to tackle the toughest issues. 
Looking drained and speaking slowly, Mr. Toussaint told a room packed with reporters and photographers, "We are very confident that this package will meet with the approval of the members of Local 100. It answers many of their needs, many of their urgent pleas especially in the area of health coverage." 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki sought to head off a strike by repeatedly warning the union of severe penalties if it walked out and crippled the nation's largest transit system, which carries 7.2 million riders a day.
Mayor Bloomberg, in a news conference outside City Hall last night, said he was gratified that the city would not have to confront the challenge of a transit strike, and that the transit workers ultimately had agreed to obey the law and not walk off their jobs. He said he had not yet decided whether to proceed with his threat to seek damages from the union for the costs incurred by the city in drawing up its contingency plans.
"Thanks to their efforts," Mr. Bloomberg said of the two sides, "New Yorkers can go back about their business without a strike looming over their heads."
In interviews yesterday, some union members said they were satisfied with the agreement, but even those who were angered by the deal appeared resigned to it.
Minutes after yesterday's 12:01 a.m. contract deadline, Ed Watt, the union's secretary-treasurer, announced that enough progress was being made to warrant stopping the clock and continuing negotiations, without calling the workers out on strike.
Facing a strike threat, New Yorkers spent the day off balance, taking subways and buses to work and school, but worried that the workers might walk out in the middle of the day. All in all, it was a normal day for New York commuters, with trains and buses crowded, despite fears of an imminent walkout.
In the late afternoon, a few hours before the settlement was announced, thousands of transit workers marched across the Brooklyn Bridge and joined a coalition of teachers, municipal employees and other union loyalists in a sprawling twilight solidarity rally at City Hall Park.
"Make the crooks open the books," the transit workers chanted, voicing skepticism that the authority faced a $2.6 billion deficit.
Apparently unaware that a tentative agreement was impending, demonstrators beat drums, carried placards and chanted slogans that vented anger at Mayor Bloomberg, demanded a fair deal from the authority and kept up pressure on contract talks that seemed near a climax.
While the rally might have had little or no effect on the transit settlement, one message came through: that the outcome was central to the future of all the unions that face negotiations with the city and state.
"This is what's happening right here, right now," said Kevin Barnes, a Transport Workers Union organizer and former subway conductor. "Labor is being born again. Unions are coming together to fight and protect the ground that they made fertile years ago."
For weeks, the talks appeared to be on a collision course because the union had new militant leadership that had promised its members a strong contract, while the authority pleaded poverty, saying it could afford only a pay freeze in the first year and modest raises in subsequent years because it faces a $2.7 billion deficit in the next two years.
In the three-year accord, the union -- representing 34,000 subway and bus workers, the largest municipal transit workforce in the nation -- agreed to many money-saving productivity measures, including merging the city's two public bus systems and unifying their conflicting work rules. The transportation authority estimated that this move would save tens of millions of dollars to help finance raises. 
Throughout the talks, Mr. Bloomberg said he was eager for the transit agency to win increased productivity measures to help reduce its deficit and set a precedent for the city's coming contract talks with unions representing more than 200,000 workers.
Mr. Kalikow said, "The productivity measures that we asked for that have been granted in this new contract go a long way to modernize the M.T.A."
In the agreement, the authority dropped its demand for the workers to pay an additional $1,000 a year in the contract's third year to finance their pensions. 
Addressing the workers' concerns that management does not treat them with enough respect, the authority also agreed to revamp its disciplinary system, which charged workers with 16,000 disciplinary infractions last year.
Under the accord, workers will be charged far less frequently with discipline violations when they are involved in an accident or when they are late filing documents required when they are out sick.
Marc Kagan, a union official who is an expert on the disciplinary system, predicted that the new contract would reduce disciplinary citations by at least 33 percent. As for the remaining citations, he said most of them would be handled through a less formal, less onerous process.
In agreeing to settle, the union avoided millions of dollars in fines, penalties and possible jail terms for its leaders. On Thursday, Judge Jules L. Spodek of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn issued an injunction, invoking the state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes and calls for two days' pay for every day a worker was on strike. 
Mr. Bloomberg had estimated that the shutdown would cost the city's economy $100 million to $350 million a year. 
The union demonstration in the hours before the settlement began shortly after 4 p.m. with a protest at transit headquarters on Livingston Street in Brooklyn.
Many said their fight was about more than money. "They don't want to give us anything, yet we continue to risk our lives to do our job," Frederick Chapman, 36, a subway station agent for 11 years, said. "If we're not safe, nobody's safe."
Clad in M.T.A. jackets and uniforms, many having arrived straight from work, the transit workers -- in a line that stretched for five blocks -- were buffeted by icy winds up from the East River as they crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, chanting "Shut up Mike, where's your bike," and hoisting placards demanding "Abolish the M.T.A." and "Audit the M.T.A."
Accompanied by supporters that included Randi Weingarten, the head of the United Federation of Teachers, and Don King, the boxing promoter, the marchers got a warm and noisy reception along the way -- honking horns by motorists and taxi drivers, the siren of an ambulance driver, cheers from pedestrians, even applause by passengers on a city bus caught in traffic behind the protest.
"They deserve what they fight for," Omar Perez, a Verizon technician, said aboard an M-22 bus that got stuck for 30 minutes.
As the procession spilled off the bridge and approached City Hall Park, the chants grew louder. And at the rally, a succession of speakers boomed support for the transit workers. 
"It's cold out here, but our hearts are on fire," roared Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association.
"We are here with you!" shouted C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. "We cannot walk away from the people who keep the city moving, whether they are police officers, firefighters, health care workers or transit workers."
When thousands of union members voted overwhelmingly on Dec. 7 to authorize a strike if no agreement was reached, many complained of being treated with little respect and called management's proposals insulting. 
The atmosphere around the talks soured badly in recent weeks for two reasons. First, two subway workers died in on-the-job accidents in successive days in late November, causing union members to accuse transit officials of giving short-shrift to safety. Second, union members felt insulted on Dec. 5 when the M.T.A. made its first economic offer, which called for a wage freeze in the first year and raises in the second and third years only if the union agreed to productivity increase to pay for them. 
Under the agreement, the M.T.A. will contribute $2.4 million in the first year for a new child-care fund , $3.6 million for a new skills upgrading fund, and $10 million toward a new fund financing prescriptions for retirees too young to qualify for Medicare. 
For the union, one of the most emotional issues was the authority's disciplinary system, which many workers said was onerous and arbitrary. 
The two sides said they would not make copies of the tentative agreement public until today. The union's members will vote by mail ballot later this month.

WAGES A wage freeze for transit workers in the first year, but also a $1,000 one-time payment. A 3 percent annual raise for workers in the contract's second and third year. HEALTH CARE The M.T.A. agrees to contribute more than $280 million to the union's health plan to keep it solvent. PRODUCTIVITY The union agrees to allow the merger of the Manhattan and Bronx bus system with the system for the other boroughs. It also agrees to unify conflicting work rules. DISCIPLINE The M.T.A. agrees to overhaul its disciplinary system, a move expected to result in a one-third drop in citations and the handling of most of the remaining citations in an informal way. SAFETY To improve safety, the M.T.A. agrees to have managers and workers do walk-throughs to assess dangers before beginning any new projects. SICK LEAVE The M.T.A. agrees to stop making home investigations to check on the 70 percent of the workers with the best attendance records. Home investigations will continue for the other 30 percent. BENEFITS The M.T.A. will contribute $2.4 million in the first year for a new child-care fund, $3.6 million for a new fund to upgrade skills, and $10 million toward a new fund to finance prescriptions for retirees. PENSION The M.T.A. agrees to drop its demand that workers pay about $1,000 more in the contract's third year toward their pension plan.(pg. B4)

HEADLINE: DIVISIVE WORDS: THE TOUGHEST CRITICS; 
Black Republicans Speak of Their Outrage at Lott

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
For decades, black Republicans have often balanced precariously along the fault lines of race and party loyalty -- called upon by white Republicans to vouch publicly for the party's inclusiveness, dismissed by black Democrats as opportunistic sellouts to the race.
 They have loyally stood by the party during heated battles like the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings and appearances of presidential candidates at ultraconservative Bob Jones University. 
 But there was something about Trent Lott's comments at Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th-birthday party, suggesting that the United States would be better off it had stuck with segregationist policies, that many say finally went too far.
"It was like a rifle going off," said Peter N. Kirsanow, the only black Republican on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, who was at home reading a book and watching C-Span when Mr. Lott's comments stopped him cold. 
Angry and shaken, Mr. Kirsanow called another Republican on the commission and said plainly, "Something has to be done."
Armstrong Williams, a conservative black columnist who was in the room when Mr. Lott made his comments, had a similar visceral reaction. "It was like being cut with a chain saw," he said.
The next day, Mr. Williams called Mr. Lott's office, expressing his outrage with a terse warning: "There's a storm brewing." 
He then called Harold E. Doley Jr., president of Doley Securities, a prominent Republican donor and the only black now with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, to take his pulse on the Lott situation.
Mr. Doley's response was firm and quick: "Lott has to go."
Senator Lott appeared on Black Entertainment Television tonight in yet another appeal for forgiveness. But his toughest critics may not be out in televisionland. Prominent black Democrats like the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Kweisi Mfume, president of the N.A.A.C.P.; and Representative Harold Ford Jr., a moderate from Tennessee, were among the first public figures to call for Mr. Lott's ouster from the party leadership.
Behind the scenes, however, a fury has been building among black Republicans who believe that Mr. Lott has significantly damaged their standing within the party and among their fellow African-Americans, many of whom already view them with suspicion. Within the Bush administration and around the country, many black Republicans are privately urging the party to dump Mr. Lott from the leadership for its own good.
"They've been fighting the good fight for the party, often enduring tremendous abuse that they are Uncle Toms or traitors," Robert A. George, a conservative black columnist, said of black Republicans. "Lott's statement seems to confirm what Democrats and many blacks have believed about Republicans all along."
Mr. George's outspoken criticism of Mr. Lott over the past week led one of the publications he writes for, The New York Post, a conservative newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, to call for Mr. Lott to step aside. A few prominent black Republicans have offered support for Mr. Lott. Outgoing Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, for many years the sole black Republican in Congress, defended him. So did Rod Paige, the secretary of education. 
The early backing -- and the fact that similar racially charged comments and actions in the past went largely unchallenged -- may have given Mr. Lott a false sense of security, some black Republicans say.
Mr. Williams said that when he first called Mr. Lott's office after the remarks, a staff member dismissed his complaints.
"He said it was just Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson blowing things out of proportion," Mr. Williams said of the staff member. "I told him, 'Forget about Jesse Jackson, this is about us,' but I could tell they weren't hearing me."
Mr. Williams and other critics say that whatever sparse backing Mr. Lott may have gotten from black Republicans has been significantly reduced by criticism of him by the White House. The president's criticism of Mr. Lott last Thursday, some of Mr. Lott's opponents said, has some early supporters now scrambling to get on the right side of the controversy.
Inside the Beltway and nationwide, many black Republicans said that they had been engaged in a flurry of phone calls to one another and to party leaders in Washington. The message was this: They expect Mr. Lott to be dealt with. 
"I've done the heavy work of the party as a grass-roots organizer, as a mayor, as a statewide representative, and this is flat-out counterproductive to years of outreach," said J. Kenneth Blackwell, the Ohio secretary of state and a longtime Republican, who worked for Jack F. Kemp and who served as representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in the early 1990's. "As a person who has been on the front lines trying to broaden the party for the past 20 years and as one who has been constantly called upon by Republican leaders to lend them credibility, I certainly hope they will do the right thing."
Besides being a slap in the face to the black party faithful, allowing Mr. Lott to be Senate majority leader would taint every policy initiative that Republicans try to advance between now and the 2004 elections, the senator's critics say.
"The manner in which Republicans address this will further reveal and define the character of the party," said Mr. Kirsanow, who urged his Republican colleagues on the civil rights commission to issue a statement condemning Mr. Lott's remarks.
Mr. Doley, 55, a lifelong Republican from New Orleans, who has held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for 29 years, said, "He'll become the poster boy for racism in the Republican Party." 
That is what many black Democrats are hoping for.
Individual members of the Congressional Black Caucus denounced Mr. Lott when the controversy erupted, but the 39 members of the group stopped short of a direct call for him to step down. 
The caucus, like many other Democrats, did not want to risk jumping in too boisterously and then being criticized by voters for political gamesmanship.
While Republicans within the administration, the Senate and nationwide continue to try to distance themselves from Mr. Lott, black Democrats say they will work harder than ever this week to bind all Republicans together.
Sensing an advantage, members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to press several hot issues on a Republican Party that is suddenly on the defensive on racial subjects. They intend to push Mr. Lott on his stated intent to support the nomination of Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr., a conservative, to an appellate court. They also intend to point out that the day after Mr. Lott's comments, new unemployment figures were released showing an 11 percent jobless rate among blacks, the highest in nine years. And they will note that President Bush's religion-based initiative allows churches to discriminate in hiring. 
"I'm more interested in what people are doing now than what people said in the past," said Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia. "Rather than playing 'gotcha,' it's time to take a real look at the policies that Trent Lott and this administration support."
Some black Democrats have even offered Mr. Lott redemption. Immediately after the senator's half-hour appearance on Black Entertainment Television, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, issued a statement saying that he accepted Mr. Lott's apology.
"The ability to forgive, to heal and come together for the common good is very much consistent with the philosophy of nonviolence of the civil rights movement," the statement said. "We have to believe that every individual has the ability, capacity and desire to change and grow."

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Oil: Wellspring of Bad Blood 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
As planning manager for Venezuela's most vaunted company, Petroleos de Venezuela, Juan Fernandez was known for caution and restraint as he plotted the state oil giant's financial future. 
 Now, the unruffled American-educated economist is plotting a different kind of future for the company: making sure its taps stay shut long enough to force President Hugo Chavez from power. 
 Charging that Mr. Chavez's left-leaning government is leading Venezuela to ruin, Mr. Fernandez, 47, and a vanguard of white-collar rebels have vowed to remain true to a two-week national strike that has paralyzed oil exports from the world's fifth-largest supplier, which provides 14 percent of the oil used in the United States. 
"I am not thinking of the risks," Mr. Fernandez said in an interview at his home. Even as he vowed to stay off the job, the government said Mr. Fernandez and four other leading Chavez opponents in the company had been dismissed. "This is my priority," he said. "This is what has become of my life." 
It is also a struggle for the life of Venezuela. When Mr. Chavez won power here in 1998, he pledged to use the oil revenues as his most powerful tool to remake a country with glaring disparities between a European-descended upper class and the vast majority of Venezuelans and Chavez supporters, who are poor and dark-skinned. "It cannot be seen as a state within a state," the president said of the oil company. 
Since then, Mr. Chavez's policies have divided Venezuelans as never before, and observers of the two-week political standoff now warn that whoever controls the $46 billion oil company will gain the upper hand and may well end up controlling the nation. 
"Oil is everything because that's how you control the money," said Roger Diwan, managing director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting company. "If the government succeeds in getting back the oil on line, they would have won. The question is, Is that possible at this stage?" 
Already the strike, now in its 15th day, has severely debilitated the oil industry. Production is down 70 percent, to about one million barrels a day, with losses for the government estimated at $350 million a week. Coupled with the threat of war in Iraq, the strike has driven up world oil prices to a two-month high. 
"It is the first time that Venezuela fails in its policy of being a secure and trustworthy supplier of petroleum," Roy Chaderton, Venezuela's foreign minister, said in an interview. "We consider that grave for Venezuela." 
After gaining the presidency, Mr. Chavez, a pugnacious former army paratrooper, quickly set about rewriting the Constitution and loading a new Congress and Supreme Court with his allies. 
While his policies have created a host of powerful enemies from the influential middle and upper classes, the most potent spring from the white-collar work force at Petroleos de Venezuela, known throughout the oil industry as Pdvsa, pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah. 
To the government and its supporters, Mr. Chavez is simply trying to manage Petroleos de Venezuela for the good of a country that, despite its vast oil wealth, has been mired in poverty. 
But to the executives and office workers at Petroleos de Venezuela, whose management was once autonomous, Mr. Chavez's government has meddled in the company's top ranks and mismanaged its finances by appointing what they called "ideologues." 
Instead of increasing production, Chavez appointees sold oil at cut rates to Cuba and began funneling ever-growing sums of money into little-known social programs, said alienated former oil executives like Mr. Fernandez.
"The petroleum industry serves the government, not the Venezuelan state," Mr. Fernandez said. "I cannot work in this company, or this country, the way it is." 
When he joined the company 18 years ago, Mr. Fernandez said, workers rose through the ranks in a highly structured, merit-based process that graded them on their achievements. "You made your career," said Mr. Fernandez, who started as a budget analyst. "It was up to you if you rose." 
But now, he and others said, there is little respect for what executives here called "the meritocracy" that had made Petroleos de Venezuela highly unusual among many state-run companies. 
The displeasure with the government's interference and Mr. Chavez's policies has prompted about 90 percent of the company's 15,000 office workers -- people who had once pledged loyalty -- to walk out. In addition to the executives, tanker crews have declared themselves in rebellion and workers at refineries and other installations have also walked off the job. 
"This is worth more than a career," said Edgar Paredes, president of the company's chemical branch and one of the opponents dismissed by the government. "History has given us an opportunity, and we are going to use that opportunity. What is in play is very important: the future of Venezuela and its liberty."
Mr. Chavez acknowledged in an interview on Sunday that the industry had been battered by the walkout. He called the strike an attack and sabotage and vowed to weather the crisis by searching for replacement workers and, if necessary, seeking technicians from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a member. 
Not all workers at the company have left. The president has the help of people like Enny Pulgar, 48, a 25-year veteran, who is working 15 hours a day, seven days a week, to fill in. "I am proud to be defending a company that has given me bread for 25 years, but also to defend the government I voted for," she said.
In his weekly radio address on Sunday, Mr. Chavez said he would stand by his aim to use the company to ease poverty, calling the plan a "nationalization" of the company. 
"Pdvsa will serve the interests of Venezuela, not the elite," he said.
He called for tough measures, including giving Ali Rodriguez, the company's president, the authority to hire and fire, powers once held by the board of directors. 
The government has also started to retake tankers whose crews declared themselves in opposition, and used the military to commandeer private tanker trucks to keep gasoline flowing for the domestic market.
Still, bringing Petroleos de Venezuela back to life is a patchwork effort, say the pro-Chavez workers who have stayed on the job. The company's headquarters in Caracas is three-quarters empty, many blue-collar workers remain on strike, and shipping clerks are, in some cases, declining to take orders. 
Omar Perez, a human resources analyst now working in the shipping department, said he and others loyal to Mr. Chavez were determined to resuscitate the company. 
"We are hanging by the edge of our nails," said Mr. Perez, 45. "But we are doing it."

HEADLINE: Gotta Have Faith 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week the Bush administration made an important announcement. I'm not referring to the selection of a new economic team, which will make absolutely no difference to policy. I'm talking about the executive order removing longstanding barriers between church and state.
 The announcement didn't attract much attention amid the furor over Trent Lott. Yet it contains the seeds of a similar future uproar. The media were shocked, shocked to discover that prominent Republicans have a soft spot for segregation -- something that was obvious long before Mr. Lott inserted his foot in his mouth. One of these years they'll be equally shocked to discover that prominent Republicans have a soft spot for theocracy. 
 Of course, the administration insists that the new policy isn't intended to allow government-funded proselytizing. And it would surely deny that by explicitly permitting religious discrimination in hiring -- organizations that receive federal contracts can "take faith into account in making employment decisions" -- it is opening up a new source of patronage for its friends on the Christian right.
Why am I not reassured? 
For one thing, we are well advised not to trust anything the administration says about the goals of its domestic policy. John J. DiIulio, who initially headed the Bush administration's faith-based initiative, told a reporter, Ron Suskind, that this White House had no interest in the substance of policy, caring only about political payoffs: "What you've got is everything -- and I mean everything -- being run by the political arm." 
Mr. DiIulio repudiated his own carefully drafted, 3,000-word letter to Mr. Suskind after Karl Rove put a horse's head in his bed. (O.K., I'm not sure about that last part.) But the best guess about any domestic policy from this administration is that its real purpose is to cater to a part of its base. And which part of the base wants to blur the line between church and state?
George W. Bush is always careful to speak in favor of faith in general, not any faith in particular. Congressional leaders are less careful. Last spring Tom DeLay, soon to be House majority leader, told a church group that: "Only Christianity offers a way to live in response to the realities that we find in this world -- only Christianity." He also said he was on a mission from God to promote a "biblical worldview" in American politics. 
By the way, one piece of that biblical worldview involves scientific education. After the Columbine school shootings, Mr. DeLay suggested that the tragedy had occurred "because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial mud." Guns don't kill people; Charles Darwin kills people.
Mr. DeLay isn't an obscure crank; he's the most powerful man in Congress. Still, is he an outlier? No. Don Nickles, now challenging the wounded Mr. Lott for Senate leadership, is less given to colorful statements, but is as closely aligned with the religious right as Mr. DeLay.
And the influence of the religious right spreads much further. The Internet commentator Atrios, who played a key role in bringing Mr. Lott's past to light, now urges us to look into the secretive Council for National Policy. This blandly named organization was founded by Tim LaHaye, co-author of the apocalyptic "Left Behind" novels, and is in effect a fundamentalist pressure group. As of 1998 the organization's membership contained many leading Congressional figures in the Republican Party, though none of the party's neoconservative intellectuals. 
George W. Bush gave a closed-door speech to the council in 1999, after which the religious right in effect endorsed his candidacy. Accounts vary about what he promised, and the organization has refused to release the tape. But it's notable that he appointed John Ashcroft as attorney general; Mr. Ashcroft gives every appearance of placing his biblical worldview above secular concerns about due process.
I'd like to think that the furor over Trent Lott's nostalgia for Jim Crow, hidden in plain sight for years, would serve as a signal to ask about other uncomfortable truths hidden in plain sight. But I suspect that it won't, that we'll soon go back to worrying about politicians' haircuts.
And then, years from now, when it becomes clear that much public policy has been driven by a hard-line fundamentalist agenda, people will say, "But nobody told us."

HEADLINE: If Saddam Were Only Brazilian 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Two mobs were hurling bottles at each other on a Caracas street the other night. The ground was littered with broken glass, a few gunshots had been fired, and the army was popping tear gas to forestall a riot (though Venezuelan gas is wimpish stuff, like onion-scented air freshener). 
 My mob was made up of Chavistas, militant supporters of President Hugo Chavez, and we could see what looked like anti-Chavez forces 100 yards down the road. I slipped away to have a look at them before the enraged mobs tore each other apart . . . but more on that in a moment. 
 That tense moment seemed to capture the mood in much of South America these days: desperate, angry and above all unstable -- with the U.S. nowhere in sight. The World Bank announced last week that Latin America was suffering its worst recession in two decades, shrinking its economy an estimated 1.1 percent this year, making it by far the worst-performing region in the world. 
Our neighborhood risks falling apart. Worse, at this pivotal time, we in the U.S. are losing the battle of ideas in Latin America. 
In the 1990's the "Washington consensus" -- emphasizing free trade and free markets -- gained ground, and with tinkering it still offers the best hope for the continent. It is the policy that success stories like Chile and to a lesser extent Mexico have generally adopted.
But this policy is now regarded by many as failed and discredited. That's why a pro-Castro leftist like Mr. Chavez was elected in Venezuela, and why free-marketeers have been losing elections in Brazil, Ecuador and, at the local level, Peru. Ask hawkers in the markets, and they tell you that Washington consensus policies enriched only crooked politicians. 
Unfortunately, there's some truth to that. Capitalism hasn't done well in South America.
"Inequality in most Latin American countries is far worse than 10 years ago," notes Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations. In Brazil the richest 10 percent of the population now gets 48 percent of the income, while the poorest 10 percent gets 0.7 percent. In Argentina, once a first-world country, I visited a slum where doctors told me that 90 percent of the children had worms.
If only Saddam Hussein ruled Brazil! If only Hugo Chavez were developing nuclear weapons! Then Washington might pay attention to the fire next door, which will affect us as much over the next two decades as Iraq's machinations. 
Our essential first step is simply engagement, for the Bush administration has several Iraq policies but no Latin America policy. It's particularly sad that the friendship between President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico has soured.
Second, trade will be the key engine for a Latin recovery, and in fairness it's one of the areas where the Bush administration has been busy in Latin America -- if also hypocritical, by scandalously protecting steel and agriculture. The U.S. needs to build on this month's landmark free-trade agreement with Chile. 
Third, we must fight corruption more aggressively. The State Department publishes an influential annual report on human rights abroad; Treasury could publish a similar accounting of corruption abroad. 
Corruption has undermined the efficiency of capitalism in South America and eroded support for markets. It's one reason too many South Americans see foreign investors and lenders only as exploiters.
Latin America has the world's best graffiti, and I was struck by the angry scrawls on American banks in Buenos Aires. A Citibank branch was defaced by this line written in English (with Spanish grammar): "Thieves, returns ours dollars!"
It seems to me that Citicorp's chairman, Sanford Weill, could pull out a can of paint and scrawl those words on the Argentine Consulate in New York. Still, however misguided, that fury needs to be addressed. Unless we pitch in to help fight corruption, unless we help build the case for markets, then much of South America will spin out of control -- ultimately looking like that angry street scene in Caracas.
Speaking of which, the second mob down the street turned out to be Chavistas as well. Two angry mobs were straining through the tear gas to rip each other apart, without realizing they were on the same side. The delusion underscored the slightly comical, mostly tragic way in which, as we look the other way, our neighborhood is coming apart.

HEADLINE: Indian Tribe Casinos 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Tribes of Gamblers" (column, Dec. 12): Are Indians being taken advantage of by investors? William Safire thinks so. But by law, tribes must receive the bulk of gambling revenue. 
 Contrary to his suggestion, Indian gambling is well regulated. Tribes spend $212 million a year on regulation. Tribal regulators, 2,800 in number, are law enforcement officers and professionals, like former F.B.I. agents and state regulators. 
 Indian tribes in North and South Dakota have been plagued by 60 percent unemployment; gambling provides them with 7,000 jobs.
In New Mexico, where the Indian teenage suicide rate is three times the national rate, gambling is financing afterschool programs and college scholarships. These are not "warm and cozy stories"; they are the difference between life and death.

HEADLINE: Plan for Downtown: Listen to Downtown 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Trade Center Site, Round 2: New Designs to be Unveiled Wednesday" (news article, Dec. 16), the public's ability to interpret and comment on the new designs is questioned.
 My windows directly face the World Trade Center site. 
I, along with many other downtown residents, will have no difficulty understanding and evaluating the designs. We will know exactly how to use the space and if it will be an improvement from the trade center we once knew. 
 The issue with the trade center design discussions, and the "Listening to the City" exercise, is that comments came from too many people without practical knowledge of the area. The only people who can reasonably review these designs are the residents and workers of downtown.
If the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation selects the right audience in the right forum, it will get constructive feedback that can improve the final result.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Soldiering On In Epic Pursuit Of Purity

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL

 BODY:
The director Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J. R. R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations, "The Two Towers." It may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is to simply drop us right into the action.
 Even for those deeply immersed in the material, this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension -- the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey; this mission began in "The Fellowship of the Ring" when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, begins the end of life in Middle Earth, as was indicated in the first "Ring" movie, "The Fellowship of the Ring." 
 Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material. Mr. Jackson's ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing. By doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous "Rings" was about setup. 
A brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a fire demon -- one of many climactic battles from "Fellowship" -- is shown near the start. But this scene is used to set "The Two Towers" in motion. It is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information. Even though the first film took in enough cash to jump-start the flagging United States economy single-handedly, Mr. Jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who haven't absorbed the "Rings" chronology into the entirety of their beings. And there may even be folks out there who haven't seen "Fellowship," but will be lured into theaters for "Towers" by all the attention that "Fellowship" attracted. Such moviegoers may feel left out, puzzled and unable to keep up.
With the narrative of "Rings," Tolkien was investigating determination, loyalty and, finally, faith, finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart, as found in Matthew 5:8 and in Kierkegaard, whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being. The pursuit of purity is at the center of "Towers."
For our hero, Frodo, whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from Middle Earth, purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power. He gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and Sam meet Gollum, a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring. He is now an emotional and physical shambles; emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch, Gollum's translucent, waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides.
Gollum is divided within himself; he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits. But he is also a hissing, bitter child-man whose paranoia keeps him breathing, and plotting. Gollum is a computer-generated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in "Towers" -- perhaps the most fully realized. (He has been dropped into the movie more effectively than George Lucas crammed Jar Jar Binks into his recent "Star Wars" addenda.) With the voice of Andy Serkis, whose movements were also copied by the animators, Gollum is torn by his nature, and Mr. Jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are.
This is partially because "Towers" is more or less a bridge to the finale of the "Rings" trilogy due a year from now, though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever. 
So, much of the flow of "Towers" is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment. Mr. Jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle against the endless, possessed armies of the villainous magician Saruman (Christopher Lee), the foe responsible for the fate of Gandalf. In his flowing white gowns and beard, Mr. Lee's warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as Mr. McKellen's.
In sheer action mechanics, Mr. Jackson's achievements in "Towers" are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around; he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust. His engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic; when the swells of Saruman's army crash into the walls of the king's castle, we could be watching Orson Welles's "Chimes at Midnight" as directed by George A. Romero -- Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. The exultant creepiness of horror films is Mr. Jackson's instinctive filmmaking style. He exaggerates it here in epic terms, and the grandeur is astonishing -- one scene of Saruman's creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot, with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect.
Mr. Jackson's mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film. The little-boy allure of the storytelling in "Towers" is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in "Fellowship." "Towers" is like a family-oriented E-rated video game, with no emotional complications other than saving the day. Women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plot-device flight attendants, offering a trough of Diet Coke to refresh the geek-magnet story. (It is a lapse in Tolkien's work that Mr. Jackson has not figured out a way to correct, even with the token reappearances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett from the first film.)
Mr. McKellen is a marginal presence this time around, which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast; "Rings" is such a kids' fantasy that a daddy figure is required. He is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of Tolkien's bad-dream threats. But he does get one -- only one -- whooping chance to do so in "Towers."
The most incredible accomplishment of "Towers" is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention. Because "The Two Towers," which opens worldwide today, has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment, the movie falls short on emotional involvement. Still, Mr. Jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that I can't wait to see his next movie -- by that, I mean the one after the "Ring" cycle ends.
"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for pounding, long scenes of sword and flaming-catapult action and unsettling mystic evil.

HEADLINE: Taking French Children's Fashion Global 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Jean-Pierre Charpentier is not your average French fashion executive.
 For the last two years, Mr. Charpentier, a former book club executive, has run Jacadi, a fashion children's wear company that not long ago was in the throes of bankruptcy. He has made it a success by selling items like the popular French schoolgirl dress, though often modernizing them for children accustomed to streetwear, and providing quality clothing at more moderate prices than that of competitors like LVMH's Baby Dior or Christian Lacroix children's lines. 
 Jacadi is watched closely because it is a leader in the field in France and has spearheaded growth in the past with its nimble franchising model. 
And now, despite uncertain economic times and a turn to cautiousness among many consumers after Sept. 11, Mr. Charpentier wants to double the number of Jacadi outlets worldwide in the next three years from about 400 today. In the United States alone, he plans to add as many as 140 stores to the 32 now, including 4 in the spring. 
Jacadi opened its first American boutique, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in 1988. Over the last decade or so it expanded, mainly through franchising, and principally to locations on both coasts, but also to malls in Arizona, Illinois and Missouri. Mr. Charpentier says Jacadi owns only a handful of its stores, mainly in large urban centers like New York and Chicago, for training personnel and running consumer tests. To finance the new round of expansion it is again seeking to franchise.
Riding the 1990's growth wave in high-end grownup apparel, lots of retailers went kiddie, with lines like Kenzo Junior and Baby Dior, both owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton or Sonia Rykiel Enfant.
Over the last several years, French chains like Jacadi, Bonpoint, Tartine et Chocolat and Petit Bateau, recognizing a clientele able to afford their blend of nostalgia and French touch, opened in big American cities like New York, Los Angeles and Miami, making it easier for American shoppers to find those exquisite French schoolgirl dresses, smocks and accessories for children.
Some analysts say Mr. Charpentier is on to something with his grand expansion plans. As uncertain economic times crimp retail sales and shift spending patterns from apparel to less-expensive accessories, opportunities open up for midcategory retailers like Jacadi, they say.
"When things are at this point, it's wise to make plans," said Michael P. Niemira, a vice president of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi who follows retailing. "It's good timing."
Neil Fiske, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, says Jacadi is riding a wave of what he calls new luxury -- high-quality goods and services once reserved for elites but that midmarket consumers now selectively covet to escape the stress of modern life. "Not by any stretch of the imagination," he said, "has the phenomenon played out."
Jacadi's competitors are not so sure.
Catherine Laurent, director of the Paris stores for Tartine et Chocolat, which has five outlets in the United States, said her company had no plans for major expansion. The chain's next big opening is in Beirut, she said.
Bernard Cohen, who owns and manages Bonpoint, which characterizes itself as at the high end of the children's apparel market, said the United States remained "a very important market." But he added that "in the kinds of locations we seek out, there is less potential." Bonpoint, he said, "refuses to go into malls." Nevertheless, Bonpoint's main targets for expansion remain the United States and Asia, notably Japan, Singapore and China.
That is just fine with Mr. Charpentier. "You have to act fast," he said, "before the others wake up."
The company, which is based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, first opened its doors in Boulogne Billancourt, another suburb, in 1976, and was a quick success. But by the mid-1990's, Jacadi was insolvent, squeezed between high operating costs and fierce competition.
In 1997, it was sold at bankruptcy court to the Frydman family, who own all of Jacadi and are major shareholders in the Marionnaud perfume group. A drive toward overseas growth, accelerated in the last five years, capitalized on global consumer appetite for classic styles and the French touch. Describing the Jacadi customer, Mr. Charpentier said, "If she goes to Gap, she buys a T-shirt; if she comes to us, she's buying an environment."
Before joining Jacadi, Mr. Charpentier, now 55, was chief executive of the book club company Groupe France Loisirs, where he had worked for 25 years.
"It's all distribution," he says. 
Jacadi did an internal study recently to identify areas in the United States where consumers have the purchasing power to support a Jacadi outlet, Mr. Charpentier said, and "we found 100 to 140 potential points."
Though Mr. Charpentier is reluctant to part with income data or detailed sales figures, Jacadi boasts that its stores average about $350,000 annually in retail revenue after two years of business. In the United States, outlets average about double the revenue of stores at home in France, Mr. Charpentier said.
This year, he added, Jacadi expects global revenue of about 135 million euros ($138 million), or 3 percent more than 2001. That would follow a 9 percent increase from 2000 to 2001. About 55 percent of revenues are generated outside France, compared with 35 percent five years ago, he said, with the United States contributing about 20 percent of non-French revenue, up from 17 percent five years ago.
Jacadi is reacting to growing competition in its home market as well as to a European trend away from expensive frills and toward less-expensive streetwear. Indeed, while Jacadi still stresses what Mr. Charpentier likes to call "bon chic, bon genre" -- roughly, real chic, real style -- it overhauled the collection two years ago to accommodate the streetwear trend. "The colors, the style, the cut are more modern," he said.
Still, neither the streetwear trend nor the uncertain economy has yet crimped Americans' taste for the French children's look, and Jacadi has done well with velvet dresses that go for up to $79 or jumpers for up to $89. Part of its strategy is to aim at ethnic groups whose tastes may tend to the frilly. Its Web site, for instance, specifies that Tagalog is spoken at a Madison Avenue store and Korean at several other sites.
Jacadi has also done well by introducing French customs like the "birth list," analogous to a wedding list, which allows customers to sign up for gifts. The custom has long been widespread in France, and all gifts now account for roughly half of revenue in United States stores, according to Mr. Charpentier.
Mr. Fiske of Boston Consulting said stores like Jacadi play on parents' "sense of nostalgia, the pleasures of childhood," adding that sometimes nostalgia for "what childhood wasn't is even more powerful than what it had been."
He and other analysts say the latest trend among apparel makers like Jacadi is toward accessories -- children's furnishings, wallpaper, shoes, even perfume for a 5-year-old.
Mr. Cohen of Bonpoint said his company recently opened Bonton, a huge new loftlike store in Bonpoint's old couture workshop in Paris offering children's clothes and accessories under one roof. "The image is more modern, more sporty, more contemporary," he said. If the concept works, he said, expansion could follow, even to the United States.
But an accessorized Jacadi is there first, Mr. Charpentier said, offering "children's furniture, things for the room, lamps, strollers."

A Bond Swap Available Only To Big Players

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
In the summer of 1998, U S West, a Baby Bell phone company with a solid investment-grade rating, set a record by selling $1.5 billion in 30-year bonds to eager investors. It was the largest long-term bond issue in corporate history.
 To people not swept up in the technology stock mania, the bonds looked like a safe investment with a good yield of 6.9 percent stretching out for 30 years. In the jargon of Wall Street, they were ideal investments for widows and orphans. 
 Any widows or orphans who bought those bonds now find themselves in an unhappy position. U S West was taken over by Qwest, whose fiber optic dreams have led to crushing debt, dubious accounting and federal investigations. Qwest is unable to offer any assurances about its real financial condition. 
Today a federal judge in New York will decide whether Qwest can proceed with an exchange offer in which institutional investors are being asked to exchange each $1,000 of those bonds for new ones with a face value of $545. The offer is a coercive one that will leave bondholders who do not accept it in the back of the line for repayment if Qwest goes broke.
For individual investors who own the bonds, the choices are even worse because the offer specifically excludes them. In fact, Qwest professes outrage that the details of its offer have been made public by disaffected bondholders. The offer is open only to qualified institutional investors, like mutual funds and hedge funds.
At a hearing today, Federal District Judge Denny Chin in Manhattan will consider a request by some bondholders for a temporary injunction blocking the exchange offer, which is scheduled to close Friday night. He will also consider a motion from Qwest to dismiss the suit.
If Judge Chin allows the offer to go ahead, institutional investors who own the bonds will find themselves in a position with some resemblance to the classic "prisoners dilemma," in which two suspects in a crime are questioned separately by the police. They would be better off if neither one of them talked, but the worst possible outcome for each prisoner would be to keep quiet while the other one talked.
For the owners of the $12.9 billion in bonds in the 11 issues that Qwest wants to at least partly retire through the bond exchange, the offer provides interesting tradeoffs. In most cases, the higher interest rates on the new bonds would provide additional income while the bonds are outstanding, but the owners would get far less money when the bond matures -- assuming that Qwest is then able to repay the principal.
The new bonds being offered would represent discounts in face value ranging from 17.5 percent for bonds maturing in 2004 to 47.5 percent for an issue maturing in 2018. Bonds maturing before 2010 would also have maturities extended, but those maturing after that would be repaid sooner, assuming all works out.
In addition, the new bonds would be collateralized to a greater extent, giving them a better chance of being paid if Qwest does enter bankruptcy.
If the offer is oversubscribed, not all bonds will be exchanged for the new bonds being offered. But owners who get some bonds back will have them reclassified to have better security if Qwest goes broke.
If the offering is a success, those holders who do not tender or are not permitted to will wind up in the worst position. They will still have their old bonds, but they will rank lower than they did in the pecking order if Qwest does go under.
So the question will be: to tender or not. If no one tendered, then Qwest would be in the same position as before the offer, and any bondholder would be no worse off. But if a lot of holders tender, those who refuse will be worse off than they were.
For the individual investors who own such bonds, the alternatives are even less appealing. They cannot tender, so their choices are to hold or sell now depressed prices. If they hold, and the exchange offer is a success, then their bonds will probably fall in price.
In the longer term, the question is whether these bonds can be paid off at maturity. If so, then it probably would be better not to tender. As recently as early this year, the bonds traded as if default were very unlikely, but that has changed. The bond mentioned above -- the bond that set a record for the size of issuance of a 30-year obligation -- now trades for about half of face value.
So will the bonds be paid in full at maturity? Some people who bought the bonds as they fell this year calculated that the answer was yes. One estimate said that the company was worth about what it owed, which might leave little for the shareholders but could provide full payment for the bondholders.
But it is even harder than normal to make such calculations. The company has no audited financial reports available, and while it has disclosed large revisions to past numbers, it has warned that those may not be the final changes. If the coming news is bad enough, getting the extra security could be crucial to making a substantial recovery for the bondholders. On the other hand, if it is good, that might indicate that there is no need for bondholders to make sacrifices.
In its offering memorandum, Qwest states: "The restated information and other information we intend to include in future S.E.C. filings is not available at this time, and were it available, could be material to your decision whether or not to participate in the exchange offer."
The bondholders suing Qwest argue that management, which decided to make the exchange offer, probably has inside knowledge of how bad the news is going to be. Qwest responds that because the information is not available now, it cannot be penalized for failing to disclose it.
Exchange offers that damage bondholders are not unheard-of on Wall Street. And, as Qwest pointed out in arguments in this case, companies do not normally owe a fiduciary duty to bondholders. But this case is unusual because Qwest's financial situation is so unclear.
Because it has no audited financial statements, it cannot sell a bond offering in the public market, and cannot make the exchange offer to public investors. But it may still need the balance-sheet improvement that would come from a successful exchange.
If it is allowed to go ahead and the exchange offer succeeds, Qwest will get some debt off its balance sheet, a possibility that has encouraged shareholders, who have bid the stock up 28 percent, to $5, since the offer was announced on Nov. 20. 
In that case, however, the biggest losers will be the people that securities laws are meant to protect -- the individual investors who thought they were buying a safe bond but instead got stuck with bonds in a company that came up with a strategy that damaged their interests.
Wall Street, on the other hand, will do fine. Qwest has hired no fewer than six investment banks to help manage the exchange offer: Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, UBS Warburg, Credit Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities. All will profit if the offer goes through.
As it happens, two of those banks -- Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers -- were among the lead managers who earned fees in 1998 for selling the U S West bonds that proved to be such poor investments for the buyers.

HEADLINE: Mayors Report Requests For Food and Shelter Are Up 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
The nation's mayors said today that this year had brought the largest increase in demand for emergency shelter in a decade, a result of a sluggish economy and the rising cost of housing and health care.
 And they said requests for food aid were second only to the peak year 2001, underscoring what they called a crisis in helping the needy. 
 At the same time, the mayors said in their annual survey on hunger and homelessness, they received less money to care for the poor and disadvantaged, a reflection of the federal budget, a drop in private charitable contributions and a shift in attention to the threat of terrorism.
"The war on terrorism has certainly moved the focus away from domestic problems," said Mayor Bill Purcell of Nashville. "But we mayors are dealing with homeland security and domestic security simultaneously. We hope that the release of this report will help the federal government and the nation understand what we must all do for the needy." 
An administration official said in an interview today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would provide $1.12 billion for programs for the homeless next year, a $28 million increase over this year.
In the survey, to be released on Wednesday, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that the demand for food aid rose throughout the country by 19 percent, with working families topping the list of the most needy. The demand for emergency shelter was more varied, with St. Louis reporting the greatest increase -- 64 percent -- while the overall average was also 19 percent.
More worrisome, the mayors said, is the growing evidence that the lack of food and adequate shelter for the working poor is becoming an endemic problem. There has been a steady rise in emergency food and shelter requests in the nation's cities since the mayors began their survey in 1986, with no sign that the problems are abating.
"The world's richest and most powerful nation must find a way to meet the basic needs of all its residents," said Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, president of the conference. "We need a recommitment to help people put a roof over their head and have a nutritious meal every day."
Nearly two-thirds of the 25 cities surveyed said they had to decrease the amount of food they provided to the poor this year, rationing meals and food donations to ensure that no one went hungry. The cities also reported that people remained homeless for an average of six months, and that 73 percent of the homeless families were headed by single parents.
"This report shows that the country's economic problems are visited most strongly on children and the working poor," said Doug O'Brien, vice president for policy at Second Harvest, a network of nonprofit food banks that provides most of the food distributed by charities.
Second Harvest released a report last year showing that private charities were feeding more poor people than the federal government.
While the mayors lauded President Bush for acknowledging the role of private charities in aiding the country's poor and disadvantaged, they said the administration should increase its support for food assistance and housing.
The housing crisis seemed the more intractable problem in the survey. Several mayors and experts said that the demand for emergency food often stemmed from a poor family's inability to pay both rent and grocery bills. With more families priced out of the housing market, the demand for public housing has exploded.
In Miami, for instance, there is a seven-year waiting list for public housing.
Mayor Anthony A. Williams of Washington said it would take a coordinated effort on many fronts to combat homelessness, including new federal financing for housing, job training, substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling.
President Bush vowed this year to end chronic homelessness within 10 years, and two-thirds of the HUD money will pay for homeless shelters and related social service and prevention programs. An additional $35 million will pay for programs to help people who live on the streets, said Philip Mangano, director of the federal Interagency Council on Homelessness.
"The money is modest," Mr. Mangano said, "but it comes at a time when most states and localities have had to cut funding that affects the homeless." 
The mayors asked the president and Congress to enact what they called a national housing agenda that would substantially increase the amount of low-cost housing.
"We know what we need to do," Mayor Purcell said. "What we need is funding to build the right kind of housing."
Adding their voices to the demand for more food assistance, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators passed a resolution last week declaring that hunger was a "national problem that undermines the ability of children to learn and grow, of adults to be productive and the elderly to live in dignity."
The group asked the states to put in effect federal changes that streamline the food stamp program and asked the administration to increase nutritional programs by $1 billion.
They also urged Americans to donate their time and money to combat the two problems.

HEADLINE: Housing Data Is Mixed; Industrial Output Edges Up 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Starts of new housing rose 2.4 percent in November, partly reversing a big slide the month before, the Commerce Department said today. But home-building permits, seen as an indicator of future construction activity, were down 2.7 percent.
 In two other reports, industrial production rose slightly, the first increase since July, according to the Federal Reserve, and consumer prices also edged higher. 
 The Commerce Department said that groundbreaking for new homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.697 million units last month from an upward-revised 1.657 million pace in October.
Kevin Logan, an economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York, said housing starts were relatively strong last month. "What it suggests," he said, "is the housing sector is the one bright spot in the economy, and that's reflecting low mortgage rates." 
Housing construction had fallen by a revised 8.4 percent in October after surging 10.9 percent in September. Economists have said that the drop in October could have been caused by a rainy month, and they added that the strong demand for housing showed few signs of flagging. 
Starts on single-family homes, the largest category, rose 0.9 percent, to 1.390 million units, last month. Groundbreaking on multiple-unit residences jumped 12.6 percent, to 278,000 units. By region, housing starts surged 10.1 percent in the South and 10.9 percent in the Midwest. But groundbreaking fell 11.9 percent in the West and 5.6 percent in the Northeast. 
The Federal Reserve said industrial production eked out a 0.1 percent gain in November, aided by a gain in auto production. Excluding cars and parts, industrial output fell 0.2 percent. Automotive production rebounded in November, rising 3.9 percent after a 2.4 percent decline in October. The overall decline in October output was revised to 0.6 percent from 0.8 percent.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices inched up, as expected, in November with lower costs for energy and clothing helping to offset increases in medical care and food. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in October. The so-called core price index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percent, the same as in October. 
The report showed a 0.4 percent decrease in clothing prices and a 0.8 percent drop in air fares. The cost of medical care increased 0.6 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Slip as Investors Take Profits From Recent Rallies

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A profit warning from McDonald's discouraged investors yesterday, reminding them of the weak economy and prompting them to unload stocks.
 Although there was some good economic news, investors still chose to take profits from a substantial advance on Monday and from a two-month fall rally. Analysts said some selling was to be expected, because of the market's recent gains and because the earnings and economic recoveries investors were hoping for in 2003 are not yet assured. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 92.01 points, or 1.1 percent, at 8,535.39, having jumped 193.69 on Monday. 
The broader market also retreated. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.28 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,392.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 7.41 points, or 0.8 percent, to 902.99.
"We had a big run-up yesterday and the basis for that is not really clear," said Ed Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. "McDonald's could have a negative impact. And things in the Middle East continue to sound worrisome."
Yesterday's batch of economic news was rather positive. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.1 percent in November, bouncing off a 0.6 percent drop in October and matching Wall Street's expectations.
In another report, the Labor Department said that consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent in November, the smallest gain since July and better than analysts had anticipated.
And the Commerce Department said that construction of new homes rose 2.4 percent in November because of the lowest mortgage rates since the 1960's.
But the economic reports failed to overshadow negative news, including a fourth-quarter profit warning from McDonald's, which sent the stock down $1.39, to $15.99.
Other losers yesterday included Best Buy, down $1.40, to $24, after beating third-quarter earnings expectations by a penny a share but projecting a flat fourth quarter.
The software maker Oracle fell 28 cents, to $11.02, ahead of its earnings report, which will be released today. 
Despite yesterday's slippage, market observers said that the mood on Wall Street remained upbeat and that the market's bias was to move up, not down.
"There is a good tone in the market," said Michael Murphy, head trader for Wachovia Securities in Baltimore. Stocks, he said, "seem to want to go up."
The market has held onto much of its autumn rally. After hitting a five-year low on Oct. 9, the Dow is now up 17 percent from that point. The Nasdaq is up 25 percent and the S.& P. is up 16 percent from six-year lows established on Oct. 9. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Treasury prices rose yesterday with a weak equity market lending some support to safe-haven government securities, while more American statements on Iraq stoked concern about a potential war.
But Treasuries traded off earlier highs, with analysts warning that any strength in Treasuries was likely to be short-lived. The market is ripe to trade sideways into the new year as volumes thin, they said.
The 10-year Treasury note increased 8/32, to a price of 99 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, decreased to 4.11 percent, from 4.15 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 2/32, to 105 12/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.02 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.907
High Rate: 1.190

HEADLINE: Two Refiners Ask U.S. for Oil From Strategic Reserve 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
At least two large oil refiners have begun talks with the Energy Department to explore borrowing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make up for shortfalls in Venezuelan exports caused by strikes, company representatives said yesterday.
 Representatives for the Amerada Hess Corporation and Citgo confirmed that they had approached the Energy Department about the issue. Both companies said they had not yet received a response. 
 Exxon Mobil, a partner with the Venezuelan state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, in a refinery in Chalmette, La., said it had not spoken to the agency about such an option. A spokeswoman for Lyondell Chemicals, another refiner, had no comment on the matter. Other large refiners, including ConocoPhillips, did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
The Energy Department said it was not considering lending oil from the 598-million-barrel reserve at this point. "Currently lending or exchanging oil from the S.P.R. is not an active consideration," an Energy Department spokesman said.
Before the strikes, Venezuela had been the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States, supplying about 1.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, or about 14 percent of all imported oil. But the standoff between supporters and opponents of President Hugo Chavez has brought oil production in Venezuela to a near-standstill.
The price of oil for January delivery was unchanged at $30.10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange at the end of trading yesterday but fell as much as 9 cents after hours.
Carl T. Tursi, a spokesman for Amerada Hess, based in New York, said of his company's discussions with the Energy Department: "We have asked them that if they are going to make oil available, we would be interested. We would step up refining rates if we had more oil."
Hess is a partner in the enormous Hovensa refinery in St. Croix, V.I., with the Venezuelan state oil company. Last week, Hovensa announced that it would cut its output for December to 275,000 to 300,000 barrels a day because of shortfalls in Venezuelan crude oil, Mr. Tursi said. The refinery's capacity is about 495,000 barrels a day and it is a major supplier of gasoline to the Eastern United States.
Kate Robbins, a spokeswoman for Citgo, which is based in Tulsa, Okla., but is owned by the Venezuelan government, said that her company had so far been able to replace the Venezuelan oil by buying supplies on the spot market and had not been forced to reduce output from its refineries. Nonetheless, the company is preparing for a possible worsening of supply problems.
"We have asked for their assistance," Ms. Robbins said of talks with the Energy Department, adding that Citgo had approached the agency late Monday. "But there is nothing specific as far as amount or timing."
The growing concern among the oil refiners has emerged against the backdrop of new data from the American Petroleum Institute that showed a sharp drop in crude oil stocks in the United States for the week ended Dec. 13, a decline of 3.16 million barrels, to 283.9 million.
"It looks like we're seeing some impacts of Venezuela, though it's hard to tell," said John Felmy, economist with the institute. "You need to have a couple of weeks of this to have some confidence in the numbers. But it is something we're watching very closely."
A resolution of the Venezuelan crisis still appears distant. Now worries are growing about possible difficulties in resuming oil production once the conflict is over, said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. Venezuelan oil is mostly heavy and some of the fields there are old, and if they were not shut down properly during the strike, Mr. Goldstein warned, that could damage the oil reservoirs underground and even reduce production capacity. 
That also throws into doubt how quickly Venezuela could increase production after the crisis. 
"People are generally saying it will take between 10 days to two weeks to resume production," Mr. Goldstein said.

HEADLINE: LESSONS; 
A Mill Town Town Spins Out Images

BYLINE:  By Jacques Steinberg 

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H. 

 BODY:
MISSISSIPPI STATE, Iowa State and the University of Maryland's Baltimore County campus are far-flung datelines on the map of higher education. But when seeking attention from the news media in recent years -- Mississippi State for a program that tests the durability of living room furniture, Iowa State for its claim to inventing the first computer and Maryland for its recruiting of black science majors -- each converged on public relations firms within a 20-mile radius in southern New Hampshire.
 For nearly three decades, a disproportionate share of higher education news has been shepherded by about a half-dozen firms in or near Keene, a mill city of fewer than 30,000 people. 
 How a community in the shadow of Mount Monadnock (of "Our Town" fame) became the home of such a niche industry is, in one sense, a genteel tale about a former Monsanto executive named Fred Gehrung who once helped introduce AstroTurf. Mr. Gehrung also pioneered the notion of colleges' marketing themselves like Fortune 500 companies and moved his fledgling consulting business in the 1970's from Madison Avenue to New Hampshire, where he had spent vacations. 
But this is also an improbably bare-knuckled story of the competing firms that Mr. Gehrung spawned, led mostly by former employees who sometimes evoke the dueling aluminum siding salesmen in the Barry Levinson movie "Tin Men."
"This region is fortunate Fred likes to fire people in the way he does," said Thomas F. Kearney, executive editor of The Keene Sentinel. "He has added greatly to the local economy because of all the spinoff businesses created by the entrepreneurial people who used to work for him."
That such work can generate several million dollars a year in revenue -- from colleges as far afield as Princeton and Juniata, in central Pennsylvania -- is further testament to how higher education, and higher-education reporting, has become big business.
It was not always so.
Until the late 1960's, colleges' enrollments rose steadily enough that the notion of courting news coverage was unthinkable. But that changed in the early 1970's, as enrollments fell and costs rose.
Serendipitously, Mr. Gehrung was looking for clients for his new business. An assignment for the Danforth Foundation, seeking support for an education financing bill, led to contracts from Duke and Notre Dame, and Mr. Gehrung was off. 
His efforts to help institutions build brand names by pitching feature articles about professors and students led to other assignments, particularly as publications like U.S. News & World Report began ranking colleges.
"Now we had a horse race," Mr. Gehrung said. By the mid-1980's, he said, his firm had as many as 40 clients, each paying up to $36,000 annually.
By then he had relocated to a Victorian house on Main Street in Keene. By Mr. Gehrung's own admission, he was a demanding boss who gave his account executives too many clients to juggle. It was inevitable that someone would take him on.
The first was Frank Dobisky, a veteran newspaperman who moved to New Hampshire to work for Gehrung Associates in 1979. He left in 1984 to found Dobisky Associates. Before long, he was representing Tulane, Washington University in St. Louis , and Iowa State, which got coverage in USA Today in 1997 for trying to recreate a computer built by a professor in the 1930's.
Bill Tyson, who had helped transform St. Francis College in Biddeford, Me., into the University of New England, left Gehrung in 1988 to found Morrison & Tyson Communications with another former Gehrung associate.
Mr. Tyson, based in Walpole, N.H., has represented the University of Texas at Austin, Macalester College and the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, whose scholarship program to lure high-achieving minority students in math and science was featured in October 2000 in The New York Times.
There would be other defections from Gehrung, and sometimes the hurt feelings endure. When interviewed recently, a competitor of Mr. Dobisky suggested that he had retired. Mr. Dobisky, 61, says he has never been busier.
Mr. Gehrung, 69, has moved to San Francisco and is selling his business to a former Associated Press reporter named John McGauley. He is at once proud of what he helped create and bitter that so many are doing such work outside the Gehrung brand. "We sort of wrote the manual," Mr. Gehrung said. "What they learned is what I was able to teach them."
That prompted Mr. Kearney of The Keene Sentinel to remark, "P.R. guys can't stop being P.R. guys when the meter goes off."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Lessons column on the Education page on Wednesday included a quotation from a New Hampshire newspaper editor who referred imprecisely to the circumstances under which several public relations consultants for colleges left the local firm of Gehrung Associates to start their own firms. While the editor, Thomas J. Kearney of The Keene Sentinel, mentioned dismissals, he now says that those who started firms resigned. He adds that his reference to dismissals pertained to employees who did not start firms.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSIT SETTLEMENT: THE GOVERNOR; 
Pataki Gets Credit for Averting Strike While Keeping His Distance

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
During the week leading up to a labor settlement with New York City transit workers, Gov. George E. Pataki drew criticism from labor leaders and Democrats for not rolling up his sleeves and inserting himself directly in the negotiations.
 In the end, however, the Republican governor's style of working mostly behind the scenes, making carefully measured public statements and distancing himself from the nuts and bolts of the negotiations has served him well. 
 Mr. Pataki's balancing act has let him win credit for averting a strike -- which would have been disastrous for his image -- while still not becoming too closely associated with the details of the pact itself. 
That may be an advantage, because the contract does not set down a particularly good pattern for negotiations with state workers next spring as the governor struggles to close at least an $8 billion budget shortfall, labor experts said.
To cut spending and still keep his pledge not to raise taxes, Mr. Pataki needs to wrest either a wage freeze from the labor leaders representing 130,000 state workers, budget experts said, or an agreement to keep raises tiny.
The governor has built up a considerable amount of good will among union leaders over the last year by backing several bills to ease organizing and providing money to settle contracts with health care workers and teachers. Many labor leaders saw the contract with the transit union, in which management won work-rule changes and the union got raises despite a deficit faced by the transit system, as another positive sign.
"What we could take from this is that the governor is not interested in an adversarial setting, he's interested in getting a settlement," said Denis M. Hughes, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. "I think he played it very well."
Still, the labor battles ahead will not be easy for Mr. Pataki. The transit contract provides for a 6 percent rise in salaries over three years, and even though the raises do not kick in until the second and third years, many of the union leaders representing state employees will see that as a floor. Labor leaders, in fact, pointed today to the transit contract and said they would demand raises that at least keep up with inflation.
The leaders of the two largest state employees' unions, however, have already made it plain they will not accept a wage freeze. Roger Benson, the president of the Public Employees Federation, said he sees the transit contract as proof that the state can find resources to provide modest raises in the pact he must negotiate. His union has 45,000 members.
"Putting zeros on the table is a sharp stick in the eye and will only create ill will and difficult negotiations," Mr. Benson said. He noted that Governor Pataki, during the run-up to the election, had provided money to help give health care workers statewide and teachers in New York City raises. "We certainly understand that money can be found and we expect there should be some significant prospecting going on for state employees." 
Danny Donohue, the president of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 80,000 state employees, said his members would not look kindly on a contract with no wage increases. Instead, Mr. Donohue has urged the governor to find savings and raise taxes on the wealthy and on corporations.
Several politicians and labor leaders said Mr. Pataki's performance during the transit talks was masterly. Though he controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Mr. Pataki stayed above the fray, saying he would not interfere with the negotiators at the table. He avoided questions about his responsibility for the authority's deficit and shaky finances, too, saying the authority was responsible for those decisions. 
The governor made it plain that no financial help was forthcoming from the state to pay for a settlement, while warning that a strike would be illegal. When the rhetoric of union leaders heated up last week, Mr. Pataki responded by urging both sides to tone down the harsh language and work harder to reach an agreement. In the same breath, he said an illegal strike would be a "horrendous act of disloyalty" after the camaraderie forged among New Yorkers after Sept. 11, 2001.
On Saturday night, Mr. Pataki once again evoked the terrorist attack when he praised transit workers for their bravery during those uncertain weeks, even as he warned them again of the dire consequences of an illegal strike.
"He hit the appropriate tone," said David L. Gregory, a professor of labor law at St. John's University in Queens. "I think he made the outlines of this very clear to everyone hours before the deadline."
It remains to be seen, however, if the same low-key approach will work when dealing with state employees, who have worked for months without contracts in the past while attacking the governor directly.

HEADLINE: Newark Resurrects Airport Terminal Long Lost in the Shuffle 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
The evolution of the building that was the first passenger terminal at Newark Liberty International Airport could be said to mimic the evolution of the airline industry.
 Like the industry, it has moved from muddy cinder runways to asphalt, from Quonset huts to ever-shinier passenger pavilions, from entrepreneurial small businesses to large corporations that have been sliced, diced, moved and reassembled depending on economic conditions. 
 The restored and expanded building, with Art Deco styling and topped with the first enclosed control tower, was rededicated today as the airport's operations offices and a shrine of sorts to Newark's role in the development of commercial air travel.
It was a long, circuitous and expensive journey in which the granite and marble two-story structure had fallen into disuse. But instead of being abandoned, it was eventually cut into three pieces and gingerly rolled on large rubber tires and dollies nearly a mile down the road where it was reassembled, restored and sensitively incorporated as the centerpiece of a new glass and aluminum operations center that tripled its square footage. 
Susan Baer, general manager of the airport, said it was fitting that the building that housed the first air traffic control center at the airport where night flights and runway lighting were born was rededicated on the 99th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic flight.
"Kitty Hawk may have been the first in flight, but Newark is where the industry was molded," said Ms. Baer.
When the building opened in 1935, Newark was the nation's busiest airport, eclipsing New York's two major airports. About 10,000 people showed up when it was dedicated by Amelia Earhart, back when the airport was the haunt of Charles Lindbergh, Wiley Post and Eddie Rickenbacker.
But the building fell victim to industry success. Larger planes, longer runways and greater numbers of air travelers called for changes, and in 1953 it was replaced by a larger terminal as the airport itself expanded northward. The building housed administrative offices and the National Weather Service until the construction of yet another new runway placed it in the middle of a Federal Aviation Administration protected area.
While safety concerns banned construction or even use of buildings in such areas so close to where planes took off and landed, other federal regulations prohibited demolition of a national landmark. So the building became a storage area for the airport.
Paul Wood, an engineer who directs capital programs for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, came up with the idea of an "adaptive reuse" of the building. The idea was a challenge, he said, though he added, "We managed to move it without even cracking the terrazzo."
Once moved, it was incorporated with new construction, set behind the angular arc of the building in a way that makes it impossible to see the ultramodern expanse of new aluminum and glass from the front. 
"We purposely did not try to replicate the design of the old in the new sections so no one would ever confuse the new with the historic," said Richard Southwick, lead architect on the restoration for Beyer Blinder Belle, the design firm. "And we built the new section lower and behind the wings on each side of the old structure to preserve the historic scene."
Not everyone is happy with the result. Gregory Arend, a preservationist and author of a book on the airport and its first terminal, said the restoration was not as faithful to the original look as it could have been. He accused the architects of "Disneyfying" the project.
"It was as if they put whitewalls on a garbage truck," he said, referring to the pairing of the Art Deco original with the new space.
Still, the main hall of the terminal, with its stylized terrazzo eagle, fluted columns with capitals in the shape of wings, has much of the feel of photographs of it in 1935. Missing from the building, constructed by the Civilian Works Administration between 1932 and 1935, were 10 murals commissioned from the artist Arshile Gorky, which in colorful, Cubist-like canvases depicted several air industry themes. Mary Sue Sweeney-Price, director of the Newark Museum, said only two of the murals had been saved and restored, after they were covered with olive-drab paint when the the military used the building during World War II.
"Modern art was not particularly popular at that time, and these were very abstract pieces," she said.

An article on Wednesday about the restoration and expansion of the original passenger terminal at Newark Liberty International Airport misstated the given name of a preservationist and author of a book about the airport who said the work was not as faithful to the original as it could have been.

HEADLINE: Trent Lott's Blow to Civil Rights 

BYLINE:  By Abigail Thernstrom; Abigail Thernstrom is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
I don't know what's in Trent Lott's heart, although he's already talked far too much about it for my taste. But two things are clear. A lot of Americans, including most black Americans, will never believe his contrition. And Mr. Lott, by playing the supplicant while clinging to his post as Senate majority leader, has conceded Republican leadership on race-related issues to the Democrats and the traditional civil rights community. 
 In his interview Monday on Black Entertainment Television, Mr. Lott called the controversy a "wake-up call," talked of a bipartisan "task force of reconciliation," came out for "across the board" affirmative action and savaged his own lawmaking decisions with the bizarre claim that "my actions, I think, don't reflect my voting record." Read between the lines: he will now take his cues from the Democrats and their allies like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. 
 Thus, the original tragedy -- remarks that certainly sounded racist at Strom Thurmond's birthday bash -- is compounded by his new posture as groveler-in-chief of the Republican Party. At a time when fighting racial inequality requires a willingness to challenge the mainstream civil rights establishment, Mr. Lott's party will no longer be able to stand tall. 
On BET, Mr. Lott was defensive about receiving an F on the latest N.A.A.C.P. Congressional report card, saying that that "I have been changing." Yet this report grades politicians on such partisan, non-civil rights matters as their votes on extending unemployment benefits to aviation workers and increasing global AIDS financing. Not surprisingly, every Senate Republican received an F -- even moderates like Lincoln Chafee and Olympia Snow. Mr. Lott can aim for a better mark, but he won't get one, not as a Republican. 
The shame is that surrendering civil rights issues to the left would not be in the public interest or that of black Americans. Democrats and civil rights organizations are stuck staring into a rearview mirror. Of course, racism has not entirely disappeared, but the Democrats' attachment to yesterday's ideas -- that inequalities can best be corrected through policies of racial preference -- is a golden opportunity for Republicans to advance new ideas. 
Take what is arguably today's most important civil rights issue: the racial gap in academic achievement. Robert Moses, a luminous figure in the civil rights movement of the 1960's, says that "the absence of math literacy . . . is an issue as urgent as the lack of registered black voters in Mississippi was in 1961." English literacy is equally important. 
Yet the political left talks almost entirely of "re-segregated" and underfunded schools, and pushes for more busing and more spending, a strategy that has failed for decades. Democrats also believe in collective bargaining rules that allow dreadful teachers to retain their jobs. Their emphasis on "self-esteem" results in the dumbing-down of educational standards, what President Bush has rightly called "the soft bigotry of low expectations." 
After an era of liberal leadership, the typical black or Hispanic student graduates from high school today with junior high skills, according to the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress.
If Mr. Lott cedes civil rights issues to the Democrats, how can Republicans in Congress join the majority of black parents who want vouchers so that their children can escape public schools that have become graveyards for hope? 
For years, Republicans have run in terror from most controversial race-related issues. But it was not always so. More than 80 percent of Republicans in Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congressional Republicans can recapture the moral high ground -- but not if their Senate leaders are unable to stand up to groups that are often at odds with the interests and even the views of their own minority constituents.

HEADLINE: More Housing On the Map 

BYLINE:  By Michael H. Schill; Michael H. Schill is director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious plan to create affordable housing in the city has been greeted with almost universal acclaim. Most of the attention has focused on his commitment to spend $3 billion over the next five years to build or rehabilitate more than 65,000 apartments and houses. Virtually unnoticed, however, is an aspect of the plan that will generate many more homes for New Yorkers of all incomes: a major revision of the city's archaic building code and zoning laws.
 One of the main reasons why the number of homeowners in New York is so low, and why one out of every four tenants in the city pays more than half of his or her income for rent, is that the private market cannot keep up with the increase in demand for housing. Unlike many other large, older cities, New York is growing. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of households increased by 205,300. The number of new apartments and homes went up by only 81,000. 
 People can (and will) argue about whether rent regulation has created this shortage. But there are more likely culprits. The cost of building housing in New York is the highest in the nation. Contributing to this cost are several legal and administrative roadblocks put up by the very same local government that spent more money on subsidized housing over the past 15 years than the next 50 cities combined.
New York City's zoning and building codes are ridiculously outdated. Its current zoning resolution was enacted in 1961, at a time when New York had 675,000 more manufacturing jobs than it does today. Land zoned for industrial use, like the Brooklyn waterfront, is now considered attractive for residential development. A developer who wants to build housing there must attempt the risky, expensive and time-consuming process of applying for a rezoning or a variance.
Even if a builder finds appropriate land that allows development, he must still contend with the building code. Last revised in 1968, the code is more than 2,000 pages. It is replete with requirements devised to placate special interests, not improve building safety or construction practices. For example, developers cannot use plastic pipe in many types of construction. This is not because metal pipe is considered better or safer. It is because two people are generally needed to carry metal pipe, compared to one for plastic pipe, and therefore labor unions prefer it. Such rules keep modern, cost-saving technologies from being adopted in New York.
For years, the city's response to these self-inflicted wounds has been to spend more money. If the cost of building housing was too high for most developers, why not offer tax abatements or outright subsidies? Now virtually all new development receives public subsidies -- even buildings with two-bedroom apartments renting for more than $5,000 a month.
The current economic downturn provides New York with an opportunity for reform. The city cannot spend its way out of this housing crisis. Mayor Bloomberg's long-term financial commitment will help many poor and working families obtain better homes. But it will not solve the city's long-term housing needs.
It is the less heralded aspect of the plan that has the greater potential. The mayor proposes to make large swaths of industrially zoned land available for housing. Decisions about how vacant city-owned land will be used will be centralized under a deputy mayor. Environmental approvals will be streamlined and expedited. And a modern, model building code will be proposed. Removing government-created barriers to housing is necessary, but we should not fool ourselves into thinking it will be easy. Each regulation, however obscure, has its purpose and its champion.
A city that cannot satisfy the housing needs of its work force is a city that is in danger of becoming uncompetitive. Mayor Bloomberg's housing plan can help New York alleviate this chronic problem.

HEADLINE: No Return to Bad Old Days, Mayor Says 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
With the end of his first year in office in sight, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg summoned his public safety staff members to City Hall yesterday and sought to dispel any perception that New York had backtracked under his lead.
 Rather, Mr. Bloomberg maintained, improvements both grand and subtle were logged this year, from sharp drops in crime and fewer people dying in fires and traffic accidents to technological improvements in recording 911 calls and using photographs to win domestic violence cases. But that was just his warm-up. 
 It was all achieved, Mr. Bloomberg and city officials said, contrary to the predictions of those both in and out of government that the bad old days of high crime and insecurity would doubtless return, especially with a soft economy becoming softer. The public safety achievements were accomplished with depleted revenues, deep budget cuts and fewer city employees, the mayor said. More than a dozen officials joined him as he methodically presented his case like a prosecutor at closing arguments.
Exhibit No. 1: The return of Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner who stood with military bearing at the mayor's side.
Mr. Kelly had seen the destruction of the World Trade Center from his home in Battery Park City and left a high-paying job in the private sector for a second stint leading the Police Department. It was a job he had a decade ago, when the expansion started that eventually increased manpower by nearly 40 percent.
That he had returned to bring crime rates down even lower than the record declines in eight years under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani must have seemed like vindication. Mr. Kelly smiled when his boss explained how New York was now situated squarely between Provo, Utah, and Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., in terms of its crime rate per 100,000 people.
"You have to go back 40 years to have the city as safe as it is now," Mr. Kelly said. "That's when Mickey Mantle was in center field, and Bob Wagner was in this building, and Hershey bars cost a nickel." 
Mr. Kelly has consistently said he will work to drive crime down even further, despite having several thousand fewer officers and more responsibilities to try to prevent further acts of terrorism.
At one point, Mayor Bloomberg called New York the safest big city in the world. And yet, when he took questions following his afternoon news conference, a hint of exasperation crossed his face. He was asked if the city could continue the trends. 
He said it could. He explained in detail how the improvements had been documented with numbers and statistics, not supposition.
Mr. Bloomberg seemed to bristle when asked why, despite reductions in crime, some people perceived more disorder or quality-of-life problems.
"I don't know where that perception comes from," the mayor said. "None of the statistics seem to show that's true.
"You can always find, every day, somebody that has seen something that they're not happy with. But in the end, you can't run an administration based on park bench wisdom. The numbers are what they are, and we have to focus on not what some columnist says, with no numbers, no backing, but what the real numbers are. This city is safer."
Despite a crime rate that rose nationwide during the year, crime in New York City fell to the lowest level since 1963, Mr. Bloomberg said. As of Sunday, crime in the city had decreased by nearly 6 percent, compared with the same period last year, and murders had fallen to 548 from 625 in the same period, a 12.3 percent reduction and the lowest in 40 years, the latest police statistics show. Felony assaults, auto theft, robbery, burglary and grand larceny have all gone down since Mr. Kelly took over.
Mr. Bloomberg then rattled off a drumbeat of accomplishments in the Fire, Probation and Transportation Departments; the medical examiner's office; and the Office of Emergency Management, among others. There was much good news, but some things went unmentioned. 
Notably absent yesterday was the head of the City Correction Department, where investigations continue into the conduct of some top officials.
Nor did the mayor mention that overtime to firefighters is soaring. Officials in the union that represents Fire Department officers weighed in yesterday with a criticism of proposals to disband eight fire companies and reduce manpower. Capt. Peter L. Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, which represents 2,500 lieutenants, captains, battalion chiefs, deputy chiefs and others, said many political promises had been forgotten.
"There is a basic disagreement between the Bloomberg administration and the superior officers of the F.D.N.Y.," Captain Gorman said. He added, "Closing eight engine companies guarantees a slower average response time for the entire city."
At the news conference, Salvatore J. Cassano, the chief of operations, said the average response time to fires had been cut by 3 seconds in 2002, to 4 minutes and 13 seconds. He said that 86 civilians had died in fires this year, and that if the trend continued, the number could be the fewest since 1921, when 99 people died.
On the roads, 180 pedestrians have died so far this year, compared with 194 in all of 2001, the mayor said. On Queens Boulevard, one pedestrian has been killed so far, the mayor said, compared with an average of eight in each of the last five years.
"It is the end of the year and I think a year ago, when this administration took office, no one would have believed how far New York City could have come in terms of recovery and rebuilding during the past 12 months," the mayor said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BUSINESS; 
Iraq Says Russian Oil Company Met Dissidents

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Iraq said today that it canceled a large oil contract with a Russian oil company because executives from the company had met with the Iraqi opposition-in-exile. 
 Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in an interview with The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, that the contract with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, had been canceled because it had discussed the fate of a major oil field with opponents of President Saddam Hussein. "Lukoil went to Washington to get assurances that their contract will be implemented after the removal of the Iraqi regime," Mr. Aziz said in the interview published today. "This is outrageous of them because they signed a contract with us. Such conduct cannot be accepted." 
 It was the starkest statement yet by an Iraqi official about the cancellation last week of the multibillion dollar contract. It also was a shift in reasoning by Iraq, which until now had said the contract was rescinded because Lukoil had delayed development at the West Qurna oil field. 
A Lukoil vice president, Leonid Fedun, said that he was unaware of such meetings and reiterated that the company was unable to begin developing the field because of constraints imposed by United Nations economic sanctions. Mr. Fedun said that Lukoil executives met with American officials this fall, but said that they had not formally discussed Iraq. 
Iraq's abrupt cancellation of Lukoil's contract severed the single most important tie between the two countries at a time when the United States is threatening to go to war against Iraq over what it says is Mr. Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. 
Moscow has been Baghdad's strongest supporter, in part because of the oil contract, political experts said, adding that the broken contract might lessen Russia's resistance to military action. 
A senior Bush administration energy official said this month that the topic of Iraq had come up during a meeting he had with Lukoil's chief executive, Vagit Y. Alekperov. He gave no details on the meeting except that it took place before President Bush met with President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia last month. 
"Lukoil has the most immediate concern," the official said. "There was a broader sense that they wanted to know what the outlook was." 
A senior Western diplomat in Moscow would neither confirm nor deny that Iraq had come up in talks between an American under secretary of energy and Mr. Alekperov. He said only that the meeting "focused on the bilateral energy relationship" between the United States and Russia.
