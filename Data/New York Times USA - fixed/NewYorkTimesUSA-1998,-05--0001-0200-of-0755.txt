HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Tender Witness to the Togetherness of People in Want

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Socially engaged, humanistic photography has a long and densely textured history in the United States, one marked by a constant tension between objectivity and empathy, idea and sentiment, the polemical urge and the personal touch.
The artist Walter Rosenblum, 78, holds a distinguished if still under-valued place in that tradition. In a sense, he was born into it. The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, he was raised on Manhattan's Lower East Side, at the corner of Clinton and Rivington Streets, during the Depression. He was introduced to photography as a teen-ager at a local Boys Club, and in 1937 he joined the politically progressive Photo League, a largely volunteer organization that sponsored workshops, lectures and classes. 
 There he met two extraordinary figures who became his teachers and his friends. One was Lewis Hine (1874-1940), the sociologist turned photographer who had been using the camera to document the lives of immigrants and workers since 1905. The other was the pioneering modernist Paul Strand (1890-1976).
From each Mr. Rosenblum took different things. Hine's pictures offered a model of photography as a democratic, socially responsive, reformist tool, with quotidian life as its subject. Strand's work, exhilaratingly experimental, suggested the medium's tremendous formal potential. Mr. Rosenblum integrated the example of both artists into the succession of memorable photo essays he created between the 1930's and the 1980's.
A sampling of that work is on view in "Walter Rosenblum, Photographs: A Retrospective Exhibition" at the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College in Flushing. The show of 70 images, organized by Jerald R. Green, represents small selections from eight of Mr. Rosenblum's major series. But it captures the essence of a life's work, giving a sense both of the consistency of an artist's vision and of how his thoughts about his medium developed over time.
Early on, Mr. Rosenblum produced work of startling maturity. Working under the nurturing eye of Sid Grossman, the director of the Photo League school, he shot his "Pitt Street" series over six months in 1938, when he was only 19. Here he stuck close to a subject he knew intimately: daily life in a tenement neighborhood tucked within the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge.
These images, about a dozen of which are included in the exhibition, make no effort to disguise the hardships experienced by the blacks, Jews and European Gypsies who made the area their home. But in almost every case the emphasis is on community rather than on misery, on a hard-won emotional amplitude rather than on oppression.
In one picture, neighborhood women with strollers gather to chat outside a rubble-strewn lot; in another, a little girl plays alone on a swing; in a third, Gypsy children sit on a stoop absorbed in a card game. The vignettes are straightforward, but each is warmed by suggestive details. Behind the women a line of immaculate white laundry hangs like a row of guardian angels; the high trajectory of the swinging girl is echoed in the soaring lines of the bridge behind her, and the faces of the children playing cards seem gilded, even in black and white, by late-day sunlight.
A few years later, Mr. Rosenblum was in Europe. As a photographer with the United States Army during World War II, he recorded thelanding in Normandy in 1944, and was the first Allied photographer to enter the concentration camp at Dachau after its liberation. When the war was over he stayed in Europe to work for the Unitarian Service Committee photographing Spanish Civil War refugees living in southern France.
A few of his combat pictures are in the show, but they are outnumbered by images of civilians -- mourners at a military funeral in France, flag-waving crowds on fire escapes at a New York block party, Spanish children in hospitals and camps. In all these photographs, ordinary people are seen reacting, often with unself-conscious stoicism, to the forces shaping their destinies.
Such influences are given a particularly incisive visual embodiment in the "Spanish Refugee" series, which is unique, at least in the Queens College show, for being shot almost entirely indoors. Picture after picture has a shut-in, humid, underground look, with faces and figures seeming to loom out of semidarkness into the camera's eye.
In contrast to these ashen, claustrophobic images, those he produced a few years later of fishing villages in the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec are buoyant with light and air. Nature is the real subject here, seen in sweeps of sea and sky, and a hardscrabble coastal landscape shared by people and animals.
Yet, despite dramatic differences in atmosphere and subject, the two series have essential elements in common, as seen in a simple comparison. A Spanish woman sitting erect with her grandchild in her lap in a refugee camp in France and an elderly French Canadian widow staring, alert as a bird, straight into the camera, may have lived an ocean apart, but they are both, in the photographer's eye, unassuming cultural emblems of endurance.
Almost a decade later, Mr. Rosenblum worked again outside the United States when, on a sabbatical from his job at Brooklyn College (where taught photography from 1947 to 1986) he traveled to Haiti. He stayed there for 10 months, immersing himself in the spirit of the place, a practice he had followed since the "Pitt Street" series.
The show offers 13 of his 90 some pictures from Haiti. And whether they are shots of a domestic altar in a thatch-roof house, an exhausted woman leaning against a veranda pole or the island landscape, almost preposterously gorgeous with its lush hills and piled-up clouds, the tone is one of restrained, level-eyed observation, never prosaic or overtly poetic but somewhere in between.
The same is true of his several New York City series, among them one made in the neighborhood around 105th Street in East Harlem in 1952 and another in the South Bronx in 1980. A handful of the East Harlem images -- three confident young men posed before a graffiti-covered wall, a child playing hopscotch in the street, a girl smiling shyly from an open window -- are much-exhibited classics. The Bronx pictures, taken nearly 30 years later, are tougher, jumpier, more varied, less lyrical, but every bit as engaged and, like all of this artist's work, determinedly hopeful.
Mr. Rosenblum has said that he chose East Harlem as a subject in the 1950's because he was convinced of the vital role that the growing Latino population would play in the country's future. And he chose to spend time in the South Bronx in 1980 because he felt that its community, then at the nadir of its economic fortunes, was being unjustly blamed for its travails.
That he called upon art as a persuasive means of stating his convictions is admirable. That the art he created is one of formal beauty and expressive power and tenderness will be apparent to anyone visiting the Queens College show. It is worth noting, incidently, that on Monday, Mr. Rosenblum, along with his wife, the photo-historian Naomi Rosenblum, will be given a lifetime achievement award by the International Center of Photography. The honor is richly deserved.
"Walter Rosenblum, Photographs: A Retrospective Exhibition" remains at the Godwin-Ternbach Museum, Paul Klapper Hall, Queens College, Flushing, through May 28.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pressing European Union to Be More Friendly to Turkey

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, April 30

 BODY:
Senior diplomats from the United States are engaged in an intense effort to persuade the European Union to adopt a more conciliatory policy toward Turkey, diplomats involved in the effort say.
The diplomats said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had made a series of telephone calls to her European counterparts in recent days, urging them to soften their attitude toward Turkey. Among those whom she has called are Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain. 
 The effort is growing as an American mediator, Richard C. Holbrooke, is about to visit Cyprus for a new round of talks with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders. His visit to the island four weeks ago ended without visible progress, in part because Turkish Cypriots and their patrons in Ankara were angry at the way the European Union was treating Turkey's application for membership.
Ms. Albright reportedly made some progress in her calls, but also found that fierce anti-Turkish sentiment in Greece and the national election campaign in Germany were major obstacles to changing the European Union position on Turkey.
Greece is Turkey's principal rival in Europe, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is facing an uphill fight for re-election. He does not want to be seen as supporting steps that could bring more Turkish immigrants to Germany, which is already home to the world's largest Turkish immigrant community.
"This Turkey question is probably the most serious disagreement we have with Germany," said a State Department official who has worked closely with German leaders.
At a summit meeting in December in Luxembourg, leaders of European Union countries decided to proceed quickly with talks aimed at admitting six additional countries and to place five others on a waiting list. The 12th applicant, Turkey, was effectively rejected.
That set off a storm of protest in Turkey, highlighted by emotional denunciations of Europe and suggestions that Turkey should look for friends elsewhere. American leaders, including President Clinton, criticized the European decision and urged that Turkey not be made to feel unwelcome in the West.
After the Luxembourg meeting, Turkish leaders took a series of retaliatory measures, including asking their Turkish Cypriot clients to stiffen their negotiating stance in long-stalled talks with Greek Cypriots. Mr. Holbrooke said after his latest visit to Cyprus that Turkish Cypriots were refusing to consider serious compromises as long as Europe treated Turkey in a manner that they considered unfair. He is scheduled to return to the island on Saturday.
The next European Union summit meeting is set for June in Cardiff, Wales.
American diplomats across the continent have been instructed to urge European leaders to issue a new statement in Cardiff declaring their desire for better ties with Turkey.
"We are now engaged in a full-court press to get the E.U. to ease up on Turkey, to make the Turks feel more welcome in Europe," said a United States diplomat involved in the effort. "There are intense negotiations going on aimed at getting the E.U. to improve the terms of its offer.
"The European countries have accused us of not understanding their problems. We do recognize that it will be a long time before Turkey is ready to join."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Shoppers Are Starting to See Lower Prices on Asian Goods

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The signals may be small -- a pink T-shirt here, a baby's rattle there -- but shoppers are starting to see price savings in a number of goods as a result of the protracted financial crisis in Asia.
While the overall Consumer Price Index was flat in March, indicating the absence of any general inflation or deflation, prices in several categories of merchandise, many of which are produced in Asia, have fallen over the last several months. 
 Some manufacturers that have their goods assembled in Asia appear to be keeping cost savings to themselves, leaving retail companies and consumers alike frozen out of any boon. Still, shoppers are starting to enjoy savings in a variety of products, in some cases dramatically. Retail prices of toys, on average, fell 3.3 percent between March 1997 and this March, compared with a 4 percent rise at the beginning of 1997, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the index.
Leading the way were video games and baby toys like crib mobiles and rattles, where prices fell as much as 20 percent in some cities last month.
Prices of clothes have dropped, especially those for infants and women. Apparel prices, after being on the rise through much of 1997, are now back to where they were a year ago.
The collapse of currencies throughout much of Asia means that the dollar buys much more in countries producing everything from mascara wands to Barbie dolls, from department store sweaters to athletic shoes. And the economic weakness there translates into desperate manufacturers willing to cut prices in order to unload goods that otherwise would go unsold.
Combined with a drop in oil prices and pressure on domestic manufacturers to keep prices down, Americans are enjoying bargain basement deals even as their nominal incomes are now rising at roughly 7 percent a year. Just yesterday, the Commerce Department's report on the nation's economic performance in the first quarter showed that inflation, at least for now, had essentially vanished. Indeed, the domestic purchases deflator -- which tracks prices paid by consumers for goods sold in the United States, both imported and American-made -- actually fell one-tenth of a percent, the first time that has happened since 1959, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was President.
"The American consumer has more spending power," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "Between the strong dollar and the collapse in Asian currencies and the fact that oil prices are coming down so our heating bills are down, we can buy more goods than we used to."
While few shoppers looking for a break on the latest Gucci pump are likely to find one, those who frequent lower-priced or midpriced stores should see bigger bargains. Lower-end stores tend to buy more products from Asia, and have the most clout with their suppliers. Analysts believe that companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will lead the way with price cuts. The company declined to comment.
Stores that do a lot of their own private-label business in Asia have also benefited from the region's woes, although in many cases any gains are offset by the instability of suppliers, some of whom may not stay afloat. And Asian suppliers who buy their raw materials outside their country are being hammered by the currency ills, raising their costs.
But the savings to consumers are clearly beginning to trickle in. "We expect to receive price concessions from our existing overseas manufacturers, allowing us to pass on savings to our customers," said Terry J. Lundgren, president of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s merchandising unit. Federated owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as well as other department store chains.
In the consumer electronics business, which has also shown modest price decreases, retailers say that most of the price cuts are in products that have simply lost value with age. Nintendo 64, for example, sold for $249 at Toys "R" Us when it first came out; it can now be purchased for half that price.
The Import Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that prices of imported toys and various other electronic goods fell last month. Indeed, between March 1997 and March 1998, import prices of consumer goods (excluding autos) fell nine-tenths of a percent. "There is a strong correlation between price deflation and deflation in import prices," said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.
In some cases, while prices may not be falling, retailers are trying to beef up what they are getting for their money. "There are some opportunities for lower costs," said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, "and we are using that to improve and upgrade quality." Some furniture sold at the company's Target discount stores, for instance, will now have extra features for the same price, she said.
Of course, retailers, especially of things like computers and televisions, where margins are razor thin, would love to bolster their balance sheets with these savings. But with rare exception this will not be possible.
Most of the savings are occurring among routine commodity items, where competition is stiff and price is the main draw. "Retailers are so competitive," Mr. Glassman said, "that if one company gives consumers an edge, everyone else is forced to do it."
A hot brand can occasionally buck the tide, though.
"Hasbro's Star Wars action figures, which are assembled in Asia, went from $3.99 to $4.99," said Vincent Hester, the owner of Toys For All, a small toy store in Houston. "Mattel's Hot Wheels cars went from 79 cents to 89 cents, and I know those are all assembled in Asia or India. If prices are coming down, the companies manufacturing are making more money. The independent stores aren't seeing any price cuts."
Sean Fitzgerald, a spokesman for Mattel Inc., conceded that the cost of producing Hot Wheels cars, which are made in Malaysia, has fallen even as Mattel has raised wholesale prices, thus gaining an extra profit cushion. "But this is in the short term," he said. "The Asia situation is constantly fluctuating and changing daily."
Executives of Hasbro Inc. said that because all their Asian sourcing is done through China, where the currency has remained relatively stable, they have not gained ground. "We have not seen any appreciable benefit," said John T. O'Neill, the chief financial officer of Hasbro.
"The importers like Mattel have a choice," said Steve Radelet, an economist at Harvard University's Institute for International Development. "They can get stuff produced cheaper, but the extent to which they will cushion their own margins will differ from market to market."
While several retailers said they had yet to experience any of the price declines recorded by the statisticians at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, many economists said another wave of low-priced goods was about to hit. "We have seen a lot of stories about how Asia doesn't matter," Mr. Yardeni said. "But by the end of the year, a flood of imports will lead to a windfall for consumers."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Favorable Government Data Spur a Treasury Securities Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After declining all week on fear of an overheating economy and higher interest rates, Treasury securities surged yesterday for their biggest rally in six months, reacting to Government data showing surprisingly low inflation.
The relief in the bond market reflected greatly diminished expectations that the Federal Reserve is now inclined to raise interest rates to thwart inflationary pressure. Fear that the central bank would take such a step had been coursing through the market since Monday, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Fed policy makers favored raising rates. 
 Traders snapped up the Treasury's 30-year bond, sending it up 1 24/32, to 102 16/32 , the biggest one-day price gain since Oct. 27, when tumbling stocks caused an investor exodus into bonds. The 30-year bond's yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 5.94 percent, from 6.07 percent Wednesday and the lowest since April 21.
The catalysts for the bond rally, which sent stocks up sharply, were reports from the Labor and Commerce Departments that portrayed a strong economy with remarkably low inflationary pressures.
The Labor Department's Employment Cost Index rose seven-tenths of a percent in the first quarter, less than the nine-tenths expected. The Commerce Department's preliminary first-quarter gross domestic product figures, the first glimpse of how fast the economy grew from January through March, showed a strong 4.2 percent annual rate. Even so, the inflation component rose at only nine-tenths of a percent, the smallest increase in 34 years.
"Talk of rate increases over the past few days may prove to be just rumors now," said Roger Hamilton, vice president and portfolio manager for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. "Without ammunition, it's safe to assume the Fed will hold off on tightening and will not raise rates this time around. I suspect the bond market will rally over the next few days in light of the good news."
Analysts said the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report due today and next week's April employment data would provide the next important insights into the economy's pace. Many said they see the yield on the long bond confined to a range around 6 percent over the near term.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Green at Derby Gate: Fewer Starts for the Starters

BYLINE: By JAY PRIVMAN 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 30

 BODY:
When Indian Charlie, the morning-line favorite, enters the starting gate for the 124th Kentucky Derby on Saturday, he will be attempting to become the first horse in 83 years to win with no more than four career starts.
Not since the filly Regret, in 1915, has such a lightly raced horse been able to capture this demanding mile-and-one-quarter race, which now includes the distraction of having to run in front of more than 130,000 screaming fans at Churchill Downs. 
 This year, an added hurdle looms in the possibility of an off track from persistent rain.
But despite the potential liabilities of inexperience, the trend over the past four decades has been for 3-year-olds to have fewer starts leading up to the Derby. Of the 13 horses in the 1960 Kentucky Derby, the average number of pre-Derby starts was nearly 21. Cuvier Relic and Tony Graff, the most experienced horses, had run a demanding 39 times while the least-experienced horses, Divine Comedy and Henrijan, had run 12 times.
This year, only two horses -- Nationalore and Real Quiet -- have raced as many as 12 times. The 15 horses entered in Saturday's Derby average a mere 8.4 starts.
And no horse in the race has less experience than Indian Charlie, who has run four times and is undefeated, including a victory in the Santa Anita Derby.
There is contention within the racing industry as to why this trend has developed. Trainers and veterinarians said the reason is twofold -- horses are more fragile these days, and modern medical technology enables the animal's caretakers to spot small problems and curtail training before a larger problem emerges.
"I think we're breeding a weaker horse today," said Dr. Alex Harthill, a prominent Kentucky veterinarian. Harthill has helped care for more than 20 Derby winners, beginning with Citation in 1948, and is treating, among others, Cape Town this week.
"People also are learning to stop more at the first sign of swelling or puffiness," Harthill added. "A lot of people in olden times would say, 'That's all right, put some ice on it.' Now, you have X-rays and ultrasound. It's a big help to find things that otherwise might be hidden."
Commercial breeders contend that horses are as strong as ever but that the demands of year-round racing, coupled with lucrative prize money, force a trainer to push young animals. All three Triple Crown races -- the Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes -- have $1 million purses.
And the Derby prep races include such lucrative spots as the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby, $700,000 Blue Grass Stakes, $600,000 Jim Beam Stakes, and the Wood Memorial and Arkansas Derby, each worth $500,000.
"I personally don't believe we're breeding a less-sound horse," said Dan Rosenberg, the general manager of Three Chimneys Farm. Three Chimneys, situated 60 miles east of Louisville in Versailles, Ky., is one of this country's elite breeding farms. Its stallion roster includes such prized studs as Seattle Slew, his son Slew o' Gold, Rahy and Wild Again.
"It's a different economy," Rosenberg added. "There are bigger purses for 2-year-olds. There's more incentive to push early."
To be sure, American racing and, in lockstep, breeding have changed dramatically in the past 40 years.
The Kentucky Derby distance of a mile and one-quarter is still considered the truest test in American racing, but fewer other races are run at that distance, and fewer still at longer distances.
New York's premier distance race in the fall championship season, the Jockey Club Gold Cup, was a demanding two miles when it began in 1921. It was shortened to a mile and one-half in 1976, then to its current mile and one-quarter in 1990. The trend toward shorter races has fueled a breeding market seeking to satisfy that niche.
"We're breeding for brilliance, so we end up with very fast horses who don't stay sound," said Randy Bradshaw, who trains Derby entrant Artax. "It's the nature of the beast. We're asking these horses to go 35 miles an hour on ankles that are no bigger than our wrist. If you put too much pressure on them, they unravel."
It was not always so. Carry Back, the 1961 Derby winner, had made 28 starts before his date with destiny. Not until 1981 did the average number of starts by Derby entrants dip below 10.
Since 1985, however, the average number of starts for Derby runners never has been more than 10, and only twice has it been more than 9. In the last four years, the Derby winner has averaged slightly more than seven starts. By current standards, Indian Charlie's lack of experience is not as glaring.
"He doesn't need more seasoning," said Bob Baffert, the trainer of Indian Charlie. "It's not like we're going to eat the son of a gun."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Major Indexes Soar in Response to Benign Inflation News

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Major stock indexes soared yesterday, posting gains for the second consecutive day, after the latest economic data largely erased investor fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon.
Buyers leaped into the equity market on news of the Employment Cost Index and the gross domestic product, which signaled that inflation remained benign despite a strong pace of economic growth. 
 The surge in stocks was echoed in the bond market, where prices surged and yields fell.
Earlier in the week, stocks and bonds had fallen sharply on concerns that the Federal Reserve was set to increase interest rates to curb inflation pressure spurred by strong economic growth.
Yesterday, the Labor Department said employment costs for American businesses rose at a slower than expected pace during the first quarter, as shown by a seven-tenths of a percent rise in the Employment Cost Index. It was the smallest quarterly rise in the index, which is viewed as a broad measure of wage, salary and benefit costs, in two years.
In addition, the Commerce Department reported a 4.2 percent increase in the first-quarter gross domestic product, but that gain was tempered by a modest nine-tenths of a percent rise in a key inflation indicator, the price deflator. The gain was the smallest increase since 1964.
Stocks that perform well in a low- interest-rate environment rose, notably financial services concerns, including BankAmerica, Citicorp and Travelers Group. Drug companies and telecommunication stocks also led the gainers.
The reports "really confirmed that inflation is not a problem," said Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York, adding, "It was the shot in the arm the market needed."
"People were concerned that inflation would be just around the corner, but labor prices accelerated at a slower pace than expected," he said. "In the near term, I can't see the Fed doing anything for the next two to three months."
The data as well as relatively strong first-quarter earnings reports reaffirmed the positive economic outlook of the Bryn Mawr Trust Company, said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at the firm. Last week, the firm increased its equity allocation to 91 percent, reducing cash to 9 percent from 15 percent, Mr. Sichel said.
"Inflation is very, very benign and we are optimistic about the fundamentals of the economy," Mr. Sichel said. The newly invested cash was used in part to buy additional shares of drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan and technology shares like Intel and Lucent Technologies, he said.
But some analysts expressed caution regarding the resumed ebullience.
"Backward looking, things are fine," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International Inc.
But, he said, "the unmistakable trend is that inflation is accelerating for benefits and wages." He added: "It's still a bad trend and the market's going to have to deal with this reality further down the road.
"It's like your kid getting all A's on his tests, but refusing to study. You don't think it will last when the work gets harder."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,063.37, up 111.85 points, or 1.25 percent, erasing the vestiges of its 146.98-point tumble Monday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 17.12 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1,111.75.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 16.77 points, to 1,868.41
In the current environment, Mr. Bond said he was focusing less on stock valuations, and instead looking at the growth prospects for individual issues.
He said he favors financial services stocks and drug companies, as well as some of the large, multinational companies that pulled back in the recent downturn, such as Coca-Cola, General Electric, Intel and Microsoft.
"If you get too cute with valuations, you could miss a big move" in stock prices, he said. Internet-related shares, for example, are a good illustration of the trend, where valuations are high, but investors continue to buy shares in the belief they represent growth opportunities, he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is 'Encouraged' by Iraqi Progress on Arms Inspections

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was encouraged by Iraqi cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors and that he expected to reduce the number of American troops who are now deployed in the Persian Gulf region to keep watch on Iraq.
The President's remarks about Iraq were more conciliatory than those heard from other Administration officials in recent weeks, although Mr. Clinton appeared once again to rule out an early end to international sanctions that were imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
 "We are encouraged by the level of compliance so far with the U.N. inspections and by the evidence that has been adduced on the nuclear side that more progress has been made," Mr. Clinton said at a White House news conference.
Under threat of an American-led military attack earlier this year, the Government of President Saddam Hussein has allowed greater access to United Nations arms inspectors seeking evidence that Iraq has stockpiled chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
On Monday, the United Nations Security Council decided to extend sanctions against Iraq after inspectors reported that Iraq had a long way to go in accounting for chemical and biological arms.
Still, Mr. Clinton said there was good news in Baghdad's cooperation with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, an arm of the United Nations that polices nations for evidence that they are developing nuclear weapons.
The agency is close to declaring Iraq free of nuclear arms, an action that could allow Baghdad to avoid intrusive inspections of its nuclear programs in the future. In a report this month, the agency said its inspections had found no evidence "of prohibited equipment or materials."
Mr. Clinton said that "if Baghdad will continue to work with us," the United Nations could move by October to reduce the severity of the nuclear monitoring. "This is just the nuclear piece, but I am encouraged by that," he said.
The President's remarks will doubtless raise concern among arms control experts who have accused the Atomic Energy Agency of complacency and have said Iraq's record of deception and its wealth of talented scientists suggest that it could quickly recreate an atomic program once rigorous inspections end.
Mr. Clinton said he would wait for a Pentagon recommendation before removing any of the vast American military force that is now patrolling the Persian Gulf region. The force includes two aircraft carriers and more than 300 warplanes.
But he added, "Inevitably, unless we believe there is some reason for it to be there, at some point in the future I would anticipate some reallocation of our resources."
In response to other questions on foreign policy, the President rejected suggestions that the United States should lift its economic embargo on Cuba or allow the Government of Fidel Castro to be reinstated in the Organization of American States.
"To open up the O.A.S. or the Summit of the Americas process to a non-democratic nation, in my view, would be a big mistake," he said.
"This country stands for freedom and democracy," he continued. "We're fighting like crazy to preserve it in countries where it is very difficult to do so, where people literally put their lives on the line every day for freedom. And when people are out there risking their lives, we ought not to send the wrong signal."
Cuba was suspended from the Organization of American States in 1961, two years after Mr. Castro came to power.
Mr. Clinton said the embargo had "been useful, but I also believe that we should do more to minimize the damage to the Cuban people, which is why after the Pope's visit, I relaxed a lot of the restrictions on the transfer of food and medicine and on travel there." Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in January.

HEADLINE: Gang Rape of Three Girls Leaves Fresno Shaken, and Questioning

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., April 27

 BODY:
On the edge of this working-class city, along a highway not far from the vineyards and the strawberry and cotton fields on some of the richest farmland in the nation, as many as 20 men and boys crowded into a motel room three weeks ago for what the police said was a night of rape.
One by one, they repeatedly assaulted a 12-year-old girl and two 13-year-old girls, who the police said had walked into the motel room thinking they were going to get a ride home from a friend of a friend. 
 What happened on the night of April 6 has shaken many people in this central California city of 450,000 residents. But Fresno lost its small-town innocence years ago, in what the current Mayor, Jim Patterson, called an explosion of crime.
Some residents nicknamed Fresno "Little L.A.," but in the last few years, the crime rate is down, more officers are on patrol and people have been strolling the streets with a renewed confidence. Then three girls walked into room 115 at the Motel 6 on North Parkway Drive.
"Everybody is hurt by this," said Mayor Patterson. "This is one of those God-awful things that could stigmatize a community."
The authorities kept the attack quiet for two weeks while they investigated and tracked down suspects. But over the last several days, as the arrests began, the assault has been front page news here. Last Friday, a 24-year-old man was picked up at his home and a teen-ager was taken into custody at his high school, bringing the total under arrest in the attack to five adults, the oldest 31, and seven juveniles. The police are hunting for three to five more suspects.
The girls and their families have been chased into hiding by telephoned threats.
"We've had gang rapes occur before but not of this magnitude," said Lieut. Jerry Davis, the commander of the city's crimes-against-persons unit. "The crime itself is bad enough, but this was directed at children. It's mind boggling."
A rally is planned on Friday at California State University here to show support for the girls and to demonstrate to the community "that this could be your daughter, that this could happen to any of us," said Kathryn Forbes, a lecturer of women's studies at the university.
Sylvia A. Ogden, the county Victim Witness Service advocate assigned to the case, said: "Those little girls, will never be little girls again. It breaks your heart."
But everyone, from Fresno's Mayor to rape counselors, agree that what happened here could have happened anywhere, perhaps in a fraternity house or in a basement in a predominantly white suburb like Glen Ridge, N.J., where a group of high school football players sexually assaulted a mentally retarded teen-age girl with a bat and a stick in 1989.
Bernard Lefkowitz, who wrote a book about the assault in Glen Ridge, "Our Guys" (University of California Press, 1997), said: "For a lot of boys, acting abusively toward women is regarded as a rite of passage. It's woven into our culture."
Woven into Fresno's subculture are gangs, and the police report on the attack linked some suspects with one called the Mongolian Boys Society. There are a multitude of ethnic gangs here, including a white supremacist gang called the Peckerwoods. Experts on gangs say that the reasons for the high gang activity include Fresno County's 16.6-percent unemployment rate, largely attributable to a lack of manufacturing jobs and the seasonal nature of the region's No. 1 industry, agriculture.
There were 36 group rapes reported to the Rape Counseling Service of Fresno in 1997, and 50 percent of them appeared to be gang-related, said Lee Ann Eager, the service's executive director, who noted that 50 percent were not. Elizabeth Mitchell, the prosecutor in charge of the Fresno County District Attorney's sex crimes unit, said the assault appeared to "have been planned from the get go," adding, "It was anticipated that this was what the room was rented for."
The three girls had apparently run away from home and were stranded about 30 miles south of Fresno when they decided to return to their families. One girl called a friend of a friend for a ride, according to the police report.
The person they called picked them up, but as he drove them home, he said he needed to stop at the motel and visit a cousin. When the girls walked in the room about 9 P.M., the police said, men were already there. One girl was taken into the bathroom and raped several times, according to the police report, and the other two girls were also raped.
When one boy in the motel room went in the bathroom, he closed the door and told one girl he would call for help, Sgt. Tim McFadden of the sex-crime unit said. The girl asked the boy to call her father, who then called the police.
The Fresno Bee reported that when officers arrived at 12:30 A.M. on April 7, most of the men and boys had left, and the officers failed to take the names of those who remained because they had not been aware that a crime had taken place.
The girls' parents were called to take them home. The girls did not report that they had been raped until the next day, April 8.
City officials insist that the officers followed proper procedures, and did take the names of the three men still in the room and allowed them to leave because no one reported a crime. The officials said the delay in making arrests had been to gather as much information before the suspects could leave the city.
Ms. Eager, the director of the Fresno rape center, said people had called her office asking if the girls had been wearing sexy clothing or if they had done something to provoke the attack. One man called to say that because the girls had walked into the motel room, it was not fair to call it rape. Ms. Eager said she silently counted to 10, then to 20, before responding: "The punishment for bad judgment is not rape, for three little girls or for anyone else."
Last weekend, as the arrests were under way, about a dozen teen-agers gathered in the library of a Fresno County Boys and Girls Club, an oasis from places like the motel room on the edge of town. A 15-year-old boy said that after he heard about the rape, he ran home and begged his mother not to let his younger sister out for a week.
Martha Moreno, 13, said she had not been surprised by what happened because too many boys "think girls are their slaves."
"If you try to stand up for yourself, they want to fight you and call you names," she said. "Boys are stupid. That's the main problem."
 The other girls in the room laughed, but Martha did not.
"It really scared me when I heard about what happened," she said. "It makes you think anything can happen to you. But I still tell boys, I'm not a slave."

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Is Star at a Rally for Kennelly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, April 30

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a talk here this morning, "Women: Finding and Raising Your Voice," but later in the day she had another mission: finding and raising money.
Mrs. Clinton did a star turn this afternoon for Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the likely Democratic nominee for governor, and helped the eight-term Congresswoman raise more than $100,000. 
 The First Lady was part of an afternoon rally that underscored the Kennelly campaign's strategy of trying to use a woman-to-woman appeal to defeat the incumbent Republican, Gov. John G. Rowland.
A crowd of about 700 people -- about two-thirds of them women -- gathered in the Shubert Theater here, at a $100-a-ticket event sponsored by Women for Kennelly, under the motto, "The power of women will put women in power." Before Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Kennelly took the stage, a tape of the Aretha Franklin song "Respect" was pumped into the hall, and one speaker suggested that it should become the campaign song.
"Every race I ever have run," Mrs. Kennelly said, "women have made the difference, and they're going to make the difference for me this fall."
This was the latest in a series of moves over the last few weeks by the Kennelly campaign to seek to distinguish Mrs. Kennelly's views from Mr. Rowland's.
Mrs. Kennelly began today with an issue, child care, that appeared to be well suited for her audience. She contended that Mr. Rowland had failed to provide affordable quality child care, saying that the state had 15 inspectors to check conditions in 7,000 programs and that sending a child to day care could cost as much as sending them to a state college.
Mrs. Clinton, who was greeted by a rousing standing ovation, remarked that while Connecticut has the nation's highest average per capita income, it also has the largest gap between the rich and the poor and three of the country's poorest cities. "How could this happen?" she asked, adding that the conclusion was "inescapable."
"For the last couple of years, you have not had the leadership you need," she said.
But there is no question that persuading voters to accept that position will be an uphill battle. A poll conducted by The Hartford Courant and the University of Connecticut earlier this month indicated that 71 percent of those surveyed had a favorable impression of Mr. Rowland and that he would defeat Mrs. Kennelly, 50 percent to 28 percent, if the election were held this month.
Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, said today that the state has its lowest unemployment rate in 10 years and that growth in the gap between the rich and the poor was the result of wealthy people making more money, not poor people getting less. Though Mrs. Kennelly may criticize the state's child care system, Mr. Pagani said Connecticut set aside tens of millions of dollars last year to expand it.
Mr. Pagani also questioned Mrs. Clinton's point about caring for the cities -- an issue her husband rarely raised in the Presidential campaign two years ago -- noting that the theater she spoke in today was being restored with $700,000 from the state government.
And there were questions about what Mrs. Clinton's and women's support would actually mean for Mrs. Kennelly. Along with the event at the Shubert, Mrs. Clinton also attended a $1,000-a-seat luncheon at a private club here to raise money for Mrs. Kennelly, as well as speaking in the morning at Yale Divinity School to students and faculty, on "Women: Finding and Raising Your Voice."
Although Mrs. Kennelly's supporters said that having Mrs. Clinton here could only help, one student at this morning's event, Jeffrey MacDonald, asked in a question-and-answer session whether what a former Presidential adviser, Dick Morris, had written was true: that he had counseled President Clinton to keep Mrs. Clinton from having a prominent public role in his 1996 campaign.
Mrs. Clinton responded, "I don't think that's an accurate description at all."

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Grew at Brisk Pace This Winter Despite Crisis in Asia

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a surprisingly strong pace this winter, and inflation remained unexpectedly subdued, the Government reported yesterday.
Instead of slowing down as the Asian recession hit American manufacturers, the economy picked up speed, growing at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. And instead of drifting higher as Washington and Wall Street feared, the broadest measure of inflation dipped below 1 percent to its lowest rate since 1964. 
 "We keep expecting a slowdown and it never comes," said Jeffrey A. Frankel of the Council of Economic Advisers. "We're returning to the economy of the 50's and 60's -- a remarkable, remarkable combination of strong growth without inflation."
Investors had been worrying that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise interest rates, a concern that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting more than 140 points on Monday. Yesterday, they decided to focus on the good news on inflation, which touched off rallies in the stock and bond markets, with the Dow climbing 111.85 points, to 9,063.37.
A Labor Department report suggested that wage inflation was not much of a problem despite a tight labor market. The Employment Cost Index rose a mere seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, more slowly than in the previous quarter and far less than economists had expected.
President Clinton called the data more evidence of an "American economic renaissance," boasting that growth was not being "fueled by big Government deficits" -- an apparent reference to the recovery during the Reagan Administration -- and dismissed the notion that the economy was bubbling over with speculative excesses. He gave much of the credit for the economy's performance to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
The Federal Reserve was probably as surprised by the economy's strength as private forecasters were. And the central bank, like private forecasters, still expects the economy to shift into lower gear on its own over the next few months. The annual growth rate has been greater than 3 percent for six consecutive quarters, well above the 2.4 percent rate that the Clinton Administration considers the long-run historical norm. The question is how and when the economy will slow.
Most forecasters expect the Asian economic crisis to do the job. Indeed, falling exports and soaring imports trimmed $41 billion from the gross domestic product in the first quarter. But a burst of domestic spending -- by consumers, home builders and businesses -- more than offset the drag from the widening trade deficit.
And it is possible that some of the winter's strength was borrowed from the spring as consumers and construction companies took advantage of mild weather. If so, growth will be somewhat slower in the current quarter.
"If we don't slow down in the second quarter, watch out," said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs. "The Fed will have to tighten, and they'll do it more than we think."
While growth was led by exports earlier in this expansion, strong domestic demand is fueling it now.
Consumer spending was remarkably strong in the first quarter, rising at a 5.7 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in six years. Spending on cars, appliances and home furnishings jumped at a 20 percent rate. Consumers also bought a great deal of clothing. Though their spending on services was dampened by lower utility bills, outlays on other services -- everything from vacations to psychiatrists -- rose smartly.
Consumers are in remarkably good financial shape, one reason that they are expressing greater confidence than ever. Household net worth has swelled by $1 trillion in the last three months as the stock market has climbed. Total wage and salary income for all Americans has been growing extremely fast as more people find jobs and corporations raise pay. It is 7 percent higher than a year ago, whereas inflation is up just 1.5 percent. The income growth has been so strong, in fact, that the personal saving rate rose in the first quarter to more than 4 percent -- despite all the shopping.
In recent months, moreover, consumers have benefited from some real bargains. The rise in the dollar has led to lower prices for imports. On top of that, oil prices have dropped sharply. Together, Goldman, Sachs estimates, they were the equivalent of a $14 billion tax cut.
As all the furniture buying implies, home building surged in the first quarter. The pace of new-home construction, which rose at a 17.6 percent annual rate this winter, was the strongest in four years. A mild winter in many parts of the country, lower mortgage rates and the rise in household net worth all contributed.
Households were not the only ones spending. Businesses continued to gear up. Purchases of equipment -- everything from jumbo jets and trucks to laptops and cell phones -- soared at a 29 percent annual rate. Factory and office building, however, remained weak.
The flip side to the high-powered domestic demand during the winter was a sudden onset of weakness on the foreign side. Exports, which remained strong through last spring, declined outright at a $9 billion annual rate -- the direct effect of the recession in Asia. With factory utilization high and unemployment low, strong domestic demand was bound to pull in a wave of imports. Imports grew at a strong 11.6 percent annual rate. The resulting deterioration in the trade balance knocked $41 billion from the gross domestic product.
Economists are divided over whether the trade deficit will continue to deteriorate during the year. If domestic demand remains strong, imports will provide a safety valve.
Inventory investment continued at a rapid clip in the first quarter, but with final sales soaring there was no sign that goods were piling up either at wholesalers' warehouses or retail stores, and the inventory-to-sales ratio remains comfortable. That is not quite as true at factories, where inventory accumulation jumped to a pace of nearly $30 billion, compared with $22 billion last fall. That apparent pileup is probably another sign of the sudden slowdown of demand for United States exports in Asia and may presage some moderation in manufacturing activity -- a development hinted at by yesterday's report by the Chicago Purchasing Management Association.
Investors had been bracing for signs of wage inflation. Very few were to be found in yesterday's quarterly report on wage and benefit costs. For several years, the shift to managed health care and the rising stock market helped hold benefit cost increases to a minimum. Now, with insurers and managed care companies raising their rates, economists expect benefit costs to rise faster. Health benefit costs did indeed pick up, rising 2.2 percent compared with two-tenths of 1 percent a year earlier. But, as the Bureau of Labor Commissioner, Katherine Abraham, pointed out, the rise was partly offset by smaller increases in the cost of legally required benefits, like unemployment insurance and workers' compensation.

HEADLINE: Treasury's No. 2 Rebuts Tobacco Arguments

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
A top Administration economist today rebutted the central arguments that cigarette makers had made against tobacco legislation before the Senate as President Clinton urged the companies to return to negotiations.
The rebuttal came from the Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, who told Congress that the Government's economic analyses showed that neither a black market in cigarettes nor tobacco industry bankruptcies would result from a bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee this month. 
 The major cigarette makers announced within the past month that they were abandoning further negotiations with Congress in large part because they thought Congress was on a course that would lead to contraband cigarettes and would drive some companies out of business.
Tobacco executives also accused the President of double-crossing them. White House officials were instrumental in the settlement the industry reached with state attorneys general last June, but Mr. Clinton has sought measures this year that would be much tougher.
The Commerce Committee's bill, scheduled to be taken up on the Senate floor the week before Memorial Day, would raise the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years, much more than the June settlement, and would give the industry little of the protection it seeks from smokers' lawsuits.
Asked at his news conference today about the companies' walkout, Mr. Clinton replied, "I think it would be better if they were at the table."
He said some parts of the Senate legislation, like restraints on cigarette advertising, might not be possible without the industry's assent.
In a backhanded way, the President also threatened to use the tobacco issue against Republicans in elections this fall if Congress did not approve a strong bill.
"I do not want this to be an issue in the November election," he said, and then repeated the sentence slowly for emphasis. Then he added:
"If it is an issue in the November election, it will only be because those people who have a political or financial interest in seeing that this matter is not resolved between now and November prevent it from being resolved. The worst thing in the world would be to play politics with our children's health. I'm not going to do it, and I hope no one else will."
Mr. Summers, who was one of the country's foremost academic economists before joining the Government, made his comments in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said a black market in cigarettes could be avoided if strict licensing requirements were set for manufacturers, distributors, retail sellers, exporters and importers of tobacco products; if cigarette packs were carefully stamped for domestic or foreign distribution, and if enforcement against smuggling was strengthened.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the committee, was skeptical. Holding up a pack of Chinese cigarettes, Mr. Hatch said, "My concern is that we're going to be flooded with this stuff."
As for the financial future of the tobacco industry, Mr. Summers said the Government's analyses showed that a measure like the one approved by the Commerce Committee could cut industry profits by 23 percent a year. But he said that the industry was extremely profitable and that it was not likely that such a measure would have "any decisive impact on the industry's overall health."
While the Senate is preparing to debate tobacco legislation on the floor next month, the matter is on hold in the House. House Republican leaders have expressed a desire to tie an anti-smoking measure to one meant to combat drug use.
Today, the leaders called a news conference to present their drug bill. Among other items, it would crack down on drug trafficking and strengthen the Border Patrol, but no mention was made of tobacco.
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads the House Commerce Committee, told Republican leaders this week that he and the top Democrats on his committee could agree on secondary matters in tobacco legislation, like strengthening the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority, and could produce a bill that did not deal with the main issues. They are the price of cigarettes and protection from lawsuits based on illness caused by smoking. The leaders, those at the meeting said, were not enthusiastic about this approach and told Mr. Bliley to set the issue aside, at least temporarily.

Strength Without Inflation, Latest Data Show
The economy grew at a surprisingly strong 4.2 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter and the broadest measure of inflation fell to the lowest level in 34 years. 
 The data defied predictions that the Asian recession had begun to afflict American manufacturers and that inflationary pressure from the economy's prolonged expansion had finally started showing up. Page A1.
 
Stocks and bonds leaped in reaction to the economic data, which diminished investor fears of impending inflation that would lead to higher interest rates. The stock rally, led by financial, drug and telecommunications shares, sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 111.85 points, or 1.25 percent, its second consecutive gain, erasing the vestiges of a 146.98-point tumble Monday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose for the biggest
one-day gain in six months, and its yield fell to 5.94 percent from 6.07, the lowest since April 21. D7.
 
Airline Alliance Reached After Delay
United and Delta agreed on a broad marketing alliance after a weeklong delay caused by resistance from Delta's pilots. The linkup still requires pilot union approval. D2.
 
NBC's Marketing Experiment
NBC has taken the first steps toward a regular business in direct marketing to viewers through "800" phone numbers. A1.
 
EMI Shares Rise on Merger Talk
Shares of EMI Group rose 16 percent after the troubled British music company confirmed it was in merger talks with an unidentified suitor, believed to be Seagram. D3.
 
U.S. Favors Indonesia Payment
The United States is preparing to back a $1 billion payment in I.M.F. aid to Indonesia, despite evidence that President Suharto's family and friends are trying to protect monopolies they control. A1.
 
Shake-Up in Pepsi's Marketing
Stung by the lagging performance of its flagship brand, the Pepsi-Cola Company is restructuring the leadership of its marketing for all soft drinks. Pepsi-Cola said its chief global marketing officer, Brian Swette, would leave at the end of the month, replaced by a three-executive marketing council. Complaints about Pepsi's marketing had persisted for some time. D4.
 
Ad Sales Lift CBS's Net
Strong advertising sales, thanks in part to the Winter Olympics, bolstered earnings at CBS. It was the first profitable quarter that did not include an asset sale in nearly two years. D6.
 
MCI Sees Revenue Growth
MCI Communications said first-quarter profit before gains and charges fell 48 percent, but the decline was less than expected. D2.
 
Boeing Wins Big Defense Contract
The Pentagon awarded a $1.6 billion contract to Boeing to oversee the design and testing of a national defense system that integrates satellites and missiles. D2.
 
Cornell's Wall Street Benefactor
Sanford I. Weill, Wall Street deal maker, chief executive of Travelers Group and Cornell alumnus, said he and his wife had pledged $100 million to Cornell's medical college. B3.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Awkward Answers

 BODY:
In his first solo news conference since December, President Clinton gave his usual fluid performance, but it was obvious that he has paid a high price for his silence on the allegations about Monica Lewinsky. Most of Mr. Clinton's feelings came across through innuendo and body language. His repeated ducking of questions seemed defensive, argumentative and yet uncharacteristically passive. Asked whether his behavior should even matter to Americans, the President all but shrugged and said he was "in some ways the last person who needs to be having a national conversation about this." For a man addicted to conversation, it was a revealing answer.
The President's lawyers have no doubt advised him to maintain his silence, just as lawyers might do for any target of a criminal investigation. But a narrow legal strategy will not help him restore Americans' faith in his character, even if they approve the way he has handled the economy. 
 As we have said repeatedly, Mr. Clinton needs to find some way to assure Americans troubled over the nature of his relationship to a young White House intern and the difficulty that so many of his aides went to in order to find her a job. Instead of taking that route, he made clear that the day that he would address such questions was in the far, receding future.
As for Kenneth Starr, Mr. Clinton spoke disdainfully of the investigation lasting "forever -- 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years," and suggested that he would be willing to wait at least that long to clear things up himself. He argued that polls showing that Americans have a low regard for his moral character have resulted from an organized smear campaign rather than anything he has done himself.
At every opportunity, he turned the other cheek so fast that he seemed to be spinning around in circles. It was self-serving spin at that, depicting Mr. Starr and Newt Gingrich as partisans and himself as the victim of a puzzling vendetta. For those who admire Mr. Clinton's rhetorical skills, it was an effective blending of signals. But for those who think the Presidency carries a duty of candor and full, frequent answers to troubling questions, this rare press conference was far less satisfying.
We have little patience for Mr. Starr's assertion that there is "no end in sight" to his inquiry. But by dodging questions and encouraging disrespect for a duly appointed Independent Counsel, Mr. Clinton is doing his own bit to prolong the investigation and drive down the polls rating his character.

HEADLINE: Steinbrenner Delays Move On Stadium

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Concerned about the intense political maneuvering over whether -- and where -- to build a new stadium for the New York Yankees, George M. Steinbrenner 3d will not make a decision about the ball club's future home until after the baseball season ends in the fall, his advisers say.
In addition, the advisers said, Mr. Steinbrenner has been talking to former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo about joining an advisory panel to help him determine his next step in the debate over whether to leave the Yankees' storied home in the Bronx for one that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is considering on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 Mr. Cuomo is one of several consultants Mr. Steinbrenner is courting, executives close to the Yankees organization said. They said that others include Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting firm with a large sports practice, and HOK Sports Facilities Group, the Kansas City architectural firm that designed the celebrated Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and Coors Stadium in Denver.
Executives close to Mr. Steinbrenner said that while the Yankees organization appreciated the efforts of Mayor Giuliani to keep the team in New York City, it had become concerned with the furor surrounding the Mayor's proposal that city tax money be used to help finance a new stadium.
The Mayor has said that building a new Manhattan stadium is more economically beneficial than refurbishing Yankee Stadium in the Bronx or building a new stadium near it. But several city officials, from the Speaker of the City Council to the Manhattan Borough President, say that the Yankees belong in the Bronx and complain that the Mayor has not included them in any discussions.
"The Yankees were beside themselves," said one executive who is close to the Yankee organization but who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The whole controversy is counterproductive. That's why it's preposterous for Rudy to run around this way."
As he has done consistently in the debate over the future of Yankee Stadium, Mr. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, declined to comment yesterday. But those close to the negotiations said that Mr. Steinbrenner wanted to remove the Yankees entirely from the politically charged atmosphere of an election year that includes a race for New York State Governor, involving both Gov. George E. Pataki and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Cuomo, who is now a partner at Wilkie, Farr & Gallagher, acknowledged that he had been talking with Mr. Steinbrenner "for a long time," although he declined to define his role. The Yankees had assumed that there would be little discussion about a stadium in an election year, Mr. Cuomo said. "Then bing, it's on the front burner," he added. "And they're talking about a referendum that could kill you.
"The Yankees want to speak now that everyone else has spoken. A lot of people have half-baked ideas. My understanding is that the Yankees want to speak as clearly as they can, given all the voices being heard around them: the Mets, the Mayor, Vallone. They feel they should be speaking now."
Mr. Cuomo has some experience with Mr. Steinbrenner. In the mid-1980's, he and former Mayor Edward I. Koch negotiated unsuccessfully with Mr. Steinbrenner over a 30-year extension on the team's lease at the stadium in the Bronx. In 1993, Mr. Cuomo warned that "there was a real danger that New York might lose the Yankees," and began exploring other potential sites for a stadium, including the rail yards on the West Side. But he lost his bid for re-election in 1994 to Mr. Pataki.
"My personal interest is in New York State and New York City," Mr. Cuomo said. "I love baseball and the Yankees."
As Mr. Steinbrenner and his aides debated how to broach publicly the subject of stadium location, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone intensified their unusual battle over the issue. Both said they would employ the little-used powers vested in them by the City Charter to block each other's plans; both accused each other of political chicanery.
Mr. Giuliani delivered the latest volley yesterday. He announced that he was creating a Charter Revision Commission that would come up with recommendations to improve the charter. But he acknowledged that the purpose of the commission -- created so suddenly that its members have not been appointed and its cost to the taxpayers is unknown -- was primarily to block Mr. Vallone's plans for a referendum that would ask voters whether the city should help finance a new stadium for the Yankees.
The specifics of the Mayor's strategy, developed after his lawyers had pored over the language of the State Municipal Home Rule Law like scholars studying Sanskrit, hinges on a clause that has never before been invoked. Simply put, the plan would have the commission raise a charter question that would be placed on November's ballot; and the appearance of any Mayor-sponsored charter question would, under state law, knock Mr. Vallone's question off the ballot.
In doing so, Mr. Giuliani broke an agreement that he and Mr. Vallone reached earlier this year to disband dueling charter commissions that each had set up to study the respective powers of the Mayor's office and City Council. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he revived his charter commission because he had become concerned in recent weeks that "city government is going to be used in a partisan, political way."
He said that he was concerned by several of the Council's plans, but one in particular: Mr. Vallone's referendum proposal, which the Mayor believes would handcuff the city in negotiations with the Yankees.
"If we submitted the city's negotiations with businesses to referendums, we would become a city government ruled by referendums and public-opinion polls," he said. He later added: 'If we get into the knee-jerk action of doing that, you might as well do away with government and just have public-opinion polls on television, like QVC."
But aides to Mr. Vallone argued that Mr. Giuliani was loath to allow the question to be brought to a vote because the West Side proposal -- which could cost private investors and the public more than $1 billion -- was extremely unpopular.
As for the Mayor's maneuver, Mr. Vallone's aides said that they still had options available, including a lawsuit or, possibly, the creation of the Council's own charter commission whose questions would be allowed to share ballot space with any proposal by the Mayor.
The Speaker also questioned the propriety of creating a charter commission to further the Mayor's political agenda. "These people would have to all participate in a public sham," he said of those who would serve on the Mayor's commission.
City Council staff members acknowledged that the Speaker and the Council already had the power to challenge the Mayor's plans for building a new stadium; the charter gives the Council great say on issues of land use and public financing. Nevertheless, Mr. Vallone defended the referendum option by saying, "I want to keep the Yankees in the Bronx and I think the fans should have a say in the matter."
But aides to Mr. Giuliani -- and even those who advise Mr. Vallone -- said that the Democratic Speaker's push for a referendum had a political component as well, his campaign for Governor. By having a referendum on the November ballot, particularly one centering on an emotional issue like baseball, Mr. Vallone would give a much-needed lift to his name recognition and insure a higher voter turnout.
"If you're going to be intellectually honest about this -- which may be a lot to ask -- you know why it's being done," Mr. Giuliani said to a reporter. "It's being done because there's an election in November, and somebody's trying to drive up the vote."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Wide Web

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
As President, Bill Clinton has often agonized over using force. But tonight he presided over one of the most dramatic expansions of the American military umbrella in 50 years, as the Senate voted to approve his plan to bring Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the NATO alliance.
Despite the seeming paradox, Mr. Clinton's carefully plotted expansion of NATO crystallizes his overall foreign policy goal. 
 Through a series of ever-tightening security, cultural and economic alliances, President Clinton hopes to enmesh as many nations as possible in what he has called a "web of institutions and arrangements," that protects and guides those within "while isolating those who challenge them from the outside."
It is the country most pointedly left outside today -- Russia -- that defines the risks of the President's historic gamble in Europe. Whether expanding the alliance into Central Europe makes Russia feel threatened in the coming decades will ultimately determine the wisdom of this move.
In remarks before the vote, Mr. Clinton framed it in epic terms, predicting that it would help realize "a dream of a generation, a Europe that is united, democratic and secure for the first time since the rise of nation states on the European continent."
Maybe. Maybe the naysayers who warn that expansion will alienate Russia and inflame its nationalists will be proven wrong. Maybe Mr. Clinton will successfully define a new mission for NATO, as he has suggested, that goes beyond guarding against Russia to protecting against post-cold-war threats like terrorism, ethnic hatred and environmental degradation.
Certainly, by drawing three Central European nations into NATO, the United States guarantees itself enhanced influence in the region just as European nations are fusing into a formidable economic bloc that could become an American rival. This weekend the European Union formally begins preparations for a new single currency.
In the near term, there can be no doubt that the vote tonight was a political victory for a President who badly needed one, from a Congress in no mood to grant him one. The importance was underscored by the fact that the vote followed by hours the latest indictment of Webster L. Hubbell, Mr. Clinton's old friend and former appointee, this time on tax charges.
In the kind of coincidence that dogs this Presidency, Mr. Clinton's latest great success over NATO, the summit meeting in Paris at which Russia acceded to the expansion, came as the Supreme Court permitted the Paula C. Jones sexual-misconduct lawsuit to proceed.
Mr. Clinton's aides were delighted with the vote, in part because they regard NATO expansion, as one put it, as pure Clinton, his from conception through development and now into implementation.
Unlike Washington's involvement in Bosnia or Somalia, NATO expansion was not a foreign policy headache that Mr. Clinton inherited from George Bush. It was a potential headache that he created for himself. But a combination of political calculation, good timing and methodical lobbying produced the vote tonight.
Mr. Clinton first committed himself to expanding NATO in January 1994, when he declared in Prague that doing so was no longer a question of whether, but when. His NATO campaign had just received support from an unexpected quarter -- the strong showing in the December 1993 Russian parliamentary elections of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a far-right nationalist. Suddenly, Russia seemed like a potentially scary place again.
In 1995, Mr. Clinton received another boost from the decision to use NATO forces to quell ethnic violence in Bosnia. The mission demonstrated that the alliance could play a useful role in Europe, even with the Soviet Union dismantled.
The President began his final push for NATO expansion in the fall of 1996, when he declared that he wanted to add a first batch of new nations by 1999, the 50th birthday of the alliance. It was no accident that Mr. Clinton made his announcement in a campaign speech. The Democrats viewed expanding NATO as a prime enticement to the critical swing voters that pollsters call "white ethnics," particularly Polish-American voters.
Republicans were interested in the same group. And more conservative Republicans were inclined toward bringing more nations into NATO for another reason. They viewed doing so as consolidating Ronald Reagan's gains in the cold war. Indeed, House Republicans had called for NATO expansion as part of their 1994 Contract With America.
In the campaign, Bob Dole's only complaint about Mr. Clinton's NATO policy was that he was moving too slowly.
Still, Mr. Clinton had to walk a fine line in selling his NATO policy to the Senate over the last year. He had to reassure liberal Democrats that expansion would not anger Russia, without antagonizing conservatives who favored expansion precisely because they saw it as a bulwark against Russian backsliding. The President finessed that problem for tonight's vote, but he has not solved it.
Conservatives are quite likely to push for more nations to join, right up to the Russian border, although further expansion is sure to provoke the Russians.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, born a Czech and for whom NATO expansion has profound personal meaning, has argued that embracing Central European nations will actually help integrate Russia into Europe.
"If we want Russia to complete its transformation into a modern European power, the last thing we should do is act as if Central Europe is still a Russian sphere of influence," Ms. Albright wrote on Wednesday in an opinion article in The New York Times.
But what then is this newly expanded NATO for? NATO's first Secretary General, Lord Ismay, famously said that the alliance had a threefold purpose, keeping "the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down."
Of that triad, NATO clearly continues to serve only the first goal. For a former Arkansas Governor who came to appreciate the power of international trade from numerous missions abroad for his state, that may be enough.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference on Investigations and Middle East

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
Before I take your questions, I'd like to make a few comments on a couple of matters that I believe are essential to the strength of America in the 21st century. 
 Five years ago, we started a new economic course for a new economy, a combined strategy of fiscal discipline, expanded trade, increased investment in education, science, technology and our people. Today, we received more good news that that strategy is working. The latest economic report shows that in the first quarter of 1998 our economy grew at 4.2 percent. Wages are rising while inflation remains low. This expansion is not fueled by big government deficits but by booming business investment.
In the first quarter, unemployment was the lowest in 28 years, inflation the lowest in 30 years, consumer confidence at its highest level in 30 years. For five years in a row now, our economy has been rated the most competitive in the world.
We are living in an American economic renaissance in which opportunity is abundant, communities are getting stronger, families are more secure and more prosperous.
But we cannot allow the hum of our growing prosperity to lull us into complacency. As estimates of the possible budget surplus expand, so, too, the suggestions that we immediately commit to spending that surplus on tax cuts and new spending. But Americans have worked too hard for too long to put our economic house in order, so I will strongly resist the use of a single penny of the surplus until we have first saved Social Security for the new century.
Nor can we turn our backs on America's responsibility to lead in the world. We see that, by the way, in the commitment today of the Vice President and Mrs. Gore as they represent our nation on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel.
Today the health of our economy is also deeply affected by what goes on in global affairs and by the health of the global economy. Therefore I call on Congress to step up to its responsibility and renew our commitment to the International Monetary Fund and to pay our United Nations dues.
I am confident we can do this in a bipartisan fashion. The debate over NATO enlargement has been a model of bipartisan action. I want to thank Senators Lott and Daschle, Senators Helms and Biden for their leadership on this issue. I hope for a strongly positive vote in the Senate later today. Because by admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic we come even closer than ever to realizing a dream of a generation: a Europe that is united, democratic and secure for the first time since the rise of nation-states on the European continent.
At the threshold of the 21st century, we are on the rise at home and abroad. But we have to continue this progress. We have to continue to work if we want economic advances and strong national security. We have to continue to work if we hope to overcome our divisions at home and work together as one nation.
We can be everything that all of you want us to be and all Americans want us to be, but I want to emphasize the fact that we are doing well today should not be a source of complacency. It should not be a pretext to drift off into politics as usual or small matters. We need to bear down and deal with the long-term challenges of the country. . . .
Q. Mr. President, in view of a new court ruling, Monica Lewinsky may have to appear before a grand jury. Under the circumstances, do you stand by your previous denials of any relationship with her or that anyone encouraged her to lie? And while I have the floor, do you think that the special prosecutor has gone beyond the call and is out to get you?
A. Well, I think modestly observant people are fully capable of drawing their own conclusions to the latter question. And as to the former question, I have answered it repeatedly and have nothing to add to my former answer. I have repeatedly said what the answer to that question is.
Q. Mr. President, Wall Street is back above 9100 and the Dow was up 165 points at 1 o'clock. A lot of Americans are pouring money into the stock market now. Do you think that this stock market bubble is going to burst? Do you think people should be nervous about that?
A. Now I didn't comment on it when it dropped a lot. And I don't think I should now. . . .
Q. The Pentagon said this week you're expected to decide whether to reduce U.S. forces in the gulf soon. Has Baghdad made sufficient progress on allowing weapons inspections to permit a reduction in force? And if so, will we see an ending of the sanctions against Iraq?
A. Well those are two very different questions. Let me say first of all, we are encouraged about the level of compliance so far with the U.N. inspections and by the evidence that has been educed by the nuclear side that more progress has been made. And I believe we've already issued a statement that we believe that if Baghdad will continue to work with us that by October we can, the U.N. may well be able to certify that they are actually in compliance on the nuclear side and they can go from the inspection to the monitoring phase.
Keep in mind, even under the agreements, the U.N. resolution, no matter what is found out in any of these areas, there will still be a monitoring regime there.
Our position on lifting the sanctions is that, these, the U.N. resolutions, have to be complied with completely and then we'd vote to lift the sanctions. So this is just a nuclear peace. But I am encouraged by that.
Now, on the question of reducing our military presence in the gulf, I would wait for a recommendation from the Pentagon with involvement from the State Department and the N.S.C. on that. . . .
Q. Mr. President, quite a few Americans seem to believe it doesn't matter what you may have done in private moments, that's between you and your wife. And some are saying it doesn't even matter if you've broken the law, obstructed justice or committed perjury. Now you deny wrongdoing, I understand, but as a standard for Presidents what do you think: Does it matter what you do in private moments, as alleged? And particularly does it matter if you have committed perjury or in other sense broken the law?
A. Well, since I have answered the underlying questions, I really believe it's important for me not to say any more about this. I think that I'm, in some ways, the last person who needs to be having a national conversation about this.
What I'm trying to, I may be the leader, but my job as leader is to lead the country. And to deal with the great public issues facing the country and to prove Justice Scalia right when he said that nothing that could be done to me in a legal way would in any way affect my job as President. It would be just one of those things, and I could go right on and do my job. And I'm going to do my best to prove him correct, by doing the public's business. . . .
Q. Ken Starr supporters make the case that he could be wrapping up his investigation except for the delaying tactics put forward by your lawyers, your aides. Specifically, the privilege asserts denying the Secret Service the right to testify, denying some of your aides the right to testify, denying the First Lady the right to answer certain questions, because of these privileged questions. And a lot of Americans are having a hard time understanding, why assert privilege if there's nothing to hide?
A. First of all, you've asked three questions. Let me deal with them.
On the First Lady's testimony, Mr. Kendall's response blows what they said out of the water better than anything I could say. And amounts to a shame on them for saying that.
Secondly, with regard to the Secret Service, I literally have had no involvement in that decision whatever. That is a decision that they have made based on what they believe. The position they've taken is a position they've taken based on what they believe is best for the institution of the Presidency. And the court will just have to evaluate their arguments and make a judgment.
Now, thirdly, on the claims of executive privilege, I cannot comment on those matters because they are under seal. However, as you know, we have suggested to the court that the pleadings and the briefs be made public, be open to public inspection so that you and the American people could evaluate the specific executive privilege issue and whether you believe they're valid or not. But I can't talk about them, you know, our side has tried to honor all these court orders and I want to continue to honor it. We've asked, it's under seal, I can't discuss it. But I will do my best to deal with this in an appropriate way. And if the court changes the rules, I hope that we'll be able to release the pleadings and the briefs so that all of you can see what this is about and draw your own conclusions and then ask questions about it. . . .
Q. Mr. President, can we come back to the Middle East? What do you think is the strategy of the Russian states toward the the Middle East at this point? And what are you expecting from the London talks next week? Is there a Russian strategy?
A. I believe there is. I think the ---- I believe that basically what the Russians would like to do is to have an influence in a critical region of the world. And they have been, after all, co-sponsors of the peace process with the United States since a period before I became President. I goes back to the first Madrid conference in '92.
Will we always agree with every position they take? No, we won't. But the Russians have pledged to cooperate with us to minimize and hopefully eliminate weapons transfers and component part transfers and things like that that should not go into explosive environments in the Middle East. And we are going to keep working with them to see that we achieve that goal. . . .
Q. Mr. President, whatever you may think about all of these ongoing investigations of your Administration, they certainly have pulled in a lot of your friends and employees and acquaintances, people who've had to appear before the grand jury a number of times, a lot of people like Betty Currie, for example, who built up large legal fees. And I wonder, do you feel in any way personally responsible? And do you still intend, as you mentioned in 1996 in an interview, once you're out of office, to help out with those legal fees?
A. Yes. If I can figure out a way to do it, I will. I feel terrible about there are all these people who have been hauled through this who, under the governing statute can never get their legal bills reimbursed. . . .
Q. Mr. President, turning to tobacco for a moment. The House Republican leadership apparently has rejected Congressman Bliley's presentation of a compromise tobacco deal. What state do you think the tobacco compromise is in now? Are the Republicans in the pocket of big tobacco and will this have to be fought out in the November elections?
A. I certainly hope not. For one thing, Mr. Bliley is, you know, a conservative Republican from Virginia, a tobacco-growing state. Mr. Waxman is a liberal Democrat who's got a great reputation for protecting the public health. Now, the fact that they reached an agreement that should have been some basis of going forward. And you know, all I can tell you is I'm heartened by what's happening in the Senate, where we got an almost unanimous vote -- just missed it by one vote -- out of the committee and the Senate for the bill sponsored by Senator McCain and others.
And we are going to work ahead. I just don't think we can afford to let politics get in the way of this. I mean the news report was that some people who were going to go along with this don't think they have to now because they think they've found some political way to avoid it. I think that's a terrible way to look at this.
The only thing that matters is 3,000 kids a day start smoking even though it's illegal to sell cigarettes to kids. A thousand of them a day will die sooner because of it. That is the only thing that matters. And we know that there are strategies which will save their lives.
I do not want this to be an issue in the November election. Let me say this again: I do not want this to be an issue in the November election. If it is an issue in the November election, it will only be because those people who have a political or financial interest in seeing that this matter is not resolved between now and November prevent it from being resolved. The worst thing in the world would be to play politics with our children's health. I'm not going to do it and I hope no one else will.
Q. Mr. President, aside from the legal questions that you face both here and in the courts, Republicans have been notching up questions about your moral authority. How important is moral authority to you as you deal with questions like tobacco and drugs? What effect do you think this whole wave of controversies has had on your moral authority, and what kind of moral authority do you think the Republican critics have?
A. Well, let me say, if I were to answer them in kind, I might be able to damage their reputation, which they might be able to do to me. But I could have no effect on their character, just as they can have none on mine. And therefore I think if I were to answer them in kind, it would be a -- more a reflection on my character than on their reputation.
I believe that it's very important for the President to be able to stand up for the values of the American people collectively and for communities and for families and for individuals. And I think this Administration has a good record. And I believe I have a good record of standing up for the things that will help us to raise our children stronger and keep our families stronger and make our country stronger.
At least I have done my best. These things are distracting, and we live in a time where they are more prominent than they have been at most times in our country's history -- although not at all times. And I deal with them the very best I can.
But I do not think the right thing for me to do is to respond in kind. The right thing for me to do is to let others defend me as best they can and to go on and worry about the American people. . . .
Q. There are some questions that have arisen because of Mr. Starr's investigation that both you and your staff have admitted are legitimate questions, but that you don't feel you're able to answer while his investigation is ongoing. Now that he's said that the end is not near, are you willing to live with these questions hanging over you for the rest of your Administration?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Does that mean, sir, that you would leave these waiting? That you're not prepared to sit down and----
A. It means that I think every American who has observed the conduct of the independent counsel would expect me to follow the advice of my counsel. And that's what I intend to do.
Q. Secondly, sir. If you believe that Ken Starr is running, as you've indicated, a partisan vendetta, and especially if you think he's wasting taxpayer money, as you've suggested here, why not ask Attorney General Reno to remove him?
A. That would not be an appropriate thing for me to do.
Q. Mr. President, you and your aides have been insisting for quite some time now that you're able to remain focused on the business of the country and do your work despite what's going on, but House Speaker Gingrich is making it increasingly clear that unless there's some more cooperation, some more forthcoming on your Administration's part, that your agenda on the Hill is going to be stalled. I wonder if there comes a point where you feel it's your responsibility to provide some more cooperation so that some work can get done for the American people?
A. Oh, I don't think anyone really seriously believes that's what the last three or four days have been about. That's -- that's -- that's -- they've been about politics and I'm not going to let -- I cannot be -- I can be responsible for a lot of things. But I'm not responsible for the Speaker's behavior. Neither, however, will I respond to it. Nothing he says about me personally -- nothing -- will keep me from working with him and with other Republicans in the Congress to do everything I possibly can on every issue before us. There is nothing that he can say about me, for whatever reason, that will affect my willingness to sit down with him and others and work for the benefit of this country. So it's not going to get in my way. It is simply not. I am not going to permit it to happen. . . .
Q. Is there any reason to take seriously a promise from any politician of either party for campaign finance reform? To regard it as anything other than lip service when, by actually voting for campaign finance reform in the way that would cause the bill to pass, they'd be facilitating challenges to themselves?
I mean, do you believe that this is really possible?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. And why would anybody do it?
A. Well, I believe it's really possible because I think a lot of politicians know that -- the cost of campaigns and advertising, particularly -- and particularly television advertising, has gotten so expensive that they're spending all their time raising money. And it's wearing them out. And it makes them, some of them, at least----. I think very few people really are terribly compromised and wind up voting in ways different than they would otherwise vote. But I think they know it raises all kinds of questions they wish it didn't raise. And I think most people in public life would love to do it.
But as I have said before, since the Republicans now have a majority in Congress, it is more difficult for them because they raise more large money, more total money, more foreign money, more----. They raise more money in all these categories that people have raised objections to. So it is harder for them.
But even among the Republican ranks, a lot of people, I think, genuinely want to do it. And I think that, you know, we're just going to keep working and try to get it done. . ..
Q. Mr. President, given the questions about your moral authority this week, together with the trouble for the tobacco bill and I.M.F. funding, is this going to be looked on back as the week where the era of bipartisanship between you and Congressional leaders ended? And if not, what are you going to do to revive things so you can get something done?
A. Well, I don't think so. I think, you know, we're having some problems over the tobacco issue, but keep in mind because of what this -- the stuff that's coming out of the House, which I don't really know how to assess.
But keep in mind, we have a bill slated to go to the floor of the Senate that passed, I believe, 19 to 1. And therefore, the Senate is moving forward.
Look at the funding for the International Monetary Fund, which is very critical to our long-term economic stability, passed the Senate 86 to 14. Total bipartisan support.
So, they're voting on NATO today. I expect it to be a bipartisan vote. And they'll be----. And, by the way, the opposition will be bipartisan, too.
So I don't think that a few days of high-level static in the House of Representatives, which may have more to do with their affairs than with the rest of us -- I don't pretend to understand it all -- I don't think that should make us believe the era of bipartisan government's over.
If they -- if they -- if the American people will send them a clear signal and they conclude it's in their interests to work with me and work with the Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate, and all of us that are working together to do it, then I think that's what will happen.
It's a question of what they conclude is in their interests. And I don't understand it entirely, but I'm going to keep working to get it done. . . .
Q. Mr. President, earlier you spoke about the hardship of people who had to get lawyers and spend money who've done nothing wrong and are not even been targeted with an investigation. My question is about people who have been targeted, and I'm asking you how far along are you in your thinking about possible pardons for people who you think have been wrapped up in investigation that they never would have even been, they never even would have come across any prosecutor's radar screen if----.
A. No one's asked me for one. And there's been no discussion about it.
Q. President Clinton I wanted to talk to you about politics in the tobacco legislation. Specifically, one way you could take the politics out of the tobacco legislation is by embracing the tobacco industry. And inviting them back into the process. Do you have any intention of doing that? And are there any plans for some sort of tobacco summit?
A. Well, first of all, they walked away; we didn't drive them out. . . .
I would hope that before this is over they would come back and rejoin the negotiations. I think it would be better if they were at the table.
And as you know, at least at the edges, there are some questions about the Government's ability to impose certain restrictions on advertising unless it is done in a consent agreement with their participation. So I would like to see them a part of this. . . .
Q. Mr. President, your adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, last week called Ken Starr's deputy Hickman Ewing a religious fanatic who has proclaimed that he operates from a presumption of guilt. Sir, I want to ask you if that's an appropriate comment, if you agree with it? And if you agree with Mr. Blumenthal's assertion that Starr is abusing -- not just using -- his office in an effort to destroy your Presidency?
A. I don't have any comment about that. I believe there was an article on Mr. Ewing in The New Yorker in which he made some comment about his presumption of guilt. And you can just----. His words ought to stand or fall; nobody else should be able to characterize them. . . .
Q. In light of your comments before about character, Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about a divergence we've seen in the polls recently. Public polls have suggested that a strong majority still approves of the job you're doing as President. The majority no longer feels that you share their moral values and they say that they no longer respect you as a person. I wonder if you find that distressing and how you account for it?
A. Well, I don't think it's hard to account for. It's been part of the strategy that's -- it goes all the way back to 1991. And -- but it used to distress me greatly; it doesn't anymore.
You know, I will say again, all these people that have been working hard on this for seven years now, they can affect my reputation. They can do nothing, for good or ill, to affect my character. Unfortunately, they can't make it any better either. They can't make it any better, they can't make it any worse. They can't have an impact on it.
And it's obvious, I think, to the American people that this has been a hard, well-financed, vigorous effort over a long period of time by people who could not contest the ideas that I brought to the table. Couldn't even contest the values behind the ideas that I brought to the table. And certainly can't quarrel with the consequences and the results of my service, and, therefore, personal attack seems legitimate.
I have never done that in my public life. I don't believe in it, and I'm not going to participate in it. But what -- all I can do -- I can't say -- I can't get in an argument with the American people about this. All I can do is show up for work every day and do the very best I can. That's what I did today and that's what I intend to do tomorrow.
Q. Mr. President, there have been reports, news reports, that the independent counsel has invited you to voluntarily answer questions about the Lewinsky matter but so far you haven't committed to an interview. Are those reports true? And would you commit to answering questions that he has or do you believe that he's simply too biased in his investigation and therefore you don't have an obligation?
A. I don't have anything to say about that. All my interactions with him, Mr. Kendall speaks for me and I just have nothing to say. . . .
Q. Mr. President, Gen. Barry McCaffrey is in the midst of controversy over the needle-exchange program as well as a personality conflict. Mr. President, what are your words to General McCaffrey's detractors, especially those in your Cabinet, your Administration and those Democrats in the C.V.C. that are joining Newt Gingrich to get McCaffrey out of the drug czar's office?
A. Well, first of all, I think we ought to look at his record. I think he's got a -- quite a commendable record. We have more than double -- we've had a strategy that was as follows with the drug issue:
One, to try to help parents teach their children that drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you.
Two, to try to support local enforcement efforts and local community efforts at not only punishment but prevention.
Three, to try to increase our capacity to stop drugs from coming in at the border. We more than doubled border guards, for example, from 3 to 6,000. We've got another thousand coming in this budget. We've got a fund set aside in the highway bill to increase the technological capacity of the Government to stop drugs coming in at the border.
And General McCaffrey has been behind a lot of that. . . .
Now, he simply believes that the benefits of needle exchange are uncertain and that the message you send out, which is that -- is -- is not good, that somehow the Government is empowering drug use. There are people all over the country who agree with that. Now, the weight of medical research -- and the American Medical Association has a different view. Their view is that it may help to lower the transmission of H.I.V. and there's no evidence that it increases drug use.
I think, if I might, I mean, that's the next logical question. We did we make the decision we did. Because the weight of scientific evidence was what I just said. But if you look at it, it's clear. If you go anywhere, all across the American cities or go to Vancouver, Canada, anyplace where they've had a needle-exchange program where there's been serious testing, the only place it really works to reduce H.I.V. transmission and to reduce drug use is when the people who come in to exchange needles get pulled into treatment programs.
So the real issue is, Will there be more funds for treatment? And that's obviously-- --. We're giving, I'm getting as much money out there as I can, but that's why I think it should remain a local decision and why I made the decision I did and why I'd like to see this controversy put behind us. Because I think, in a way, it -- in terms of impact on people, it's been -- there has been more heat than light on it. . . .

HEADLINE: U.S. SET TO BACK $1 BILLION OUTLAY TO AID INDONESIA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The United States is preparing to back a $1 billion payment in international emergency aid to Indonesia on Monday, despite evidence that President Suharto's family and friends are continuing to undermine efforts to break up the multibillion-dollar monopolies they control.
Treasury officials today acknowledged that Indonesia has failed to meet some of the most important conditions that were imposed by the International Monetary Fund in return for a $40 billion bailout package. Nonetheless, they said, the United States expects to vote in favor of gradual resumption of aid when the monetary fund's board meets next week. 
 Late last winter, after delivering $3 billion to Indonesia, the fund stopped all further payments until the country began to meet the stringent bailout requirements. Today, I.M.F. officials said that they wanted to encourage Indonesia to continue making the kind of painful changes it had been making in the last two weeks, particularly raising interest rates and halting lending by the central bank, changes that the country had resisted adopting.
The Clinton Administration now says those steps satisfy its previous demands that Indonesia make "adequate progress" toward meeting the I.M.F. conditions.
But for all of the monetary fund's optimistic declarations of progress -- some of which are clearly designed to entice investors back to Indonesia -- the fund has so far failed to achieve its most difficult goal, to dismantle the most egregious examples of "crony capitalism," and break up the monopolies that have built the multibillion-dollar empire of President Suharto.
While Indonesia has agreed to dismantle two enormous monopolies in cloves and palm oil, for example, both Indonesians and foreign executives in Jakarta say that the monopolies now thrive in different forms.
Within the Administration and on Capitol Hill, the decision to send more aid to Indonesia is enormously sensitive and politically risky.
The White House has been trying unsuccessfully to convince Congress to contribute another $18 billion to the I.M.F. -- a plea President Clinton repeated today at his news conference -- at a time when many lawmakers have complained that the monetary fund's strategies are misguided and that it is propping up a corrupt and repressive regime in Indonesia.
Moreover, the fund will resume payments just as human rights abuses in Indonesia are escalating. Earlier this week the State Department urged Mr. Suharto's Government to investigate the charges of a leading dissident who, after fleeing to Amsterdam, said he had been detained and tortured for participating in anti-government demonstrations. At least 14 other democracy campaigners have been reported kidnapped in the past few months. Those who have been released have refused to discuss what happened during their captivity, apparently out of fear of retribution.
So far, the Administration has declined to say whether it would link its vote at the I.M.F. to Indonesia's handling of the mounting protests. Testifying before Congress in early March, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said "it seems to me that you do have to have compliance" with the monetary fund's stringent conditions, which include the breakup of the monopolies, before Indonesia can begin to draw on a $40 billion bailout package that the United States helped design.
In interviews today, however, Administration officials said they were favoring sending Indonesia some of the money to encourage it to accelerate its reforms. The fund has agreed to dole the money out in billion-dollar installments, keeping month-to-month pressure on Mr. Suharto. A similar strategy was used last year, with mixed results, to force economic changes in Russia.
Today both American and monetary fund officials argued that Mr. Suharto's Government has, for the first time, fulfilled several of the most easily measurable pledges, including restoring discipline to the nation's central bank. The bank's wild lending spree earlier this year -- a desperate effort to keep Indonesia's financial institutions and major busineses from collapse -- fueled runaway inflation and sent international investors fleeing.
Since signing the third agreement with the fund two weeks ago, Indonesian officials have also begun to negotiate with international creditors who lent $70 billion to Indonesian businesses, almost all of which have stopped paying their bills. Slowly, Mr. Suharto's Government has begun restructuring a collapsed banking system, though it has yet to close many banks linked to the Suharto family and its circle of powerful friends.
The fund's top official in Indonesia, Prabhakar Narvekar, said earlier this week in Jakarta that the country's compliance with the agreement has been "good enough." Today, speaking in Washington, the fund's No. 2 official, Stanley Fischer, said that the fund planned to give money only after making "monthly checkups on the execution of the program."
"We have new monitoring and enforcement measures in place," Mr. Fischer said, adding that while "there have been difficulties, we believe the problems will be taken care of."
Still, David A. Lipton, Undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said today that "we are concerned about the Indonesians' capacity and determination to follow through on their agreements. That is why the I.M.F. is dispersing $1 billion at a time." He said the United States would not make a final decision to favor the resumption of aid until Indonesia and the fund resolve some outstanding differences over the weekend.
While the United States commands enormous influence over the fund, its 18 percent share of voting power on the board is not sufficient to veto the I.M.F's decisions about turning aid on and off. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 2, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page headline yesterday about pending American support for a resumption of international aid to Indonesia referred incorrectly to the extent of Indonesian compliance with conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund. Both American and I.M.F. officials say Indonesia has failed to meet "some" conditions (chiefly those dealing with businesses controlled by President Suharto's family and friends), not "most" conditions.

HEADLINE: ISRAEL AT 50: THE OVERVIEW;
Picnics and a Quarrel Mark Israel's 50th Anniversary

SERIES: ISRAEL AT 50: Independence Day

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 30

 BODY:
Israel marked its 50th birthday today with a uniquely Israeli blend of smoky barbecues, military fly-overs, fireworks and controversies.
The centerpiece of the jubilee, a three-hour outdoor gala tracing the country's history in song and dance, at which Vice President Al Gore was the guest of honor, was also the focus of a daylong dispute after ultra-Orthodox Jews protested a scene with scantily dressed dancers. In the end, the Bat Sheva modern dance troupe withdrew from the program, leaving a conspicuous gap. 
 The deep fissures in Israeli society were also on display on Har Homa, the site of a controversial Jewish housing project in Arab-dominated East Jerusalem. Several thousand religious nationalists and settlers mounted the hill in the southeastern part of the city to lay a symbolic cornerstone, while several hundred left-wing protesters beat drums and shouted imprecations from below.
But the familiar background buzz of discord failed to quell festive spirits under the brilliant blue of a cloudless day. An estimated three million Israelis poured into parks, squares, forests and beaches to fire up the mangals, the grills that have become an integral adjunct of Israeli holidays, to watch Air Force F-16i's fly over in tight formation -- one forming the figure "50" -- to spray one another with aerosol foam, and to do all the other things people do on birthday parties.
On the banks of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, one company distributed tons of shishkebabs cooked on what it called the "world's longest barbecue," raising clouds of greasy smoke. "In a sense, the mangal has become a national symbol," quipped Arie Hollander, 39, whose family shared a patch of shade with four others. "It's as if whoever is not grilling is not part of the family."
In that spirit, the family extended across the country. In Jerusalem's Sacher Park, religious Jews with yarmulkes mingled with kerchiefed immigrants from Russia, Afro-coiffed immigrants from Ethiopia, and native-born Sabras in sandals.
"We have a great country, and this is truly the best day of the year, because it is our country's birthday," effused Yitzhak Daniel, a Jerusalem native.
At the main event, the "Jubilee Bells" show at Jerusalem's Ramat Gan stadium, Vice President Gore received a standing ovation when he said in Hebrew, "I ask your forgiveness, I don't speak Hebrew."
"May God bless those who struggle in their dream and may God bless medinat Yisrael" -- the state of Israel, he said.
He was followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who noted that while the United States perceived itself as the "new Promised Land," "Mr. Vice President, this is the original Promised Land."
Despite the name, no "jubilee bells" were rung. But a progression of troupes, singers and actors created a collage that traced Israel's 50-year history, from a mournful violin playing music from the film "Schindler's List" -- whose showing on Israeli television last week drew the largest audience in the country's history -- through artistic depictions of the signing of the declaration of independence, the waves of immigrations, wars and achievements.
The program included snatches of the most popular songs of the past 50 years, like Eli Luzon's 1987 hit, "What a state! What a state! What a state, special and unique!"
But then an announcer came out and said that the Bat Sheva dance troupe had backed out. The dispute began the day before, when an ultra-Orthodox Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, Haim Miller, protested a well-known sequence in which the dancers take off some clothes to a song about the existence of God.
Two religious parties went to the Supreme Court seeking an injunction. When the court refused, they threatened to mount a demonstration, prompting daylong negotiations. The dancers agreed to appear in leotards. But when their manager resigned in protest, they walked out.
"It hurts terribly," one dancer said. "We had to do this to show support for the manager."
In any case, ultra-Orthodox Jews were not present at the gala, because most of them do not participate in such civic celebrations. Those who watched on television would have seen the dance, since both Israeli channels showed tapes from the general rehearsal.
The dispute was one of many reminders of the divisions and problems still hanging over Israel at 50. The million Arabs with Israeli citizenship were not included in official celebrations, and commemorated the creation of Israel as their "Nakva," or "catastrophe."
The Palestinians were literally excluded, as Israeli security forces barred any movement by Arabs out of the West Bank and Gaza for the duration of the holiday weekend.
At Har Homa, the East Jerusalem hill the Arabs call Jamal Abu Ghneim and regard as occupied territory, thousands of right-wing nationalists, many of the men with beards and pistols and the women herding their large families, gathered to lay a symbolic cornerstone for the large Jewish housing project planned for the site. The announcement of the project in March 1997 was one of the incidents that served to halt Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and construction work has been halted for several months.
"We want to send the message to the world that Jerusalem is not for negotiation, and we will have thousands of Jews living in this site just a year from now," said Jonathan Levy, spokesman for a right-wing group called "Our Jerusalem."
Below Har Homa, kept separate from the nationalists by a phalanx of police, several hundred left-wing demonstrators stood in front of a huge inflatable dove, beat drums and chanted, "Har Homa is not Zionism," "Har Homa is the end of peace," and "Settlers go home."
The national divisions were also evident in many small incidents. Israeli Television noted that a reception at President Ezer Weizman's house today was the first time Leah Rabin shook hands with him since her husband, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated in November 1995. Mr. Weizman had publicly criticized the Oslo agreements, and his rambling eulogy at Mr. Rabin's funeral angered Mrs. Rabin.
Then there was the fact that the Jubilee Bells program conspicuously erased images of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Doron Shmueli, the director appointed by Mr. Netanyahu, affirmed that he had ordered the omission, so the signing of the Oslo agreements and the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony at which Mr. Arafat shared the prize with Mr. Rabin and Shimon Peres were edited to exclude Mr. Arafat.
The stalled peace hung heavily over all the festivities. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat are scheduled to go to London on Monday for separate meetings with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in a new American bid to break the deadlock. Dennis Ross, the chief American mediator, has been in Jerusalem this past week preparing for the meeting.
With four days without newspapers, however, such developments were largely left in the background. For the day at least, the skies were clear and the mood was largely festive. For many people, it was probably Mr. Luzon's song that best caught the day's mood.
What shall I sing to you? What shall I tell?
There are many things we could do without.
But despite the mess and the shortcomings,
This is our state for generations to come.
What a state! What a state!

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about celebrations of Israel's 50th anniversary misstated the location of some festivities in Jerusalem. They were at Givat Ram stadium, not Ramat Gan stadium. The article also misspelled part of the name of a site in east Jerusalem and misspelled the Palestinian term for catastrophe. The site was Jabal Abu Ghneim, not Jamal Abu Ghneim, and the term is nakba, not nakva.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A 2d Look Reveals Surprises

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Alex Katz never exactly dropped from sight, but right now he's something of a comeback kid.
Mr. Katz, who is 70, did not make the cut when Pop Art coalesced in the early 1960's, and he has never fit comfortably into any realist slot. But these days, younger artists -- drawn to representational painting, portraiture and suave renderings of urban life -- have enthusiastically embraced his art. His recent exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in London seems to have been one of the highlights of the city's art season. 
 In addition, two new, detailed books are at hand: a fine monograph by Irving Sandler due out soon from Abrams and an extended autobiographical monologue published last year by Cantz and edited by Rolf Lauter. Whether it's Mr. Katz's talking or Mr. Lauter's editing, this book often moves with a lively and distinctive clip across the artist's childhood, education and development and much of the surrounding art world.
Some of the details are fascinating. Particularly intriguing is the possibility that Mr. Katz's use of expanses of saturated color reflects not only the influence of Abstract Expressionism, the prevailing style when he was coming of age as an artist in New York City in the early 1950's, but also the impact of his parents, bohemian Russian emigres who tended to paint the rooms of their Sheepshead Bay home in Brooklyn in strange, intense colors and unusual patterns.
Not that it made for a comfortable childhood. Mr. Katz recounts how he determinedly painted the walls of his bedroom relatively sedate colors (gray and plum), "trying, trying, trying to do something that was ordinary. Everything in our house was so damn bizarre."
Also contributing to Mr. Katz's heightened visibility is a beautiful survey of his landscapes at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens. "Alex Katz Under the Stars: American Landscapes, 1951-1995" features nearly 40 pared-down paintings of urban or pastoral motifs installed with breathtaking spareness in large light-filled galleries, never more than one painting to a wall and only two or three to a room.
So far, Mr. Katz's achievement has always been identified with his stylish billboardlike close-ups of faces, stiffly posed couples and psychologically distant group portraits. His images of unpeopled landscapes have remained firmly in second place, but it will be interesting to see if this ranking holds.
Mr. Katz's portraits sometimes suggest the looming shapes of hard-edge abstraction (comparisons to Ellsworth Kelly's crisp interlocking compositions are not farfetched). But in his landscapes, while trying to record his own perceptions of light, space and form in the real world, he comes closest to Abstract Expressionism at its most gestural.
He does this partly by setting himself nearly impossible challenges, painting the first or last glimmers of day's light, a driving rain, the effect of the sun seeping through dense trees and reflected in a dark brook, or a dizzying abundance of leaves. These subjects require a much greater variety of paint-handling than the figure paintings, resulting in loose, open surfaces that are a kind of imagistic action painting. At the same time the animated exchanges between paint and nature and between the artificial and the perceived in Mr. Katz's best landscapes are as much a form of enlarged, streamlined Impressionism as they are representational Abstract Expressionism.
These two readings alternate throughout the show. At every turn the viewer seems to step into an almost tangible environment with its own atmosphere, temperature, terrain and time of day. But each environment also has its own treatment of formal elements or represents a different point in Mr. Katz's development. And it contributes greatly to the overall effect that Mr. Katz and Allanna Heiss, director of P.S. 1 and curator of the exhibition, have taken care to juxtapose works that either complement or contradict each other in telling ways.
Unity reigns in the opening gallery, in a series of variations on a theme. The viewer almost feels enveloped by the mist rising off three pale gray-on-gray paintings from the 90's, one of a New York rooftop, another of a patch of beach in faint morning light and a third of barely visible trees, also at sunrise.
In the second, we're deep in foliage that borders on abstraction. Call this the Pollock room. In "Woods," the combination of prevailing greens -- solid, dappled and highlighted with yellow -- broken by brown verticals signifying trunks suggests a naturalist version of Pollock's idiosyncratic 1953 abstraction "Blue Poles." The scattered, dashed-off quatrefoils of white and gray in "Apple Blossoms," opposite, echo Pollock's more classic all-over compositions.
In the third gallery, things get complicated. Two paintings depict contrasting nocturnes, town and country. In "Lake Light" of 1992, dark water is illuminated by a swath of white moonlight, its passage framed and set ashimmer by quick loose dabs, the night's immensity signaled by a tiny dock at lake's edge. In "Varick" of 1988, a totally black surface is broken by carefully lined up strokes of white executed with a wide dry brush: they are office windows defining the corner of a building. Tiny diagonals crossing the wide strokes read as fluorescent light fixtures, placing the windows very high above us.
Meanwhile, a third, much earlier painting, "Late July" from 1967, contradicts the deep black-white softness of its neighbors by being colorful, painted with the flat, sharp-edged precision of a folk-art painting and thrusting the subject, a branch of maple leaves, forward for close examination until they are almost in our faces.
This is the first show to not only isolate Mr. Katz's landscapes but also trace them back to their point of origin: the small, deft colored paper collages that he began making in Provincetown in the summer of 1955. Only two or three landscapes in the exhibition precede these marvelous little works -- "Trees," "Pink Landscape" and "Two Trees." While their roughness is appealing, they are the efforts of an artist not yet in control of his medium or clear about his goals.
The collages, never more than a few inches on a side, taught Mr. Katz very important lessons about scale, deep space, abbreviation of form and the need to distort color to convey the truth of light. The field of blueberries in "Blueberry Field," a 1958 collage, might have been rendered in some shade of green, but Mr. Katz translates it into glaring yellow. In the 1993 painting "Gold and Black No. 2," the same yellow expands to a width of nearly 13 feet, framing a few shadowy tree trunks -- a nearly abstract image that also points us out of the woods, toward the blinding openness just ahead.
With their blunt little bits of paper corralled into legible images, these are the first instances of economy in Mr. Katz's art. They lead to the first works of his maturity, like the dazzlingly simple "Luna Park" from 1960, and then forward, to the single brush strokes forming windows in the city night.
"Alex Katz Under the Stars: American Landscapes, 1951-1995" remains at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, through June 21.

HEADLINE: Europe's Colossal Coin Toss

BYLINE: By Josef Joffe; Josef Joffe is editorial page editor for Suddeutsche Zeitung.

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany

 BODY:
This weekend in Brussels, Europe will ratify its greatest gamble ever: a common money without a common government. Come next Jan. 1, the currencies of 11 European Union member states will be irrevocably chained to each other; come Jan. 1, 2002, marks, guilders and francs will be history. There will be only euros and cents.
The gamble consists of three parts. One, most Europeans don't like the euro; for years, the opinion polls have delivered solid majorities against this "Esperanto money" -- or for its postponement. If there were a referendum, the euro would not make it. 
 Two, history confirms the doubt. Who remembers the Latin Monetary Union? Or the Scandinavian one? Or the East African shilling shared by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda? They did not last long because their members did what nations always do: they went their own way in matters monetary and fiscal, breaking the bonds that held their currencies together.
Three, the task is gargantuan. For the European Monetary Union to work, Europe will soon have to become like the United States in at least one of two ways. Either the E.U. becomes e pluribus unum -- a common state with a common identity and sense of obligation -- or it turns "Reaganite," that is, into a common market that sheds its rigidities, regulations and redistributive habits. Or, even better, it does both.
The 11 euro club members will have to give up their sovereignty where it matters most. They can't cheapen money to stimulate investment, they can't go into deficit spending to spur consumption, they can't devalue to increase exports. They have to stay in a straitjacket where one size fits all.
But economics is about relentless change. How will governments deal with "asymmetric shocks" that affect the 11 countries in different ways? With monetary policy "outsourced" and fiscal policy heavily constrained, there are only three ways left, and each requires responses that Europe is badly equipped to execute.
Take a simple example: mounting unemployment in northern France. If Europe were like the United States, wages would drop, attracting investments and new jobs. But wages in Europe do not fall, least of all in France; they are only upwardly flexible. Nor do wages differ much between regions, which are in the grip of nationwide bargaining agreements.
Second, if jobs don't come to the workers, workers go to the jobs -- as Americans do. But Europeans don't move, not inside their own countries, and certainly not from France to Denmark. Traditionally, lavish subsidies for declining industries have allowed people to stay in place.
The third solution is transfer payments on a Europeanwide scale -- analogous to what happens in the United States. When the Midwest is in trouble, stabilizers kick in automatically. Washington takes in less in taxes and injects more money from various support funds.
But that demands more than just monetary union. It requires political union -- a central government, a sense of national identity and obligation that Belgians, say, do not feel for Portuguese. Moreover, the E.U.'s taxing powers are limited to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product, a pittance compared with what governments can do in the way of redistribution.
So the euro is more than a gamble; it requires a twin revolution. Living within the straitjacket of economic sovereignty foregone, Europe must part with its cherished statist and corporatist traditions, unleashing the market and allowing wage flexibility and geographic mobility to carry the brunt of adjustment.
Or Europe understands that it cannot put the cart before the horse -- that it cannot have a common currency without a common government, a United States of Europe. Again, the United States offers an instructive example. First, it had a Constitution; then, in 1913 and with the Civil War in between, it established true monetary union in the guise of the Federal Reserve. That process took 126 years.
Yet Europe thinks that it can do it by 2002. It is a huge gamble. If it fails, it may contaminate much of what Europe has achieved in the last 50 years.

HEADLINE: Pace Slowed For Industry Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The pace of American manufacturing slowed modestly during April, factory purchasing managers said today in a monthly report that hinted at an economic slowdown. The report helped sustain optimism in the financial markets that increases in interest rates would be averted.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index fell to 52.9 percent last month from 54.8 percent in March. New orders and employment rates declined, although export orders were surprisingly stable in view of the economic weakness in Asia. 
 Analysts said the purchasing managers' index combined with Government reports today showing a sharp drop in March construction spending and slower growth in wage and salary incomes still did not make an entirely convincing case that a slowdown was under way.
"With orders solid and backlogs building, the sharp drop in production, which largely powered the decline, should be short-lived," Joel Naroff, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said of the purchasers' index.
The report also offered further signs of mute inflation, as prices paid by manufacturers kept declining. In addition, it showed the lowest index reading for hiring since February.
"These data indicate that manufacturing activity slowed as the second quarter began, and is another reason not to expect a firming of monetary policy," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
Financial markets extended their gains today from the rally on Thursday that was set off by reports that the United States gross domestic product expanded at a vigorous 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter with only marginal inflation.
The Commerce Department said today that spending on new construction dropped at the sharpest rate in more than a year during March, down five-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $618.6 billion, after a rise of three-tenths of a percent in February.
It was the first decline in construction spending since November, when spending dipped one-tenth of a percent, and the largest drop since a 1.2 percent decline in December 1996.
All of the monthly drop was in government-financed projects like highways and streets and conservation projects. Spending on housing in March was strong.
Another Commerce Department report showed that consumers accelerated the pace of their spending in March even though incomes grew at only half the rate of February.
Spending on everything from furniture to food and medical services rose five-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.68 trillion in March, after a gain of three-tenths of a percent in February, the Commerce Department said.
But incomes increased only three-tenths of a percent, to a $7.16 trillion rate, half the rise in February.
March incomes had been expected to soften since the monthly employment report, issued early in April, showed a loss of 36,000 jobs. That slowing may be reversed, however, when the April report is issued next Friday. Forecasters now estimate that 285,000 jobs were added to payrolls last month, increasing the likelihood that wages and salaries will rise again.

HEADLINE: Getting Biotechnology Set to Hatch;
As Science Gathers Speed, Monsanto Leads Pack

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
As biotechnology pioneers like the Monsanto Company see it, the moment is arriving when science can give business the power to put the clock of evolution on fast forward.
To date, the tinkering has already produced products like Monsanto's New Leaf potatoes, which come armed with a bacterial gene that produces a protein deadly to the pesky Colorado potato beetle. But New Leaf springs from research in the 1980's when the available technology limited Monsanto to moving just 60 foreign genes a year into potatoes. Now, Monsanto can create 10,000 new combinations annually. 
 The more fundamental "genomics" research, which identifies genes and various combinations that might prove useful, is also accelerating. Monsanto's cost to figure out the sequence of amino acids that make up a gene -- the basic control unit of life -- has been slashed to $150 from $2.5 million in 1974. As a result, Monsanto estimates, its library of genetic information and the libraries of all other major drug and agricultural players in the biotechnology field are doubling every 12 to 24 months.
Sound familiar? In the world of electronics, that same rate of explosive growth is known as Moore's Law, after Gordon Moore, the cofounder of the Intel Corporation who projected in 1965 that the number of transistors on a microchip would multiply at that clip, fueling a computer revolution.
"It means we are going to have the tools to address big and historically intractable problems with life as we know it, things like how to make plants grow in dry climates and how to live well with heart disease," said Robert B. Shapiro, Monsanto's chairman and chief executive.
There remain formidable political, marketing and technical risks to, as critics put it, "playing God." But with biotechnology's knowledge engine now running at Silicon Valley speed, Wall Street and many in the biotechnology business are convinced that their industry will produce "life science" giants as prosperous as Intel and Microsoft and that the next few years are likely to sort out many of the eventual winners -- and losers.
For now, Monsanto, based in St. Louis, is seen as the biotechnology front-runner. Sure, the company, which had $7.5 billion in revenues last year, is more than biotechnology alone. Moreover, the new products have a long way to go before Monsanto recoups the more than $1 billion it has invested in biotechnology research. But Monsanto is already raking in profits from having placed a lot of heavy biotechnology bets early in the agricultural sector and is now moving into other sectors, like pharmaceuticals. "They have the best strategy in biotech and they are executing it better than anyone else," said Jerry Caulder, who recently retired as chairman of the Mycogen Corporation, a biotechnology pioneer now controlled by Dow Agrosciences, a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company.
Mr. Shapiro says he owes the "fabulous hand" he is playing to Richard Mahoney, his predecessor at Monsanto, who began pouring money into biotechnology in the 1970's after scientists reported key breakthroughs in cloning and techniques to move genes between species. "He had a sense that the fundamental technology would succeed and the rest would fall into place," Mr. Shapiro said.
But Monsanto's coronation is hardly a done deal. For one thing, it has rivals that dwarf it, led by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company in this country and Novartis of Switzerland. DuPont, which retains huge interests in oil and industrial chemicals, aims to quadruple its sales of agricultural products alone to more than $40 billion within 15 years.
The high-stakes scramble for an advantage made billion-dollar takeover prizes last year out of obscure companies like Holden's Foundation Seeds Inc. (Monsanto) and Protein Technologies International (DuPont). All the major biotechnology players in drugs, food and farm products are constantly seeking alliances and partners. (In its 1997 annual report, Monsanto listed 16 deals over 14 months.) And there have been mega-mergers, such as the 1996 marriage of Sandoz and Ciba Geigy of Switzerland to create Novartis, a farm-to-drugs giant nearly four times the size of Monsanto.
Currently, all eyes are on the DeKalb Genetics Corporation, a leading seed company that has put itself up for sale. The quickest way to move biotechnology into the food chain is to genetically alter the seeds of the best-selling strains of major crops that companies like DeKalb have developed through traditional breeding. Although it is a distant No. 2 to Pioneer Hi-Bred International in the domestic seed business, analysts predict that DeKalb will be worth more than $2 billion.
Monsanto is thought to have an edge in the bidding, which is expected to be decided as early as next week. It already owns 45 percent of DeKalb's nonvoting shares and 10 percent of the voting shares. DuPont is on the sidelines after having shelled out $1.7 billion last year for 20 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred. But Novartis, Hoechst of Germany, Dow Chemical and Cargill are seen as potential deep-pocketed bidders who may need DeKalb even more than Monsanto does.
It would be a great final exam question for an M.B.A.: At what price is Monsanto better off losing DeKalb and pocketing a huge cash gain on its shares that could be used for other acquisitions? Whatever the outcome, Mr. Shapiro disagrees with analysts who say the showdown comes at a bad time for his company because it has been financially strained by its other investments.
"On the whole, it's in our interest for things to happen as fast as possible," he said.
That was not the attitude of Monsanto a generation ago, when it was known for plastics, synthetic fibers, industrial chemicals and its somewhat defensive slogan, "Without chemicals, life itself would be impossible."
Thanks to years of pruning and grafting, Monsanto now sells itself on Wall Street as the prototype "life sciences" company for the next century. To drive home the point, Monsanto spun off most of its chemical operations last summer into a new company called Solutia.
Although the future belongs to biotechnology, the current ace in the hole in Monsanto's life sciences strategy is Roundup, the world's best-selling herbicide. It is widely used even by farmers who are not growing soybeans, cotton or corn that has been altered to tolerate spraying with it. And Monsanto's drug subsidiary, G. D. Searle, has a strong portfolio of products developed through conventional methods, including a potential blockbuster in a new arthritis treatment.
Still, Monsanto says all its operations -- from Searle to its food ingredient business (best known for Nutrasweet) to its herbicide and seed divisions -- will increasingly be linked to biotechnology. "Life begins at 97," say the signs posted here, referring to both the Solutia spinoff and the company's founding in 1901.
Wall Street is impressed. Monsanto's stock, adjusted for splits, soared from $13.75 in 1995 to a peak of $56.1875 on April 9, and that is not counting the value of the spunoff Solutia shares.
 Monsanto closed at $54.375 Friday, up $1.50, and Solutia at $28.50, up 12.5 cents.
It helps that Mr. Shapiro and other senior managers have compensation packages heavily tied to the stock's performance, including requirements that they invest in options that will be worthless unless the stock increases 60 percent in the next five years. But the most telling endorsement of Monsanto's strategy is that analysts have been pestering broader-based companies with strong life sciences businesses, like DuPont and Hoechst, to divest themselves of their other operations.
DuPont, for one, does not see the need. It contends that biotechnology will eventually contribute to its industrial business -- plants could be altered to produce nylon and other oil-based products, for example. DuPont also says it is ahead of Monsanto in achieving breakthroughs in the genetics of food and animal feed. Monsanto's high-profile success, it contends, has been largely confined to inserting traits in crops that affect how much insecticide or herbicide farmers use, instead of actually changing what is grown.
Bragging rights are valuable, but each also has a lot to gain from the other's successes. The industry needs hit products to knock down the barriers to faster commercialization of biotechnology.
But the specter that is haunting biotechnology, particularly in Europe, is the specter of what British tabloids like to call "Frankenstein food." Polls show that Europeans are more worried than Americans about genetically modified products.
Agrevo, the joint venture of Hoechst and Schering A.G., recently postponed the introduction in the United States of soybeans it has altered to tolerate its Liberty herbicide because of doubts that American farmers would be able to sell their harvests to Europe, a major export market.
Here in the United States, the latest sign of tensions is the fierce opposition of consumer and organic farming groups to a proposal by the Department of Agriculture to label genetically altered crops as organic if grown without synthetic chemicals. The regulatory issues could become even more complicated as Monsanto and others home in on altered crops to promote human health. DuPont this year began contracting with farmers to grow a strain of soybeans that produces less fatty oil. Monsanto is aiming for cornflakes that reduce cholesterol and crops that stimulate the production of hormones to fend off osteoporosis.
"We will need to clarify the difference between drugs and nutrients, decide whether these products have to prove safety and efficacy, and figure out what kind of patent protection they will get," said Ganesh M. Kishore, co-president of Monsanto's nutrition operations, who is also in charge of integrating biotechnology research across Monsanto's businesses.
The uncertainty and the fast pace of change have led Mr. Shapiro to introduce some alien management genes into his company. Monsanto has adopted Silicon Valley's casual dress code, for instance. To mix technical and business skills, most operations are now headed by co-managers. Monsanto was an early adopter of the concept of using temporary teams from several departments to attack problems.
"There's some confusion now over who should make decisions," Mr. Shapiro conceded. "But the energy level is good, and people are thinking more broadly."
Mr. Shapiro is a New York City native and former law professor who freely admits to interest in management ideas he sees others laughing off as "too New Age." Monsanto, he said, may even one day experiment with having employees choose their own managers and with shaping budgets by how many people want to work on a project.
But Monsanto has to be careful about evolving a culture that is hard for outsiders to fathom. "Building a network of companies we can work with around the world is a key job for us," said Hendrik A. Verfaillie, Monsanto's president and the heir apparent to the 59-year-old Mr. Shapiro.
Mr. Shapiro suggests that biotechnology is developing so rapidly that the biggest cultural challenge of all may lie ahead: merging Monsanto with a major rival, even if that means the other company's chief executive emerges on top.
"The economic logic is there for more consolidation, although emotion gets in the way," Mr. Shapiro said. "I was very impressed with the creation of Novartis."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japanese Auto Makers Tell U.S. What It Wants to Hear

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 1

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus with the United States has climbed steadily over the last several months, increasing the likelihood of a protectionist backlash in Congress and industry.
But despite the rising trade tensions, the Japanese car industry -- a favorite whipping dog of American critics in the past -- is all but promising that it will not increase exports over the next year and might even pull back a bit. 
 If that projection proves accurate, Japanese auto makers will be bucking powerful economic forces. One is the weakening yen that enables them to charge lower prices in dollars for their products, undercutting Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler. Another is the stagnating Japanese economy, which has dampened demand at home. Only yesterday, the Japanese Automobile Dealers' Association reported a 7.4 percent drop in sales of new cars, trucks and buses in Japan from a year earlier, the 13th consecutive monthly fall.
Moreover, the most promising foreign market to emerge in decades, Asia, has basically dried up, making sales to the United States and Europe all the more crucial to the Japanese manufacturers' profits.
And yet, moderation appears to be the order of the day. "I think the consensus in the auto industry here is that exports to the United States will probably be flat to maybe a little down," said Toshiaki Taguchi, a Toyota Motor director who is in charge of business in the Americas.
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association concurred, saying it expected a decline. And analysts' views were equally soothing. "Rising Japanese exports have been a big concern among holders of G.M. and Ford," said Stephen E. Volkmann, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But that's not nearly as big a risk as many people are afraid it will be."
One reason for the self-restraint is that it applies to a high base; Japanese exports to the United States increased by 10.7 percent last year, to nearly 1.3 million cars. Moreover, Japanese auto makers insist, it is no simple matter to ship more cars across the Atlantic.
"We can't suddenly start exporting more to the U.S. just because the yen falls a little," said Takeshi Sumita, a spokesman for the Honda Motor Company, which saw its exports to the United States skyrocket 37 percent in the fiscal year that just ended. "We're just not that flexible." Mr. Sumita described Honda's fiscal year 1997 export performance as an aberration caused by weak exports the previous year and by an unexpected demand both for Civics and for two new models of sport utility vehicles.
But the biggest factor in keeping a lid on exports is probably the Japanese industry's shift of production to America. The latest-model Honda Accord is wildly popular, for example, but it is made in the United States, not Japan, and thus is not included in export figures.
Moreover, Accord models that are made in Japan lack the size and engine power so popular in America. Indeed, 80 percent of all the cars that Honda sells in the United States, its biggest market, are built in North America largely from components made by suppliers there. "Their parts are purchased in dollars and they are sold in dollars," Mr. Sumita said.
Toyota is rumored to be cutting production in Japan by more than 10 percent, something it could avoid easily by exporting more to the United States. But it will not, Mr. Taguchi said, in part because it has shifted production of some compact truck models to plants in the United States.
The company is trying to expand capacity in the United States and Canada, where it produces roughly 900,000 cars a year. "Our priority has always been to maintain the factories in America at their highest capacity," Mr. Taguchi said. "The sales network is set up to sell our American-made products."
As for Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, respectively Japan's second- and fourth-largest car companies, they are having trouble selling new cars in the United States, and analysts believe they have such a backlog of inventory there that they cannot risk shipping more cars over. In the last fiscal year, Nissan's exports crept ahead just 1.2 percent, to 273,500 vehicles, while Mitsubishi's dropped 1 percent, to 80,000.
That leaves the Mazda Motor Corporation. Mazda's exports to the United States in the year that ended March 31 were up 15.8 percent, to 115,318 vehicles. But railing against Mazda would be tricky for American politicians because Ford owns a 33.4 percent chunk of it.
To be sure, politics plays a big part in the Japanese show of moderation. All of the big Japanese manufacturers claim to view the American market as saturated, intensely competitive and a huge political headache. Toyota, in particular, is widely perceived as forgoing the opportunity to export more in the interests of two-way relations.
"We consider all the factors in the market," said Mr. Taguchi, the Toyota director. "We do not operate our business on a political basis, but we do pay attention to export levels as one of the factors of doing business overseas."
Not surprisingly, some skeptics question the auto makers' commitment, and predict that the profit motive will triumph over diplomacy. "The natural and obvious conclusion, especially given what's happening in Asia, is that exports to the U.S. and Europe will go up," said Hiroo Tanabe, who sits on the American Chamber of Commerce's ad hoc committee on cars. "How else are they going to make money?"
Where indeed, with sales slack at home and in Asia? One hint comes from last year's figures: While overall exports surged 21.4 percent, to nearly 4.7 million vehicles -- the first time in 17 years that such exports have gone up more than 20 percent in a year -- those to Europe exploded by 35.9 percent.
Watch out, Europe, here they come.

HEADLINE: Bertelsmann Hits a Snag In Acquisition

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Bertelsmann A.G.'s plan to purchase Random House and merge it with the media conglomerate's Bantam Doubleday Dell unit has temporarily stalled. Faced with an intensive new level of regulatory scrutiny, the German company decided this week to withdraw its application seeking approval from the Federal Trade Commission.
Bertelsmann intends to refile for approval soon, although it declined to specify exactly when. The withdrawal, a rare tactic, comes after investigators were preparing to subject the merger to a rigorous antitrust review that a trade commission survey indicated had happened in fewer than 2 percent of the almost 28,000 applications filed between 1983 and 1996. The review, known as the "second request" phase, gives regulators the power to depose top executives and to subpoena volumes of corporate documents. 
 In almost half of those cases that got such a second-request review, the merging companies ultimately abandoned their deals or prompted legal action by Federal authorities, according to the working paper by an F.T.C. economist, Malcolm B. Coate.
Bertelsmann's merger application was formally challenged last week by the Authors Guild in New York, which had criticized the combination as a "new economic behemoth" that would command more than a third of the adult trade market, a calculation that Bertelsmann disputes. The chief objection of the group is that the new company could diminish outlets for authors' manuscripts and reduce the quality and diversity of books in the marketplace.
Despite its withdrawal, Bertelsmann still expects Federal regulators to approve the media conglomerate's acquisition of Random House this spring, according to the corporation's spokesman in the United States, Stuart Applebaum. That would meet the company's timetable, announced previously, of completing the sale by July.
"This is something that isn't particularly perturbing," Mr. Applebaum said of the withdrawal. "It is routine, we're told, that they want more information. It is a high-profile acquisition and there has been a lot of misinformation and noise."
However, antitrust experts said that Bertelsmann's actions clearly indicated that there was some problem or thorny issue, otherwise Federal regulators would have allowed the merger to proceed following a 30-day period after the application was filed.
"It's not a common tactic," said James M. Spears, a former general counsel for the F.T.C. and a lawyer in private practice. "It's essentially a way to clean up the merger if there's something that's going to give you a problem."
Refiling, he said, gives companies the opportunity to remove any "burrs" -- even to trim the size of merging companies to win approval of Federal authorities. But submitting a new application is no guarantee that a company will ultimately be able to avoid the second phase of intensive scrutiny, which could lead to months of delays.
Mr. Applebaum said that Bertelsmann had no intention of shedding any parts of the two publishing houses and that the corporation would use this period to provide more market information about sales data and revenue figures to Federal regulators. "They have asked us for some specific and focused information to assist them further in confirming that our prospective transaction presents no competitive concerns," he said. "We are voluntarily supplying that information."
According to a person with knowledge of the F.T.C. review -- which is a secret process -- Federal regulators were preparing the questions for the intensive investigative phase, which can sometimes take as long six months while a company responds to demands for information and documents.
The merger of Bantam Doubleday Dell with Random House, which is owned by Advance Publications, would create a company that is the world's largest English-language publisher of trade books, which encompasses adult fiction and nonfiction. In the last two years, there has been considerable shifting among the top publishing houses with Pearson P.L.C.'s purchase of Putman Berkley, which it merged with Penguin; attempts by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to sell HarperCollins, and Viacom's efforts to sell off parts, or all, of Simon & Schuster.
Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C. in Washington, said that the F.T.C. would not comment on the status of the Bertelsmann review, other than to confirm that an application had been filed.
It was unclear whether the opposition of the Authors Guild had figured in the regulatory process or Bertelsmann's withdrawal of its application. But yesterday, the guild's executive director, Paul Aiken, called the withdrawal "very good news."
"If they're in a position where they feel compelled to refile, that does sound serious," Mr. Aiken said. "It's an indication that the F.T.C. is properly taking the high level of market concentration in the publishing industry seriously."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
3-Day Market Rally Erases Losses of Earlier in Week

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
After beginning the week with a tumble, stocks recovered to end with a gain for the week yesterday as they rose for the third straight session.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 146.98 points on Monday, rose 83.70 points yesterday, to 9,147.07, with most of the gain coming in the last half-hour. 
 For the week, the Dow was up 82.45, a gain of less than 1 percent. The Dow is now 37.87 points from its record high reached April 21.
The advance was not as strong as the 111.85-point surge on Thursday, when investors were encouraged by reports that the economy grew at a brisk pace in the first quarter while inflation remained benign.
Data showing a similar outlook yesterday were largely viewed as old news.
Still, yesterday's reports, pointing to a modest slowdown in manufacturing and another showing a sharp decline in construction spending, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates before July. Investors are looking ahead to next week's April employment report and other signals for concrete evidence that the economy is slowing in the second quarter to justify further stock price gains, analysts said.
"The reports confirmed what the markets already knew: the economy is growing very fast with very little inflation," said Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"Unless the data revealed evidence of widespread weakness, there's little reason to expect stocks and bonds to move higher," Ms. Callies said of yesterday's gains. "A report of the facts is not enough to create a major rally."
Other market measures were higher yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,121, up 9.25 points, just 9.54 shy of its closing high reached on April 22. Technology shares posted the weakest showing, with the Nasdaq composite index up 5.03, to 1,873.44. The Nasdaq ended the week with a 4.48- point gain, leaving it 44.17 points away from its closing high.
While yesterday's economic reports were largely viewed as positive, a closer look at the data reveals some cause for concern, some analysts said.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index fell to 52.9 in April from 54.8 in March. The index of factory output, however, was still above 50 percent, "which tells us that manufacturing output is expanding," said Kathy Bostjancic an economist at UBS Securities in New York. "Beyond that, the market is not seeing a real slowdown in economic growth," she said.
In addition, new orders and new export orders, two barometers of the impact of Asia, did not slow drastically, a possible indication that "Asia is not having as big a draw down on growth" as expected, Ms. Bostjancic said.
While such news bolsters expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates anytime soon, she said, it does leave room for concern that the economy will not slow enough on its own, nor get the anticipated drag from Asia, which would lessen the need for the Fed to act.
"We've averted an accident, but there's still that tentativeness that it could happen," Ms. Bostjancic said.
Now that the market has turned aside economic news, some analysts predicted that company news reports would power the market in coming weeks.
That line of thinking bore fruit yesterday as gains in oil shares and losses among some drug shares reflected the news of the day.
A rise in crude oil prices, which moved above $16 a barrel for the first time since March 30, pushed oil stocks higher.
Shares of Chevron, Exxon, Amoco and Mobil rose as April production by major oil producers fell in line with targets, minimizing concerns of an oil glut.
Meanwhile, several drug shares, which had been strong gainers in recent weeks, faltered. Eli Lilly, fell 3 1/4, to 66 5/16, amid concern that sales of its cancer drug Evista will not be as strong as expected. Merck fell for the first time this week, closing down 4 3/16, at 116 5/16, as some analysts dampened their outlook for the company.

HEADLINE: NATO Is Inching Closer, But Russians Don't Blink

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 1

 BODY:
The traditional May Day holiday might seem to be the sort of occasion that would mobilize Russian opinion against NATO's decision to take in three of Moscow's former satellites.
But the United States Senate's vote to approve NATO expansion drew a collective yawn today. The big stories on the evening news were a surge in fighting in Tajikistan, the kidnapping of President Boris N. Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya and the formation of the new Government. 
 The Senate's vote to approve the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic was mentioned, but only in passing. The Kremlin did not bother to comment.
In short, Russians have stubbornly refused to live up to the caricature foisted on them by some Western commentators: embittered nationalists ready to lash out at the West at the first opportunity.
None of this means that Russians are enthusiastic about NATO's move to extend its boundaries to the East. For many Russians, NATO enlargement is part of a broader pattern in which Washington has been deaf to Moscow's concerns and sought to take advantage of Russia during its period of weakness.
"As was the case with missile strikes against Iraq, the Administration prefers to act first and then figure out to do with the results," said Sergei Morozov, a correspondent in the United States for the NTV television network.
The vote has also forced Washington to expend political capital that might have been directed at dealing with other American-Russian issues, like arms control.
But the Russian response has been more modulated than many Western critics of the move suggest.
Russia's foreign policy elite has been opposed. But NATO blunted that opposition by negotiating an agreement that gives Russia a voice -- though not a veto -- in the alliance's decisions, and Moscow seems to have reconciled itself to a bigger NATO.
Russia's politically influential business executives and bankers, for their part, have not been interested in settling scores over NATO. They are more interested in raising capital in the West for investment at home and in developing foreign markets for Russian oil and gas.
Their biggest worry is not NATO's embrace of Eastern Europe; it is the effect of falling oil prices on Russian exporters and the unease Western investors have over emerging markets, an unease sharpened by the downturn in southeast Asia.
Much of the Russian public is too consumed with the daily economic grind to care. Like many Americans, Russians have turned inward since the end of the cold war.
Russia's biggest challenges are the payment of back wages, tax reform and other social and economic concerns, not foreign policy. Public opinion surveys have shown that half of those polled are indifferent about NATO enlargement. Those that have a view, however, tend to be negative.
The temperate Russian response minimizes the risk that a populist could rise to power on a tidal wave of anti-American sentiment.
The notion that the West will "lose" Russia over NATO has always been overdrawn. Nor does expansion mean that Washington will necessarily have to forfeit Russian approval of the Start-2 treaty to reduce nuclear arms. The Russian military has lined up behind Start-2 because its strategic arsenal will continue to shrink anyway, and the treaty will limit American arms, too.
The Communists say they will put up a determined fight when the Start-2 treaty is put to a parliamentare vote, but this probably has more to do with Russian politics than with NATO expansion. Having been humiliated by Parliament's approval of President Yeltsin's new Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, the Communists are looking for a way to show they are not a spent political force.
There is one important caveat: Russia has drawn the line at NATO's inclusion of the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Their membership would stir up a hornet's nest of official and popular criticism.
But there was little visible anxiety today. The First of May is the start of a four-day weekend, and a vast majority of Moscovites avoided the Communist marches and speechmaking to head for their dachas and the capital's first few days of balmy weather.

HEADLINE: Cigarette Makers' Strategy of '94 Is Echoed Today

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
In March 1994, the directors of the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette maker, gathered to hear a warning that their industry faced tumultuous change. Just weeks before, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. David A. Kessler, had announced that the agency might regulate nicotine as a drug.
In a slide presentation that day, Philip Morris executives explained how Dr. Kessler, in laying out the Government's options, had "skillfully pursued a flexible strategy." But they promised to fight any regulation of nicotine -- and the industry's counterattack soon began. 
 Tobacco strategists raised concerns that regulating cigarettes like drugs would create a thriving black market. And executives urged allies in Congress to put Dr. Kessler on the "hot seat" in public hearings. "Criticize his investigatory tactics," Philip Morris advised. "Expose his 'witch-hunt' operation."
Lawyers and public relations experts turned up their efforts to influence and intimidate the media. The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation even considered suing the cartoonist Garry Trudeau, the creator of the "Doonesbury" comic strip, for a story line that executives viewed as defamatory.
These and other details are from a cache of more than 38,000 internal industry documents that a Congressional committee released last week, after a long fight by cigarette makers to keep them secret.
While some of the records date as far back as the 1960's, a review of hundreds of documents from the critical years 1993 and 1994 offers new insight into how the industry sought to fend off a gathering regulatory and legal assault, and why five tobacco companies ultimately negotiated a $368.5 billion settlement last June of lawsuits brought by some 40 states.
That agreement collapsed this spring as Congress began considering tobacco legislation, including a bill introduced by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that would cost the companies $516 billion. The documents show that in their renewed battle against any legislation regulating tobacco, cigarette makers are again employing arguments developed in 1994, that, for example, higher cigarette taxes would create a black market and cause economic havoc for the industry.
The documents may also provide clues to why the industry sought a settlement. As early as 1993, for example, in the draft of a presentation, Philip Morris's general counsel, Murray H. Bring, noted that some analysts believed the industry faced a "doomsday scenario" in which large judgments in smoking-related lawsuits could force companies into bankruptcy, much as had happened to asbestos producers.
Mr. Bring wrote that one of Philip Morris's goals was to isolate its domestic tobacco operations so legal claims against it could not be collected from other Philip Morris operations, including Kraft Foods, Miller Brewing and even Philip Morris's foreign tobacco unit. One way to seal off liabilities, he wrote, would be to reincorporate Philip Morris overseas, but he noted that such a move might be viewed as fraud.
But Mr. Bring, who helped devise the industry's strategy in last June's agreement, may have achieved his goal in that plan, which limited the financial obligations of cigarette makers to their domestic tobacco units. A similar provision is in the McCain bill.
Officials of Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., declined to comment on the documents, saying they believed that the records, despite recent court rulings, were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. A Minnesota state judge ordered the documents disclosed after finding that some contained evidence of fraud and other crimes by industry executives and their lawyers.
Speaking generally, however, a spokesman for Brown & Williamson, Mark Smith, said: "The process of selectively picking out specific documents is distorted. It is like looking at one frame of a feature-length film and trying to make a statement about what the movie was about."
But if a movie was to be made about a pivotal moment in the battle over cigarettes, it could be titled "1994." That year, the Government began its efforts to regulate cigarettes; industry executives, in a dramatic appearance before Congress, asserted that nicotine was not addictive and that smoking did not cause cancer; the Justice Department started a wide-ranging criminal inquiry, and states like Mississippi and Minnesota began suing tobacco companies to recover Medicare money spent on smoking-related illnesses.
Now, as cigarette makers fight legislation in Congress, arguing that the proposals would doom the industry as surely as the impact of any courtroom losses, producers have returned to themes sounded in 1994..
That year, for example, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, a unit of the R. J. Nabisco Holdings Corporation, decided to attack the F.D.A.'s proposal to regulate cigarettes as an "effort at backdoor Prohibition."
"My understanding of the documents," said Tommy Payne, a senior vice president for R. J. Reynolds, "is that they reflect a rational consideration of the regulatory and legislative positions that the industry found itself in in 1994 and are ongoing today."
As part of their drive against the McCain bill, cigarette makers have also remobilized industry-financed organizations like the National Smokers Alliance. The companies used such groups in 1994, according to documents, to fight issues like regulations on secondhand smoke.
The records also include a briefing document for the chief executive of R. J. Reynolds, James W. Johnston, to use in preparing for a landmark Congressional hearing in 1994. To any question about the company's suppressing unfavorable scientific research, the recommended answer was that researchers were free to publish their results, once any proprietary information was deleted.
A recently disclosed R. J. Reynolds memorandum from 1985, however, shows that the company had a policy of suppressing publication of research about the cancer hazards and other toxic effects of smoking.
In a statement, the company said it had long encouraged its scientists to publish research and to make scientific presentations "despite allegations to the contrary."
Some 1994 documents also touch on the Justice Department's investigation of possible fraud by tobacco producers. One Brown & Williamson document provides an extensive inventory of company memorandums and records related to a genetically engineered strain of tobacco known as Y-1 that has twice the nicotine of regular leaf.
The Government is looking into potential Federal crimes involving Y-1, including whether Brown & Williamson officials helped smuggle Y-1 seeds to Brazil and whether they misled drug agency officials in 1994 when asked if they had developed high-strength tobacco.
Brown & Williamson officials have denied any wrongdoing, saying they did not disclose the project to the agency because they were never asked about it. The 1994 Y-1 document was prepared in response to questions from a Congressional committee but apparently never submitted.
Among the documents cited in the inventory is one labeled "Relabeling Y-1 from Brazil" and others dealing with tobacco containing high levels of nicotine and low levels of tar.
Tobacco producers also faced increased scrutiny in 1994 from the news media, just as today. That year, Philip Morris filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the American Broadcasting Company over a segment on "Day One," a news magazine. In particular, the company challenged an ABC claim that cigarette makers manipulated nicotine levels by adding the substance to the product.
ABC, in a decision that caused controversy within the network, settled the claim and issued an apology.
Lawsuits were on the minds of other cigarette makers, too. In 1994, Brown & Williamson considered suing Mr. Trudeau for defamation for a "Doonesbury" strip that depicted the company's chief executive, Thomas Sandefur, as indicted for perjury because of his Congressional testimony.
Also that year, R.J. Reynolds considered suing Dr. Paul M. Fischer, the researcher who wrote a landmark study showing that children readily identified the company's Joe Camel figure with cigarettes. Neither suit was filed, after company lawyers decided they would not succeed, the documents show.
The documents also offer details on the companies' plans for new products and promotions. In a 1993 document, R. J. Reynolds officials reviewed a proposal to decorate a bar in Baltimore around the theme of "Joe's Place," with signs and other marketing tools based on Joe Camel.
In reviewing the proposal, which was made by a consultant, R.J. Reynolds officials rejected the idea of having a "Hump Night" at the bar and said they would have to determine whether Maryland law allowed drinks to be bought with coupons in cigarette packages.
A company official said the "Joe's Place" proposal was not adopted. But the company did begin a promotional program in 1994 called "Camel Clubs" in association with bars nationwide.
 
Receivers Named
A New York state judge appointed receivers today for two tax-exempt, tobacco-funded groups that the state Attorney General is trying to put out of business as industry propaganda fronts.
Justice Stephen Crane of State Supreme Court appointed a former judge, Walter Schackman, to run the Council for Tobacco Research, and a lawyer, Milton Gould, to run the Tobacco Institute.
Judge Crane also ordered each group to file a $500,000 bond and provide a statement of assets and liabilities, names of creditors and claimants and all other information relevant to dissolution proceedings.
Attorney General Dennis Vacco of New York said on Thursday that he was moving to revoke the groups' tax-free status as not-for-profit research and information organizations because they violated their charters. Mr. Vacco accused the groups of posing as nonprofit groups while, at taxpayer expense, they "fed the public a pack of lies in an underhanded effort to promote smoking and addict our kids."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "VERBATIM: Responding to Bad News"
Much of the tobacco industry's strategy for protecting cigarettes from regulation was devised in 1994, as cigarette makers faced growing pressure from lawsuits and regulators. Industry documents made public last week revealed some of the companies' countermeasures.
 
FEB. 25, 1994 -- Dr. David A. Kessler, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said the agency might move to regulate nicotine as a drug and cigarettes as drug delivery devices. In a memo later prepared for Congressional allies, Philip Morris officials described ways for lawmakers to question Dr. Kessler in public hearings.
 
APRIL 14 -- Seven tobacco industry executives testified before Congress that nicotine was not addictive and that cigarettes did not cause cancer. To prepare the chief executive of R. J. Reynolds, James W. Johnston, the company prepared mock questions and answers.
 
APRIL 28 -- Two former scientists from Philip Morris testified before Congress that the company dropped efforts to develop a synthetic substitute, or analog, for nicotine that had fewer toxic effects on the cardiovascular system. In devising a response, Philip Morris was apparently concerned about raising the issue of addiction.

HEADLINE: Poles Say, 'Thank You, America,' and Czechs and Hungarians Voice Delight

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, May 1

 BODY:
Poland's leaders and people greeted the United States Senate's vote to approve their NATO membership with relief and delight today, praising the vote as the beginning of a promising new era that would overcome a century of dark history.
"Thank you, America," exclaimed Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, breaking out into his rarely used English on Polish television today. 
 In the Czech Republic and Hungary, where public support for NATO membership had been more muted than in Poland, the reaction to Thursday night's vote was also enthusiastic.
The Czech President, Vaclav Havel, who is recuperating from an operation in Austria, said in a statement that the Senate vote would help build the "foundations of stability in the entire Euro-Atlantic area."
And in Hungary, Prime Minister Gyula Horn, a former Communist, said his country should interpret the favorable vote as a sign that Hungary met "international requirements for freedom, democracy and a market economy."
The Governments of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been working for four years toward the Senate vote, which they regarded as the final hurdle toward NATO membership. To win Senate approval, the three Central European countries have been trying to reform their armed forces and to meet the standards of democracy and free enterprise required by the alliance.
In Poland, the largest and strategically most important of the three, the Government watched the maneuvering in the Senate very closely, and by this week politicians and the media were following the debate in minute detail. There was wide coverage of proposed amendments and apprehension that the vote, delayed earlier this month, might be delayed again.
In a statement issued soon after the vote, Prime Minister Buzek expressed the historical importance for Poland. "The decision of the United States Senate is the final obliteration of Yalta by the only remaining superpower," he said, referring to the agreement in 1945 that placed Eastern and Central Europe under Soviet influence. "The United States has included us in the elite team of NATO allies."
The strong endorsement shown in the Senate vote -- 80 to 19 -- was noted by some with considerable pride.
"Eighty votes in favor is a lot," the Czech Ambassador to the United States, Alexandr Vondra, said in Washington.
"I believe it's more votes than Germany got in 1954," he said, referring to when the allies admitted West Germany into NATO. "It's a communication of trust and confidence."
Then, Mr. Vondra added in a stern tone, "People at home should realize what it means."
The Czechs have been the most equivocal about joining NATO among the people in the three countries, with only 50 percent of Czechs saying they favored membership, according to a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute in Prague this month.
In Poland, where there is an instinctive fear of Russia and where the military is the most highly esteemed national institution, opinion surveys have shown more than 80 percent support for inclusion in NATO.
The news of the vote came on a major public holiday in Central Europe -- the May Day holiday that commemorates workers. In Poland no newspapers were published, but news of the vote spread quickly. Many people regarded it as a victory.
"I think we will be more secure, and more security means more prosperity," said Jacek Zembruski, 30, a real estate developer, as he walked with his friend Iwona Gawron, 30, in Lazienki Park in Warsaw.
"I hope the NATO documents will be more respected than other security documents Poland had before 1939," added Ms. Gawron, a reference to the failure of Poland's allies to come to her help before the German attack that started World War II in Europe.
One of the most emotional moments came in the gallery of the United States Senate when immediately after the vote, the former head of the Polish section of Radio Free Europe, Jan Nowak-Jezioranska, 87, leaned over to the Polish Ambassador, Jerzy Kozminski, and said, "We lived to see it."

HEADLINE: $2.3 Billion in Housing Aid Is Cut From Spending Bill

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Buried inside a $6 billion emergency spending bill signed by President Clinton today is a $2.3 billion cut to a Federal program that assists low-income tenants. New York City housing officials and advocates said the reduction could be devastating to big cities if Congress fails to restore the funds later this year.
Mr. Clinton, who had threatened to veto the bill if the housing funds were cut, changed course and decided to sign the measure after receiving assurances from House Republicans that the $2.3 billion would be restored during the appropriations process this summer, Administration officials said. The emergency spending bill provides money for disaster relief and for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. 
 "The threat of having existing housing decreased was frightening," said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "Once there were assurances the funding would be restored, the Administration made the decision not to veto."
But city housing officials, housing advocates and some Congressional Democrats said that President Clinton, with his signature today, had set the stage for a contentious battle over housing funds later this year, one they said they were not optimistic about winning.
They said it was impossible for Congressional leaders to guarantee that the $2.3 billion would be completely restored, because Congress is already struggling to provide funds for transportation, health care and education programs. And they warned that even if the Republican leadership succeeded in finding $2.3 billion, the money would probably come out of other housing programs.
Officials with the New York City Housing Authority said they were most concerned that Congress would try to provide the $2.3 billion by reducing programs that help cities maintain and operate public housing projects.
"While they say they'll bring the money back, it never comes," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Queens and Brooklyn. "If past experience is any indication, housing will certainly suffer. It's always been the weak sister politically."
At stake are funds for the Section 8 program, which subsidizes the rents of poor families living in private apartments. The New York City Housing Authority estimates that it provides Section 8 assistance to 74,000 low-income households.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that $2.3 billion is enough to subsidize the rent of 420,000 households nationwide, about 20,000 in the New York metropolitan area.
Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Republican from Suffolk County and chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community development, said he did not think the $2.3 billion would be shifted from other housing programs.
But he said the House Republican leadership might insist that Congress enact major revisions to national housing policy, including allowing cities to place more working families into public housing projects, before it provided funds for existing housing programs. Mr. Lazio is the author of the main House bill dealing with public housing. Mr. Cuomo and many tenant groups strongly oppose Mr. Lazio's bill.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
For three decades, Daniel Callahan has been a leader in the field of biomedical ethics. One of the first philosophers to tackle topics that had begun to worry leading scientists, he joined with Dr. Willard Gaylin, a psychoanalyst, to found the Hastings Center in 1969. The institute brought together medical clinicians and researchers, legal scholars, ethicists, theologians, historians, social scientists and government officials to examine issues arising from human genetics, new reproductive technologies, organ transplantation and other developments in biomedicine.
By the time Dr. Callahan retired as director of the center in 1996, what was once a series of ad hoc forays into ethics conundrums had been transformed into a well-established field of systematic inquiry. He now concentrates on writing and, as the center's director of international programs, on promoting similar discussion in Europe and elsewhere. This spring he published his ninth book, "False Hopes: Why America's Quest for Perfect Health Is a Recipe for Failure" (Simon & Schuster). This week, in phone calls and faxes interrupting his preparations for a lecturing trip to South America, he responded to some questions. 
 Q. Over the last quarter-century, there has been an explosion of activity in the field of applied ethics -- books, courses, conferences, journals, institutes, government commissions, all dealing with ethics in medicine, business, law, advertising, journalism. Is so much attention and debate a sign that society has become less ethical, more ethical or simply confused?
A. What's striking about the recent interest in ethics is that there are a variety of motives at work. Part of the interest stems from a general worry about the state of morality, and there the focus is on shaping morally sensitive, decent people -- good family members and conscientious citizens. Courses on ethics or values in high school and at the undergraduate college level reflect that concern.
Another part stems from a desire to reduce overtly bad behavior and to set rules to avoid such behavior. Business ethics, legal ethics and advertising ethics have had a strong thrust in that direction.
Still another part stems from attempting to cope with novel moral dilemmas, well outside the scope of traditional moral codes. Biomedical ethics is the most prominent example of this.
More generally, there is considerable confusion about ethics, and there are plenty of examples of bad ethics around. Are we more or less ethical? We are probably more ethical at the public level -- in our politics and major social institutions -- and less so at the personal level, in great part because the "personal" is thought to be off limits to moral scrutiny, a sad and profound mistake.
Q. Not long ago, you suggested that biology and medicine might be experiencing an ethics backlash. What provoked that speculation?
A. During the early years of American bioethics, in the 1960's and 1970's, many physicians reacted negatively to the thought of lawyers, philosophers and social scientists helping them out with ethical problems. "Stay out of our profession!" That response passed, and by the 1980's bioethics was well accepted.
Of late, however, particularly in the wake of the cloning debate, a number of prominent scientists have said, in effect, "All this ethics talk is just standing in the way of research and progress, and you can't stop any of it anyway!" But if ethics is doing its job well, and not just acting as moral legitimator and research cheerleader, it should be causing trouble.
Q. Your latest book, "False Hopes," follows other books -- about technology, medicine, aging and death -- in which you have dwelt on the importance of a culture that respects limits. In one sense, ethics has always been about limits. But isn't the contemporary approach to ethics, which seems to focus on resolving immediate practical problems, apt to remain marginal to that kind of deep cultural issue?
A. The setting of reasonable limits on technology and our aspirations for never-ending medical progress is, I believe, the single most important challenge in the care of the dying, the future of Medicare, resource allocation and the uses of genetic knowledge, to mention only a few examples.
Yet our culture hates any talk of limits, and so do most professionals in health care. The most common tendency is to think that greater efficiency and better management will enable us to finesse any need to set limits. That's the American way.
My conviction, though, is that ethics must take on our underlying cultural patterns; that's often where the trouble begins. I suppose I would like to see something of a cultural conversion experience at that level, but only in the environmental arena do we see some hints of that possibility.
Q. American health care is increasingly governed by market mechanisms. Is this, too, a "false hope," unlikely to create what you call "sustainable medicine"?
A. I have borrowed from the environmental field the notion of "sustainability" for application in medicine: sustainable medicine. By that, I mean a medicine that is affordable and equitable, which means a medicine of limits and more modest aspirations. The expanding role of the market in health care is one of the gravest challenges to a sustainable medicine. Markets play to our individual wants and desires, and look to profit, not to the health of populations.
It is surely a "false hope" to think that in the market alone lies the way to affordable and equitable health care; there is no place in the world that this has happened or is likely to happen.
Yet there are some market tactics, such as competition and economic incentives, that might effectively contribute to a sustainable medicine. But they must be used carefully and must, above all, be carefully monitored and regulated by government. The key to any success the market might have lies not in less government interference but in thoughtful and judicious interference.

HEADLINE: Blacks at Berkeley Are Offering No Welcome Mat

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., May 1

 BODY:
In springs past, Dana Inman took pains to persuade black students who were offered admission to the University of California's most renowned, selective campus to join her here.
Once the letters announcing their acceptance went out, the hard sell began, and Ms. Inman, a senior at Berkeley now, hit the telephone lines, calling prospective freshmen. 
 But not this year. Reeling from the news that under a new process that eliminated affirmative action, only 191 blacks were among the 8,034 students admitted for the class of 2002, Ms. Inman said she was unable in good conscience to tell those students that they would be wiser to choose the University of California at Berkeley than someplace else.
And when some of those high school seniors visited the campus two weeks ago, what Ms. Inman, director of the Black Recruitment and Retention Center, and several others in the organization gave them was not exactly a pitch.
"We told them that it's a very hostile environment and that we're not welcome here, and they don't want us here because they're not letting us in," Ms. Inman said. "We weren't pushing them to come to Cal."
As black students, administrators and professors here confront the precipitous decline in admissions of African-Americans, there is perhaps no better measure of their anguish than the reluctance or unwillingness of many of them to persuade the black students admitted for the academic year starting next fall to join them.
University officials say that Berkeley is as receptive to minority students as ever, and that the decline was the unavoidable consequence of a race-blind approach to admissions mandated by Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative that barred the consideration of race, ethnicity or sex in public employment, contracting and admissions to public colleges and universities in California. To preserve as much diversity as possible, they have begun an intense campaign to persuade a high percentage of the minority students admitted to enroll at Berkeley.
Nonetheless, many African-Americans feel betrayed and insulted by what happened, and have told prospective students to beware of what could be an isolating experience.
No matter how successful the university's efforts are, black students are likely to make up less than 2 percent of the incoming freshman class, as opposed to 7.3 percent of the current one. Today is the deadline for students to mail letters telling the university they plan to attend, but Berkeley officials said it could be two to three weeks before they receive and open all the mail.
As the deadline approached, some black members of the faculty said they declined or ignored university officials' unusual request that they volunteer to call five or more prospective students to sing Berkeley's praises.
They said that while they knew their lack of cooperation might further reduce the number of black students, they worried about encouraging African-Americans to enter what they regard as a divisive, politically fraught arena, a national laboratory for the dismantling of affirmative action in higher education.
Even Berkeley's director of black student development, Grace Carroll Massey, has decided not to help woo blacks, seemingly in defiance of her job. When prospective black students or their parents contacted her, she pulled no punches.
"This is the first year I've told students who asked me not to go to Berkeley, but to go to Stanford," said Dr. Massey, who is planning to leave her job at the end of this year, but only in part because of this issue.
African-Americans at Berkeley and elsewhere in the University of California system are by no means alone in their alarm over the impact of Proposition 209. This year's undergraduate admissions process was the first affected by the law.
At Berkeley, the number of black students offered admission dropped to 191 from 562 last year, while the number of Hispanic students dropped to 600 from 1,266. Proponents of the referendum said the decline proved that these groups had enjoyed an unfair advantage before.
The declines were smaller at less selective campuses in the system; at one, the University of California at Riverside, the number of blacks accepted rose 34 percent. But many university officials openly agonized over what they said was a dire threat to the multicultural complexion of Berkeley, a place long associated with eclectic ideas and progressive politics. They maintained that every student's educational experience could be diminished by a campus less heterogeneous and less reflective of the society beyond it.
Since the number of minority students accepted at Berkeley was made public a month ago, Berkeley officials have worked to minimize the effect, holding special receptions for minority students and sending out special promotional videos. Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl said he had even called about 50 black and Hispanic students himself.
"We have done everything that we could think of," Mr. Berdahl said.
Meanwhile, many California politicians and corporate leaders have called for changes in the educational system to help improve the academic performance and test scores of minority students.
But nowhere does the anxiety seem as keen as among the African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans on University of California campuses. And it has found particularly compelling expression in the ambivalence that Berkeley students feel over whether to reach out to peers who have been admitted and what to say to them.
On the one hand, they want minorities to remain a visible, vibrant presence at Berkeley. On the other, they have reservations about how comfortable black and Hispanic members of next year's freshman class will be.
Hispanic student leaders and administrators said that despite spirited debate, for the most part they have adopted the same position as university officials and have intensified their appeals to prospective freshmen.
They said they probably felt better than African-Americans about recommending Berkeley because the Hispanic population was larger. While only 6.1 percent of the current 21,738 undergraduates at Berkeley are black, Hispanic students make up 13.2 percent, and three times as many Hispanic students as black students were offered admission for next fall.
To be sure, there are many African-Americans at Berkeley who have urged the black students accepted by the university to enroll. The writer June Jordan, a professor of African-American studies, said she has told prospective black freshmen: "I implore you to come. This is our school. This is our state. This is our country. Let us not yield here."
But even Ms. Jordan feels the tug of the opposite sentiment, which she said was more prevalent among African-Americans on campus.
"What we're talking about," she said, "is that if you can't sit at the table, you're not going to ask anybody to pick up the crumbs that fall to the floor."
The officers of the Black Recruitment and Retention Center said that in previous years, shortly after the university sent out acceptance letters, a group of 15 to 20 students would work the phones at the undergraduate admissions office.
This year, the officers said, they decided not to, although some members of the group did so on their own. They also entertained the idea of canceling the weekend when they entertain prospective black students visiting the campus. Since arrangements were under way before the admissions numbers were made public, they went ahead with it, though less enthusiastically.
"Before, we were ultra-utopian: Berkeley's the best, you've got to come here, definitely," Kerri Harper, a senior who is the center's assistant director, said as she sat in its campus office. There was a poster of Malcolm X on a wall behind her and, on a wall to her side, a T-shirt that proclaimed, "Black by Nature, Proud by Choice."
Ms. Harper said that the message this time around was that Berkeley was a gamble, and that black students might need extra poise to survive in what could be a minuscule minority. "I'm really concerned that a lot of students are going to be left out in the cold," she said.
Gregg Thomson, director of the office of student research, said that if the enrollment decisions made by the top 191 of the 562 African-Americans admitted last year were an accurate harbinger, Berkeley could end up with fewer than 30 percent of the 191 black students admitted this year. At that rate, the incoming class could have fewer than 57 black students, representing slightly more than 1.5 percent of all freshmen.
Indeed, Berkeley accepted fewer black students than Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto, which offered 238 black students admission into a freshman class half the size of Berkeley's.
Stanford, a private university, still practices affirmative action, and several African-American leaders at Berkeley said officials here should have done the same, taking a moral stand against the referendum.
Some also said that there must have been ways, short of violating the law, for university officials to give more consideration to the quality of the high schools that black applicants with lower standardized test scores had attended. University officials said that they did take that into account.
But the disappointment and anger that many African-Americans at Berkeley feel boil down to a fervent belief that California should not have abandoned affirmative action, which they said merely lowers the obstacles created by racism and, in some cases, economic hardship.
Three of four top officers of the Black Recruitment and Retention Center who were interviewed said that without affirmative action, they almost certainly would not have been admitted to Berkeley. But all three are getting good grades and said they deserved to be here, even though they now felt less welcome.
"If the university does not want people like me anymore, that means I'm unwanted," said Jimar Wilson, a junior who is the center's co-chairman for recruiting.
Chancellor Berdahl said he had spent hours over the past few weeks trying to vanquish that thinking and exhorting students like Mr. Wilson not to give up on Berkeley.
"I have said to them, basically, that there isn't any place that I think it's more important to be right now than here," he said. "Because there's no place where this issue is being confronted more viscerally."

Stocks End Volatile Week With Solid Advance
The stock market strengthened for a third day and ended the week with gains that more than erased the market plunge Monday, when fear that the Federal Reserve could move to raise interest rates caused heavy selloffs. Further evidence of benign inflation, seen in a widely followed monthly report on American manufacturing, helped reassure investors that the bull market still has stamina. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 83.70 points, to 9,147.07, finishing the week with a gain of 82.45 points. Page D3.

HEADLINE: Euro Follows American Example

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In two articles critical of the euro, William Safire (column, April 30) and Josef Joffe (Op-Ed, May 1) suggest that the United States did not have a central bank until the Federal Reserve was established in 1913. 
 In fact, one of George Washington's first great successes as President was the Bank of the United States of 1791. This central bank was only decisively destroyed by President Andrew Jackson in the 1830's -- a decision that helped precipitate the disastrous Panic of 1837.
The European Union is moving along the same path traveled by the early American Republic. Fifty years after 1776, the American Union was held together by little more than a customs union, a national bank, a tiny army and a weak judicial system. The development of a national free market slowly prepared the way for increasing political integration.
The European strategy of "economics first" thus has an important precedent.

B.A.T. Industries' Profit Fell in First Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The profit of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. fell 3.8 percent in the first quarter as profit growth at its financial services units was offset by the strength of the pound. Net income fell to 333 million ($557 million) from 346 million a year earlier. The company, the world's second-biggest cigarette maker after Philip Morris, sold fewer cigarettes in the United States because of health concerns and in Asia because of an economic slowdown. Its financial services arm, which will be spun off this year, had strong profit growth in life insurance and general insurance.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Help for North Korea on Fuel

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 1

 BODY:
With increasing urgency, the United States is pressing Japan, South Korea and other countries for more money to supplement North Korea's energy supplies -- a key part of a deal that got North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons. But Washington's efforts have had little success so far, American officials said today.
Without new money to pay for the heavy fuel oil that North Korea has been promised, the officials said, there is a high risk that the North Koreans might begin to renege on their 1994 agreement to stop operating nuclear reactors and abandon their nuclear weapons program. 
 The United States, President Clinton has promised North Korea, will be the ultimate guarantor of the deal that averted a threat of war on the peninsula four years ago.
The provision of some 500,000 tons of fuel oil a year, worth about $60 million, is largely an American responsibility. But with midterm elections approaching, the Administration has had increasing trouble getting the Republican Congress to finance foreign policy programs without amendments that the White House prefers not to sign.
"There is a gap in funding for fuel oil that we are trying to close," an American official said today. "And if we do not finance the heavy-oil deliveries, there is a grave risk that North Korea will stop cooperating."
The organization set up to handle the provision of fuel oil, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, is known as KEDO. If it reneges, the official continued, "we expect the North Koreans to react at some point in a way to jeopardize the agreement, which we believe so far that they have been adhering to."
The American officials traveling with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright here on her first official visit with the new Korean President, Kim Dae Jung, are clearly trying to ratchet up pressure on Congress, and other countries, to save the agreement.
In addition to providing the fuel oil, KEDO is scheduled to build two light-water reactors to replace the more dangerous ones being closed.
But the group already owes about $47 million on previous oil shipments. Congress has agreed to help retire that debt, but only along with other countries, which it insists must provide the bulk of the money first.
Over the last two years Washington has paid $20 million to $25 million, and the European Union has contributed $17 million. Japan provided a $19 million line of credit last year. There have also been modest contributions from Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
As one American official put it: "The underlying problem is that the executive branch overestimated the extent to which we were going to be able to secure commitments from other countries." The official added, "KEDO and the United States have been rattling tin cups around the world."
But KEDO has another problem. The financing arrangements for the $5 billion or so to provide the two light-water reactors was also left incomplete. South Korea, which will provide the reactors and the workers to build them, pledged 70 percent of the cost, with the Japanese providing a billion yen. But that is worth less now in dollars, and covers now only about 20 percent of the remainder.
Another $500 million or so -- about 10 percent -- has yet to be found, American officials say. They have tried the European Union and various countries in the Middle East.
There is less urgency on this issue, because work on the reactors is still in its early stages. Large amounts for parts and construction will not be needed for another year.
President Kim renewed his pledge to Ms. Albright today that Korea would keep its money commitments despite the economic crisis here. But worries persist that Seoul will have difficulty down the road. Japan, too, is going through a crisis and has less money to throw around now than four years ago.
Given the seriousness of the threat, an American official said, "we think all of this should have been easier to do." The official added, "We think the accountants shouldn't be running this but the national security councils should be."
But another official acknowledged that the economic climate and the looming expense of the reactors might explain other countries' reluctance to bail Washington out on the fuel oil money just because Mr. Clinton is having problems with Congress.
 Ms. Albright and Mr. Kim discussed this issue and the economic crisis in some detail today, American experts said.
It was their first meeting since 1986, when Ms. Albright, then a Georgetown University professor, came here on a trip sponsored by the National Democratic Institute. Mr. Kim, then an opposition leader, invited her to dinner and presented her with a decorative scroll reading, in Korean, "If you seek real, practical goals, you will achieve them."
Today she brought that gift back with her, offering it to President Kim in recognition of his success, telling him she was moved to see him, a noted fighter for democracy and human rights, as Korea's leader, said an American official briefing the press.
Mr. Kim said the United States had saved his life twice: first when he was kidnapped in 1973, presumably at the instigation of his country's Government, and again in 1980, when he was under a death sentence.

HEADLINE: Leaders in Hartford Agree to Budget Deal With Rebates

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 1

 BODY:
Graced with a large surplus and a strong economy, Gov. John G. Rowland and Democratic legislative leaders have reached a mostly painless budget agreement in which both sides accomplished what they most wanted.
In a compromise made late Thursday, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, secured agreement on the centerpiece of his state budget plan, a proposal that Democrats had at first scoffed at: rebate checks of up to $150 for taxpayers, sent out before the November gubernatorial election. 
 In exchange, Democrats, who control the Legislature, would be able to increase property-tax relief and expand the tax rebates to lower-income people.
Today, hours before legislators began debate on the $11 billion budget, Mr. Rowland said he would have preferred larger rebate checks. But he downplayed his failure to get the tax rate reduced, and said he was pleased with the compromise.
The House passed the spending portion of the budget early this morning, 145 to 4. The Senate is expected to debate the plan and approve it today. Budget negotiations were simplified by a $500 million surplus, caused largely by increased revenue from the personal income and sales taxes. Democrats who called Mr. Rowland's rebate plan a gimmick when he announced it in February said they could no longer oppose it as the surplus grew. After Democrats balked at Mr. Rowland's plan to send checks in late October, shortly before the gubernatorial election, they compromised by agreeing to send checks in late July.
The $115 million in rebates will come from the surplus, allowing about 1.2 million taxpayers to receive rebates: joint filers will receive as much as $150; heads of households, $120, and single filers, $75. Under Governor Rowland's original proposal, about 800,000 taxpayers would have received rebates of as much as $200. The rebate, like a refund, will be taxable for those who itemize on their Federal tax returns, Marc Ryan, the deputy budget director, said.
State Representative Christopher DePino, chairman of the State Republican Party, said the rebate was a political victory for Mr. Rowland.
"It's the Governor's initiative," Mr. DePino said. "It'll be the Governor's signature on the bill, and when the check's in the mail, it will come from the Governor."
Although Democratic leaders have agreed to the rebate, Mr. Rowland's likely Democratic challenger in November, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, said that she would have used the money to reduce property taxes and the state's debt or to invest in education.
Mrs. Kennelly's campaign co-chairman, State House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, accepted the budget compromise. The $11 billion budget, which takes effect on July 1, adjusts the second half of a two-year budget approved last year by increasing spending about 5 percent.
In addition to the tax rebate, the two sides worked out an additional 1 cent cut in the gasoline tax, which will now go down 4 cents on July 1. The tax is currently 36 cents a gallon. The House approved the gas tax cut at 11:30 last night, 149-0, but the Senate adjourned at 10:20 P.M.
Democrats were able to win $45 million in property tax credits. Currently, people who paid taxes on a car or home can receive a $215 credit on their state income tax; that credit has been raised to $350.
The compromise also has $10 million in reduced sales taxes, including elimination of the tax on newspapers, coupons and rebates.
The budget has several increases in education spending, including $25 million for aid to towns and cities, $20 million for a new reading program, $12 million in scholarships and a tuition freeze for students at state colleges. About $30 million is being budgeted for a new program to subsidize health insurance for uninsured children.
The surplus allows the state to put $162 million into its rainy day fund, increasing the fund to $500 million. This amount is close to what bonding companies recommend: 5 percent.
Michael P. Meotti, president of the nonpartisan Connecticut Policy and Economic Council Inc., said that the rebate checks would have little impact. "I'd be hard pressed to feel people will remember the great rebate of 1998," Mr. Meotti said.

The House Democratic leader and five other senior Democrats threatened today to withdraw support for President Clinton's request for $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund, dealing a serious new setback to one of the Administration's top foreign policy goals.
Support from the Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and most House Democrats represents the Administration's last hope for pushing the new financing through an increasingly hostile Republican-led House. The Senate strongly supports the financing. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich threatened this week to bottle up the financing unless the Administration cooperated with a House inquiry into fund-raising for Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996. Last week Congressional Republican leaders dropped the $18 billion request from a popular emergency-spending bill.
Those two actions, fueled by Republican anger that the fund remains a dangerously secretive agency that rebuffs reforms, have left the financing measure hanging by a thread in Congress.
In a sharply worded letter to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin today, Mr. Gephardt and his colleagues threatened to snip that thread if the Administration did not stop pressing for the fund's plan to enhance the unrestricted movement of investments in and out of countries.
The lawmakers wrote that "our support for additional I.M.F. funding will be in jeopardy if the U.S. Government continues" to support the fund's plan.
For Congress, there are two major issues related to the fund: the short-term issue of helping to replenish the I.M.F.'s treasury, depleted by more than $100 billion in loans to Asian countries; and what long-term changes in the agency's lending practices the United States should lobby for in the 162-member organization.
As the fund responds to the increasingly global marketplace by enhancing the movement of capital, House Democrats in particular fear that not enough attention is being paid to mitigating the human consequences of this globalization.
The immediate issue that prompted the letter from Mr. Gephardt and other House Democrats is an amendment to the I.M.F. charter that would allow the organization, when studying a country's economy, to examine its openness to all types of investment.
That would include a country's restrictions on allowing foreigners to buy stocks, bonds and factories or make any other kind of investment. But the I.M.F. could not require a country to open its financial markets. At most, it could criticize the country for failing to open up.
Many House Democrats have sought to couple any ability to take money in and out of a country with protections for workers and human rights.
"The amendment talks only about the liberalization of capital," Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said in an interview. "We thought we had a deal here, and now it looks like they are backing away."
Besides Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Frank, the other House Democrats who signed the letter were David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat; and Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and Esteban E. Torres of California.
Howard Schloss, Mr. Rubin's spokesman, said today: "We agree with the members on the importance of the issues raised in their letter. We have been working with Congress as we carry out discussions in the G-7 and with the international financial institutions. We intend to explore the most effective ways to address these issues, and will continue to work with Congress."
The timing of the letter coincided with news that the United States is preparing to back a $1 billion payment in international emergency aid to Indonesia on Monday, despite evidence that President Suharto and his family continue to undermine efforts to break up the monopolies they control. But lawmakers said that was not the focus of their complaint.
Democratic strategists said the letter was intended to keep Democrats united behind the $18 billion financing package, and to warn the Administration against any changes in the fund's charter that could hurt workers or other people in countries that accept economic austerity measures in exchange for the fund's below-market loans.
"What Gephardt intends here is not for anyone to take the Democrats for granted," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee.
Despite the Democrats' reservations, the I.M.F. has repeatedly said this year that it favors only "orderly" liberalization of markets.
It fears that if countries open up too quickly, their banking and regulatory systems may not be able to manage the inflow and outflow of foreign cash.
Some nations resist such openings, saying money that flows out of the country too fast could worsen an economic crisis. That happened to some nations in Asia last fall: once economic news turned sour, investors pulled out all at once, making a bad situation worse.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 4, 1998, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a threat by senior House Democrats to withdraw support for the Clinton Administration's request for $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund misstated the number of countries in the organization. It is 182, not 162.

THE SEVILLE COMMUNION
 By Arturo Perez-Reverte.
 Translated by Sonia Soto.
 375 pp. New York:
 Harcourt Brace & Company. $24. 
 Seville is known for its barbers, its Gypsy temptresses, its Latin lovers; for the tomb (if not the actual body) of Christopher Columbus, bullfights, orange blossoms, Holy Week processions and an extraordinary mix of Arab, Baroque and Renaissance architecture. Julius Caesar conquered it; the Roman Emperors Hadrian and Trajan were born nearby; the Vandals, Visigoths, Moors and crusaders grudgingly passed it on to one another. It was the site of the Spanish Inquisition's first auto-da-fe, but, most important, the home port of Spain's bounteous New World empire. "Dramatic extravagance," V. S. Pritchett once observed, "is in the Sevillian nature."
And dramatic extravagance is what the former journalist Arturo Perez-Reverte provides in "The Seville Communion," his third thriller (following "The Flanders Panel" and "The Club Dumas") to be published in English and the second to be translated by Sonia Soto. Perez-Reverte writes with wit, narrative economy, a sharp eye for the telling detail and a feel for history. "The Seville Communion" is good fun, as entertaining as it often is silly.
How silly? Silly enough to describe the Vatican as "40 hectares containing the most powerful state on earth" and to allow its hero to go weak-kneed at the way a woman retrieves her cigarette lighter from under her bra strap. Silly enough to have a cardinal pine for the good old days of the Inquisition and a duchess recall that "great-great-great-grandfather Fernando was governor of California before they took it from us." Still, any novel that can survive its protagonist looking "like Richard Chamberlain in 'The Thorn Birds' but more manly" obviously knows on which side its extravagance is buttered.
The hero in question is the Rev. Lorenzo Quart, the "sexiest priest" alive, outside of the latest Andrew Greeley yarn. A "weary, solitary Knight Templar," Quart works for the Vatican's very hush-hush Institute for External Affairs, from which he is discreetly dispatched to defuse threats to Holy Mother Church. He is emphatically not "the kind of priest who turned the other cheek." He is a St. James Bond, an agent in a Roman collar and handmade leather shoes who wields a Mont Blanc pen instead of a snub-nosed Beretta.
Quart's assignment in Seville concerns the proposed purchase and demolition of a deteriorating 17th-century Baroque church, Our Lady of the Tears. After two people eager to close the church have ended up dead, an anonymous hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer, leaving an ominous message suggesting that the embattled church "kills to defend itself." Seville's ambitious archbishop, in cahoots with real estate interests, is determined to dislodge Our Lady of the Tears' obdurate pastor and sell the property. But the seemingly unsophisticated parish priest has powerful allies in one of Seville's most venerable families, which happens to have historic ties to the 300-year-old church. That's where the lady with the incendiary cigarette lighter comes in, a raven-haired "Andalusian beauty" who "was too much even for a man with the nerves of Lorenzo Quart."
Perez-Reverte unravels his mystery by cutting back and forth among discrete but converging stories and sets of characters. A hapless trio of henchpersons (including a punch-drunk ex-boxer/bullfighter and a washed-up flamenco singer) bring a welcome bit of slapstick to the proceedings. There is the inevitable ornery, jeans-wearing American nun, as well as a ruthless banker (estranged from the Andalusian beauty) and plenty of viperish ecclesiastical intrigue.
Almost all of Perez-Reverte's characters are plausible, but usually as types. His vivid descriptions of the city, like his stories of Seville's outsize romantic and heroic past, are more resonant. Good at making the reader want answers, he is less good at giving satisfying ones. Finally, motive and explanation are too stagy and, more disappointing, the murderer is too peripheral to the psychological heart of the story. There's also a lot of facile talk about splendid buildings and elaborate ritual as a "means of entrancing the masses" because "naked faith can't be sustained." Much of this seems filched from the Cliffs Notes to Dostoyevsky's "Grand Inquisitor." Still, you'd have to be a remarkably faithless reader not to want to visit Seville after finishing this flavorful confection.

FROM WEALTH TO POWER
 The Unusual Origins
 of America's World Role.
 By Fareed Zakaria.
 199 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
 Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 This thin doctoral thesis would ordinarily pass unnoticed outside academic circles, but it should attract wider attention for three reasons. First, its author is no obscure assistant professor, but the managing editor of Foreign Affairs, the premier American foreign policy journal. Second, its tightly argued thesis addresses a question sure to be revisited during this anniversary of the Spanish-American War: to wit, why the United States in 1898 suddenly cast off its traditions and, in an imperialist jag, claimed the role of a global power. Third, its conclusions are both provocative and full of implications for the world today.
Fareed Zakaria begins in the mode of political science by defining a theoretical problem and reviewing two dominant schools of thought. Why, he asks, do nations expand? Clearly they cannot do so unless and until they acquire the requisite material power vis-a-vis their victims or rivals. But mere measures of strength cannot account for the motives or timing of a nation's expansion. That is the weakness of the school of classical realism, which holds that nations define their interests more broadly as their power expands, and that increases in power predictably yield assertive policies.
An alternative explanation is that nations expand their interests when they feel less secure, when they perceive threats that demand a response. But perceptions cannot be measured exactly, while aggressive governments invariably invoke "national security" whether or not it is endangered. That is the weakness of the school of defensive realism, which holds that interests come first, and that power is mobilized when interests are threatened.
That is to say, classical realism cannot explain the "imperial understretch" of the United States between 1865 and 1890 despite its having become one of the world's mightiest nations. Defensive realism, on the other hand, cannot explain why the United States projected its power with zeal after 1890 despite the relative absence of serious threats.
Zakaria endeavors to solve this puzzle by making a distinction between the nation and the state. "The state" is a concept taken for granted in European political thought, but neglected if not despised by Americans.
After the Civil War the American nation quickly surpassed Europe's great powers in size, population, production, technology or all four. But in foreign and military affairs power must be mobilized, which requires that decision makers not only define the national interest in terms of expansion, but command an administration able to harness their nation's might. Throughout the 19th century America never lacked for expansionist prophets -- chief among them William Henry Seward, the Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson -- but with the exception of the Civil War years Congress reigned as the dominant branch of government. As Senator George Hoar put it, his colleagues would have considered it a "personal affront" for the President to lobby them on legislation. "If they visited the White House, it was to give, not to receive, advice," with the result that, in Zakaria's words, "weak executive power translated into passivity and inaction in foreign policy."
What happened between 1877 and 1896, according to Zakaria, was "the rise of the American state." The proximate cause was industrialization, which threw up social problems beyond the resources of the individual states. So the Civil Service Commission, the Bureau of Labor and the Interstate Commerce Commission were born. Next, the Administrations of Rutherford B. Hayes, Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison redressed the balance between the executive and legislative branches by wielding the veto, abolishing patronage through civil service reform and choosing Cabinet officers loyal to the President rather than to influential factions in Congress. Third, dynamic secretaries of the Navy and of war and progressive officers like Adm. Steven B. Luce and Capt. Alfred Thayer Mahan persuaded Congress to vote funds for a modern steel Navy and larger professional Army (as opposed to state militias).
Finally, a recondite Supreme Court decision, "In re Neagle," in 1890 paved the way for an "imperial presidency" by holding in a case not connected to foreign affairs that the executive possessed all powers needed to enforce "the rights, duties and obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, our international relations and all the protection implied by the nature of government under the Constitution." This decision -- an "extraordinarily broad" one, Zakaria says -- placed in the hands of a President like Benjamin Harrison, not to mention Theodore Roosevelt, the lever needed to move a nation. Whereas Seward and the embattled President Andrew Johnson had to beg and bribe Congress to acquire Alaska in 1867, Roosevelt could boast about Panama that he "took the Canal Zone and let Congress debate."
"When the interests of the American people demanded that a certain act should be done," he said, "and I had the power to do it, I did it unless it was specifically prohibited by law."
The author does not ignore the subtle crosscurrents of history or deny the importance of personalities. But he argues persuasively that the Spanish-American War, the acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico and Hawaii, the creation of the nation of Panama and its canal and the other imperial episodes of the Progressive Era were made possible by the fact that "control of the American state and its extraordinary resources had now firmly passed into the hands of the central decision makers who were attentive to the opportunities the international system presented and to the great power at their disposal rather than to the needs of Congressional districts."
This thesis has a number of merits. It allows Zakaria to escape the myth that America was ever isolationist, to demonstrate a certain continuity in American expansionism whether triumphant or thwarted and to identify the second Cleveland Administration not as a last hurrah for an old diplomacy but as the first hurrah for a new. His argument for continuity would have been even stronger had he looked ahead to Woodrow Wilson, whose aggressive expansion of Federal power at home paralleled his globalization of American interests abroad.
However well the author addresses the matter of means, he does skirt the matter of ends. Some may ask why the powerful state was built in the first place, and whether real or perceived interests of business lay behind it. Others may wonder how average Americans persuaded themselves that global power was now their necessary and proper destiny. Zakaria hints at a cultural paradigm shift when he writes that "the reason for the long absence of highly developed foreign policy institutions was . . . America's antistatist tradition," and when he invokes Hans J. Morgenthau's insight into the "restraining influence of a moral consensus . . . that kept in check the limitless desire for power." Something, after all, moved the once anti-imperialist newspaper The Chicago Times-Herald to conclude that "the people now believe that the United States owes it to the world to accept the responsibilities imposed upon it by the fortunes of war." Owes it to the world? That phrase bespeaks a new moral consensus about America's role that cannot be explained by classical or defensive realism, or by Zakaria's notion of the rise of the state.
Even if the author cannot touch all bases in less than 200 pages, his thesis conveys important lessons for our post-cold-war world. One is that the emergence of new major powers need not provoke conflict so long as the transition is "properly understood and properly handled." Another is that one need not fear rising powers that lack the state apparatus to mobilize their national strength. Thus, Zakaria concludes, alarmists were wrong to fear the reunification of Germany or the economic might of Japan, because their constitutional structures and international entanglements inhibit their states from translating wealth into power. The really good news is that China, too, "finds that its central state is challenged by local authorities and constrained by international ones."
Zakaria might also have mentioned Russia, whose central Government seems almost not to exist, and the United States, whose Government most certainly does. Indeed, foreigners may conclude from the argument here that the only power likely to try to impose its will on the world is . . . the United States. Perhaps Zakaria will address that ironic prospect in a sequel to this thoughtful treatise.

"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet"
 The American Talking Film:
 History & Memory, 1927-1949.
 By Andrew Sarris.
 573 pp. New York:
 Oxford University Press. $35. 
 AS Groucho Marx, in "Duck Soup," leaves the august and matronly Margaret Dumont's bedroom, Chico Marx enters, disguised as Groucho: long nightgown, floppy nightcap, round glasses, absurdly false mustache. We know this is Chico because we have seen him put on his disguise -- otherwise we might have a problem. Dumont is surprised to find this figure still there, since she has seen him leave, and she expresses her surprise.
"Oh no," Chico says. "I no leave."
"But I saw you," Dumont says. "With my own eyes."
Chico replies, in one of the most dizzying philosophical moments in the cinema: "Well, who you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes?"
She has to believe him and her own eyes, as we all do at the movies, silents as well as talkies. Sound increased the range of things our eyes could not tell us, but the need and difficulty of believing them remained. "The art of the cinema," Andrew Sarris wrote in "The American Cinema" (1968), a book many of us carried around till the pages fell out and almost all the directors described there had become old masters, "is the art of an attitude, the style of a gesture." The attitudes and gestures could be aural, but only by extension, by metaphor. And it is striking that many of the sharpest and most memorable moments in Sarris's companionable new book are lucid accounts of visual events or impressions: Chaplin in "The Idle Class" as a repentant alcoholic apparently sobbing, his back to the camera, only to turn and reveal himself as energetically at work with a cocktail shaker; Henry Fonda in "The Grapes of Wrath" as a man whose "physical and spiritual stature is not that of the little man as victim but of the tall man as troublemaker"; Otto Preminger as a director who likes to keep his characters in the same frame; a sequence in D. W. Griffith's last film, "The Struggle," where another alcoholic, having less fun, hears the voice of conscience but expresses it in an attitude: "As an organ plays 'Abide With Me' and a minister begins his sermon about the Resurrection, Skelly coils out of sight of the neighbor's window and contorts himself into a posture of abject guilt such as the screen has never shown before or since."
" 'You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet' " is loosely organized, although organized might be too strong a term, but it has plenty to say. As he points out, Sarris has after all been "a practicing polemicist" for three decades, and has "more than 40 years of published missionary work" to his credit. The book takes the form of a series of notes and essays covering a small fraction of the films Sarris must have seen. At times he quotes from "The American Cinema," at times he takes off from it into much longer riffs -- on Alfred Hitchcock, for instance, and on John Ford, and on Josef von Sternberg. On two serious points -- the virtues of Vincente Minnelli and Billy Wilder -- he revises his earlier, dismissive opinions that Minnelli had "a fatal flaw as an artist," namely a "naive belief that style can invariably transcend substance," and that Wilder should be classed in a section called "Less Than Meets the Eye."
A great admirer of Andre Bazin and Francois Truffaut, Sarris maintains nevertheless a catholic view of what an author might be in the cinema, and knows dancers and songwriters also count -- and producers and studios too. Still, there is no doubt about where his critical heart is. In this history of American film, there are 9 pages devoted to the studios, 99 pages devoted to genres, 92 pages devoted to actors and actresses and 244 pages devoted to directors. There is also a section (31 pages) on "Guilty Pleasures," which include B movies, Wanda Hendrix, Mary Astor and various versions of "Gaslight."
The book starts with the arrival of the talkies, and Al Jolson's famous line, which provides Sarris with his title, and ends in 1949 for reasons we are not given. The effect is a little eerie, since you keep thinking Sarris is going to talk about later films, and then you put your own memories of the films into the silence. There is not a lot in this book about the industry, technology, audiences, economics, censorship or politics -- much of which Sarris dismisses as "sociological." Even information about directors' careers is quickly plowed back into reports of what's on the screen. As Sarris put it in "The American Cinema," "The best directors generally make the best films, but the directors must be discovered through their films." This is a viewer's cinema, a matter not only of believing our eyes but of deferring to them. This is entirely appropriate for a book by a movie critic, and the result is pretty exuberant, but we have to know what we are not getting.
But, then, is the book a history at all? It's a history of what was to be seen at the cinema, and of what Sarris himself saw and heard there. And also, often moving, always irreverent, a history of who he is. We learn about Sarris's father ("a Mr. Micawber awaiting the apocalypse"), about the ethnic tilt of Sarris's tastes ("Given my first generation Greek-American background . . . I found myself less drawn to the wide open spaces of the western"), about his seeing "Gold Diggers of 1935" when he was 7 years old ("For years and years I retained the image of a playgirl plunging to her death from a skyscraper ballroom"), seeing Bogart when he was 9 ("I found something so sneaky and malignant in Bo-
gart's personality that I was not able to respond to him for years after"), teaching a class on Buster Keaton at Columbia in 1969 ("It was the most extraordinary learning and teaching experience of my life"). The prose is full of bounce and opinion ("Mea culpa, and all that," "So much for the legend. Let's get on with the revisionism"); it has good jokes ("Detective ex machina"), some real insights ("Death generally finds Hitchcock's characters in the wrong mood and the wrong costume") and plenty of finely flung allusions. Chaplin's movie persona "is clearly and congenitally one of the poetically unemployed, Mr. Micawber masquerading as Mother Courage. . . . All in all, Chaplin's Tramp gets off quite a few stops before the Finland Station."
The writing is also pretty slack at times, as if a zombie journalist were still at work when Sarris had gone home. Fritz Lang, we learn, "prowled the dark corners of the soul, where destiny collided with depravity." And there is quite a bit of gushing when the polemicist and memorialist take time off. "No still picture however luminous can do her ineffable beauty justice," Sarris says of Vivien Leigh, "for she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence."
But then, it's important that film images should move us as well as just move, and moving images are what we may all become if we are lucky -- if we are happily remembered. When asked if he knew Cary Grant, Sarris says he said no "very quickly," and then adds:
"But having seen 69 of his 72 movies, and having witnessed his marvelously gracious performances at several public occasions, can I be said to have 'known' him less intimately than I would have if I had peppered him with journalistic queries at some marathon interview or other? Very probably, I 'knew' much the best part of him, a part that I suspect he would have wanted me to know if he had had any inkling of how much I respected and admired all that he was."
Moving images in the cinema are constantly in dialogue with other moving images, and it's worth remembering that Chico couldn't have made his enduring wisecrack if Margaret Dumont had not been ready to say what she saw. "People sometimes ask me," Sarris says, "why we don't have people like the Marx Brothers anymore, and I reply that we do have people like the Marx Brothers, perhaps too many, but we don't have anyone like Margaret Dumont anymore."

HEADLINE: Don't Even Think About It. (The Cupid Cops Are Watching.)

BYLINE: By Philip Weiss; Philip Weiss is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about Southern retirees living the good life.

 BODY:
"Were you and sally making out in the back seat of a car at 11 last Friday night?"
It was lunchtime at the Bell Tower Club in Bakersfield, Calif., and Holly Culhane, a sturdy, black-haired woman in her late 30's, clad in a wine-colored polka-dot shirt, bent toward me, seeking an answer. 
 I sat up straight. "I've got to tell you something, Holly. I've worked for this company from 9 to 9 sometimes. What I do on my own time is none of your business."
"I understand how you feel. I understand that it's a frustrating situation." The wavelet of sympathy dissolved as quickly as it had appeared. "The only issue is whether you and Sally were making out in the back of a car and have a relationship that goes against what our policy allows a manager to be doing, a manager who is a direct representative of the company."
"We were in a car at 11 on Friday night," I said. "But we weren't in the back. We were in the front, and I don't know what 'making out' means. At one point . . .she and I are very. . .we worked together for four years. . .I put my hand----."
I reached for Culhane's shoulder. We were just role-playing. Culhane is a human resource consultant to small businesses in California, and she was showing me how she does her job. Many of the companies she advises have dating policies; sometimes she has to investigate. It was all hypothetical. So why was I stammering?
"You have to be more specific," she said. "The employee said she saw you guys kissing and groping in the back seat of this car."
"A member of this company is skulking around my car at 11 at night? Is that a good workplace environment?"
Culhane stirred her tea.
"You're more than welcome to talk to your boss about this," she said. "We want to deal with your concerns, too. You're not on trial by any means. The reality is that we have to go back to the question at hand. Is there a relationship between you and Sally?"
I folded. You would have, too.
"Let's say there was a relationship. Let's say I've been married 20 years and the passion's gone out of my marriage----."
"So you admit to having a relationship with this employee?"
"What is the confidentiality of the comments I'm making to you? My wife does not know about this."
"I understand. As I mentioned to you when we began the investigation interview, the comments you make to me will not even go back to your boss. They will go directly to your employer's attorney. We will tell your boss the results of the investigation, but we will not give him any specific statements. They're signed by you so----."
A waitress, aproned and cheerful, materialized with the dessert truck. Tarts. Mousses. Flan. Rule of thumb in Bakersfield: stick with the berry cobbler. As I dug in, I tried a new tack.
"Yes. We were kissing in that car. We're in love. I've never been so much in love in my entire life! I don't know why this has anything to do with harassment."
Culhane didn't blink. "Whether or not you're in love is not the issue. Whether or not you've never been this happy before is not the issue. The issue is, We have a complaint from someone. If this employee chooses to state that this romance has created a harassing or uncomfortable situation in the work environment, we just have to investigate."
Her cobbler was gone. Mine, too. But who was tasting anything? We tumbled back into the afternoon, and she went off to an appointment. I got into the rental car and cranked the music. Someone breathy and urgent came on, singing, of course, about sex.
 
Getting From Yes-Yes to No-No
The American people seem tolerant enough. They appear willing to accept the possibility that President Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship with an intern less than half his age. In Colorado, the citizens seem already to have forgiven Gov. Roy Romer's longtime relationship" with an aide. But that popular feeling is at sharp odds with a growing consensus among workplace professionals about how to make the office a fairer place. Labor lawyers, human resource managers and consultants like Holly Culhane agree: sex and romance between co-workers may be O.K., but almost never between people of unequal power. Policies at I.B.M., General Motors and other leading companies reflect this thinking. And by "unequal power" they don't mean simply the C.E.O. and his secretary. In the new economy, among educated professionals and all those managers and would-be managers who work so closely together in teams and late into the night, and often on the road after wine-besotted expense-account dinners. . .you get the picture.
Rules on consensual relationships are not, strictly speaking, sexual harassment policies. But they grow out of sexual harassment theory and practice. The average judgment in a successful harassment suit is $250,000, and that doesn't count legal costs or the negative publicity. "Surveys have asked executives what kind of a scandal would they least like to have presented to them," says Burke Stinson, senior public-relations manager at AT&T. "Product failure is at the top of the list, but I think sexual harassment is a horse that's getting to the front of the pack now."
Romances between unequals are seen as a breeding ground for harassment complaints especially after "they go south," to use the term of art; now two people in the same department are not talking to one another, and the subordinate doesn't get a promotion she feels she deserved and files a complaint. To prevent this, frightened corporate boards have teamed up with feminists dedicated to sexual equality and human resource managers dedicated to harmonious office life to regulate these affairs. As never before, your business is their business, for 40, 50, 60 or more hours a week.
The new rules come at a time when people are spending most of their waking hours at work. And now that there are more women in the workplace, offices are increasingly the backdrop for mating rituals. It has been said that the modern novel wouldn't exist without adultery. Well, "Ally McBeal" wouldn't exist without office romance. Not to mention a dozen other TV series set in law firms, hospitals and precinct houses that are hugely popular among professionals. Edward Harold, a labor attorney in New Orleans, says: "A lot of work today is like in the movie 'Speed': a man and a woman in a high-pressure situation where they have to solve a problem together. So it's no surprise they become romantically involved." But there is a phalanx of human resource types whose job it is to make sure life doesn't imitate art.
There are, of course, countless examples of unequals marrying: Microsoft's C.E.O., Bill Gates, and a former product manager, Melinda French; the chairman of G.M., John Smith, and his former secretary, Lydia Smith; Liz Tilberis, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, and a former professor at her art school, Andrew Tilberis. What would a human resource manager have made of those? Drawing the line at inequality would seem to be especially difficult in a contemporary workplace, where hierarchies have become both flatter and more fluid, where today's boss may be next month's co-worker, or vice versa.
But today some managers are paid to draw that line, to do something the poets have struggled to do through all of time, parse love. Many an intimate office relationship is clandestine and confusing; but instead of going to a therapist or a friend or a novel to help sort things out, modern lovers are expected to go to the guy on the 11th floor, in human resources. Modern lovers have to be documented. Modern lovers have to have their job assignments separated. Modern lovers have to visit what one human resource manager referred to, with only a little irony, as the Cupid Cops.
"If I hear rumors of a romance, I'll call up the line manager who's involved in the romance and ask him if it's true, and if it is, I'll take him, his manager and the employee and talk to them," says C. Anthony Ladt, the vice president for human resources of a large leasing company based in Louisiana. "I'll tell them we want to make sure that all parties understand it's consensual. I'll give her two numbers, my number in the corporate offices and the number of her manager's manager. That tears down the wall that ordinarily exists. And I'll say we frown on it. These relationships are great for the times they work out for the two people. But in this day and age, that doesn't happen a lot."
 
Among the Cupid Cops
In March, human resource people from around the country gathered on Capitol Hill; this was the annual legislative conference of the Society for Human Resource Management, an organization of 95,000 members. That's where I met Anthony Ladt. In olden days, managers like him were responsible for pension plans and 1099's. Today, the human resource manager has far greater powers, stemming in part from sexual harassment.
"It's not what most H.R. managers signed on to do, be a watchdog, be a policeman," Ladt said. But his job description includes eight-hour flights at the drop of a hat to deal with a harassment claim in one of his company's branches, instructions to employees not to leave things like roses on a co-worker's desk if their relationship is over and warnings to managers that if they want to invite one subordinate to a party, they better invite them all.
A quarter of American companies now have policies dealing with romance, according to a society survey. (Only half of them are written.) But the conventioneers I met in the basement of the Hyatt Regency are in the vanguard. In their workplaces, a Monica Lewinsky-Bill Clinton-like relationship would simply be out of the question. Whether or not the two had sex, the relationship was plainly a "special" one and likely a "sexually charged" one, to use two terms of opprobrium; such a relationship could demoralize a work force. "It goes to perceptions of leadership," said Susan Meisinger, the society's senior vice president, referring to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. "It's a dumb idea for him even to put himself in that position where questions of unfairness could arise. Think of a C.E.O. having a special relationship with the person that delivers mail or the person that works in the corporate cafeteria. The imbalance in power is just stark."
The workplace these H.R. managers survey is one where perceptions of unfairness become complaints in no time, and where complaints become nightmares.
"There is no notion of safe sex when you talk about supervisor-subordinate sex," Jonathan Segal, a Philadelphia employment attorney, told a conference gathering one morning. "Many of you have been to Ocean City, Md., seen the beautiful summer homes there. Well, a lot of them are owned by lawyers who have clients whose employees have unrestricted dating."
What do those lawyers tell their clients? Michael J. Lotito, a San Francisco employment attorney, leaned up against a wall outside a banquet room at the Hyatt and described one predicament.
"Here's a concrete situation," Lotito said. "The president of an organization that has operations around the country -- he inquired about whether it would be advisable for him to get involved in a welcome relationship with a woman at one of the stores. She was a clerk at a store 1,000 miles away. He wanted to know whether or not he could give her a letter that she could countersign, saying that the romantic relationship was welcome, that he wouldn't participate in personnel decisions that affected her. The advice that I gave him was, The welcome relationship today is the unwelcome relationship tomorrow. And what kind of a tone are you setting for other people in the situation? You're telling me it's discreet. You're going to try to keep it discreet, but everyone is going to find out about it in two seconds. And what if the manager of Store 1 wants to go out with someone in Store 2? Or a V.P. of operations is going to stores and asking people out?"
I went into lunch and sat at a table with four of the society's staff members. The conversation turned to flirtation on the job, and Sharon Leonard, manager of state legislative affairs, brought up a favorite loaded problem: two workers go on the road for a job, and one says, "Can we get adjoining hotel rooms?"
Leonard was disapproving. But I remembered similar situations in my own life and tried to hold a brief for the passionate.
"I can see wanting to do that," I said. "It's the flirtation process. You're taking a risk, putting yourself out there, seeking to establish if there's any interest."
Sara Costello, who works in customer relations, said: "I don't think you should establish that in the workplace. If you're interested in that, establish it outside the workplace."
"Aren't we making the workplace a sterile place?" I said.
"Maybe that's true," she said. "But on the other hand, we want to have fairness in the workplace."
 
How It Came to This
In 1975, a landmark speak-out was held in Ithaca, N.Y., on behalf of Carmita Wood, a 44-year-old worker at Cornell University who had done what so many women did when they faced unrelenting sexual pressure on a job -- given the job up. The following year, Redbook published a groundbreaking survey of sexual harassment in which about 90 percent of 9,000 women who responded said that they had been sexual harassed in the workplace.
"There was a grass-roots women's movement that started to identify this as a collective issue," says K.C. Wagner, who now works at Cornell's school of industrial and labor relations. "What was so powerful was that it gave a name to an experience that all women had, but didn't have a conceptual framework to address."
A legal effort paralleled the grass-roots one. Lawyers sensed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, barring job discrimination on the basis of sex, might be used against sexual coercion on the job. But the courts were not sympathetic. They tended to rule against individual women, saying that what each of these women had experienced was strictly personal. What was required was a grand theory that established that sexual coercion in the workplace was a form of discrimination suffered by women. This theory was supplied by a young Yale legal scholar named Catharine A. MacKinnon, who in 1979 published "Sexual Harassment of Working Women."
MacKinnon, who now teaches law at the University of Michigan and at the University of Chicago, says that she showed that sexual harassment wasn't personal, it wasn't biological, it wasn't trivial or interpersonally romantic. What it was was group-based, based on sex -- because a person is a woman, a member of a social group."
MacKinnon's brilliant, cold classic went hard at the notion that women who got involved with their superiors were consenting to sexual activity in the workplace. They had no choice, she argued.
Consent was made to stand for desire," MacKinnon says. "It's a pathetic term for desire. Did you ever hear a man come back from a great night out and say, 'I consented to sex last night!' Consent means something you put up with whether you want to or not."
Her argument had tremendous influence. In 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision affirming that sexual harassment was a form of sex discrimination, accepted her theory that "consensual" sex could still be coercive. This case, Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, involved voluntary sexual acts -- indeed, H.R. types call it the "safe sex" case because Mechele Vinson, a bank teller, said she had had sex with her boss 40 to 50 times, more than one of them in the vault. MacKinnon was one of Vinson's attorneys, and William H. Rehnquist, an Associate Justice at the time, endorsed the view that it didn't matter whether Vinson consented to the sex. "The correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome, not whether her actual participation in sexual intercourse was voluntary," Rehnquist wrote.
Much of the public discussion of sexual harassment during the 90's has been about a range of abuses less invasive than sleep-with-me-or-you're-out: lewd managers, frightful offices, unwanted back rubs, birthday parties with strippers. In the wake of the national speak-out that followed the Clarence Thomas hearings, the number of sexual harassment claims soared, and there is widespread acknowledgment among experts that things have got better. More recently, in the matter of Paula Jones, both the public and Judge Susan Webber Wright seem to have concluded that boorishness need not be sexual harassment; things have got not only better but more nuanced.
Meanwhile, pioneers have moved on to all sexual relationships between unequals. So what if they are consensual? What if the subordinate in the relationship should one day say the attention was unwelcome? To avoid lawsuits, some companies have adopted rules not only against gropers and lewd-joke tellers but also against the manager who asks a subordinate out on a date. "It's difficult for a subordinate to say no to a requested date from a supervisor who has control over his or her employment destiny," says Jonathan Segal, the lawyer from Philadelphia.
The unstable nature of consent was an issue not long ago in a case at Yale University. Months after a consensual relationship between a 17-year-old student and 32-year-old faculty member ended, the student came to regret the relationship and said that she had felt coerced. While the faculty member denied that the relationship had been sexual, Yale found that it had been "sexually charged" and reprimanded him for sexual harassment. Then the school adopted new rules last year that flatly bar relationships between teachers and their students.
In calling for the change, Richard H. Brodhead, dean of the college, acknowledged that many happy marriages had come out of unequal relationships and said that he valued "the right of adults to make their own choices and to take responsibility for the consequences of their choices with a minimum of institutional interference." But in the end, institutional interference won the day. Far better to say, "Just don't," Brodhead said.
Another problem surrounding consensual relationships is how they affect others in the workplace. When a supervisor has a relationship with a subordinate, other workers often sense unfairness, experts say. Remember Mary Cunningham, whose relationship in the 80's with William Agee, the chairman of Bendix, promoted scandal? It's hard to imagine Cunningham's rapid rise at Bendix occurring today without others filing some sort of grievance. "It's always been a factor, but now it gets surfaced much faster as an issue and it takes on ramifications," says a vice president for human resources at a large food-industry company. "Others will go complain if they see the favoritism. And there is a hostile work environment because of this."
The legal concepts evolving in this area can make your head hurt. Paramour preference -- is it illegal for a boss to give preference to a lover? Depends on what it does to the rest of the workplace. Could create "ugly duckling" litigation, complaints filed by those who were passed over. Especially if there was gossip about the liaison, which would contaminate the workplace, making it a hostile environment.
So TV pours out stories about sexualized workplaces, and we go to offices where there are smooching police?
"Employers have argued just what you are saying to me, that we are used to a certain amount of sexual freedom in this society, of sexual speech and content," says Eric Matusewitch, a specialist with New York City's Equal Employment Practices Commission. "And the courts have said that the so-called First Amendment freedoms don't exist in the workplace and can't exist because employees are a captive audience. We all basically have to work for seven or eight hours a day. And behavior that may be O.K. outside is not acceptable inside."
 
Nothing at the Office Is Zipless
Perhaps the best known consultant on sexuality in the workplace is Freada Klein. Based in Cambridge, Mass., Klein, who is 45, works with blue-chip companies all over the world, billing an average of $3,500 a day. The first time I spoke with her, by phone, she told me she has never called for flat prohibitions.
I thought I could catch Klein out. I alluded to the Lewinsky scandal.
"Is there any way a 48-year-old C.E.O. could have sex with a 21-year-old intern and it would be O.K.?"
"It certainly raises huge questions," she said. "Not to be evasive, but that depends on the corporate culture. If it's an operation with a truly effective practice, a corporation with an ombudsman with a direct line to the board, where the subordinate would have no fear of retaliation -- that's a very different environment from the overwhelming majority of corporate structures in place today. A very enlightened corporation, a very mature 21-year-old and a single rather than married 48-year-old----."
"What does marriage have to do with anything?"
"It has the possibility of being a real relationship rather than an extramarital fling," she said. An interesting distinction for a human resource consultant to be worrying herself about.
The first appointment I could get with Klein was on a Sunday. I flew up to Boston and took the train to M.I.T. and got out in a cold, empty square. The modern tower where her offices were was a few steps away.
Klein turned out to be a small, pretty, mirthful woman. She was wearing a purple sweater and was accompanied by a slightly owlish man, who went to get us tea and coffee from an Au Bon Pain. He looked familiar. He turned out to be Mitchell Kapor, the man who founded Lotus Development -- where Klein had once run the H.R. department! (Their relationship did not begin until nine years after she left Lotus.)
Klein talked about sex and power. In the early 70's, she was at Berkeley, getting a B.A. in criminology and working Sunday mornings at a rape crisis center. One morning Klein had a revelation when a woman called to talk about being raped the night before by a stranger.
"She was sobbing, and I remember almost verbatim her expression was, 'The hardest part is realizing how similar this is to sex with my boyfriend,"' Klein said.
"A light bulb went off?" I asked.
Klein nodded. "I began to think about something that Mitch and I will talk about because I will come home and say: 'How do you understand your gender? I don't understand how sexual activity with an unwilling partner is pleasurable."'
I told Klein that I might stand up for the unreconstructed male, and she smiled politely. I asked her if there was a difference between male and female managers as sexual predators.
"Women are less likely to be counting up notches in the belt," Klein said. "Sort of emotionless or acontextual sexual relationships----."
"What is an acontextual relationship?"
"There isn't an emotional context to the relationship. There isn't an exchange that an act of intimacy both reflects and furthers----."
"That's a value-laden comment," I said.
"Of course."
"Erica Jong used the term zipless favorably to refer to sex without consequences. That would fall into the category of acontextual relationship."
"That's the notches on the belt."
"Is that a bad thing?"
"That's a tough one," she said. "I don't want to condemn a competent grown-up who chooses it. I think it's a low value for a culture."
Kapor leaned into the discussion.
"When it happens in a workplace, it typically has consequences that are adverse to one or more of the participants. 'Zipless' was about strangers meeting in an encounter; they pass on. If people think about their past sexual relationships, they're just as happy not to see that person every day. Somehow one of the things we don't contemplate about office romances is that not only did this person not drop off the planet when we stopped being involved with them, they don't leave the cubicle next to ours. And that's what makes it an organizational issue. Which is to say that in practice 'zipless' just doesn't work. Ever. Hardly. It's an ideal. Erica Jong is a novelist."
 
No Sex, Please. We're Lawyers
I wanted to learn how people actually draw the line in the workplace so I gave Klein a letter to give to her clients. She sent it around the country, and it got just one taker, a big Newark law firm, Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger & Vecchione. Two progressive partners there had spearheaded the policy over resistance from other members of the firm, and one recent morning I met with them: David Sheehan, the managing partner, and Christine Amalfe. Sheehan had soft blue eyes and a ready sense of humor. Amalfe wore a tomato-red power suit with gold buttons.
The old Gibbons, Del Deo policy was unspoken; people weren't to get involved. Good employees were lost. The new one says dating between co-workers is fine, but that relationships between unequals present great difficulties and must be reported.
"Let's say the junior person wanted to end it, and the senior person starts acting differently, puts pressure on the junior person," Sheehan said. "It happens every day out there in the world. That's not a healthy situation to be involved in, to have to work with that person. Very few consensual relationships result in sexual harassment, but one can cost your company a whole lot of money, a whole lot of time, and hurt your reputation."
I brought up my favorite scenario: an affair on the road; in this context, a partner and associate on the West Coast working on a case together for months at a time.
"Why not have a relationship?" I said.
"Sometimes it happens," Amalfe said. "You can't prevent two people from traveling together just because they might, if the moon lined up correctly, and the stars, become an item. If they become an item, you deal with it."
"I guess I'm thinking of the movie version," I said. "If they had a discreet affair on the West Coast, no one learns about it and it ends when they get back, so what, none of your business."
"Correct," Sheehan said.
"Well, it would violate our policy," Amalfe said. "But it is none of our business."
Everyone laughed.
Then I said: "What if an associate says, 'I'm getting ignored because X is having a relationship with a partner and she's getting preferential treatment. I don't want to be identified. Everyone in the office feels this way."'
"We now have to investigate," Amalfe said.
"Do you respect the claim of confidentiality?"
"It makes it a little difficult," Sheehan said. "Let's assume I went to you, you're the person who's having the affair, your first reaction is, 'Who told you that?' I say, 'Well, I can't reveal my sources.' 'Well, how am I supposed to deal with these baseless allegations? That's just a baldfaced lie.' First rule of every relationship, by the way, is you deny it exists."
"Really?"
"Absolutely."
I asked Amalfe how she felt about the possibility that she might have to go to a partner senior to her and ask whether he or she was having an affair.
"It doesn't bother me in the least," she said.
"What do you ask?" I said. "'Are you having an affair?"'
"'What's going on?"' Amalfe said.
"I don't know that I'd be that direct," Sheehan said. "I think I'd ask a lot of other questions that would be difficult for him to answer without suggesting that there's more than just a casual relationship. For example, if people have seen them having dinner together on a Saturday evening, in a candlelit restaurant, just the two of them, that's a fact. I don't have to reveal my source for that. You were seen. I'd try to infuse into the scenario facts that would demonstrate that they've created an inappropriate relationship that has to then stop."
"Because the relationship is special?" I said.
"That's right," Sheehan said. "It does go back to Washington. We will never know until either Clinton or Lewinsky tells us, and we believe one or another, what actually happened. The only way you would ever know whether two people were having an affair, unless somebody's got some great photos, would be whether one of them gives you the kind of detailed information that would establish the fact. Trying to prove that is almost a fruitless task. So you pound away at the fact that all the other activities that they're engaging in create a clear appearance of improper conduct."
"David," I said, "you seem like a very tolerant person."
"Sure."
"Is this what you imagined your life would involve? You're in a room telling this guy what's inappropriate behavior?"
"I understand that, and maybe it's a denial of who we are as human beings, we have natural drives and passions----."
"And you're divorced!" I said, remembering something he'd told me at the start.
"Indeed."
Then Sheehan looked away, out the picture window filled with Jersey smokestacks, Jersey malls.
"I don't want to sound like a therapist, but you can't deny what your background is," he said. "My mother made tubes for RCA over in Harrison. She got to be a supervisor. I used to hear her every night at the dinner table complaining that she couldn't be a foreman because only men became foremen. My mom got held back inappropriately by a society that never should have let that happen. I met the foremen, and she could run them into the ground; she was much more talented than they were. That's always been with me. That's the real touchstone."
 
The End of the Affairs
I had a list of H.R. consultants and managers whose names I'd gotten off the Society for Human Resource Management Web site, and I flew west, then drove from San Francisco to Fresno to Bakersfield, down through El Nino and Modesto into the central California valley, past almonds blooming mauvely and pistachios bloomingly something elsely, experiencing that post-Lewinsky frisson of terror and prurience as modern lovers' business became the Cupid Cops' business. One H.R. person hung up the phone, saying, "I stay away from the he-said-she-said stuff," but for others it was grist.
"At one point, we asked the senior manager to end the relationship; he agreed," one H.R. manager said, describing a situation. "He said, 'I will do nothing that will jeopardize my career.' Well, he did not end it. You can understand his not breaking it off. If he were an average performer, we might press him a little harder. This guy was doing an outstanding job. We didn't really press it. We ended up getting an agreement, in which the woman is transferring into another environment."
Ruth Evans, an H.R. consultant in Fresno, told me of an investigation she'd once done of a consensual relationship gone sour: "There were gifts given. She wrote him a letter in which she expressed her interest. He had saved the letter, which I found very interesting. I couldn't prove it one way or the other that there was a relationship. But there was enough there to show that he may have led her on. So some sort of action had to be taken. In this case, reprimand and training."
And Holly Culhane: "She thought she would be laid off for lack of work, so she filed a sexual harassment suit against him. Finally he broke down and told us what was going on. It was still an ongoing relationship. She never divulged it was an affair, because he was married. He came clean. We transferred her to another department."
The consultants were all principled, well-meaning people, but the pop-culture scenarios of love in the workplace didn't play much in their minds. Culhane told me how unpleasant it was to have to tap out obscenities on her laptop as she did in an interview, then to have to repeat these words to an attorney over the telephone.
The most idealistic was Evelyn Foster, a consultant in Mill Valley who met me in the lobby of the Westin Hotel on San Francisco's Union Square. She wore brown suede flats and a dark blue blazer; she was steely and competent, a product of small-town Nevada whose talents had been taken for granted when she came into the work world and who had been chased around a desk more than once by an abusive manager. She had the H.R. religion: when sex is in the air, business suffers, people are less productive.
We talked about investigating romance, and I asked whether Foster made any judgment about the emotional content of a relationship.
"Yes," she said. "You don't punish people because of love. If they honestly fall in love, bless them, two good competent employees and they fall in love -- you try and accommodate that situation. Is it true love or just a very exciting fling? And I would say, one probably encounters more of the fling, the short-term affair. And there's all sorts of things going on in that dynamic: the power play, the subordinate figuring they're going to get ahead, that they're getting an edge above everybody else. The context isn't a long-term meaningful love relationship. It's something else, but generally it's not to anybody's advantage in the end."
"What if a person confessed to you: 'I fell in love. I'm married. What should I do?"'
"I would try to determine, Is this person antagonistic toward his wife, is he going to marry this person? If it feels more like true love, then maybe you accommodate it in the sense that you pull the subordinate out of that department and try to find them a job somewhere else in the company and really distance them and then it takes that problem out of his department. You honor that this is true love. But if the person has no intention of divorcing his wife, if it still has the aura of being an affair and an affair in direct line like that is against the company guideline.. . ."
 
The Power of a Desirable Subordinate
A few years ago, a campus forum on sexual harassment would be sure to focus on its horrors, but when I squeezed sideways into a standing-room-only hall at the City University of New York's gay and lesbian center late last winter, the panel's talk was about the joy of sex between people of unequal status. For whatever reason, protests against consensual sex codes seem to be coming, at least for now, from the gay quarters on campuses.
The star of the panel was a forceful and attractive woman with a booming voice and tangled dark hair: Jane Gallop, a feminist literary scholar and the leading critic of the new rules barring relationships between unequals.
"I think they can be abusive, but always abusive?" she said. "There are few people in the world between whom there isn't a power differential. And so that would make all sex abusive, except between identical twins." (A pair of identical twins approached Gallop after the panel to say that there are stark power issues between twins.)
Five years ago, the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee investigated Gallop for sexual harassment over flirtations that she said were consensual. Gallop was teaching at the university. The flirtations were with two female students. Gallop was living (and still is) with the father of her two children.
"My first response was shame," she told me. "The administration and my lawyer told me to be silent. A lot of friends said I should be silent. Because the worst thing that could happen to me is it would come out publicly. But the worst part was the two months of silence."
Gallop was cleared, then turned the situation to her advantage by writing a book, Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment. In it, she relates the pleasure she experienced in the sexual tension between herself and one accuser, whom she had kissed, and celebrates the erotic charge that exists between teachers and students. She describes her own days as a graduate student, when she seduced two male members of her dissertation committee.
"Lots of smart, ambitious young women, many of them likewise feminist academics today, have felt powerful because they seduced their teachers," she wrote. Her professors "were brilliant. I wanted to get them into bed to make them more human. I wanted to see them naked."
Oh, that Monica Lewinsky might someday scour her soul!
But Jane Gallop's backlash is fairly lonely. Men who have suffered in consensual- relationship investigations almost invariably go to cover. Martin Hanaka left the presidency of Staples last fall after a relationship he had with a line employee came to light. (The employee accused him of assault, a charge later dismissed.) Hanaka said that the relationship had not been sexual. But it had plainly been special -- Hanaka had met with her for breakfast and lent her $10,000, even as she was seeking a promotion -- and thus violated Staples's strict fraternization policy barring undisclosed relationships between supervisors and subordinates. Hanaka left for a job in Florida and doesn't want to talk about it.
Nor does the former assistant professor of the now notorious case at Yale. His reprimand for having a "sexually charged" relationship with an undergraduate woman has dogged him around the country. The man's attorney begged me not to mention his case by name, even though it has been published.
"Every time his name is mentioned in the press, more nails are added to the coffin," the attorney, John A. Stewart, said. His current faculty position, Stewart said, "is based on the fact that he's not in the newspaper. People are scared to death of the publicity he might bring to their campus."
Stewart went on to denounce the "administrative, nonjudicial, non-due-process types of investigation" to which people in his client's position are subjected. Valerie Jenness, an assistant professor of criminology at the University of California at Irvine, expressed similar views. Jenness was teaching at Washington State University when the school investigated her two years ago. A minor dispute had arisen over Jenness's contribution to a short paper written by her former girlfriend, and because the girlfriend was a graduate student and Jenness was faculty, the investigation turned to sexual harassment. It did not matter that Jenness was 33, the girlfriend 35, or that they were in separate departments. After what Jenness says was a harrowing year, she was exonerated. But W.S.U. did not renew her contract.
"It gets mean; it makes life pretty miserable," says Jenness. "If I'm charitable, I can say that institutions are in a tough position. They don't want to be caught not caring. They know if there's any hint of sexual harassment and they fail to move aggressively, they can be liable. So what we have is an exaggerated response -- cutting corners, aggressively pursuing stuff."
A faculty grievance committee at W.S.U. found that the school had violated Jenness's privacy and right to due process. At one point, for instance, her notes and letters to a student who had sought a romance with her were passed out at a faculty meeting, apparently as evidence of what one official called "bad boundary maintenance."
Bad boundary maintenance! Passion and boundaries have always been on difficult terms. Jane Gallop was accused, among other things, of putting her bare foot on a student's chair and rocking it inappropriately. It's little wonder she has cast these consensual-relationships codes as antisex.
"Because I believe so strongly that sexual harassment is wrong, I object to the way in which it's become diffused so that sex in and of itself is a bad thing," she says. "You cannot be human, you cannot have human feelings about other workers, you cannot respond as you would when you hear a song on the radio.
"I actually believe that when a person in power chooses to have a relationship with someone below them, they're endangering their power. It makes them more vulnerable. Saying that women need protection turns them into poor pathetic people who must be protected against their own sick desires. Seeing women as objects, as passive, as victims, with no sexuality on their own. And seeing men as totally predatory, purely active in the most evil sense of the word."
Though it may be tempting to imagine a libertine army brandishing Gallop's text and holding out for the right of adults to navigate power relationships in the workplace, I doubt that the "pro sex" position will prevail here. The understanding that romance between unequals can disrupt a workplace is today the reigning human resource orthodoxy. The American sense of fairness and meritocracy recoils at the notion that sex is the score by which women should advance. The chaste feel they have a grievance. The courts have given companies wide latitude to bar unequal relationships.
Catharine MacKinnon has supported some of these codes, too. In the wake of the Lewinsky case, she wrote that organizations have a right to bar relationships that are both "wanted" and "exploitive."
I asked her why she feels that way. "Because when men get done with women sexually -- she was talking about the workplace, which she says the courts have deemed "an island of equality" -- they're done with them. They're slime."
So why shouldn't there be laws against these relationships? She said she had problems with that. Women plainly want these relationships. A law won't do the trick. There has to a national discussion. People have to talk about it.
"If all such relationships were ended, how many relationships would be left between men and women?" she said. "I make people think about these issues, and they don't want to. They want to jump out of a 30th-story window, or push me out of it."
 
Getting a Little More Personal
Late in March, I met Freada Klein for dinner at the Ambassador Grill near the U.N. We both lunged for the wine list and decided to split a $42 bottle. As a result, we had a merry time that got confessional after 10 o'clock.
It began when I told her that as a reconstructed male, I had called a couple of women I'd had sexual encounters with years before to see if these encounters were, as I feared, "consensual but unwelcome."
"Good," she said. "That speaks volumes about you. I'm very careful to say it is completely unfair to judge a 1970's relationship by a late-1990's standard."
"Thanks," I said. "You may have just got me off the hook."
Klein smiled and said that helping to change these rules was for her a "true joy and honor."
Then she told me that as a 16-year-old college student she had had "a completely consensual relationship" with a professor 20 years older than herself.
I was stunned. "How long did it last?"
"On and off for a decade. This might be news to my parents but, hey, it's all right."
"Did you get a lot out of it?"
"Of course. It took place within a particular context within a particular social era, and I did not then, nor do I now, define that as a coercive relationship. But would I want my niece, for example, who is 16----."
"On its face it, has certain inequities," I said.
"Absolutely. Do I imagine that there are other students who are my peers that he or another professor could have made moves on and would have been a devastating experience? Yes."
"For someone, it's devastating. For you, it was O.K. This is all about context."
"Exactly," she said.
Having started out with the hammers of law, we'd arrived at the more delicate workings of etiquette. It struck me that this was one of feminism's most enduring contributions. Having persuaded our society that the personal was political, sometimes it could go back the other way. Sometimes the political could be merely personal after all.

HEADLINE: Touring Percussionists Who Aren't Really Offbeat

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
ONE might have thought that five percussionists who wanted to band together as a full-time touring ensemble were unrealistic, even slightly eccentric. The repertory for percussion quintets, after all, is slender. And although such a group is, strictly speaking, a chamber ensemble, its potential audience is likely to come not from the string quartet and piano trio circuit but from the more constricted world of new music.
Yet Bob Becker, William Cahn, Robin Engelman, Russell Hartenberger and John Wyre joined forces in 1971 to form Nexus, and now they have plenty to show for their persistence. The quintet, based in Toronto, gives about 100 performances and master classes a year. It has released more than a dozen recordings on its own label, Nexus, and it just cracked the majors with new recordings of Toru Takemitsu's "From Me Flows What You Call Time" (on Sony Classical) and Gavin Bryars's "One Last Bar, Then Joe Can Sing" (on Point, Philips's new-music imprint). 
 These works are among the two dozen or so scores commissioned by or for Nexus; Steve Reich, Michael Colgrass, Bruce Mather and John Cage have also composed for the group. But Takemitsu's "From Me Flows What You Call Time," a concerto for percussion and orchestra commissioned as part of Carnegie Hall's centenary celebration, has become Nexus's signature piece.
Its title, taken from a poem by Makoto Ooka, was meant to evoke the musical memories of a century at Carnegie Hall. The group gave the premiere at Carnegie in 1990, with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, and has played it more than 60 times. On Tuesday, it returns to the hall to perform it with Jukka-Pekka Saraste and the Toronto Symphony.
"Takemitsu approached writing a piece for us with a different esthetic than you would expect," Mr. Cahn said recently of the gracefully exotic 36-minute work, which is scored for both Western and Asian instruments, and includes a section in which the players use streamers to animate wind chimes mounted above the audience. "You would think that a work written for Carnegie Hall's anniversary and for the Boston Symphony would be an occasion for bombastic music, with all the force percussion can present. But Takemitsu was more interested in quiet music."
The Bryars score, too, is quiet and moody, and in fact much of the Nexus repertory confounds a listener's expectations. The players have expanded it by composing works of their own, and because they have collected dozens of folk instruments from around the world, their pieces often incorporate African and Asian drumming traditions. Nexus concerts also include improvisations, which are entirely unscripted.
"The one time we tried to plan an improvisation," Mr. Hartenberger said in a conversation with the group, "was about 25 years ago, when Bill had the idea that we should go out onstage and pretend to hit our instruments without actually touching them."
William Cahn took up the story: "The underlying philosophical idea was that if there are radio waves that you don't see and can't hear without a radio receiver, then perhaps there is something about music that can be communicated through means other than sound. So the plan was that we would set up the instruments; we'd try to feel inside what we feel when we're making music; we'd make the gestures and do everything we could to communicate a musical idea, without producing a sound.
"I still don't have an answer as to whether that communicates or not."
"I do," Mr. Hartenberger said, drawing laughter from the rest of the group.
"At any rate," Mr. Engelman chimed in, "we agreed to execute Bill's idea, and we went out onstage. And in the first gesture Bill made, he accidentally hit his instrument, ruining the whole concept."
The interaction among the five musicians in conversation is not unlike the give and take in their concerts. Now all in their 50's or just out of them, they say they have maintained their friendship after 27 years of working and touring together, a rare circumstance, given the tensions and potential ego clashes inherent in a musical collaboration. Few ensembles endure that long without personnel changes.
"People ask us if we get along, probably because there is that history of tense relationships, especially among string quartets," Mr. Wyre said. "I think the difference in instruments may have something to do with it. String players punish themselves to learn those instruments, and maybe when it comes time to share that in an ensemble, there's less joy. We don't have the weight of 300 years of pedagogy behind our playing. We don't have to share bowings, and we have never told each other how to play."
Mr. Hartenberger added: "We started out as friends. We were five guys meeting in one another's living room and setting up instruments and playing. From that the group evolved."
Nexus also has the luxury of working in a field that is not overcrowded. Its biggest European rivals -- apart from soloists like Evelyn Glennie -- are Les Percussions de Strasbourg, a venerable French ensemble, and the Kroumata Percussion Ensemble, a Swedish sextet that has made extraordinary recordings. The New Jersey Percussion Ensemble, directed by Raymond DesRoches, and Pulse, directed by Claire Heldrich, are active in the New York area, but their personnel changes regularly, and they don't tour as widely as Nexus.
"The guys in Nexus are the high priests of the percussion world," said Daniel Druckman, a percussionist who performed with several New York ensembles before joining the New York Philharmonic. "They are all really fine players and very interesting musicians. Before world music became such a cliche, they were out there exploring the percussion music of other cultures, not in a cynical, marketing way but out of sincere interest."
Nexus has its frustrations. The players would like to do more commissioning, but the composers they want are expensive. Even getting a work from Takemitsu, a composer who admired their work enough to sponsor some of their Japanese performances, was difficult.
"We gave him about $10,000," Mr. Engelman began.
"It was more like $2,000," said Mr. Cahn, who is the group's business manager.
"O.K., $2,000," Mr. Engelman continued. "Later he told us he had started our piece at least three times, but it wasn't coming together." It wasn't until Carnegie Hall arranged for a $55,000 commissioning fee from the Suntory Corporation, that Takemitsu produced "From Me Flows What You Call Time."
Another obstacle in Nexus's commissioning program is that composers don't always listen carefully when the players convey their needs and desires. Composers often give little consideration to such practicalities as how much equipment Nexus can economically take on tour.
"SOMETIMES pieces just don't work out," Mr. Wyre said. "If someone writes a work that includes five bass drums, we can't take that piece on the road. It's just too massive. It's one thing to learn a work and give its premiere. We try to choose music that will become part of our repertory, works that we can play over many years and know there's going to be some growth in what we can do with them."
There is, to be sure, a small repertory of classic works on which Nexus can draw, including works of the 1940's by John Cage and Lou Harrison.
"With Cage in particular, the instrumentation allows for a lot of flexibility," Mr. Becker said. "He might ask for something that rattles, for example, and there are a lot of possibilities you could choose. So when we play those pieces, they sound very different from when another percussion group plays them. I think that the farther up you come to the present-day repertory, the less that's the case. The instrumentation becomes more specific, and the sound becomes more stable, so we are less able to make those pieces distinctively Nexonian."
When the players find a score that works for them, the first thing they do is decide how to distribute the instrumentation, taking into account personal strengths. Mr. Becker and Mr. Hartenberger, who also play in Steve Reich's ensemble, are expert players of mallet instruments, for example, and Mr. Wyre is especially fond of exotic gongs, bells and temple bowls.
In the work by Takemitsu, who died two years ago, the composer spared them the task, designating parts for each of them in the score.
"We've been spoiled by this piece," Mr. Cahn said. "It not only gives us a piece by a great composer, but it gets us together with symphony orchestras, and it showed us what that level of creative production can bring in terms of response."
Mr. Engelman added: "Still, when we were in Japan to perform the work there, Toru said to me, 'Do you want your $2,000 back?' I said, 'Yeah, maybe with interest.' And he said, 'I'm sorry, but I spent it a long time ago.' "

For Shelton, Fairfield's First Spec Building in Decade

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: SHELTON

 BODY:
GROUND is to be broken next month for Fairfield County's first speculative Class A office building in a decade -- not in Stamford, but at the northwestern edge of the county in Shelton. The construction is to start without the developer, the Davis Companies of Boston and Wilton, having a single lease in hand.
The move comes at a time when at least four major office projects approved for construction in downtown Stamford remain unbuilt for lack of committed tenants. 
 "Suburban buildings are being built first, in the Boston area, Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco," said Paul Marcus, president of the Davis Companies, a 23-year-old real estate investment, management and development concern with more than 3 million square feet of properties in New England, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.
"Only one building is going up in downtown Boston," he explained. "Cities have no room for companies to grow."
Mr. Marcus noted that Shelton, a 32-square-mile town, had plenty of room for expansion and that taxes and the cost of land were both low, all attractions for financial partners.
"I have five options -- all pension funds willing to invest because my first building of 157,000 square feet will cost $120 a square foot rather than the $200 a square foot required in Stamford," said Mr. Marcus. "Moreover, with a 20-acre parcel in Shelton I can build in phases rather than requiring financing for a 400,000- to 600,000-square-foot building that must go up all at once."
Another attraction is the tax rate in Shelton: $22.77 per $1,000 assessment, as opposed to $25.60 to $28.10 in Stamford.
Mr. Marcus has received approval from the Shelton Planning and Zoning Commission to erect 400,000 square feet of offices. Associated with him in the venture is David A. Mack Properties of Southport. The project, to be called Reservoir Corporate Center, will eventually contain three buildings on a hill overlooking the scenic Trap Falls Reservoir, near Exits 11 and 12 of Route 8.
Twin five-story buildings of 157,000 square feet each will be connected by a one-story structure housing a full-service cafeteria and fitness center. Rents will be in the low $20's a square foot compared with Stamford Class A rents that have reached as much as $35 a square foot.
Occupancy of the first building is scheduled for next March. Construction of the second and third buildings will be contingent on substantial leasing of the first building. The third building will be marketed as a corporate headquarters. "We would build to suit for a single tenant," Mr. Marcus said. The tract will be enhanced with walking and jogging trails and extensive landscaping.
His confidence in proceeding without tenants is bolstered by the vacancy rate of about 5 percent for Class A space in the Shelton-Trumbull marketplace. The demand is such that a 119,000-square-foot office building still under construction by Robert D. Scinto -- a major local developer -- has been fully leased. Major lessees are Brand Direct, a marketing company for financial institutions, with 35,000 square feet, and Clayton Group, managers of real estate portfolios for those institutions.
Other positive factors include easy access to labor via Route 8, significant amounts of new reasonably priced housing, and the fact that companies pressed for space in lower Fairfield are moving parts or most of their operations to cheaper locations.
An indication of Shelton's rising status, said Mr. Marcus, was the sale of his company's building at 1000 Bridgeport Avenue. Bought for $65 million 18 months ago, he said, it has just been sold to Mack-Cali, a New Jersey real estate investment trust, for $120 million.
Shelton's commercial-building surge is taking place in a triangle extending from the reservoir to Bridgeport Avenue at the west and Commerce Drive to the north. Nearly 750,000 square feet of offices have been approved or are now rising, and the planning department expects more applications through June. The town now has a total of 3.4 million square feet of office space.
Two new hotels, an AmeriSuites and a Homestead Village, have broken ground and the Hilton hotel chain has applied for approval of a two-building complex consisting of a moderately priced inn and an upscale hotel and conference center.
Five new restaurants, a Marriott Residence Inn, a Ramada Inn, a Sears Hardware, Bradlees, TJ Maxx, Wal-Mart and Staples, plus numerous smaller stores and buildings housing offices and light industry, have opened at various times over the last three years.
"The city is coming to fruition now," said Mark A. Lauretti, Shelton's four-term mayor, whose family-owned restaurant, Lauretti's, will move to a new location to make way for the Hilton project.
"I've been here since the population was 12,000, now it's 36,000," said the 43-year-old Mayor, a lifelong resident. "We started with an industrial base, now we have a corporate roster that's the envy of this region."
Indeed, the city has come a long way from 1975, when the Goodrich sponge-rubber plant burned down, putting 4,500 people out of work. During the building spree in the early 80's a concerted effort by the town to refocus its economy on offices rather than smokestack industry brought a crop of large buildings to newly established corporate parks -- just in time for the crash of 1987.
By 1989 the vacancy rate for its six million square feet of office and industrial buildings was 37 percent. With prices down everywhere, tenants could afford the more fashionable towns along the Gold Coast, leaving Shelton with a crushing number of empty buildings, some not even finished.
I N 1990 Auguste-Thouard, a French real estate firm whose subsidiary, the ATC Group, is based in Greenwich, bought a 155,000-square-foot building at 1 Research Drive in Shelton for $5.6 million, well under the asking price of $12 million. "We still own it," said Alain LeBleu, president of the ATC Group.
Last year he sold a 450,000-square-foot building on 50 acres at 710 Bridgeport Avenue for $26 million; he had bought it in 1991 for $22 million. It was purchased -- fully occupied by Philips Medical Systems and Timex -- by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a Melville, L.I., REIT. "We sold off another building in Shelton," said Mr. LeBleu, "and although we are approved to build a 60,000-square-foot office building at 1 Research Drive, we will not do so until we have a prelease situation."
"I think Shelton is a good, longterm, stable market, but we haven't the same perception of a turnaround that others have," he continued. "I don't think there will be a huge demand in the next two or three years."
In 1991, Zell-Merrill Lynch, now Equity Office Real Estate Investment Trust, bought and still owns Shelton Pointe on Trap Falls Road, a five-story, 160,000-square-foot office building with a cafeteria, fitness center, and an eight-acre campus graced by a pond and five fountains.
"We think of Shelton as a complementary situation to our presence in Stamford," said Jeff Johnson, chief investment officer for Equity Office Properties in Chicago. "It was one of our first Northeastern assets, and it remains a low-cost alternative to Stamford and New York."
Companies and projects that have been drawn here over the last 17 years include Pitney Bowes, Physicians Health Services, Tetley USA and the Shelton Square Shopping Center. In addition, Mr. Scinto has built several office parks including Enterprise Park -- a complex of four office buildings, two currently under construction -- and two additional buildings on Commerce Drive.
Housing priced from $190,000 to $600,000 is available in hundreds of varied housing units scattered across the rural countryside or close to the office complexes.
"Some enclaves have pools, jogging paths and tennis courts," said Linda Schauwecker, a partner at Real Estate II, a local firm.
Since the Goodrich fire, Shelton's downtown has deteriorated and its lack of a movie theater or cultural offerings is somewhat off-putting. But, said Kevin M. Foley, a broker with Cushman & Wakefield in Stamford, leasing agent for Reservoir Corporate Center, "the lack of night life is not an argument we hear."
"Restaurants and shopping are more important than theater and the arts," he said, "and those things are available in Stamford -- only 30 minutes away. Trumbull has a 12-screen theater, Bridgeport has 25 screens."
"The big complaint is not enough hotel rooms -- you have to book two weeks in advance," he continued. "Because of the location Shelton is expected to accommodate people on extended stays, doing business from Stamford to New Haven."
Said Paul Kauffman, head of a Cushman & Wakefield team servicing Reservoir Corporate Center:
"Shelton will not attract financial services headquarters or major New York City Fortune 500 headquarters. But it will continue to attract middle management divisions of Fortune 500's for its ability to draw on a widely diversified labor force in a broad geographic area. Basically, Shelton is now a mature, stand-alone market with a stand-alone address. People know where it is."

HEADLINE: Bond Sale to Lower Electric Rates

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
In a matter of days, the first segment of the largest sale of municipal bonds ever undertaken in the United States will mark a milestone in Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to cut Long Island electric rates by 20 percent.
Mr. Pataki said the rate cut would take effect immediately after the partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, which is imminent, and will last for at least five years. 
 It will be the largest single reduction in electric costs in the region's history.
Although Long Island's rates will still be among the highest in the country, regional economists have said the reduction will create tens of thousands of jobs, help retain and attract businesses and boost a regional economy that is already robust.
Critics, calling the savings illusory, said any initial benefits would be far outweighed by the eventual cost of the plan for electric customers and by blocked competition.
A long-term result of the Pataki plan, they said, would be to dam up competitive pressures that would transform the electric industry in other parts of the state and country over the next 30 years.
One group, the Hauppauge Industrial Association, said it and other opponents to the plan were deciding whether to sue to stop the issuance of the bonds.
But the bond sale advanced decisively last month. A little-known but very important state panel, the Public Authorities Control Board, approved the sale by the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, of the first $3 billion of a record-breaking $7.3 billion to be sold by the end of the year.
The sale's success with investors was virtually assured last week when a financial rating agency, Standard & Poor's, gave the bonds an investment-grade of A-. (Ratings range from AAA to D.)
The agency noted, but downplayed, some predictions that technological innovations and competition in the electric industry would lead customers to abandon the new state power system, depriving it of revenues to pay off the bonds.
"We don't think the technologies are advancing enough at this point to suggest that cash flow will be at risk," said Marla A. Fox, a director in the public finance department of Standard & Poor's. The agency also noted that competition would be limited because Long Island had few prospects for importing power.
"Lipa's vulnerability to competitive forces is expected to be limited," the agency said, referring to the power authority by its acronym. "Competitive risks are tempered by transmission constraints and customer-base demographics. Consequently, Lipa should achieve the sound financial performance that it is projecting."
The agency also noted "the stability associated with a transmission and distribution system that serves a broad, predominantly residential and affluent customer base."
Ms. Fox said this statement referred in part to the lack of major industrial power users on Long Island, whose future withdrawal from the electric system could greatly reduce revenues.
The Standard & Poor's rating is the first close look at the Pataki plan from the perspective of potential investors and almost certainly guarantees buyers in a Wall Street market that experts said was hungry for new municipal bond issues. A second agency, Fitch IBCA, gave the bonds a similar rating.
Experts said the bonds would be especially attractive to New York investors because they are triple tax-exempt, meaning they are exempt not only from Federal, but also from state and local taxes.
Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the Long Island Power Authority, said marketing of the bonds should proceed quickly to take advantage of low interest rates.
Experts estimated that interest on the first segment of bonds would be about 6 percent.
Critics of the plan say it will saddle electric customers with billions of dollars in debt over the next 30 years and hold customers hostage to a state-owned utility dependent on customer revenues to avoid bond default. But they acknowledged that in the current market, the bonds were likely to sell briskly.
"You can sell almost anything in a bull market like this," said Charles M. Studness, an analyst of utility finances. "But that doesn't mean what's going to happen is good for Long Island."
The bond sales will finance a sweeping restructuring of the source of Long Island's electricity by replacing the Long Island Lighting Company, the region's privately owned utility and power provider since 1910, with a public-private hybrid unlike any other power company in the country.
The plan calls for the Long Island Power Authority to purchase Lilco's transmission and distribution system as well as Lilco's 18 percent ownership share of the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power facility near Scriba.
Following a planned merger with Brooklyn Union Gas, Lilco will continue to own Long Island generating stations, selling power to the power authority and managing the delivery system.
The power authority will have jurisdiction over electric rates, an aspect of the plan that alarms some critics. Rates for private utilities are set by the New York State Public Service Commission.
The key provision in the Pataki plan will convert a paper asset held by Lilco -- representing more than $4 billion in uncollected costs and interest for the never-operated Shoreham nuclear power plant -- into a cash payment to the company. This measure precludes the possibility of writing off some or all of the remaining Shoreham debt.
The Internal Revenue Service helped assure the plan when it said Lilco would be exempt from about $2 billion in capital gains taxes on the sale of the Shoreham paper asset to the authority.
The Pataki plan will raise $4.2 billion through the sale of tax-exempt state bonds to refinance the Shoreham debt at lower interest.
Critics said the payment for the paper asset was a bailout of Lilco for costs the company and its shareholders should assume for the failed nuclear project. Construction costs for the plant caused Lilco to institute a series of major rate increases during the 1970's and 80's.
In a 1989 settlement with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Lilco agreed to sell the plant to the Long Island Power Authority for $1 in exchange for the creation of a $4.5 billion regulatory asset that allowed the company to collect on all prudent costs and interests for the plant project.
Mr. Kessel and other backers of the Pataki plan have said the 1989 agreement makes it legally impossible for state regulators to compel Lilco to write off some or all of the Shoreham costs. Critics of the Pataki plan strongly disagree.
The unanimous vote by the Public Authorities Control Board last month approving the initial bond sale was the final state approval necessary.
The board has three voters: Mr. Pataki; Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer, the Senate majority leader; and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan.
With his vote, Mr. Silver chose not to exploit an opportunity to delay or thwart the Republican governor's plan in a gubernatorial election year.
As the likelihood of a 20 percent rate reduction increased, it was hailed by some officials. "I don't think any of us should have cold feet," said Bruce Nyman, Democrat of Long Beach, a member of the Nassau County Legislature. "A lot of people have been waiting for this for 20 years.
"Interest rates have never been lower," Mr. Nyman said. "A few years ago, I was getting more interest in my Christmas club."
Critics said they saw trouble ahead. "The bonds are fraught with risk, but buyers will be well compensated," said Gregory A. Palast of Southold, a utility regulation analyst.
"But we don't know what the future electric market will be," he added. "And there is a practical limit to how much you can squeeze from people on Long Island to pay off these bonds."

HEADLINE: The View From/Exeter;
Postgraduate Programs -- of the High School Variety

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
DAVID CADELINA, football coach and math teacher, is introducing his students at Central High School in Bridgeport to another world, a world few of them even dream about. He is recommending his most academically promising players for a postgraduate year at Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the nation's most prestigious independent schools, which counts among its graduates Daniel Webster, John and David Rockefeller, George Plimpton and Pierre Dupont, former Governor of Delaware.
"You get very close to your players if you are coaching your sport the way you should. You become coach, teacher, parent for the players. You want to see all good things happen for them," explained Mr. Cadelina, who is in his first year at Central. 
 So this spring he discussed a possible plan with his football players -- who had never heard of Exeter, never heard of a postgraduate year and were unsure of the advantages of staying in high school another year. One not only decided to try, but made it, with Mr. Cadelina working on college placement for other players.
The fifth year, called a postgraduate year, is not well known but many private schools offer it. Students have a chance to mature, to grow academically and for athletes, especially important, to grow physically.
A graduate of Amity High School in Woodbridge, Mr. Cadelina recalled his own postgraduate year at Choate prior to entering Hamilton College. "I was fortunate to have parents who pushed me to take the P.G. year and got me into a very good liberal arts school," he said, "so I've seen what a good education can do." This is what he wants for his students.
He contacted a friend in the admissions office at Exeter and learned that the school, in a bucolic setting in New Hampshire, "sought students from every quarter." This language appears in the school's charter and is interpreted today to mean students from different economic circumstances as well as geographical areas, according to Tom Hassan, admissions director. When Mr. Cadelina arrived with the three nervous candidates on a campus visit, they saw they would not be alone among the elite. "There's a group of students up there just like them," said their coach.
Lee Young of the Exeter admissions office said the school's recruiters visited 30 cities last year, seeking a diverse student body for the 35-person postgraduate program. Two of Mr. Cadelina's applicants did not have adequate grades or test scores to do the demanding work at Exeter, she said.
But Antonio DePina, 18, of Cape Verdean extraction, who speaks Creole and Portuguese and dreams of becoming a history teacher, was accepted and will be at Exeter this fall. He played defensive end and guard on the Central team and has already met the football coach at Exeter.
This year, Tony, as he is known, is in rigorous honors classes but he said that in his freshman year, his grades were not outstanding. He attends Central High School's magnet component, a school within the high school for 730 students that focuses on college preparation. Patricia Cucuzza, the supervisor of the school, reports 96 percent of its graduates continue their education, some at Yale, Harvard and Princeton. Seventeen advanced placement classes are offered.
Tony has his eye on Trinity College in Hartford and believes the additional year at Exeter will pull up his grade point average. "If I go to high school another year I will have more choices," he explained.
At Exeter, he found the students friendly, the food good and the campus college-like. "The kids were really outgoing," he said. "Here they are outgoing only if they know you." In fact, he added, "For being one of the top prep schools in the nation they were pretty much down to earth."
Tony said his family thought he should go directly into college from Central but his sister urged him to take the postgraduate year. "These kids seem more mature I think because they live away from home," he said, thoughtfully. He is a self-sufficient young man and plans to make his own meals when he misses his mother's Creole specialties.
Tony credits the coach with turning the team around, as well as landing him at Exeter. "He's done a lot to pick up morale," Tony said. "Everyone thought the football program was dead."
The coach runs a rigorous sports program, with strict rules that whittled down the number of players to 33 from 90. Players must stick to a strict weight-lifting regimen, sign a code of conduct promising to be good citizens and perform academically as well.
"We want everybody to think positive things when they hear 'Central football,' " said the coach, adding, "a lot of kids don't make it but the kids who do become a permanent part of our football family."
The coach's attention showed fast results. In the fall of 1997 his players' grades were at their highest. Parents called Coach Cadelina to express their appreciation. He worked with teachers and asked them to notify him of academic or discipline problems among his players. First he and the other coaches discipline faltering players by making them runs laps, many laps. Then they require them to attend extra help sessions held Wednesday evenings after practice.
Coach Cadelina said, "As far as Exeter is concerned I'm not looking at it nearly as much from a coaching standpoint as I am an overall life experience. College coaches look favorably on the postgraduate year because players are a year older, a year faster, a year stronger, just a year better."

Active-Adult Communities Gaining in the North

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
SLOWLY but steadily, the construction of active-adult communities is pushing deeper into the northern part of the state, where developers say the demand for such housing outstrips the supply.
Three projects, one each in Warren, Passaic and Morris Counties, in various stages of development will produce a total of 1,300 housing units over the next five years or so. Such projects, which offer social and recreational services and someone else to do the chores, cater to buyers 55 and older who are entering their retirement or preretirement years. 
 Analysts and developers say several factors -- beyond the supply-demand imbalance -- are stoking the northward expansion of these communities, long linked to Ocean County, to which legions of older households in the state have migrated for decades.
The factors include the rising sale prices and real estate taxes in such communities in the southern half of the state and a corresponding rise in traffic congestion.
In the last four years the average sale prices of such homes in the southern half of the state rose from $135,000 to $170,000, with some selling in the low- to mid-$200,000 range, said William E. Becker, a housing consultant in Teaneck who specializes in active-adult retirement communities. Taxes, on average, have also increased, to $4,500 from $2,575, he said.
There is also the trend, which shows no signs of abating, of older people retiring closer to where they once lived or where their children live. And they want to be near employment centers because 30 percent of the people living in active-adult housing communities today still work, Mr. Becker added.
Ocean County is not in danger any time soon of losing its position as a choice address for retirees. But the fact that many people in the aging population -- in 1996 (the latest date for which figures are available), 15.9 percent of the state's 8 million residents were between the ages of 55 and 74 and the numbers are expected to grow to 19.2 percent of 8.5 million residents by 2010 -- will help make areas of North Jersey potential alternatives. Mr. Becker estimated that some 12,000 active-adult housing units were in the planning stages in the state, half of them outside Ocean County. State figures show that there are now 20,946 units in New Jersey.
The new momentum in active-adult community construction is driven by the strength of the state's overall housing market. Sales of existing homes rose 6.7 percent last year to 157,247, the highest level since 1987, according to the latest figures from the New Jersey Realtors Association in Edison. The projection is that the state will maintain that sales level this year, said Meredith LaVecchia, a spokeswoman for the association.
And what of active-adult units? For the last two years, Mr. Becker noted, about 2,500 such units have been sold a year, nearly double the number sold in 1994 before the housing market began to shake off its recessionary stagnation.
ALL of these factors played a part in the decision by Belvidere Development, of Far Hills, to move forward with Brookfield, a gated community in White Township in Warren County. Work is to begin this month on the project's first phase -- 300 detached homes costing $40 million.
Later phases will include 185 apartments and 18,000 square feet of commercial space, as well as 100 assisted-living units. Designed for residents usually 70 and older, they offer health care as well as social and recreational services. The project, which will cost an estimated total of more than $70 million, is to rise on 140 acres of farmland along Route 519.
"This area is analogous to what Ocean County was 20 years ago," said Eric M. Levin, president of the company. "And it is close enough for buyers to be near their families."
The site is near the historic town of Belvidere, the Warren County seat, and not far from the township of Mount Olive, an employment hub in Morris County. Also, it is accessible to Interstates 80 and 78, putting it within an hour's drive for potential residents who live in Morris, Passaic, Essex and Bergen Counties -- the market, along with local residents, the company hopes to attract.
In contrast it is a two-hour drive to Ocean County, Mr. Levin noted.
Nine years ago the company's owner, Kevin G. McDermott, purchased the site, then zoned for industrial and residential use; he won rezoning to build the project the same year. But then the recession hit and it was put on hold until the market improved.
With all the elements -- from location to support services -- in place "now, is the ideal time for this type of development." Mr. McDermott said, adding "the market is demanding it."
The project's detached houses were modified to meet current consumer preferences. The houses, with 1,280 to 1,950 square feet of space, have been widened to 34 to 40 feet from 28 to 38 feet and two-car garages have been added. Houses will sit on 86 acres of the site, with 35 acres left as open space, 25 acres of it deeded to the town for the public. Preconstruction sales of the first 73 homes, priced from the low $120,000's to the mid-$150,000 range, will begin in June and occupancy is expected to start by the fall.
Planned amenities include an outdoor pool, a boccie court, a nine-hole putting green and a 9,600-square-foot clubhouse with a fitness center. Monthly maintenance fees will be $120.
The pace of construction will be tied to sales and after two-thirds of the detached houses are built construction of the apartments will start. Mr. McDermott said it had not yet been decided whether they would be rentals or condominiums.
"What we are selling is country charm and affordability -- an alternative to Ocean County," Mr. Levin said.
OFF Pike Road in Wayne Township in Passaic County, K. Hovnanian Enterprises, based in Red Bank, is moving ahead with plans for a 23-acre gated community with 230 condominium apartments. The project, called K. Hovnanian's Four Seasons at Wayne, is the fifth active-adult community for the company, which is planning six others in the state.
The two- and three-bedroom units at the Wayne project, in 14 two-story buildings with elevators, will range in size from 1,600 to 2,000 square feet.
The buildings, with 12 to 19 units each, will have underground garages; buyers each will be assigned one parking spot as well as garage storage space. Prices are to range in the low- to high-$200,000 range.
Amenities will include a 5,000-square-foot clubhouse, outdoor pool and tennis court. Monthly maintenance fees, though not yet set, are estimated to be about $200. Models are expected to open in October.
The Fox Hills Corporation of Randolph, has started work on a 600-unit gated condominium community on Mount Hope Avenue in Rockaway Township in Morris County. The $110-million project, called Fox Hills, will contain one-, two- and two-bedroom-with-den units, in 13 three-story steel-and-concrete buildings with elevators. The buildings, set atop underground garages, will be spread over 88 heavily wooded acres, half of which will remain undeveloped. A later phase will have 100 assisted-living units.
Mort Solkind, president of the development company, said the focus of the project "was on having a suburban community, not one in the middle of nowhere." The project is one-half mile from Exit 35 of I-80 and close to the Rockaway Town Square Mall.
The condominiums will have 817 to 1,781 square feet of space and purchasers will have garage parking spots. Initial prices range from $129,900 to $209,900. The focal point of the community will be a two-story, 23,250-square-foot clubhouse with an indoor pool, library, a TV recording studio, fitness center and game rooms.
Sales opened last month and 54 units in the initial 84-unit section have been sold, said Mr. Solkind. Occupancy is scheduled to begin in December.

HEADLINE: Disappointment Follows Vetoes Of State Spending

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN Westchester, as in other parts of the state last week, bitter disappointment followed Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of $1.6 billion in proposed state spending. High hopes were dashed for new library services, improved school buildings, richer arts programs and other items included in the original fiscal proposal. And many state legislators who had been exulting about this year's almost on-time budget -- one that was hammered out in the open rather than behind closed doors -- were forced to deliver bad news to constituents in an election year.
"Money for Westchester Community College and SUNY Purchase, gone! Money for the Arts Council, gone!" exclaimed an indignant State Assemblyman, Richard L. Brodsky of Greenburgh, reeling off a list of Mr. Pataki's cuts. "The vetoes are especially bad for Westchester." 
 Mr. Brodsky described the reductions in schools and public health programs and the elimination of initiatives to clean up hazardous waste sites and devise a state map showing cancer rates as "direct attacks on the ability of the state government to help New Yorkers live decent lives."
Using his line-item veto for the first time, Mr. Pataki whittled out of the budget $760 million in spending this year and more than $800 million in borrowing for future programs. The State Legislature, which would need a two-thirds vote in both houses to override a veto, was not expected to mount that fight. The last time a veto was overridden was in 1996. Although legislators last week were still trying to sort out which items had survived and which were excised, it appeared that Westchester Community College lost at least some of the $1.14 million it had expected to spend on capital projects. It also lost $150 for each full-time student, money that the college president, Dr. Joseph N. Hankin, said would have been used to hold the line on tuition.
"Well, it still won't force us to raise tuitions," Dr. Hankin said, "but it will hold back some of our expansion plans. In general, they are discouraging colleges, and that's shortsighted." Financing for child-care programs at the college, aid to part-time students and technical improvements were also cut.
Also, Purchase College, part of the State University of New York, faced a reduction in the $33.4 million that state lawmakers had proposed, money planned for library upgrades and new stage lifts at the Performing Arts Center, among other things.
Local public schools, too, were disappointed, especially by the Governor's veto of a $500 million bond program for school construction.
"I've learned not to expect anything until I see it in writing," said Superintendent Saul M. Yonofsky of the White Plains public schools, sighing deeply. "No sooner do we start planning than it gets taken away." White Plains was to have got $1.1 million for construction work.
The district may also lose a proposed $300,000 increase in state aid for magnet schools, as may New Rochelle and Mount Vernon.
County Executive Andrew J. Spano said he was sympathetic to the Governor. "We all share the same problems, the need to reduce the cost of government," he said. Still, he said, he was asking his commissioners to assess the impact of the vetoes on the county's ability to provide services.
Yonkers faces losses of $5 million for construction, $250,000 for a computerized student record-keeping system and $1.1 million in salary increases -- part of a $77-million-a-year statewide support aid program, which helps urban school districts raise the compensation for city teachers, who generally receive less than their suburban counterparts.
"We're disappointed, to say the least," Superintendent Reginald Marra of Yonkers said. "Some things will have to just get put off."
In another category, the Westchester Library System, which serves 38 libraries in the county, lost about $50,000 for an Electronic Doorway Library project to offer the public computer terminals with Internet access. Mr. Pataki cut $3 million for similar library projects statewide.
"The Governor has always reminded us that his mother worked in a library and that he was a strong supporter of libraries," Maurice Freedman, the director of the county's library system, said. "This was a very strange way of demonstrating that support."
The Westchester Arts Council, too, was stung by the Governor's veto. The county's designated arts services organization in White Plains was to have received $250,000 to buy a permanent home, but after the veto announcement it was looking at half that amount. Janet T. Langsam, director of the council, said the organization had been considering the purchase of either a house near the downtown area of the city or a former bank on a block where a multiplex cinema is planned.
"It's going to be a much steeper climb now," she said.
Another $250,000 for sound barriers on the southbound side of the Sprain Brook Parkway was cut from the budget, as was $90 million for highways statewide. About $2 million for economic enhancements at the Yonkers Raceway and $60,000 to study the possibility of building a convention center and hotel at the site remained in the budget.
So did $500,000 for the Westchester Institute for Human Development in Valhalla, which provides out-patient services to people with developmental disabilities like mental retardation and autism.
Uncertain was $50,000 in financing for Tara Circle, an Irish artistic and cultural organization; $125,000 for a breast imaging center and a military health center at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers and $100,000 for an early-intervention children's program at the County Mental Health Department.
Although State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, chairman of the county's Republican Party, said he considered Mr. Pataki's vetoes "generally prudent," he was hopeful last week that some items could be restored,
"We can either try to override the vetoes, compromise or let the budget stand," Mr. Spano said. "Maybe we can negotiate."
Mr. Spano said Mr. Pataki had indicated that he would be is willing to compromise and that conversations with him would begin immediately.
But state Assemblywoman Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale, was furious with the Governor, calling the vetoes "arbitrary and ill advised."
Her district, which includes White Plains, lost $6,000 for a teen-age-pregnancy-prevention program and $6,000 for an enrichment program at the White Plains Child Care Association, among other items.
Speculating that other factors were at work, she said: "I'm puzzled why it was done and what the criteria were. Many of the member items vetoed were beneficial. I think the vetoes were more a matter of smart politics than anything else."
Mr. Pataki -- a Republican who is running for re-election and is widely believed to have aspirations for higher office -- announced the vetoes after the Assembly and the Senate, for the first time in history, drafted a budget through conference committees without the executive branch present.
Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat, agreed with Mrs. Hochberg that the vetoes represented a power move on Mr. Pataki's part. "This is about the Governor trying to re-create the 'three men in a room' syndrome as a way to solve his political isolation," Mr. Brodsky said, referring to the former system under which the Governor and the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the Assembly forged budgets behind closed doors.
Some political observers, however, believe the new budget process may have actually given Mr. Pataki even more power, because it left him free to veto whatever he disliked.
Calling the legislators' proposal "an election-year spending binge," Mr. Pataki reduced its size to $71.4 billion, which still represents a 6.9 percent increase over last year, the largest rise in a decade. The budget, even with the cuts, is almost 17 percent more than when Mr. Pataki took office nearly four years ago. The original 7.6 percent election-year spending increase, to $71.9 billion in the fiscal year that began April 1, had originally drawn harsh criticism from conservatives.
"Obviously, in an election year, I would have liked to have not vetoed these," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference last weekend.
But bowing to the demands of fiscal conservatives, whose votes he values both on the state and the national level, Mr. Pataki said, "We have got to have budgets that are soundly balanced and that meet the needs of the future."
But in 14 consecutive years of late budgets, this one was the least tardy, being passed on April 14.
In Westchester, fiscal conservatives were pleased that the Governor took a tough stand. Before the vetoes, Urs Broderick Furrer, a Mount Pleasant Councilman and vice president of the Taxpayers' Alliance of New York, described the proposed budget as "far too loose" and said he was appalled by the pork-barrel spending. After hearing that Mr. Pataki had vetoed more than 1,000 separate spending items, he said he was somewhat pacified but "would like to see Mr. Pataki go even further." "There's still plenty of pork in there," Mr. Furrer grumbled.
Richard Hallinan, treasurer of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said he had been worried that the Governor was setting a precedent for excessive spending that "would be difficult to reverse when the economy cools, which it always does."
"The veto is a step in the right direction," he said.
Mr. Pataki said his thumbs down on some budget items will "maintain the reputation for fiscal prudence that New York has earned over the last three years by keeping spending under control, while also allowing the state to continue its aggressive fight against crime by constructing a new maximum security prison this year."
The Governor let stand the largest corporate tax rate reduction in state history. It was also the first rate cut in more than a decade.
About the only really good news from the perspective of all sides was that the Legislature completed the budget just two weeks into the new fiscal year, in contrast to the 18 weeks beyond the April 1 deadline it took to pass a budget last year and the 15 weeks required in 1996. In fact, the last time that the Legislature finished a budget this early was in 1993.

HEADLINE: GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM;
Taking Another Look

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I have not visited the Guggenheim Museum of Art in almost 10 years. A frequent museumgoer, I have been partial to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the New-York Historical Society for most of my life. In my first and last visit to the uptown facility, I found the Guggenheim to be a very uncomfortable space that detracts from an unimpressive collection. Although the Frank Lloyd Wright structure itself demands attention, I have never felt tempted to venture inside again. But after reading Michael Kimmelman's article describing Thomas Krens's tenure as director of the Guggenheim "The Globe Straddler Of the Art World," April 19 , I have been persuaded that the interior of the Guggenheim deserves another look. 
 Art is the ultimate confirmation that we (collectively as a species) have transcended our environmental limitations. Once reserved for the courts of kings, decisions about which artists should be supported and what works should be conserved for posterity have now been relegated to the white knights of capitalism -- the not-for-profit organizations. I believe that the peace, prosperity and high quality of life that we enjoy as Americans is due in a large part to the free-market structure that underpins our nation. Because capitalism works, and we as a people have become more efficient at exercising it, our economy has succeeded.
Mr. Krens's approach seems to be the natural synthesis of state control and the free market. The markets have taught us that growth is good, that able-bodied management teams will be rewarded, and that the union of two organizations with similar interests and different types of asset pools can create synergies that add value beyond the scope of an audited balance sheet. As such, Mr. Krens's accomplishments should be lauded. He is a visionary. His approach to accumulating and displaying art is as fresh and as apropos as Cubism was in the 1920's.
As a capitalist, I am proud to be an American. As an American I have always been perturbed by the lack of cultural awareness among my fellow citizens. As an art lover, I am hopeful that "Krensian tactics" will win favor among our white knights and contribute to America's statement of emancipation from our environs.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
On the North Shore, Restoration's the Word

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: UPPER BROOKVILLE

 BODY:
ZVIA GUTMAN's regular occupation is managing the apartment buildings she owns in Washington Heights, Harlem and the Bronx. But she also spends long hours at her future residence here on Terrace Lane, supervising the restoration of a playhouse that once belonged to Josephine Hartford Douglas, sister of Huntington Hartford, founder of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company.
One of only four surviving outbuildings of a grand 90-acre Gold Coast estate called Farlands, which once stretched up the hill from Mill River Hollow Road, the brick structure contains not only a pool but also a 65- by 125-foot indoor tennis court that was once connected to the vanished manor house by an underground tunnel. 
The tennis-court wing's 50-foot-high roof, originally corrugated frosted glass, is now made up of plastic panels imported from Israel that, together with huge windows, let a flood of soft diffused light into its vast interior.
Switching to plastic from glass is one of the few compromises Ms. Gutman and her architect, Mojo Stumer of Roslyn, are making in restoring the brick building, which when completed will have 6,500 square feet of living area, including a finished basement connected to the main level by an elevator. With the tennis court and pool, the building has a total of almost 16,000 square feet of space.
"The idea is to restore this building to the way it was," Ms. Gutman said. "But to replace the glass in the ceiling would have cost $250,000 so that is something I decided not to do."
Ms. Gutman would not disclose how much she is spending on her house. But the likelihood is that renovations together with the purchase cost of the building, which is on two acres, will come to well over $1 million.
Buyers like Ms. Gutman who have the means to build substantial houses in exclusive areas like Nassau's North Shore, but who elect to buy -- and in many cases painstakingly restore -- old estates or their major outbuildings are rekindling the market for authentic period houses.
"The economic times have made it possible, because it not only takes money to restore an old house, but also to maintain it," said Barbara Candee, director of Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty in Locust Valley. "The request now is for a true traditional house that has been restored, not changed, that is 60 to 80 years old, with wonderful moldings, wonderful floors, wonderful hardware and with high ceilings," she said. "People prefer that to what you might call a faux traditional house."
She was referring to reproduction Georgians and other brick manor houses that are under construction in exclusive areas of the North Shore.
Mrs. Candee said that in her market area -- Sands Point to Stony Brook, Sotheby's sold 15 houses for $1 million or more last year, compared with seven in 1996. Of both years' sales, she said, 75 percent involved older estates.
Among reasons buyers are seeking out existing houses is that "the older house is usually in more of an estate setting, property-wise, with mature, ancient trees and wonderful plantings," she said.
AMONG her listings, for example, is a French Regency-style house in Matinecock whose six acres of gardens originally were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer, with Calvert Vaux, of Central Park in Manhattan. The asking price is $2.25 million.
"Older homes are highly desirable because they can't be reproduced," said Thomas B. Anderson, who heads the country home division of Sotheby's regional office in Manhattan. "In this healthy economy, what we have noticed without question, particularly over the last year and a half, is that the beautiful grand old homes are the most desirable properties we have," he said.
Potential buyers come from around the world. They include people in such diverse fields as investment banking and the entertainment industry, said Eileen Cornacchia of Palm Beach, Fla., who, with her husband, Joseph, has their summer house in Southold on the market for $5 million.
Such people have been intrigued by their 1927 Adirondack Lodge-style house "because when you pass the iron gates and go up the drive you enter a world like no other," she said.
The house, which has been restored, is on six acres, has 1,600 feet of beachfront on Southold Bay, dock space for 20 boats, a helipad and room for 24 house guests. It is being marketed through the Chace & Friends real estate agency in Greenwich, Conn.
Whenever restoration is needed, however, it can be an expensive undertaking, easily costing $300 to $400 a square foot, said James Smiros, a Glen Cove architect.
He recalled a client who had purchased a house on 20 acres in Mill Neck called the Cliffs which the financier James W. Beekman built as a summer house in 1863. The gardens were designed by Olmsted.
The plan was to knock down the 11,000-square-foot house and replace it "and that would have been a lot less expensive," Mr. Smiros said. "But as we studied the house we found it had such great architectural qualities that we instead chose to restore it," he added.
There are also environmental concerns that have to be addressed, said Edward C. Vassallo, the owner of the North of 25A real estate agency in Brookville. Asbestos usually has to be removed at great cost. And old oil tanks buried in the ground pose another problem, he said. "But people are willing to put the money in now because they feel the market is on the rise and that their investment is secure," said Mr. Vassallo.
There are other factors behind the rekindling of interest in period houses, said Robert B. MacKay, director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, a nonprofit group with offices in Cold Spring Harbor. "There is a greater appreciation of history in this country than ever before, and old houses are tangible history," he said.
Popular television programs such as "This Old House" and restoration fairs that are being held around the country have helped to galvanize that interest, he added.
Mark D. Stumer, one of the principals of the Mojo Stumer firm, which is working with Ms. Gutman on the Upper Brookville playhouse, said that although most of the new home construction today is taking the shape of traditional architecture, old estates "have a design and a presence that you could never afford to duplicate today."
Although the playhouse Ms. Gutman is restoring does not fit the mold of classic residences, it nevertheless mirrors an opulent way of life that no longer exists.
"Long Island Country Houses and Their Architects 1860-1940," an authoritative illustrated survey of that era published last year by the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities in association with W. W. Norton & Company, includes an aerial photograph of Farlands showing a massive Neo-Federal-style mansion surrounded by landscaped gardens and a golf course.
The house, designed by Guy Lowell, was built in 1918 by Guernsey Curran. A racetrack now occupied by the James H. Vernon Middle School was also on the property.
FARLANDS was demolished in the 50's to make way for a housing subdivision. The playhouse, the former gatehouse, a carriage house and the former dairy barn -- the latter two converted to residences -- and linden trees lining Lawn Lane are all that survive, said Peter M. Weiler, the Village Attorney for Upper Brookville, whose father, William, was superintendent of the estate.
Ms. Gutman is determined to restore what details she can to an interior that was neglected and partly ripped out by previous owners. All doors and windows are being replaced, but they duplicate the originals. The wooden walls of the tennis court wing, a balcony overlooking it and the pool house are being restored. "We're trying to make it look like it always did," said Michael R. Doyle of Mojo Stumer, who is the project architect.
The interior of the building, which once also contained a music room, a playroom, a kitchen and staff quarters, is being adapted for today's living needs. An attic ceiling in the former playroom, now the living room, was removed, for example, and the attic vents were enlarged into windows to allow light to pour down from above. And the elevator was installed.
"People live differently now than they did 80 years ago," said Brian Shore, a Locust Valley architect with a client who is restoring an Old Westbury mansion once owned by Harry and Gertrude Whitney.
"You can accommodate that, and still preserve the character and quality of the old house," he added. "And when you're done, there is something very self-fulfilling about bringing that old house back to life."

Sport Utility Vehicles

 BODY:
Should there be a special driver's license required for sport utility vehicles, with their safety problems?
 
Unsafe for Everyone 
 As a driver of several smaller vehicles, I must say that the increase in the number of sport utility vehicles has made it very difficult to maintain visibility and safety on the road. On the highway I do not feel threatened, but in traffic I am frequently blocked in by sport utility vehicles and mini-vans. I cannot see pedestrians or traffic signals and signs. I find it especially treacherous to drive in the city near these vehicles.
The utility vehicles should be used for hauling large loads of materials and people. It's a waste of resources and a threat to the safety of everyone, including their drivers and passengers. In addition, many sport utility drivers have a tendency to be unnecessarily aggressive, similar to drivers of expensive sports cars, and that again poses a safety threat. I just don't see the point in John Doe four-wheel driving it to the office. It's a really obnoxious trend.

Unfairly Singled Out
Why are we sport utility vehicle owners suddenly becoming so maligned? As I approach retirement age, I purchased mine for the comfort of having the four-wheel drive to get my wife and myself around when it snows.

For Special Conditions
Drivers of sport utility vehicles should have a special license to drive on mountain roads or in bad weather. There is no other reason for a special license, though.

Little Cars a Threat
Drivers of smaller sport utility vehicles seem to feel they are impervious to tipping over and safe in any road condition. All sport utility vehicles are subject to the effects of ice, no matter the size of the vehicle.
What about the number of mini-cars? A look at the bumpers of these small vehicles makes it obvious that with them, safety takes second place to economy.

Warning Will Suffice
It's the drivers' responsibility to understand the risks and decide if they want to take them. But not everyone understands that the vehicles are more dangerous than regular cars, so they should be warned when they purchase one.

Plenty of Licenses
Drivers distracted by quarrelsome kids, drivers on car phones, drivers whose minds are occupied by problems at work: maybe we all need special licenses.

HEADLINE: Homebuyers Spending for the Extras

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
AFTER living in six homes in the last 24 years, two of them newly built, Kevin E. McKenna, a marketing executive, and his wife, Susan, a registered nurse, are now building another. This time, Mr. McKenna said, they are putting in all the extras they never got around to before.
In all, they have ordered $54,000 worth of options for their new four-bedroom colonial in a Milford, Conn., development, increasing the price of their house by more than 21 percent -- from $252,000 to $307,000. The 334-home development, called Lexington Green, is being built on 140 acres by the Baker Firestone company of Pleasantville, N.Y. 
 That amount of spending on extras is not unusual. Housing experts say that in these economic boom days, even first-time buyers are no longer satisfied with the standard items provided by builders, even if they include such niceties as fireplaces and two-car, instead of one-car, garages -- which themselves were considered options not that long ago.
Gone are the days when people want a house just for shelter, said Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. "Now they are buying for a life style and this is happening all over," he said. Surveys have shown that on average $5,000 to $7,500 worth of options are added to every new house sold throughout the country, he noted, and in more affluent areas like metropolitan New York the numbers are much higher.
With two out of three buyers of new houses now move-up buyers, many are part of "the baby-boomer generation, well educated, both husband and wife working, at the best period of their working careers, and with money to spend," Mr. Ahluwalia said.
"They ask themselves the question: 'Should the money sit in the bank, or should they put it in the house?' " he said. "And the answer is the house."
Kenneth R. Nadler, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., architect whose clients include people building multimillion-dollar houses, summed it up this way: "People are willing to spend more on a house because they reason that while things are good, the house is a good place to put their money while they have it. The feeling is, If you're going to do it, now's the time. Everyone's dream is the same basically. It boils down to how much money do you have."
"People are looking at homes not just for living, but for total enjoyment"' said Mark D. Stumer of the Mojo Stumer architectural firm in Roslyn, L.I. "People are working very hard, they are under a lot of stress, and they're saying, If we are going to make all this money, we might as well enjoy some of the amenities of life."
To make their lives easier, Jyl Camhi and her husband, Keith, are adding two home offices costing $46,000, along with other options, to a $639,000, four-bedroom house they are buying in a Stamford, Conn., development called Westover Woods.
She is a computer software consultant. He owns a software consulting company. "We both work tons of hours," Mrs. Camhi said.
So does Frank Vella, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan who commutes to Manhattan from Mount Kisco, leaving home at 6:30 A.M. and returning at 8 P.M.
When he and his wife, Melinda, bought a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath, 3,752-square-foot house a year ago in the Mount Kisco Chase development under construction by Toll Brothers of Huntingdon, Pa., they added $92,400 worth of options to the basic house, which was priced at $568,900.
"This house came pretty well equipped," Mr. Vella said, "but we wanted to do something we felt really good about and a house we can have fun in. When you deal with people all day long, you just need a place to get away."
THE options they added included an extra room over the garage, a greenhouse breakfast room off the kitchen and a whirlpool bath and other upgrades. They spent $20,000 extra on the kitchen, adding such upgrades as a granite countertop that cost $7,500 and a designer tile floor that added $2,000. They also paid $15,000 extra for an oversized 1.45-acre lot.
Robert I. Toll, chairman of Toll Brothers, a national builder of houses that average $400,000 in price, said he is sometimes taken aback at the extent of options his customers add to houses that already have an extensive amount of amenities included in the basic price.
"It's an ego fulfillment kind of thing to some extent," he said. "There has been a remarkable increase in wealth in recent years and people are spending this money on themselves."
Music conservatories, billiard rooms, elevators, four-car garages, two-person showers and tubs "with pillars going to the ceiling so Augustus would be comfortable" are all available, Mr. Toll said. "We have a huge, thick customization catalogue, but people want to go beyond even that," he added. "They want to put something unique into their homes and to make their own home different from anybody else's."
Toll Brothers made an analysis of what buyers spent on extras in houses in different price ranges over a six-month period ended March 31. It showed that, on average, options added 13 percent to houses selling for $200,000 to $300,000; 17 percent to houses selling for $300,000 to $400,000 and 18 percent if the house sold for $400,000 to $499,000. Above $500,000 the number declined to 14 percent.
Among favorite add-ons were a greenhouse, a third garage, a bathtub with jets and a "princess suite," which is a second master bedroom with a bath for the daughter in the house.
Richard R. Girouard, a New Canaan, Conn., builder, has sold 63 custom houses over the last five years. Over the last two years, moving up from the $600,000-to-$900,000 market, he has sold 16 houses priced at $1.8 million to $4 million. In the category in which he is now building, he said, wine cellars complete with tasting rooms are now very much the thing. They cost $50,000 to $200,000. Home theaters add an average of $60,000 "and everyone has one." Kitchen cabinets alone can cost $100,000, he said.
"It's not that our need for creature comforts has changed," said Alan Yassky, a Spring Valley, N.Y., real estate broker who acts as a consultant to home builders in Rockland County. "Our perception of what that means has changed. Thirty years ago, a creature comfort was a finished basement. And now it's a separate great room, or a separate library where the husband and wife can be alone without the family. Having a paneled library isn't that unusual any more."
Beyond that "it comes down to absolute convenience for the buyer," said Carl R. Kuehner 3d, president of Building & Land Technology in Wilton, Conn., a builder of housing both on the East and West Coasts. "How do you become more efficient? By having an office in the home. How do you not have to water the lawn? By building in a sprinkler system. The new trend is gas-fired fireplaces, so all you do is push a button. People want to do something other than maintain a home."
Families are now staying in their houses longer than they used to -- 12 years on average, according to a 1997 report by the Chicago Title Insurance Company. "You don't mind spending money on a house you know you're going to stay in," said Joseph M. Forgione, the principal of Sterling Properties in Livingston, N.J., a builder of houses in the $250,000 to $700,000 range.
"Years ago, when you wanted to upgrade," Mr. Forgione said, "you could always buy another new house in the same town. Now land has become so scarce, people don't have that option any more."
To accommodate buyers who need help in picking what they want, some developers are building elaborate design centers. K. Hovnanian of Red Bank, N.J., which opened a 5,000-square-foot center for its Four Seasons at Lakewood and Four Seasons at Wall developments in Monmouth County. N.J., two years ago, now has another, of 15,000 square feet, about to start construction in Edison, N.J., within an hour's drive of several of its projects. The company builds 4,000 houses annually nationwide, more than half of them in the Northeast.
"Ten years ago, we did mostly entry level housing and we didn't do any customization," said Ara K. Hovnanian, the president of K. Hovnanian. "But we have been following the baby-boom generation and as they change from entry level to move-up age, we have moved along our company to meet their needs."
But it isn't just baby boomers who are loading up their houses. Retirees, even those on modest incomes, are on the same train, as are first-time buyers.
Jan A. Kokes, vice president of the Kokes Organization of Whiting, N.J., which builds developments in Ocean County for people whose average age is 63, said he was selling houses in the $137,000 to $202,000 price range, to which people are adding $15,000 to $20,000 in extras.
A sunroom adds $6,000 to $8,000, a fireplace $3,500, a screened porch $5,500 to $7,000, and a basement $25,000. "They all want something," he said. "People are saying, 'My children are gone, I'm going to build a new house, and I am finally doing this for me, the way I want it.' "
"In the past," said Mr. McKenna, the Lexington Green buyer, "we always said, 'The next house, we'll do it.' And we always regretted it later. Now we're putting in all the bells and whistles that we think we will enjoy."
FORMERLY a regional director of sales and marketing for Nabisco, the packaged-foods company, he now is the national sales manager for Inter Act Systems, an electronic marketing firm based in Norwalk, Conn. He and his wife hope their relocation days are over, another reason they are adding more to their house, he said.
"No one is buying just the basic house any more," said Lawrence Blum, the sales director at Lexington Green, where prices range from $180,000 to $270,000. The options buyers select add a minimum of 12 percent to the basic price and in some cases have added as much as $100,000 to the cost of the house, Mr. Blum said.
The extras the McKennas chose included finishing the 1,200-square-foot basement with a bedroom and a bathroom, building an unfinished 650-square-foot loft over the three-car garage, upgrading the kitchen and bathroom cabinets, adding extra telephone and cable lines, adding ceiling fans and improving the lighting.
They are replacing the carpeting on the main floor with hardwood floors, adding two-zone heat and central air-conditioning, and installing a woodburning fireplace in the living room with yet another extra -- a gas line that will give them a blazing hearth at the touch of a button.
In a consumer survey on housing conducted last year by Professional Builder magazine a trade publication for home builders published in Des Plaines, Ill., 529 would-be house buyers who indicated they were seriously in the market for a new home were asked what products they would select as options if they were offered. Of those sampled, the largest group -- 155 house hunters -- was looking at houses selling for $100,000 to $150,000.
Percentages varied by geographic region and by the price of the home people were looking at. But in summary, among options priced from $800 to $1,000, upgraded carpeting was the favorite, a porch came in second and double-glazed windows came in third. Among products priced from $1,600 to $2,000 each, the top favorites were storm windows, security systems and whirlpool baths. And among products priced from $3,000 to $6,000 each they were central air-conditioning, fireplaces, and screened porches.
In the $12,000-to-$20,000 price range, swimming pools, basement recreation rooms and home offices were the favorites with 31.4 percent of the 455 buyers who responded to that category indicating they would want a pool, 21.3 percent opting for the recreation room and 19.1 percent selecting the home office.
Not all builders are thrilled about custom-building for buyers, especially in a hot housing market. "I'd rather cookie-cut and deliver houses faster, but those times have gone," said Steven A. Klar, president of the Klar Organization in East Meadow, L.I., which builds everything from town houses to large single-family residences on individual lots.
"In new construction," he said, "there is a statement, 'As long as I'm doing this, I might as well.. . . If I'm going to go for the marble bathroom, I might as well put in the whirlpool.' I hear it all the time."
One of his recent buyers. Thomas Nester, could have been listening. Mr. Nester and his wife, Lois, both accountants, bought a house last April in a Klar development in Dix Hills, L.I., called Longmeadow. The basic price of the five-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot house was $505,000. With upgrades, the house cost the Nesters $580,000.
"We walked into the model, and we could easily have lived with the house without any extras," Mr. Nester said. "But we said, 'If we're going to do it, let's do it the way we want it.' " So they made the bedrooms larger, extended the living room, put in extra phone and computer lines and upgraded the kitchen and the bathrooms.
As first-time buyers, Carolyn Williams and her husband, Thomas, weren't going to leave anything out either. "We saved two-and-a-half years to buy our house, and we wanted to do it right," Mrs. Williams said.
Parents of three young children, they are purchasing a house in a Holtsville, L.I., development called Summerfield, under construction by the Emmy Building Group and Stanley Gross of Smithtown.
The $195,000 house, for which they had signed a contract six months ago, won't be ready until October because adding the options they wanted is slowing construction, Mrs. Williams said. Plus it's costing them an additional $35,000 for such items as a front porch, central air-conditioning and a whirlpool tub and a stall shower in the master bathroom suite.
At first they were going to forgo the $4,200 whirlpool tub and stall shower combination, she said, "but one of the guys at work told my husband, 'Just do it, because it's more expensive to add it later.' So we went for it."
ADDING options as the house is built makes a lot of economic sense to buyers. For the Williamses, who are making a 20 percent down payment on their house, their $35,000 extra outlay will cost $7,000 more for the down payment and about $140 a month more on their mortgage payments, said Mr. Williams, who is a financial planner.
"One reason I decided to put the extras in is because interest rates are so low." he said. "Factoring the cost into my mortgage is a lot cheaper than borrowing down the road if you want to do it then."
"People used to want to pay off their mortgage as soon as possible and have a mortgage burning," said Mr. Blum, the Lexington Green sales director. "Now they put in as many options as they can, put down as little as they can, and pay off the mortgage over the longest period of time they can. It's a whole different outlook."
Outlook and life style are the expressions industry experts and builders use most often when attempting to sum up what motivates home buyers who spend much more on their houses than they really have to.
"It all has to do with life style," said Mr. Ahluwalia of the National Association of Home Builders. "And what is life style? It means that when you have enough money to meet your basic needs, you also spend it on something that doesn't mean anything. Many of the things people are buying in a home have no functional use; it's all for show."
Mr. Hovnanian of the K. Hovnanian building company has a pragmatic viewpoint. "Ozzie and Harriet died a long time ago," he said, referring to the radio and television show. "The perfect family of the husband who goes to work, the wife who stays home to take care of 2.5 children, and the white picket fence, is gone. With dual-income families, two singles, divorced fathers and single mothers buying houses, the standard house just doesn't work for everyone anymore."

HEADLINE: HEALTH;
Mental Patients in Shore Towns Are Moving to New Homes

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Some Jersey Shore towns that have been inundated with former mental patients since the 1970's are experiencing some relief, thanks to a carefully planned program that closed five troubled boarding homes and found new, often better housing for about 200 residents.
"We're really pleased with it," said Richard Cuttrell, the business administrator for Neptune Township, Monmouth County. The township includes the quaint Methodist summer village of Ocean Grove, where the Breakers, a 35-bed boarding house, was shuttered in 1996. Mr. Cuttrell said the closing was a major factor in Ocean Grove's renaissance. "The entire town has seen a turnaround in the last five years," he said. 
 The program, called Shore-EASY (for Shore Homeownership Opportunities, Restoration and Economic Assistance Strategy), has almost finished spending the $10 million allocated to Ocean Grove, Asbury Park, Long Branch and Lakewood to improve some boarding houses and increase social services for their residents, as well as to buy houses and move residents. Planning for redevelopment of the sites of the closed houses is in progress, and negotiations to buy one or two more houses in Lakewood are under way.
But the program's most powerful legacy may lie beyond the physical changes in the shore towns, in its multifaceted approach. Representatives of several state departments, including Health, Community Affairs and Human Services, as well as the state mortgage and finance agency that buys the properties, frequently met and discussed relocation and service options with local agencies, officials and advocates for the mentally ill, all with the participation and oversight from the Governor's office.
"Everybody there knew it was supposed to work," said Carolyn Beauchamp, the director of the Mental Health Association of New Jersey. "And if it didn't, who knew who would be taken to task for it?"
A result appears to be that rarest of government programs: one that is praised even by its harshest critics.
"I really feel this whole Shore-EASY thing was a violation of the Fair Housing Act," said Bill Nordahl, a former mental patient who works with the Collaborative Support Program of New Jersey. "I believe that we, as ex-mental patients, have the right to live wherever we choose." Another flaw, he said, is that Shore-EASY created a net loss of affordable housing units.
Even so, he said, the state "was more sensitive than they ever were in the past" and had worked very hard to give residents a choice of new homes. "They took some people to as many as 12 places," he said.
Residents said they had mixed feelings, but often very positive ones.
Laurie Marino, 40, who lived at the Asbury Carlton, a former hotel, for more than four years, is now living with two other women in their own suburban house in Freehold, supervised by the Easter Seal Society. "For myself, it was good," said Ms. Marino, who has a schizoaffective disorder, an illness that can resemble schizophrenia. "But I was one of the younger people there. A lot had been there 15, 20 years. That was their home. Now they're scattered all over."
One longtime resident was Mary Uminowicz, an elderly woman. A native of Jersey City, she moved to the Asbury Carlton in 1968, having spent 20 years at the Meadowview County Hospital for "a nervous breakdown," she said. Now she is living in a small boarding house with four other tenants, looked after by a kindly landlady whose cooking she praises. "I told them I want to stay," she said. "She's nice to me. She does my laundry."
Ray Licata, director of the Monmouth County Division of Social Services, said he was surprised by the program's success. "It went much better than I thought it would," he said. "I thought there would be more problems, and I didn't think we'd be able to keep as many patients in Monmouth County."
Of the 197 people relocated, 9 remain in Ocean Grove and 24 in Asbury Park. Elsewhere within Monmouth County, 51 people have been placed; 33 went to Ocean County, 25 to Camden, 16 to Essex, 11 to Union, 25 to other counties. Three moved out of state.
Shore-EASY was created in 1995 in answer to furious protests from shore communities to a plan to close the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital (on schedule for next month).
In the 1970's, a social movement to minimize constraints on people with mental illnesses or mental retardation coincided with the advent of psychotropic medications like lithium, prompting a wave of discharges from mental hospitals. But the former patients often received little in the way of monitoring or follow-up care.
The shore areas were experiencing a downturn in tourism, and small, floundering hotels began reinventing themselves as boarding houses. Former mental patients began moving in by the score; when the state announced its plan to close Marlboro, there were about 100 such houses in the four towns, ranging from dilapidated homes with a dozen or so beds to the notorious Asbury Carlton, with 163 beds. Any remaining tourism was driven away, town leaders said, by the former patients, who forgot to take medication, wandered the streets, panhandled, and bought and sold drugs.
Governor Whitman's office responded to the town's arguments with Shore-EASY. "I think it was the first real sign that the state recognized that there was a problem," Mr. Cuttrell said. "That alone did a lot of good."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Pattern and Decoration, Abstract and Otherwise

BYLINE: By BARRY SCHWABSKY 

DATELINE: SUMMIT

 BODY:
"GO west, young man" may have been the catch phrase for 19th-century pioneers, but for artistic pioneers, then and now, a more appropriate slogan might be "Look east."
It's what painters like Whistler and van Gogh did, enamored as they were with Japanese prints, and it's what a number of young artists in the 1970's did as well. That's when Robert Kushner, along with colleagues including Valerie Jaudon, Joyce Kozloff and Robert Zakanitch, began looking to Islamic tiles, Japanese kimonos, Turkish rugs and the like as inspiration in their efforts to find ways to expand the vocabulary of painting. These artists became known as the Pattern and Decoration movement. 
 As Mr. Kushner's current exhibition at the New Jersey Center for Visual Arts demonstrates, their efforts may not always have been successful but were never less than thought-provoking, and their ideas were perhaps more deeply ingrained in the Western tradition than they may have seemed.
In contrast to an older artist like Miriam Schapiro, who had slowly worked her way toward the Pattern and Decoration idea, Mr. Kushner may be said to have grown up into it. While still an undergraduate at the University of California at San Diego, from which he graduated in 1971, Mr. Kushner studied with Amy Goldin, the art historian and critic who would soon become known as the voice of the movement; a few years later, they would travel together through Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey.
Inspired by the chadors worn by Iranian women, Mr. Kushner's early paintings like "Biarritz" (1975) were often made on pieces of fabric that were squared off at the top but formed a semi-circle at the bottom. These works were actually meant to be worn in performances the artist staged (it would have been helpful if the exhibition catalogue had given more details of these, and perhaps even shown a few photographs of them) but at the same to function as pure painting to enliven a wall.
Many modernists, especially women like Sonia Delaunay and Natalia Goncharova, had ventured into clothing and costume design, but the idea that the very same object could be at once a costume and a painting was something new. Still, as painting, "Biarritz" is very much within the modernist tradition, reflecting the influence not only of early 20th-century originators like Matisse and the Delaunays, but also of the color field painters of the 1950's and 60's, like Helen Frankenthaler and Kenneth Noland. They, too, had painted directly onto unprimed canvas so the color would float within its surface rather than sit atop it, and their quest for a simplified imagery often brought them to the point of patterning, as in the case of Mr. Noland's concentric circles, stripes and chevrons.
In fact, while Pattern and Decoration has often been seen as a rebellion against the austere rigors of late modernism, a way of reclaiming simpler and more spontaneous pleasures, the patterning impulse can just as easily be seen as proceeding from one of the bases of modernist esthetics: the determination that rather than being divided into areas of greater and lesser significance (for instance, figure and background), every portion of a painting ought to be of equal importance, and realized with equal intensity. What better solution to such a challenge than the repetitive force of pattern, which demands that every area under its sway be treated equivalently?
A painting like "Two Birds" (1977) shows considerable change: while the shape of the painting still recalls the idea of clothing -- the reference is a kimono -- it is no longer actually wearable. Furthermore, the imagery is not, as in "Biarritz," completely abstract: there are now flowers, which will henceforth form a major part of the artist's imagery, as well as the birds of the title.
By the time he made "Sail Away" (1983), the largest painting here, Mr. Kushner was no longer painting patterns but collaging them. Here, as in other paintings of the decade, he has drawn, with acrylic paint, schematically rendered nudes along with floral forms on his cotton ground, then sewn blocks of often gaudily printed textiles around the drawn lines. As Sara Lynn Henry remarks in her catalogue essay, the figures become "embedded . . . in the kaleidoscopic shifting of decorative patterns."
The end of the decade brought new changes, as Mr. Kushner resorted for the first time to conventional stretched canvas and added the physicality and chromatic richness of oil paint to the fluidity of acrylics. The human figure has disappeared; the floral and other botanical imagery that accompanied it has taken center stage, as in "Artichoke Apotheosis" (1995). Yet the sensual appeal of this artist's flowers is, if anything, even greater than that of his nudes.
Perhaps there's some clue there to an artist whose exploratory sensibility has not yet found its ideal vehicle. Back in 1986, Mr. Kushner said: "When you first start making art, everything is possible and desirable. Then the patterns of ideas start to emerge and you say, 'What do I really want to do?' " His patterns, overloaded as they may be, have never been as sensuously rich as he intends, but rather intellectually willed, "patterns of ideas."
Nor has deciding what he really wants to do been this artist's forte. The lesson the great modernists learned from Asia was economy: how to leave things out. Matisse may have been the great decorative artist of the century, but he was never indulgent; rather, he was ruthless in his exclusions, severe in his simplifications. The colors and patterns in just one of Mr. Kushner's paintings would have served Matisse -- who observed, "An avalanche of color has no force" -- for 10.
There are fine, occasionally even gorgeous passages in these paintings. Just look at the bunch of small white and lavender flowers just right of center in "Pomona Pavane" (1996), for example. Yet rarely does the whole hang together. Decoration, which in its Matissean sense implies expanding space rather than filling it, remains more of an aspiration than an accomplishment here.

HEADLINE: Pine Barrens on Edge

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
THE bungalows on the back roads of Pine Ridge South here are spanking new, and so is the life of the place. Tom Koehl, newly retired and resettled from Secaucus, says that although "they roll up the sidewalks too early around here," regular bingo games are under way and the pool hall is open; shopping and restaurants are "not bad." As he speaks, a gleaming silver bus pulls up at the clubhouse around the bend as residents return from an Atlantic City day-trip.
Mr. Koehl also talks gratefully about deer and tree frogs while pointing behind his house, where bulldozers have just munched into the pines for new lots. "We had swamps when we moved to Secaucus, and they built all that up," he says. 
 This is the Pinelands, or, more specifically, an intersection between the Pinelands and the rest of New Jersey. The people moving to Manchester, where a concentration of retirement communities has put the over-65 population at more than 70 percent, want to have it all: tree frogs and malls, neighbors and nature trails. And more and more people are joining them.
In the vast land-use plan drawn up nearly 20 years ago to protect the sandy forest that most people know as the Pine Barrens, some pockets of Manchester were designated to absorb development, and they have: the population has grown by a third since 1980, with more than 5,500 building permits issued.
The pattern is even more striking in the designated "regional growth areas" near Atlantic City -- Galloway Township's population has increased 123 percent since 1980 and Hamilton Township's by 88 percent. Evesham Township, on the Philadelphia side, grew by 79 percent in the same period.
All that, too, has proceeded according to plan. But it's in areas like these that the land-use plan, the state's foremost sprawl-prevention mechanism, is feeling strains. The plan, covering about a million acres in seven counties, was the state's way of preserving a rare and huge ecosystem by closing off its heart and channeling development to the edges, where it seemed inevitable.
It was, in effect, a zoning plan writ large. A 15-member commission was set up to figure out what everybody in its jurisdiction would be allowed to do with their property, and it infuriated farmers and developers while barely mollifying preservationists; only in the last few years has it achieved an uneasy peace with local officials and agricultural and real-estate interests.
"We can't say very much about the commission," said Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Builders Association. "What that reflects is the fact that the commission in essence has set itself up, adopted the Comprehensive Management Plan and really just left very little room for interaction. With a few exceptions of the growth townships, Hamilton or a couple others, there's very little by way of activity in the Pinelands. That's by design; the design was basically to shut down the industry in the whole area."
But along the perimeter, the "growth townships" have not escaped the classic dilemma of the suburban fringe. They are caught between spillover growth from Philadelphia, New York and Atlantic City, with the promise of ratables, and the desire of those who got there first to lock the gate.
Warren G. Sweeney, chairman of Manchester Township's environmental commission, said that many residents "are from areas that have already reached their capacities, and those that got here first don't want to let anyone else in."
"Also, we're in a very sensitive area environmentally," Mr. Sweeney said. "A lot of people are trying to prevent what's there from being bulldozed and macadamed over. It's a considerable treasure to be aware of and to protect."
Now the Pinelands Commission is about to receive the Whitman imprint. Its chairman of 10 years, Richard L. Sullivan, has announced that he will retire in June, leaving Governor Whitman with a critical environmental job to fill.
Mr. Sullivan recommended three possible successors: Sally Dudley, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions; Candace Ashmun, a member of the 15-member commission from its start in 1979, and Michael Catania, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
Ms. Ashmun said that "the very towns that were frantic because they didn't think they could get enough development are now complaining that they have too much."
The Commission's managed-growth plan insures that suburbia doesn't creep into the heart of the Pinelands. "The shore is getting worse and worse, and the Highlands is being attacked now," she said. As for controlling sprawl, she said, "the Pinelands is the only place we've had the nerve to do it."
But along the periphery, "the number of building permits is incredible," she said. "It's scary to me."
According to the commission's statistics, economic growth in its jurisdiction is actually higher than in the rest of the state. It estimated in a report issued last year that the population of "Pinelands municipalities" -- some of which, like Manchester, are partly outside its boundaries -- grew 30 percent between 1980 and 1996, as against 7 percent in the remainder of South Jersey and 5 percent statewide. Other economic indicators, including growth in personal income and building permits, also were higher inside than outside the Pinelands.
"People have to understand that this is not a park," Mr. Sullivan said. "It's not a wilderness. Some people think there are 111 people down there."
In fact, there are more than 570,000, according to Census Bureau estimates. The plan would theoretically accommodate as many as a million.
"That's not too many if residents and businesses go in the right places," Mr. Sullivan said. He said 95 percent of the development since 1980 had occurred in the "growth areas" set aside by the commission.
But in those areas, the effect was one dreaded 20 years ago by the preservationists who dominated the commission and by their early rural adversaries: it's suburban.
In Manchester and neighboring Berkeley Township, the commercial strip is Route 37, just outside the official state Pinelands boundaries and lined with strip malls and fast-food places. In Hamilton Township, the Hamilton Mall could not contain retail growth; around the corner, the Consumer Square Mall -- Target, Seamans, HomePlace and more -- is pushing outward. In the wedge between them, new townhouses ($74,990 to $85,990) are rising at the Timber Glen development.
Is this what the Pinelands plan contemplated?
"I don't think the plan cared what kind of development was going to occur," said John W. Sinton, a professor of environmental studies at Richard Stockton College who served on the commission for several years. "The commission is a negative force -- stop development. All of the effort went into that. My thought was always that if there was a positive force -- here's how we should develop, let me suggest that you build in these areas or do some real local planning -- that would have been a positive development."
In a 1985 book on the Pinelands, "Water, Earth and Fire" (Johns Hopkins University Press), Mr. Sinton and his co-author, Jonathan Berger, argued that the plan restricted some areas too severely while making others "dumping grounds for future development."
In sum, Mr. Sinton said in an interview, "it's the kind of top-down planning that doesn't work in a place where local power tends to rule."
The early commissioners "were never very much in touch," he said. "I would invite them down to go canoeing or whatever, and it was clear that they really didn't like the place much."
But for all his reservations about the "Princeton mafia" that engineered the plan -- "the wealthy have always wanted to preserve things" -- Mr. Sinton said the Pinelands are probably better off with the plan than without it, if only because it had slowed growth in the central Pinelands.
To Mr. Sullivan, "top-down planning" is the only kind that works. "The virtue of this system is that it is treated as an ecological entity," he said. "You put things in places that can accommodate them. If we left it up to the 53 towns, the chance of preserving this special place would be blown. It's the most likely way to protect the Pines and the way of life people come down here for."
Mr. Sullivan, 71, who served as the Department of Environmental Protection's first commissioner, was appointed by Gov. Thomas Kean. Mr. Sullivan is identified with the preservationist wing of the Pinelands Commission, if there still is such a thing in an agency where politics and economic interests have grown awfully tangled in two decades.
The commission has seven members appointed by the Governor, seven appointed by the freeholders of the Pinelands counties and one by the Federal Government, which in 1978 designated an area slightly larger than the state's Pinelands area as a "national reserve," provided funds for land acquisition and directed the state to set up the land-use plan.
When the commission was formed, its mission was not to oversee a million acres worth of zoning matters but to protect the region's forests, rivers and especially the aquifer beneath it all -- 17 trillion gallons of fresh water easily contaminated by anything leaching through the sandy soil. But acquiring the whole area for a park or preserve was politically and fiscally impossible, so the commission would have to deal with thousands of private owners, who even now hold more than half the acreage.
The state marked off a 339,000-acre "preservation area," all but closed to new development. It assigned the new Pinelands Commission to carve the remainder into districts for forest preservation, agriculture (especially cranberry and blueberry farming, a mainstay of the region's agriculture) and residential development.
The commission, set up in a slightly ramshackle old farmhouse in Pemberton Township, which it still occupies, drew the blueprint. There had never been such an all-encompassing plan in the United States, and there hasn't been since, said Charles L. Siemon, a leading land-use lawyer who worked on the plan and now practices in Boca Raton, Fla.
 
From Effusive Praise To Ringing Denunciation
Conceding some bias, Mr. Siemon said: "I don't think I have any doubt that it's the greatest American planning initiative and success in this century. The ecological integrity, the character of communities, the basic systems are still functional today. And I'm sitting in South Florida right now, where I think the built environment and the natural environment are in tragic condition."
Now, everyone seems to agree, it is the Pinelands fringes that are causing concern. "The issues now seem to revolve around places where growth is taking place where they now aren't sure they want growth to take place," said Ms. Dudley of the state advisory group on the environment.
Ms. Dudley, like other environmental advocates and like the commission's officials, says the plan gives developers the advantage of predictability: the areas for growth are clearly set out, they say, as are the maximum densities.
Some developers agree. Kevin Johnson, a builder in Jackson Township, said that his still-unbuilt Savannah Ridge subdivision had been approved years ago but that builders "shied away" because Pinelands regulations required costs that they thought would make the housing too expensive.
Mr. Johnson bought the tract, drew up 3.2-acre lots for houses starting at $270,000 and a week after opening for sales last month had two contracts and a binder. His dealings with the Pinelands Commission, he said, consisted of "a couple of phone calls and faxes."
Some developers do not agree. "You couldn't give me property in the Pinelands," said one Gloucester County builder, who refused to permit his name to be used. "They're an awful, awful state commission. They'll stonewall you to death."
Farmers, too, have complained about the commission for two decades, mostly because it effectively rezoned the land that many had once contemplated selling to developers. "That's perceived wipeout," said Terrence Moore, the commission's executive director. "And that's very understandable. One farmer who's very respected said it's good for agriculture, it's just not good for farmers."
The commission did devise a limited mechanism for compensation, in the form of development rights that can be sold by landowners in restricted areas to builders in growth areas. Tom Darlington, a Burlington County cranberry grower who has served on the commission from the beginning, said this provision had eased some pain, though "not all farmers are overjoyed with the commission."
"When I voted for the Pinelands master plan," he said, "all my farmer friends almost tarred and feathered me." But he said that one who barely spoke to him for 20 years told him recently that "he now realized that the commission was a valuable thing and without it we growers would have been wiped out of business."
Then there are those who maintain that the commission has not saved enough, though the principal watchdog group, the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, is more ally than adversary.
"If the scales can be tilted to the environmental side, we'll put the pressure on," said Theresa Lettman, the project manager for the group. "As much as we'd like to fight it, we accept the plan.
"Now we hope the Governor appoints someone to that chair who understands the importance of the plan," said Ms. Lettman, who is also a Whitman appointee to the New Jersey Natural Lands Trust. She said the Pinelands group would support any of the three possible successors whom Mr. Sullivan recommended.
Environmental advocates are relieved that the Governor, whose record as a conservationist is equivocal, proposed this year that the state preserve one million acres of open space, some of which would naturally be in the Pinelands.
"The majority of people in the state feel preserving open space is the way to go," Ms. Lettman said, "and the Governor is taking that direction."
In Manchester, hundreds of residents, most from retirement communities, have turned out at public hearings to oppose a plan by H. Hovnanian Industries for another senior-citizen development on 7,100 acres just outside the Pinelands boundaries. And the township is negotiating with the Pinelands Commission to lower the building densities allowed in the Pinelands area.
The adjacent township, Berkeley, which has had about 10,000 new housing units since 1980, is also feeling squeezed. Mr. Catania's group, the Nature Conservancy, recently struck a deal with a developer to acquire 4,000 acres in the Pinelands there.
All over the Pinelands, Mr. Catania said, "I think there's going to be another boom, and in the next 5 or 10 years, I expect the areas that need to be protected are either going to be protected or they're going to be gone."

Map/Chart: "It's Not Barren, And It's Getting Less So"
The Pinelands National Reserve is governed by an intricate map that tries to channel most of the area's economic development into "regional growth areas" shown here in black. Even in towns and villages, development is permitted only if it is "compatible with the existing character." At the other end of the scale are the most ecologically sensitive zones, the "preservation area" and the "special agricultural areas" at its core, where economic activity is largely restricted to blueberry and cranberry farming; other forest and agricultural zones impose varying restrictions on housing density and agricultural use.
 
Preservation area
Largely undeveloped, but with some farming; reserved mostly for recreation and wildlife management.

HEADLINE: Bosom Foes Together Again

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
IT would have been an odd evening, that's for sure.
Hugh Hefner, the man who put women in bunny costumes and set the wheels of the sexual revolution in motion for millions of Americans, and Gloria Steinem, the crusading leader of the women's movement, were supposed to go on a blind date a few decades ago, as Mr. Hefner tells it. 
 In a funny way, it would make sense if the two had hit it off. He, the creator of Playboy, and she, the founder of Ms. magazine, ran spectacularly successful publications at the forefront of social change, then watched the circulation -- and relevance -- of their magazines dwindle. Both have made enemies of the right wing. Both ran through a series of romantic partners, wrote about sex, support gay rights and think Al Gore would make a fine, if boring, President.
But they hate each other's guts.
The long-ago meeting never took place, and instead, time pulled Mr. Hefner and Ms. Steinem further and further apart. But last week, cultural kismet -- or just a shrewd publicity coup -- brought them together after all these years for something resembling a blind date. The American Society of Magazine Editors chose the two of them to be inducted into its hall of fame at a luncheon on Wednesday at the Waldorf-Astoria.
His hair gray and his waist thickened with age, Mr. Hefner eschewed his trademark pajamas for a suit and tie, and clutched the lucite podium a tad shakily as he accepted the award from his daughter, Christie Hefner. He brought the house down when he said, "It takes something special . . . to get me out of my pajamas."
Ms. Steinem, clad in black pants and a black scoop-neck shirt, accepted her award from the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who praised her beauty and intelligence. The audience of magazine editors obediently ate their poached chicken and drank their white wine. The proceedings were terribly civil.
Things didn't turn frosty until Ms. Steinem and Mr. Hefner retired to a hotel suite for an interview. There they proved two things: that decades-ago date would have been a disaster. And it takes an awful lot to get a tough-as-nails Playboy press agent to cry.
Ms. Steinem, 63, insisted that except for the coincidence of their awards, she would never have found herself in the same room as Mr. Hefner. "I would not -- no, I would never under normal circumstances even think of Mr. Hefner," she said. "And I doubt that he would think of me at all."
She looked at him defiantly.
"That's not true," Mr. Hefner said, hunched stiffly in his chair, his eyes cast toward the beige plush carpet. "I would think of you. Sure I would."
In Ms. Steinem's presence, Mr. Hefner, 72, seemed crumpled, almost deflated. It was unclear whether he was responding that way out of a misguided, gentlemanly deference to her as a woman or whether he was genuinely terrified of her.
Their history is laced with ironies. In the early 1960's, Mr. Hefner said, Ms. Steinem wrote to him to suggest they meet socially. A rendezvous never took place despite what Mr. Hefner called "a flurry" of telephone calls and letters. Ms. Steinem denies ever trying to set something up. Mr. Hefner's office later faxed the interviewer a letter from Ms. Steinem dated July 7, 1962, in which she said she hoped to meet him. Ms. Steinem said later by telephone, "It was not to set up a date, I assure you."
The following year, Show magazine published an instantly famous expose by Ms. Steinem, then 28, about going undercover as Bunny Marie (she began as a Playboy door bunny, moved on to hatcheck bunny and graduated to table bunny). The article was included in Ms. Steinem's best-selling 1983 book of essays, "Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions," and it was made into "A Bunny's Tale," a television movie starring Kirstie Alley. In an interview of Mr. Hefner for McCall's in the mid-60's, Ms. Steinem described him as "a skinny, apologetic white man" and called the Playboy philosophy "boyish, undeveloped, anti-sensual, vicarious and sad."
Mr. Hefner never concealed his distate for Ms. Steinem or her activism. In the McCall's interview -- the last time they met until last week -- he said of the women's movement, "Women shouldn't be wasting their time on this foolishness."
But 1998 finds them, if not exactly mellowed toward each other, at least close on some issues. For example, there is Viagra, the male potency drug. "The implications of Viagra go far beyond just male sexual impotence," Mr. Hefner said, fumbling with his Playboy cuff links. "It will go on to much more serious stuff. There is some evidence that it may have positive physical effects for women as well."
Had he tried it?
"Sure," he said. "And the Monday afterward I went out and bought a chunk of Pfizer stock."
Ms. Steinem said she was disgusted that some news reports said "it was impossible for women to even tell if it worked," and that it looks as if insurance companies may cover the cost of Viagra for some male patients, but exclude women. "It's already scandalous that insurance companies don't cover birth control, contraception and even abortion," she said, the color rising in her cheeks. "Now this. It seems like Viagra in about two minutes has become more likely to be covered by health insurance than birth control, contraception and abortion combined."
Then there is Paula Jones, another topic that has made Ms. Steinem and Mr. Hefner into strange bedfellows (only metaphorically, to be sure). Ms. Steinem angered feminists by refusing to support Ms. Jones's allegation of sexual harassment against the President. Mr. Hefner wrote essays critical of Ms. Jones.
"I have always supported her access to the legal system," Ms. Steinem said. "But her case was always borderline legally. She was never told what her real chances were. I wish with all my heart she had gone to a women's group in Arkansas at the time. Even if it wasn't a good legal case -- which it wasn't -- there are ways of making complaints that she should have been able to use."
Ms. Steinem sat utterly still, her legs crossed at the knee and her hands locked in her lap.
Mr. Hefner, who wrote in a Playboy essay that "the President's enemies are enemies of sex," added now that Mr. Clinton's detractors "have a serious conservative agenda."
In the last decade, Ms. Steinem's brand of feminism and Mr. Hefner's libertine Playboy philosophy have undergone major transformations. Ms. Steinem has weathered the onslaught of so-called bimbo feminism, exemplified by women strippers who say they are empowering themselves by stripping for men and by young women who pose topless for the jackets of their books, which are purportedly about empowered, independent women. "The question is less what is done than who has the power to decide what to do and how to do it," Ms. Steinem said. "Remember, it's the right wing that is anti-sex -- not feminists."
Mr. Hefner has, for his part, watched his empire steadily erode as Playboy's circulation, which peaked at 7.16 million in 1972, fell steadily to 3.15 million. A chain of Playboy clubs closed in the 1980's, and Mr. Hefner had to endure the ignominy of selling his purple corporate jet with built-in discotheque. He married for a second time. The bride was Kimberley Conrad, the 1989 playmate of the year. They have two sons, 6 and 8, but are now separated.
Recently, there have been signs of a small Playboy revival. The Playboy manner -- with its winking, now-ironic images of martini-sipping lounge lizards and coquettish women -- is in style with a retro-loving subculture. Esquire is working on a profile of Mr. Hefner. The Friars Club will roast him as its man of the year in the fall. Playboy Enterprises is underwriting an exhibition of stag films at the Whitney Museum of American Art, to open in December. Next year, the magazine will celebrate its 45th anniversary, and the best part of it all, Mr. Hefner said, is that "the year 2000 is the Chinese year of the rabbit."
Ms. Steinem and Mr. Hefner agreed that reaching old age no longer means what it did to their parents' generation. "Sixty and 70 doesn't mean much anymore, as long as you retain your health," Mr. Hefner said.
Ms. Steinem agreed. "There is a great unexplored land after 60," she said. "It may be best indicated by who you were when you were 9 or 10 and a little girl. Climbing trees and saying: 'I know who I am. I know what I want.' That's before the feminine role has come down upon you. Then at the other end, when the feminine role has run out, you become this independent creature again, only now you have your own apartment, and you can reach all the light switches. It's also a time when you are no longer obsessed with sex, so that really helps."
Mr. Hefner's eyebrows shot up.
Ms. Steinem argued that postmenopausal women are free from the storms of sex and romantic love, and so are happier. She said: "When I meet women who are over 55 who have just fallen in love and are miserable, I always ask, 'Are you on hormone replacement therapy?' "
How many centerfolds were feminists, Mr. Hefner? "I wouldn't know," he said. "I have no idea."
"Of course not," she said.
Mr. Hefner shook his head woefully. A photographer asked them to pose together, holding their etched-glass awards from the editors.
"Do we have to do that?" Mr. Hefner asked. "Haven't we done enough?" He turned to Ms. Steinem and asked, "Are you comfortable with that?"
"No, I don't think so," she said. She accused the magazine editors' board of arranging the joint awards to her and Mr. Hefner as a publicity stunt. "We've done enough," she said. "We can't pose with our awards. It's not the awards that are the problems. It's us doing it together. I am not going to pose with him."
Mr. Hefner, clearly uncomfortable with her rising anger, paused to wipe a hand across his brow. His publicity agent, Cindy Rakowitz, walked over to guide him out of the room.
"This was obviously an error in judgment," a furious Ms. Steinem said of her decision to accept the award. Her eyes followed Mr. Hefner as he shuffled away. "It's just so outrageous."
Mr. Hefner returned to his hotel suite to change his shirt. Outside, Ms. Rakowitz dabbed at her mascara, tears falling.
"She was so mean to him," Ms. Rakowitz said, the spangles on her navy suit sparkling in the dim hallway light. "She doesn't understand, he's such a nice guy. He is so nice to the women who work for him."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen New Beetle;
After Beetlemania Fades, Will the Beat Go On?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
ENOUGH, already. Yes, the Volkswagen New Beetle is cute. It is adorable. It is unique. It is cool. It gets attention -- so far, at least -- everywhere it goes.
But now that the novelty has begun to wear off, the first-look articles have all been written and Viagra has supplanted Volkswagen as the hot product of the moment, it is time to look at the New Beetle not as a social phenomenon, but as just a car. 
 And as extraordinary as it looks, the 1998 New Beetle is a fairly ordinary, though perfectly capable, car to drive. And it is a real car despite its toy-like looks. The smooth, arcing lines could have been drawn by Fisher-Price, and they suggest that this is a car to play in. Indeed, people smile and giggle when they see it, though that will end as the cartoonish shape becomes more familiar.
The premiere has been spectacular and the crowds are S.R.O., but critics and consumers are wondering if VW's show has legs. Even the company refers to the reincarnated Beetle as an experiment.
Underneath the familiar but updated silhouette, the car rides on a thoroughly modern platform that it shares with the VW Golf, a modest success in America but one of the best-selling cars in Europe.
Mechanically, the New Beetle is the opposite of the original, which was designed by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930's and was sold in the United States from 1949 to 1979. The original had an air-cooled engine (a horizontally opposed four-cylinder) in the rear, it was driven by the rear wheels and it had drum brakes. The new car has a liquid-cooled engine (also four cylinders, but in a straight line) up front, driving the front wheels, and it has disk brakes.
During my test drive I encountered a University of Michigan graduate student who passionately insisted that because of these differences, the 1999 version was an impostor. But buyers should be thankful for the changes, which make the car safer, more reliable and much more pleasant to drive.
Even though the New Beetle is built in Mexico, it has a solid German feel. Its rigid structure and firm suspension give it the responsive handling of a European sedan, along with a comfortable ride.
The acceleration could be quicker, but that shortfall will be remedied as other engines become available. I had no problem keeping up with highway traffic in the test car, which had a 2-liter, 115-horsepower, four-cylinder gasoline engine with an economy rating of 23 miles a gallon in town and 29 on the highway. One other engine is available now: a 90-horsepower, four-cylinder, direct-injection turbo-diesel with a highway mileage rating of 48 m.p.g. and a driving range of nearly 700 miles.
Those wanting more zip will have to wait until year-end, when the New Beetle gets the 1.8-liter, turbo-charged four-cylinder gasoline engine from the Audi A4 1.8T. There is speculation that the new car will eventually get Volkswagen's very hot VR6 engine, but the company insists there will be no V6 in the foreseeable future. There is other speculation that future Beetles could come with all-wheel drive, a convertible top or even an alternative-fuel powertrain.
A five-speed manual transmission is standard; a four-speed automatic is optional. Having driven both, I'd opt for the better-performing manual, which also seems more appropriate in light of Beetle history.
The New Beetle is larger than the original Bug, though its length of 161 inches is about the same. But it is more than 7 inches wider, and its cab-forward architecture, with little overhang beyond the wheels, makes it much more spacious inside.
When you slide behind the steering wheel the cabin actually feels big. In the original Bug, you were face to face with the windshield, but in the New Beetle, nearly two feet of dashboard separate front-seat occupants from the glass. This long dash is, at first, disconcerting and will certainly be a giant dust collector. But I quickly grew accustomed to looking past it. The headroom is immense, and front legroom is generous. Even very tall drivers have plenty of room.
The rear seat is a different story, because of the perfect curve of the roofline. Headroom and legroom are adequate only for very small people, like children. (My head brushed the rear glass, and I'm only 5-foot-2.) A 6-foot-plus companion was uncomfortably bent at the neck, his knees scrunched up, when two other 6-footers took the front seats. When unoccupied, the rear seat can be folded to expand the 12 cubic feet of cargo space under the rear hatch.
The front seats, which adjust in various ways, are fairly comfortable, and are covered in an attractive velour cloth, leatherette (a no-cost option), or real leather ($700). A tilting and telescoping steering wheel is standard equipment.
The Beetle's interior design is distinctive, too, with styling cues that hint at its predecessor. The upper door sills are metal, painted in the body color; it looks as if the metal is folded like a hem from the outside. The interior has a round theme, including a simple curved dashboard with a circular speedometer. When illuminated, the gauges' red needles are set against a backdrop of indigo blue. The steering wheel, shift knob and hand brake are trimmed with a material that looks like brushed aluminum. And there is a bud vase on the dash to the right of the driver. The plastic vase is a standard feature; flowers are optional.
In contrast to the Spartan original, the New Beetle is well-appointed. Standard features include a pollen and odor filter, a six-speaker stereo, an anti-theft alarm system, halogen projector-beam headlights, four-wheel disk brakes and a central locking system with remote entry. Options include a CD player, anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, cruise control, integrated fog lamps, heated front seats and power windows.
The materials and workmanship were outstanding on the test car. On the trunk, a chrome VW logo swivels to reveal a lock and an integrated hatch handle. Inside, the door grab handles had a soft, silky feel, in contrast to the hard plastics in many $15,000 cars.
Volkswagen's quality control slipped for a few years, particularly for Golfs made in Mexico, but Consumer Reports has given it higher marks for reliability of late.
I had one quality problem with my first test car, an early-production model. The doors froze shut and could not be opened, apparently because of a bad seal. Some colleagues reported similar problems with their test cars.
In terms of safety, the New Beetle has pretensioning front safety belts, front and rear headrests, daytime running lights, dual air bags and side air bags inside the front seats. And the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported last week that it did well in low-speed bumper tests, suffering only $134 in damage after four tests. (Compare that with the Hyundai Elantra, which suffered $3,042 in damage, according to the insurance industry group.) The institute is expected to announce tomorrow that the VW excelled in front-end crash tests.
The New Beetle starts at $15,700, including delivery; the diesel version is $16,975. A two-year warranty includes scheduled maintenance at no charge. Still, the VW is not cheap compared with small cars like the Dodge Neon and Honda Civic. Indeed, there are better bargains in price and performance, but the New Beetle makes a truly distinctive fashion statement.
And the look is what this car is all about.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Calling the Tune, Raising the Money, Fixing the Plumbing

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN David Rivel assumed leadership of the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music in 1995, the Park Slope institution was withering on the vine. It had had six executive directors in the previous three years. Its enrollment was stagnating. And its fund-raising efforts were yielding just $59,000 a year toward a budget of $1 million.
The 114-year-old brownstone that it calls home was crumbling, too. Mr. Rivel would arrive in the morning and sweep bits of building off the front steps. Water was leaking into classrooms and creating pools in the basement. On one occasion, a piece of ceiling landed on his desk. 
 But today, the conservatory, one of the city's 18 community schools of the arts, is shrouded in scaffolding. It is in the first stage of a project to restore the building, increase access for the disabled and make the place more music-friendly, in part by expanding its teaching space by 30 percent.
The school is progressing on other fronts, too. It is raising more than $250,000 a year, and it has amassed $1.7 million so far in a $2.5 million capital campaign. Enrollment has never been higher; there are now 1,400 students, including 500 at another school, in Flushing, Queens, that was established in 1955. The conservatory has also built up its jazz program, which is the largest in any of the country's 400 community arts schools.
Much of the credit is given to Mr. Rivel, a wiry, energetic 36-year-old who left the apex of culture -- a vice presidency at Lincoln Center -- for the grass roots. "If David hadn't come along, the conservatory probably would have gone out of business," said Emilie Roy Corey, a social worker who began taking lessons at the conservatory in 1992 and now serves as its chairwoman.
When a headhunter approached Mr. Rivel about the job, he had never heard of the conservatory, even though he lives just 12 blocks away.
After eight years at Lincoln Center, however, Mr. Rivel had begun to see audiences fall off, the consequence of drastic cuts in music education in the public schools over the last generation. Wanting to address the problem, he took the conservatory job.
The conservatory was founded in 1897 by Edward Adolf Whitelaw, who headed it until he died in 1944. Under his leadership, it was a place for elites, modeled on European conservatories, for which students had to audition. After World War II, the G.I. Bill sent a flood of veterans and their families through its doors, permanently altering the institution. It became a community school of the arts, which provide quality arts education to all, regardless of ability or resources.
"We're trying to be a force for music," Mr. Rivel said. "It's not all about turning out great musicians. It's about turning out great citizens."
At the conservatory, that process starts early: preschoolers as young as 18 months are eligible for its Songs, Sounds, Leaps and Bounds program. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, 4- and 5-year-olds in the group were banging on drums and racing around the room to music.
"My son has a lot of fun here," said Judith Conley, explaining why she brings 5-year-old Brandon. "And he comes to the dinner table singing things like, 'Isadora Duncan was a modern dancer.' "
The conservatory, where the as-yet unrestored interior has a homey if shabby feel, offers private lessons as well as group instruction and ensembles for those wanting to learn a new skill, start a career or exercise a talent untapped by 9-to-5 duty as a computer analyst or nurse.
Lessons are free or subsidized for those who cannot pay the fees; the teachers are professional musicians who often perform at the conservatory or outside it.
Besides these on-site activities, the conservatory has a Music Partners program, which takes music into 14 public schools and reaches 2,500 students a year. "Basically, we're the music departments that were gutted in the public schools," Mr. Rivel said.
To keep these many programs going and to continue the school's rebound, Mr. Rivel is relying on his job experience and fund-raising contacts from Lincoln Center. His basic premise is that a small arts organization can and should operate like a large one. He has hired a director of development and one for public relations and marketing. He has put in place an annual budgeting process, with monthly reports. He has created a personnel manual and established an endowment to maintain the building.
There are still bumps in the road ahead, of course. The renovation and its disruptions will take two years more -- if all goes well -- and the capital campaign, like all such efforts, is vulnerable to economic downturns and other dangers.
Meanwhile, the show goes on. Downstairs from the preschoolers, Zoe LaMarche, 11, is taking a saxophone lesson from Benny Russell, struggling -- and succeeding -- with Jackie McLean's "Dig." Several floors up, Cleve Guyton is giving a clarinet lesson, as trumpet sounds filter in from another room. (After renovation the rooms will be soundproof; now, they most definitely are not.)
In another studio, Hiromi Matsunaga finishes one piano lesson and begins another. Her student is Fern Gentile, a lawyer specializing in elder law, who just began taking lessons. She had always wanted to learn, she said, and then her 9-year-old son started studying at the conservatory.
"It gave me a huge desire," she said, "and we got a piano."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Debating the Merit of a Social Security Cap

BYLINE: By JANE HODGES 

 BODY:
IN his early 60's, Alfred Armand set up a telecommunications consultancy in San Francisco. But in recent years, he turned down some jobs.
The reason, said Mr. Armand, now 70, wasn't so much that he wanted to cut back on business. Instead, he said, he passed up the work because taking it would have pushed his income well beyond caps imposed by the Social Security Administration's "earnings test," which penalizes benefit recipients ages 62 to 69 who earn more than certain amounts. 
 "I could have used the additional money I generated, but I always tried to hold down my income," said Mr. Armand, who works part-time as a telecommunications instructor at Skyline College in San Bruno, Calif. When he first set up his consulting business, he recalled, he lost $3,000 in benefits one year and $6,000 another year.
Earnings limits have long come under fire from older Americans and their advocates. This year, though, the prospects for their elimination may improve as Congress and the Clinton Administration, operating in an economy with almost full employment, consider proposals to assure Social Security's long-term health.
"There's a sentiment growing that it's illogical," John Woyke, a principal at Towers Perrin, the management consulting firm, said of the earnings cap. "It's definitely on the table and could be one of a set of reforms."
This year, workers who began collecting Social Security benefits at age 65 can make up to $14,500 in salary and wages without having their benefits cut. Those who make more will see their benefits cut by $1 for every $3 of additional earnings.
The ceiling is lower for workers 62 to 64 who chose to take Social Security benefits early and continued to work. The maximum they can earn is $9,120; any more than that, and their benefits will be cut by $1 for every $2 of additional earnings.
According to Social Security estimates, about 329,000 Americans lost part of their benefits last year because of earnings caps.
To improve their situation, Congress in 1996 approved a new schedule of earnings caps for people 65 to 69; the limit gradually climbs to $30,000 in 2002. Moreover, there is no limit on income from investments, rents, royalties and capital gains; there is also no limit on earnings for those 70 and older.
Even so, some people have argued that the earnings test discourages sixty-somethings from working during a still-productive life stage. And as Washington prepares to deal with the future of Social Security, those arguments have gained ground.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, are proposing to eliminate the test. Mr. Moynihan's measure is part of his bill to revamp Social Security; Mr. McCain's initiative focuses specifically on the test.
Mr. Moynihan has said that in the current economy, the labor force has more room for older workers -- something that was not true when Social Security began in 1935. David Podoff, an economist who works with Senator Moynihan on the Senate Finance Committee, said: "The test is a relic of the Depression era, when we were trying to discourage people from working. Now we want to encourage them."
Senator McCain's plan would repeal the test only for those 65 and older. "This would provide economic freedom to lower-income seniors," said Nancy Ives, a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain. "By keeping seniors in the work force, it would be a net plus, because of the tax revenues this would generate."
Opponents of caps also say their benefits for the Government do not justify keeping them. Not only do they create administrative burdens, Senator McCain contends, but they have cost the nation an estimated $15 billion annually in lost productivity in recent years.
Those who want to keep the test say its elimination would impose large short-term costs on the Federal budget. Mr. Moynihan's plan would cost $10 billion a year over the next 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office figures, though other provisions in his proposal would help offset that. Ms. Ives said the short-term costs of Mr. McCain's bill would be less than $10 billion a year.
Social Security administrators and test supporters also say that any perceived unfairness may result from a misunderstanding of how the test works.
Michael Leonesio, an economist for the Social Security Administration, noted that the test does not permanently hold cash from workers. Those penalized in their 60's recover withheld earnings through adjustments to their checks after they reach 70.
The test is "actuarily fair" for those 62 to 64, Mr. Leonesio said, and will become so for those 65 to 69 within 10 years. That means it will not affect the total benefits collected over a lifetime.
"With actuarial fairness, there's no reason to get rid of it at all," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
He added that eliminating the test might only benefit higher-wage earners. "I can think of few lower-priority uses of funding than letting lawyers, doctors and professionals keep a cash advance," he said.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Deflation Isn't a Worry, Either

BYLINE: By NORBERT WALTER; Norbert Walter is chief economist for Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt.

 BODY:
MORE than a year ago, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, warned about the danger of an "irrational exuberance" on Wall Street, prompting me to write an article for this space titled "Deflating an Inflation Worry."
Recently, though, the Asian financial crisis and an economic downturn in Japan have raised fears of a vicious downward spiral in the global economy. So this may be the right time to deflate a deflation worry. 
 There is no question that the Asian crisis has radically altered the global economic climate. While Asian currencies and stock markets have recovered somewhat, the situation remains precarious, despite financial rescue missions by the International Monetary Fund. Excessive short-term borrowing by Asian companies -- a key contributing factor in the crisis -- has forced banks and other private lenders in the United States, Europe and Japan to roll over billions of dollars to Asian borrowers.
Many analysts fear that the plunge in asset prices in Asia, combined with the harsh economic therapy required by the I.M.F. for its aid, will lead to deep recessions and soaring unemployment in Asia. As Mr. Greenspan has noted, such doom could spill over into the United States, Europe and the rest of the industrialized world.
Prices of oil and other raw materials have been pushed sharply lower worldwide by expectations of slower economic growth. Currency devaluations have made Asian suppliers much more competitive, and pessimists worry that the crisis will cause an old-fashioned price war and a decline in global investment activity. It is also widely argued that the creation of a single European currency, with its rigid fiscal rules, is adding ice to the baby's bath water.
It all sounds so convincing -- and alarming -- until one looks at the facts. Many economists and analysts who are sounding the global deflation alarm are the same ones who were convinced just a few months ago that the American economy was growing too strongly.
But they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. The United States economy is in quite good shape. Production is booming, domestic demand clearly is continuing to rise and credit is readily available. Despite last week's nervousness about interest rates, long-term rates have been trending down. The real costs of financing -- the prevailing rates of interest minus inflation -- are not low, but they are not dangerously high, either. In fact, they compare quite favorably with financing costs in Europe and many countries in the developing world.
Inflation in the United States, meanwhile, remains well-behaved. Barring further economic shocks in Asia that might push the dollar higher, or drive oil and other commodity prices lower, the inflation rate is likely to trend higher, but not to levels of serious concern.
Given that the Asian crisis is likely to prompt the world's central banks to hold interest rates relatively low -- at least in the short term -- there seems little risk of a dangerous contraction in the global supply of money and credit. Accordingly, the notion that the world is poised at some sort of deflationary abyss seems far-fetched.
If the continuing problems in the Japanese financial system can be contained and if the Chinese Government can resist pressure to devalue its currency against the dollar, a gradual re-acceleration of inflation, not deflation, is likely in 1999 and thereafter. For that reason, the Fed and the world's other major central banks are unlikely to maintain their benign stance for more than the next few quarters. Indeed, 1999 may be the year when the Fed and the newly created European Central Bank will have to start nudging short-term interest rates higher to keep inflation at bay into the next decade.
This should not pose a serious deflationary threat to the world economy, particularly if battered Asian economies have by then restored their credibility in the global financial markets. This will require a radical program of social, political and economic reforms, including greater corporate transparency. Asian countries will also have to attract more direct foreign investment in factories and other productive assets rather than simply repeating the potentially destabilizing inflows of "hot money" portfolio capital, in which investors try to chase the latest fad in emerging markets.
THESE changes will require a Herculean effort by the countries involved. But even more is needed to restore stability to the region: Archimedean support for good governance must come from friends in the leading industrialized countries and major international financial institutions.
These reforms -- not some panicky response to an imaginary deflationary crisis -- will be the key to safeguarding global prosperity in the next century.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Keeping Up With the Gateses?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
HER car is a second-hand 1989 Acura, a bit of resistance on the part of Juliet B. Schor to the "competitive consumption" that she describes so vividly in her new book, "The Overspent American." The television set is in the coldest, least inviting room of her house -- another bit of resistance. But the well-dressed Ms. Schor gives ground on clothing, participating despite herself in the new consumerism that has been reshaping behavior since the 1980's.
Ms. Schor, an economist at Harvard University, argues that the vast majority of Americans aspire in their spending to the life styles of the wealthiest 20 percent. They go into debt trying to acquire the trappings of that world, or the portrayal of it offered incessantly on TV. For tens of millions of Americans, consumption has become the route to a sense of well-being and identity. But that route always seems to require more purchases, which in turn become new status markers in an endless "ratcheting up." 
 "The comparisons we make are no longer restricted to those in our general earnings category, or even to those one rung above us on the ladder," Ms. Schor writes. "Today, a person is more likely to be making comparisons with, or choose as a reference group, people whose incomes are three, four or five times his or her own. The result is that millions of us have become participants in a national culture of upscale spending."
In an age of income inequality, that is not easy. The incomes of the top 20 percent, which start at $75,000 a year and reside mostly above $90,000, have been growing faster than the incomes of everyone else, so keeping up means going deeper into debt. That, in fact, has been happening, particularly among households in the $25,000-to-$75,000 income range, the group that is trying hardest, in Ms. Schor's view, to rise in status. Simply having all the basics -- being comfortable -- now fails to be sufficient.
"While politicians continue to tout the middle class as the heart and soul of American society," she writes, "for far too many of us, being solidly middle class is no longer good enough."
Only determined "downshifters" -- and they are growing in number, Ms. Schor reports -- manage to immunize themselves, by altering their lives, working less and spending less. Ms. Schor is with them in spirit, if not always in practice. The black nylon shoulder bag that she tosses on the floor behind her as she settles into the driver's seat of her car is smart-looking and bears a designer label. Her black, knitted European suit is similarly upscale; not high couture -- she got it on sale for $200, marked down from $1,200 -- but certainly stylish.
TWO findings stood out in a lecture about the book that Ms. Schor gave last week to 50 students at Brandeis University, 20 minutes by used car from her Harvard office. Television is a big driver of consumer aspirations, she said -- not just the commercials, but the stylish clothing worn by actors and the affluent settings of so many shows, particularly soap operas. Tabulating a survey of employees at a big, unnamed telecommunications company, Ms. Schor found that for every hour of television watched weekly, spending rose by $208 a year. This group watched enough TV to cost each person more than $2,200 a year.
"People from really opulent families use TV as a reality check," Ms. Schor said. "But for the vast majority of Americans, TV upscales their perceptions."
And their aspirations. Another poll asked where people wanted to end up. Eighty-five percent said they wanted to be rich or upper middle class; only 15 percent sought to "live a comfortable life" -- a code phrase for middle class. The Brandeis students, in a show of hands, fit this pattern. Only one saw herself as becoming middle class, and she raised her hand meekly.
Ms. Schor -- 42, director of studies at Harvard's Women's Studies program, married to another economist, raising two children in a recently purchased three-bedroom suburban home -- wrote a best-seller in 1991 entitled "The Overworked American." Instead of working fewer hours and having more leisure, which had been everyone's expectation, Americans were actually spending more time at work, she reported. It was a finding that struck a public chord and that Government data later confirmed. Among the reasons she gave for the trend: People needed the extra income to pay for their consumption.
And now, in the midst of a stock market boom and an outburst of consumption, "The Overspent American" (Basic Books) tries to explain what makes people such driven consumers. Ms. Schor, in effect, has written a modern-day version of "The Theory of the Leisure Class," in which Thorstein Veblen chronicled the "conspicuous consumption" of America's wealthy at the turn of the century, noting their spending on luxury goods (gold-handled walking sticks, for example) to call attention to their wealth and thus gain social esteem.
A HALF century later, after World War II, James Duesenberry, another Harvard economist, updated Veblen. Neighborhood life flourished then. Incomes were much more evenly distributed than in Veblen's day -- or now -- and Mr. Duesenberry popularized the phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" in his classic description of neighbors matching neighbors in the purchase of dishwashers, televisions, second cars and the like.
Another 50 years have passed and people today hardly know their neighbors. Civic activity, a potential substitute for spending, has declined. Income inequality has dissipated the egalitarian ethos. Religious and social taboos against excessive consumption have deteriorated. And the new view of life, Ms. Schor argues, is not through the kitchen window, but through the television screen or in catalogues and advertisements that endlessly promote luxury products, or in office settings where lower-level workers are often in contact with wealthier colleagues who lead fancier lives.
Ms. Schor's book describes this new milieu. The story she tells may be the most eye-catching so far, but she is not alone. Robert Frank, a Cornell University labor economist who recently co-wrote a book entitled "The Winner-Take-All Society" (Free Press), is completing a new book, "Luxury Fever," in which he shares several of Ms. Schor's views, though not her finding that most Americans are trying to mimic the lives of the upper 20 percent on the income ladder.
In Mr. Frank's analysis, the goal may be the top rung, but the mimicking is mainly a process of trying to keep up with those only a little higher in income. And since income inequality has created many rungs, starting at the top with Mr. Frank's big winners, it is a busy process. "If you read about someone high on the ladder buying a $50,000 wristwatch, then you don't feel like such a spendthrift if you buy a $1,000 watch," Mr. Frank said. "That is what is happening."
Both Mr. Frank and Ms. Schor would curb the spending through a consumption tax that bit hardest at the biggest spenders. A goal would be to push more spending into investment, public and private. But the solutions, particularly in Ms. Schor's case, are less interesting than the sociology and the economics.
Criticism of Ms. Schor's book is already coming from some traditional economists. The mainstream view is that consumers act rationally, buying what they need or value and can afford -- if not right away, then with earnings that they expect to receive later in life. Ms. Schor accepts this thesis, but she argues -- as did Veblen -- that such theorizing fails to recognize that spending takes place in a social framework.
"People have choice; they can opt out of the game," she said. "What I am saying is that opting out is a socially costly thing to do. It is very difficult."
A $30,000 outlay for a Volvo or a sport utility vehicle may buy true value in the eyes of the purchaser, specifically crash protection and durability. But the payment is also made to buy status, which Ms. Schor argues is often a waste of national resources and an unnecessary invasion of savings. Her thinking helps to explain the 1989 Acura, and the decision to run her family with only one car, not two or three -- another bit of American spending in which the line between utility and social pressure is often obscure.
The red-brick colonial home that Ms. Schor and her husband, Prasannan Parthasarathi, bought in Newton is ideal for this one-car family -- within walking distance of Mr. Parthasarathi's new teaching job at Boston College, and also a short walk to the playground and the neighborhood elementary school.
The family resists, too, the home improvements so dear to Ms. Schor's new consumer. The bathrooms, never updated since the house was built in 1929, are just fine, she declares. So is the kitchen, last remodeled in the 1960's. "People say we have to change the cabinets," she said. "But we don't."
When it comes to clothing, though, sorting out value and status is not so easy.
"For most women, clothing is an area of conflict," she said. "You need an upscale wardrobe for your job. But we are also socialized in a culture that generates a lot of desire for apparel and accessories. I have that. One year, it was 1985 or 1986, I sat down and totaled up what I had spent on clothes, and I was horrified to find that I had spent $8,000 and I had only earned in the $30,000's."
THE nuances of the new consumerism are noteworthy. The college-educated, Ms. Schor found in her polling, are bigger consumers than the less educated, perhaps because college raises their aspirations. Gift-giving for weddings, birthdays, bar mitzvahs and the like requires ever-more expensive presents, sucking an age-old practice "into the larger vortex of consumerism."
Less noticeable spending -- expensive vacation travel abroad, say, or having children at Ivy League schools -- also plays a growing role in establishing status, and people find ways to advertise these invisibles, with school decals, for example, on the family car.
Contrary to mainstream economic thinking, Ms. Schor found, people pass up practical purchases that add value, like aluminum siding. Siding reduces home maintenance and improves insulation, but is often rejected as declasse. So are high-quality drugstore lipsticks, lacking only the high sticker prices of the high-fashion brands.
"In fact, with lipsticks, the higher the price, the more consumers tend to purchase them," she writes, summarizing her research. "This finding flies in the face of the received wisdom that a higher price discourages buyers."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
An On-Line Rush Is On

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE future of the mutual fund industry is wired, and that may be good news for Internet-wise investors. Their rewards could be a greater variety of funds and lower expenses, according to the authors of a Goldman Sachs & Company report on the money management business.
The report cites a study by Forrester Research, a technology market research firm based in Boston, that predicts mutual fund assets in on-line accounts will grow from an estimated $47 billion today to $241 billion by 2002. That pace is five times the expected growth rate for overall household assets. 
 Retail investors stand to benefit from the trend. "The Internet represents growth, variety and a low-cost means of distribution which could lead to lower fund expenses," said Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman who was co-author of the report. The increasing ease with which money managers can distribute funds will insure a continued supply of new offerings, he said.
The added variety of funds can be useful to investors: Research has shown that newer, smaller funds tend to outperform older peers that have greater assets, especially in certain asset classes like small-capitalization stocks.
The growth in on-line fund investing should also drive down fund expenses, said John J. Moon, another co-author and an associate in the investment banking division of Goldman. And such a decline would be a break for fee-weary investors.
For example, American Century Investments, the fund group based in Kansas City, Mo., is considering adding a share class for sale over the Internet that charges less than its other share classes. "It's in recognition that a growing portion of our customer base is interested in doing business on the Web," said Chris Doyle, a company spokesman.
Mr. Doyle said that 10 percent of the company's two million investors had indicated they wanted to do business with it over the Internet and that about 4 percent did so already.
The Internet reduces fund companies' need for expensive toll-free telephone numbers and customer service staff and cuts postage and printing costs, he noted. "The thinking is that you could share these cost savings with the investor," he said, perhaps through a reduced management fee.
For the fund industry, Mr. Moon said, the growth of on-line fund investing will result in clear-cut losers as well as winners.
"We believe the largest mutual fund providers will be best prepared to reap the rewards, because they will have the reputation and the brand names to differentiate themselves," Mr. Moon said.
Smaller companies will benefit from the low-cost distribution provided by the Internet, helping them proliferate. "It has truly leveled the playing field," Mr. Strauss said.
But middle-tier companies will be increasingly squeezed as smaller fund companies, which generally have lower overhead, crowd onto the Internet to peddle their wares. Indeed, the report noted that midsized companies' share of mutual fund assets had already dropped from 33 percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1997. The market share of the 10 largest companies, by contrast, has risen slightly, to 51 percent from 49 percent, and that of smaller companies has climbed to 27 percent from 18 percent. (In a universe of 706 firms, the top 10 in assets were defined as large companies, the next 20 were considered midsized and the remainder were considered small.)

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Captive REIT's: A Tax Shelter Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
IT'S hard to keep a good tax shelter down.
After nearly disappearing in the late 1980's, so-called captive REIT's are making a comeback, with half a dozen begun in the last three years. And again they are sending some eyebrows to the rafters. 
 Like an ordinary real estate investment trust, or REIT, a captive REIT provides shelter from Federal taxes and derives income from ownership of real estate assets.
What makes a captive trust different is that, at least at the outset, all its properties are obtained from, and leased right back to, a sponsoring company whose main business isn't real estate, and the trust takes no role in managing the properties.
Captive trusts first became widespread in the mid-1980's, when nursing-home companies, in particular, set them up as a way of using their sizeable real estate holdings to raise capital off the balance sheet. To some extent they took the place of a so-called stapled REIT, under which shares of a trust and its sponsor traded as a unit.
The captive trusts traded separately but remained at the mercy of their only sources of income -- their sponsors. When the sponsors ran into trouble in the last recession, the trusts suffered badly and grew scarce.
Lately, though, new trusts have been popping up in property-rich sectors like golf courses, movie multiplexes and prisons. Last week the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, the second-largest prison operator, took its Correctional Properties Trust public; the new trust, offered at $20 a share, closed at $23.0625 on Friday.
The Wackenhut offering followed by a week the announcement by the Corrections Corporation of America, the industry leader, that it would merge itself into its captive trust, CCA Prison Realty Trust, and create a private prison-operating company that the trust will partly own. The novel deal's baffling complexity has sparked a class action lawsuit and sent the stocks of both the trust and the sponsor sliding. The trust, whose share price doubled after it was begun last summer, closed on Friday at $35.5625, off $9.0625 from its peak.
Captive REIT deals are so advantageous for sponsors that some analysts expect many more of them. "There's potential here for an awful lot of industries," said Michael Kirby, a co-founder of Green Street Advisers, a research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. Mr. Kirby added that the trusts allow companies to make money off underappreciated real estate assets.
And despite the controversy surrounding CCA Prison Realty, the new crop of trusts may prove more attractive to investors than their failed predecessors. For one thing, they appear to have somewhat better growth prospects.
"In the old days, with nursing-home companies, these REIT's generated returns that were relatively fixed," said Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter based in Shrewsbury, N.J. "But during the recent wave they've been restructured to give them some kind of growth aspect" in their income stream, like a built-in rent escalator. These trusts will never grow as quickly as their sponsors, he said, but their rich dividends can make up for slow growth.
Still, the trusts can run into stadium-sized conflicts of interest. Most share managers, boards of directors or even their chief executive with the sponsoring company, opening the door for the sponsor to veto a rent increase or a potential acquisition that might benefit the trust.
The market can penalize trusts that are too much in thrall to their sponsors. "The main difference between the REIT's that have done very well and those that haven't has been their structure," Mr. Kirby said. "The less captive, the better."
Mr. Kirby points to health care trusts from the mid-1980's, like Nationwide Health Properties, that later became independent.
"Nationwide's success has been particularly striking," he said. Under Beverly Enterprises, the nursing home operator that sponsored the trust, "it got run into the ground," he said. "But since it became independent, it's turned into one of the best-performing REIT's."
Entertainment Properties Trust has plenty of independence but hasn't done half as well. The trust owns 13 multiplex cinemas run by AMC Entertainment. It shares no top executives with AMC, has only one AMC employee on its five-member board and faces no bar to doing business with other theater chains; in fact, AMC encourages it. But the trust's stock has languished near the offering price of $20, closing on Friday at $19.6875.
David M. Brain, the trust's chief financial officer, thinks his company is being penalized because it doesn't yet do business with anyone but AMC. But the lackluster performance may have more to do with worries about a coming glut of movie theaters.
Some trusts, like National Golf Properties, take steps to establish independence but never stray far from their sponsors. All but five of National's 120 golf courses are leased to the company that spun it off in 1993, American Golf; National leased those five to other operators just "for the sake of doing it," according to James F. Wilson, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, a stockbroker in San Francisco.
"There are pluses and minuses to all this," Mr. Wilson said, crystallizing the conundrum facing many captive REIT's. "This is a company that has to ask itself: Does it want to have all independent operators to avoid conflicts, or does it want to have the best operator that will maximize revenues?"

Are Trusts' Stocks Poised for Revival?

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
SO far, 1998 has been a bust for real estate investment trusts. Indexes of REIT stocks are down for the year, while the broader market has soared. As speculation mounts that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to brake a speeding economy, are REIT's headed from bad to worse?
Quite the opposite, analysts say: REIT stocks may be on the brink of a revival. 
 The trusts produced steady double-digit returns from 1995 through 1997, reflecting the vibrant economy and widespread resurgence in property values since the days of half-vacant Houston skyscrapers and foreclosed Boston condominiums. In 1998, analysts said, fear of a speculative bubble in the property market, along with worries about overbuilding and tighter Government regulation, have held REIT stocks back.
"This has been the worst period of REIT performance in REIT history," said Martin Cohen, president of Cohen & Steers in New York, a leading manager of REIT securities. "The economic recovery is getting old, and prices for property are getting high. So sentiment is not as positive."
The relative weakness in REIT stocks, however, does not necessarily signal a downturn in the economic cycle or underlying vulnerability in the REIT industry.
On the contrary, these publicly held property companies are generally considered to have durable strengths, with low debts and steady income from rents.
"The REIT stocks tend to be defensive-type stocks," said David Lerner, chief executive of David Lerner Associates, a Syosset, N.Y., dealer in municipal bonds and other conservative investments. "We've been going through a very strong bull market, and the REIT stocks have not been in favor. But that's not because there's anything wrong with them."
REIT's have become the dominant force in real estate, amassing a broad array of reliable income producers, from shopping malls to theaters to hotels, and they show few signs of slowing down. The aggressive REIT of the real estate billionaire Sam Zell, Equity Office Partners, was the buyer in 5 of the 10 largest commercial property transactions last year. Starwood Hotels and Resorts has become the world's biggest hotel company. Vornado Realty Trust has invested $3 billion in the last year in everything from offices to cold storage vaults.
So some analysts expect a rebound in the second half, with gains in the 10 to 12 percent range, and say REIT stocks could even benefit from a rise in interest rates, which would tend to hurt other stocks.
"Interest rates tend to go up when the economy is strong," said Ritson Ferguson, president of CRA Real Estate Securities in Radnor, Pa. "If I'm a real estate owner, that's the kind of environment where I get to raise rents and make more money."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Spiders and Diamonds and Dogs, Oh My!

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
WANTING a piece of the action on Wall Street but lacking the expertise to go it alone, millions of Americans began investing in mutual funds during the last decade. Then, as most equity funds failed to keep up with the bull market, investors embraced index funds as inexpensive shortcuts to owning the most-sought-after stocks.
Now, legions of individual investors have apparently decided that they are ready to go one-up on Wall Street after all. 
 They are pouring billions of dollars into unit investment trusts -- products that let them time the market by actively trading in and out of broad indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard & Poor's 500. Almost overnight, unit investment trusts with catchy names like Diamonds and Spiders and Webs have become Wall Street's hottest products.
A sort of hybrid between a mutual fund and a stock, a unit investment trust holds a fixed portfolio of bonds or stocks for a defined time. The most popular trusts trade like stocks on the American Stock Exchange, where they are single-handedly responsible for an increase of about 25 percent in daily trading volume in the last three years.
Investors like unit trusts because they are easy to understand; stock brokers like them because they are even easier to sell -- and because of the fat commissions many offer, compared with similar mutual funds.
Sell they have. Americans funneled $38 billion into unit trusts last year, nearly two-thirds more than in 1996 and three and a half times the 1995 total, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. In the first two months of 1998, the trend continued, with an additional $11 billion flowing in, up 14 percent from the corresponding period last year.
Unit trusts are by no means new; they have been around at least as long as mutual funds and are regulated under the same Federal laws. And like their fund cousins, they have been transformed by Wall Street's marketing gurus from a sleepy backwater of slow-and-steady bond investing into a fast-paced forum for speculating in stocks.
Whether most investors should buy in, however, is a complex issue. Much of the fervor, trumpeted in electronic chat rooms dedicated to market topics, seems to come from those who have mistaken an uninterrupted bull market for their own investment brilliance.
Many investment professionals agree that unit trusts make a world of sense for some people -- among them, those who want to invest for a fixed time and who do not feel comfortable picking stocks themselves. The low annual expenses of some trusts -- in some cases, less than a quarter of the cost of the average mutual fund -- earn them grudging respect even from executives at the Vanguard Group, the king of low-cost index funds. But for other investors, including those who focus primarily on long-term investment goals, there are cheaper, more effective alternatives.
Moreover, many unanswered questions remain about unit investment trusts, including how the most popular ones will perform in a market downturn. While that issue looms for all types of funds, it is aggravated for Diamonds, Spiders and the like by the volatility of their trading patterns. In addition, there is far less oversight of unit trusts than of mutual funds.
A minimum of checks and balances may have made sense not so long ago. Historically, the structure of unit investment trusts -- they generally are prohibited, for example, from replacing a security in the portfolio -- made the products most popular as a way to invest in bonds. And municipal bonds, most often bought and held until maturity, proved particularly appropriate.
Indeed, trusts investing in tax-free bonds still held about 40 percent of the estimated $97 billion in assets in unit investment trusts at the end of 1997. But that share had fallen by more than half, from 87 percent of trust assets, since the end of 1990.
The percentage of assets in equity trusts has soared, meanwhile, to roughly half the total. More than 97 percent of the new money that flowed into unit trusts in the first two months of this year went into equity portfolios, as did 93 percent of last year's flows, according to the Investment Company Institute.
 
On the Amex, a Breed Apart
 As with mutual funds, much of that money is headed into trusts that track popular stock market indexes. Strategic Insight, a New York investment management research firm, estimates that individual investors poured about as much new money into index-tracking unit trusts last year as they invested in index mutual funds -- roughly $30 billion.
The Strategic Insight figures include money that flowed into trusts that invest in only a portion of an index, like the popular portfolios that buy the highest-yielding stocks in the Dow industrials -- a group often referred to as the "Dogs of the Dow."
But the biggest portion of the index-trust money has gone into a handful of unit trusts that trade on the American exchange and have names that seem drawn from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
There are Diamonds, which track the Dow industrials; Spiders, which track the S.& P. 500 (phonetically, their name is an acronym for Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts, or S.P.D.R.'s); Midcap Spiders, which track the S.& P. Midcap 400 index, and Webs, which track Morgan Stanley's world equity benchmark indexes. Combined, the four products account for about one out of every six shares traded each day on the Amex.
These Amex unit trusts are a breed apart from the traditional unit trust. Most trusts are set up by brokerage firms, which pick a portfolio of stocks reflecting a specific objective or theme and then sell shares to interested investors on the understanding that their money will be put to work beginning on a certain date. On that date, the sponsor buys a set amount of each of the stocks, which it holds for a defined period, usually one year but sometimes longer.
Investors in traditional trusts usually pay a sales fee, or load, of 3 to 6 percent for their initial purchase. Beyond that, annual expenses are usually quite low -- usually less than one-third of 1 percent of the trust's assets -- because the sponsor has little to do. Stocks are replaced only for big events, like an acquisition or bankruptcy. Investors can cash out any time for the net asset value of their shares, and new investors can usually buy only shares that have been redeemed.
The Amex-sponsored trusts, by contrast, were created for the purpose of trading. As with mutual funds, an infinite number of shares can be created and sold, and securities in their portfolios can be replaced when a company is deleted or added to the underlying index.
The Amex-traded trusts also let investors do many things that investors in index mutual funds cannot, like shorting the index, just as one would sell a stock short, or buying on margin. And the trusts can be traded at any time during the market day, at the going price; mutual funds, by contrast, are offered and redeemed just once a day, at the fund's closing net asset value.
These attributes have proved popular not only with individuals, but also with all types of institutional investors, like mutual fund managers, corporate treasurers and even foreign governments, many of which use the Spiders and other trusts to manage cash reserves while staying invested in the market. They are especially useful tools for institutions, like pension funds, that are not allowed to use futures to achieve the same ends. In March, for example, the Government of Singapore disclosed that it owned 3.5 million Spider units, worth $393 million and representing 8.3 percent of the total units outstanding at the time.
Keeping spare cash invested in the market, so as not to miss out on any of its seemingly continual rise, was the very reason that the Motley Fool, an on-line investment forum geared to individual investors, began early this year to invest a portion of its primary portfolio in Spiders.
"We don't try to make market calls," wrote the Motley Fool investment analysts in explaining the decision. But if they cannot find enough stocks that they think will beat the market, "for the time being we want to be in the market as a whole through the S.& P."
And while no one knows how stocks will perform, the analysts wrote, "the way to conquer that disadvantage is to always own them."
 
A Speculation Tool
That logic made sense to Derek Banducci, 21, a junior studying economics and philosophy at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., who monitors the Motley Fool Web site for help in investing the money he has saved for college.
"My basic assumption is that the market as a whole is going to be going up," Mr. Banducci said. Therefore, he has bought Spiders for both his "conservative" portfolio -- the money given to him by relatives to pay for college -- and, using borrowed money, or margin, for his "aggressive" portfolio, which includes money saved from his summer jobs.
"It's turned out pretty well for me," Mr. Banducci said. "The only risk is that over the long run, I know stocks have averaged a 10 percent return, and I'm paying margin interest of 9 percent. But looking over the past five years, the S.& P. is up significantly more. So I should be able to easily beat what I'm paying for the margin loan."
Market speculators like Mr. Banducci are aggressively trading in and out of Spiders and their kind. Last year, trading volume in Spiders totaled 14 times the number of shares outstanding. By comparison, of the 10 most actively traded stocks on the American exchange last year, only one traded more than four times its available shares.
Vanguard and other mutual fund companies whose index funds might have appealed to such investors just a year or two ago say they are happy to see market speculators investing in the trusts.
Frequent trading forces an index fund to buy and sell more shares of the indexed stocks. That, in turn, raises the fund's expenses, which causes it to lag behind the benchmark. So Vanguard, among others, takes steps to discourage such trading, like requiring written notice of an exchange in or out of its index funds and not allowing investors to make more than two round trips in and out of an index fund each year.
Of course, the flexibility of unit trusts has a cost. While the Amex trusts have very low continuing expenses, investors must pay a brokerage commission to buy or sell them, as they would with a stock -- commissions that can build up quickly if an account is actively traded.
Nor are the prices of the trusts as predictable as investors might expect. Though each Spider, for instance, represents one-tenth the value of the S.& P. 500, it does not automatically trade at that price. Instead, the Spiders sell for what another investor is willing to pay, which often is less than their theoretical value -- particularly when many investors are trying to sell.
Consider last Oct. 27, when stock prices fell more than 7 percent, their worst slump since 1987. The S.& P. 500 closed at 876.98, slightly above its lowest value for the day, 876.73. One might assume that Spiders would have fallen as low as $87.67 that day and closed at $87.70. In fact, they fell nearly a dollar lower, to $86.84, and closed at $87.19, about 50 cents below the index equivalent.
The next day, the stock market declined sharply at the opening bell before making a remarkable reversal and soaring upward. And the discrepancies between the value of the Spiders and the S.& P. 500 were even greater than they were the day before. Spiders traded as low as $84.38, or $1.15 below the lowest equivalent value of the index, and bounced as high as $92.88, or 57 cents above the index's peak.
The differences stem from the fact that Spiders trade through a specialist on the exchange, whose job is to match buy and sell orders and to step in, trading for his own account, to keep the market orderly. But he is not obliged to guarantee that a trust tracks its index on a wild day.
"The specialist's job in those situations is to look at a market that is moving rapidly and determine where it is going," said Michael T. Bickford, a senior vice president for derivatives marketing and research at the Amex. "Sometimes the last sale is not indicative of where those indexes are headed. On those days, and any day like them, you're absolutely going to see larger-than-normal differences from the index."
Mr. Bickford added that the exchange had had no complaints about the trading of Spiders shares last October. "It was as stern a test as we have had since the events of 1987, and I think the specialists distinguished themselves," he said. Officials of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, the specialist responsible for the trading of Spiders and Diamonds, declined to comment.
 
A Recipe for Trouble?
George U. Sauter, who oversees stock-index funds for Vanguard, is among those who say such pricing discrepancies in times of high volatility could one day cause problems for individual investors in unit trusts.
"I think that in a market break, if the pressure gets pretty severe, the specialist could get mowed down," Mr. Sauter said. "I think you will see the shares going to a big discount because the specialist won't be able to keep up."
Not so, pledge officials of the American exchange. Institutional investors will step in quickly to buy large volumes of the underpriced asset -- either the unit trust or the individual stocks in the index it tracks -- and sell short the overpriced asset, said Joseph B. Stefanelli, the exchange's executive vice president for derivative securities. The opportunity to lock in the resulting profits will cause the two values to return to equilibrium, he said, and so the Amex expects that Spiders and Diamonds "will never sell at a big discount or premium."
If the exchange is wrong, the risks will likely be greater for small individual investors, who are virtually the entire market for Diamond shares. The institutions that the American exchange is counting on to restore equilibrium to the unit trusts use the S.& P. 500 as the benchmark for their portfolio performance and hence are big traders of Spiders, not Diamonds.
Witness the difference in trading volume of the two trusts. Last Monday, for example, when the stock market dropped nearly 2 percent, 14.5 million Spider shares changed hands on the Amex, compared with only 1.9 million Diamonds. Spiders trade an average of more than five million shares a day, roughly 10 times the average daily volume of Diamonds.
The liquidity picture could become even worse if individual investors abandon the market in a steep downturn. Unlike Spiders, which began trading in 1993, Diamonds began trading on Jan. 20 and have yet to experience a volatile session like those of last October.
Further confusion could arise for individuals and institutions alike if a market drop triggers the market's newly approved circuit breakers. Mr. Stefanelli said that under current plans, futures exchanges might be closed while stock markets continued to trade. That could shift waves of trading from the futures markets to the Spiders and similar securities, "which could be dangerous for our floor and our customers," Mr. Stefanelli said.
"We haven't made a definite decision about what to do in that case, but we would consider closing down the Spiders," he added.
But in general, the American Stock Exchange wants to expand the success of its Spiders and Diamonds, Mr. Stefanelli said. "We do not trade options on the trusts at this moment, but we'd like to do so, and we're investigating whether we can," he said. In addition, the exchange would like to introduce products that track more specialized indexes, like a small-cap index or one measuring the performance of a particular industry, like technology.
And why not? The Amex makes a few pennies on each transaction, and "the volume adds up," Mr. Stefanelli said, though he declined to offer details on revenues and profits.
One big question for investors is whether the Amex is keeping close enough tabs on all the parties involved in its unit trusts.
Until hearing the news from a reporter, Mr. Stefanelli acknowledged that he was unaware, for example, that the Denver broker-dealer appointed last December as the official distributor of the Spider and Diamond contracts had to correct a net capital deficiency eight days after it was awarded the business.
The firm, Alps Mutual Fund Services, also acts as the de facto underwriter of the trusts, transmitting orders from institutional investors to create Diamond and Spider units, maintaining certain records and taking responsibility for some regulatory compliance functions. Edmund J. Burke, a senior vice president at Alps, said the company was now in compliance with capital requirements, which were established by regulators to insure that securities firms could meet the demands of their customers' business.
It is unlikely that investors were endangered by the capital deficiency of Alps; its role is different than if it were the underwriter of stocks or mutual funds, when its own capital would be at risk.
More obvious risk factors lurk in the traditional unit trusts sold by brokerage firms. Primary among them is that the trusts are open to the same vagaries of stock-picking as any mutual fund -- with the important difference that they cannot replace a poorly performing security with a better one.
Investors should also be aware that, unlike the returns of exchange-traded trusts, the performance of trusts sold by brokerage firms often can be tracked only by contacting the brokerage firm itself.
And most unit trusts are watched far less closely than are mutual funds. Kathleen H. Moriarty, a partner at Carter Ledyard & Milburn, a New York law firm, noted that unlike mutual funds, unit trusts have no directors whose duty it is to protect the interest of shareholders.
There are, of course, unit trusts that make investing sense and investors who should consider buying them. An investor inclined to work with a full-service broker may find them a low-cost alternative to broker-sold mutual funds or the commissions on trading individual stocks, said Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight.
"I think the day that most investors want to sell 1,000 shares of this and buy 1,000 shares of something else are rapidly coming to an end," added Robert E. Holley, a senior vice president at Paine Webber and director of its unit trust department.
Trusts can have minimum investments as low as $250, one-fourth or less the minimum for many mutual funds. But an investor in a trust like Merrill Lynch's Premier American Portfolio, which invests in a group of 36 name-brand stocks, would end up paying the equivalent of a 5.35 percent load in the four years over which the trust extends.
These days, investors are likely to find little to attract them to a traditional municipal bond unit trust. With interest rates low, brokerage firms and investors have found that it takes incredible performance for the bonds in a trust to overcome the typical sales charge of several percentage points.
So for now, the old-fashioned trusts have lost out in investors' minds to trusts that can be used to try to time the market. But investors are likely to discover that timing strategies in general can be a losing game.
"Most times investors fail to do it correctly," Mr. Nachmany said, "especially in a market that goes up all the time."

Unit investment trusts: The name is a mouthful, but investors are having no trouble spitting out buy orders to their brokers. The trusts are Wall Street's hottest product, drawing $38 billion from investors last year, triple the amount of two years earlier. By investing in a fixed portfolio of securities for a defined length of time, the trusts keep costs low. But they usually carry a sales fee that can eat deeply into returns.
 
DOGS OF THE DOW
Some of the most popular unit investment trusts buy the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average each year, pursuing the so-called Dogs of the Dow theory. Since 1973, that strategy has out-performed the Dow index by about five percentage points a year. But it has lagged behind the index in three of the last four years -- per-haps because so many investors have started to invest in the Dogs.
 
DIAMONDS
Diamonds are shares in a unit trust that tracks the Dow Jones indus-trial average; the shares trade on the American Stock Exchange. Diamonds are highly popular with individuals, who seem to be using them as a simple tool for making broad bets on the direction of the market. Institutional investors are far more attracted to Spiders.
 
WEBS
A variety of world equity benchmark shares, or Webs for short, track the 17 foreign stock market indexes maintained by Morgan Stanley. With fewer than 100,000 shares of most of the securities changing hands each day, investors could have trouble finding buyers. But the Webs offer access to some markets for which there are few comparable investments.
 
SPIDERS
Shorthand for Standard & Poor's depositary receipts, Spiders are essentially an S.& P.-500 index fund that trades like a stock on the American Stock Exchange. But the shares do not track the index exactly. Instead, they act much like a futures contract, often hitting higher highs and lower lows during volatile trading sessions.

"Whom Do You Trust?"
Unit trusts charge low annual fees, but their sales charges can make them more expensive than no-load funds with similar objectives. The performance of unit trusts, meanwhile, can closely track or vary widely from the performance of similar mutual funds, as shown below. Returns shown are for periods over which both the trust and the similar fund have been available.
 
"Not Quite Tracking the Market"
When the market is in turmoil, Spiders and other exchange-traded unit trusts can prove more volatile than the indexes they are supposed to track. That was the case for Spiders last Oct. 27 and 28, when the market dived 7 percent and then rebounded in the most tumultuous trading since the 1987 crash.
 
Near the end of trading on Monday, the S. & P. 500 dipped to 876.73 before closing at 876.98. But the Spiders fell farther, trading for as little as $86.84 and closing at $87.19, about 50 cents below its index equivalent. (Spiders are designed to represent one-tenth the value of the index.)
 
When the market opened even weaker the next day, the S. & P. 500 tumbled to 855.27, but the Spiders fell as low as $84.38, or about $1.15 below what the index indicated.
 
And as the market recovered, the Spiders' volatility drove them as high as $92.88, or 57 cents above the index's peak of 923.09.

HEADLINE: The Last-Chance Season

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
BY the eighth inning of this season's opening game, in a muddy park in East New York, Brooklyn, Misael Quiroz's fingers were weak and numb with cold. The players on the benches were shivering in the icy drizzle, and about a dozen fans -- mostly their wives and girlfriends -- watched from the stands, hunched into parkas or blankets. A few players, trying to get warm, bounced up and down like children on Pogo sticks. But Misael, 21, did not suggest calling the game, and neither did anybody else, not even jokingly. On both teams, each player was intensely focused on the game, each as serious as if they had, after all, made it to the major leagues.
Misael pitches for the New York Yankees. Not the New York Yankees of the American League, but the New York Yankees of the Pedrin Zorilla League, a group of eight teams of Hispanic players, most, like Misael, from the Dominican Republic. Hispanic leagues have been playing in city parks for at least 50 years, said the Zorilla league's president, Vidal Maldonado. Their games often draw hundreds of spectators, the most ardent from the Dominican Republic. 
 In recent years, the island has become a factory for Major League Baseball, with academies that turn out hundreds of young, talented players who can usually be signed for much less than American-born players. The number of Dominican players in the majors has grown to 111 from 12 in 1968. A few make it to the very top, like Pedro Martinez, the Boston Red Sox pitcher with a six-year, $75 million contract, and Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs outfielder with a $42.5 million, four-year deal.
But for each Dominican player who makes it to the major leagues, scores -- if not hundreds -- of others never get past the farm teams. The major league clubs do not keep track of the numbers. Nor do they offer advice or job counseling for the newly released players. They just give them a one-way ticket home. But rather than return, defeated, to the stark poverty and scant opportunities of their homeland, many exchange their tickets for one to New York. They settle in the Dominican neighborhoods, especially Washington Heights, working at menial jobs and playing ball on weekends.
"There are more and more Dominican ballplayers coming here," said Julio Pabon, the president of Latino Sports Ventures Inc., a sports marketing company in the Bronx. "It's a new frontier. Players are on their own." And often they cling to only one hope: to catch the eye of a big-league scout who will give them a last chance.
"We get them out of the minor leagues," Jose (Cano) Ramos, a postal worker who lives in the South Bronx and is the manager and coach of the Zorillan League's Yankees, said of his players, nearly all of whom are Dominican. "They are cut out, they feel isolated. They want to be with other players. They come here and see their friends. We put them back in the game. You never know."
Only three months ago, Misael was in his second season pitching for a Pittsburgh Pirates farm team in central Florida. But then came the tersely worded letter that told him his life's dream -- the one that he had worked toward so single-mindedly and that had seemed so close -- was denied. He would not be a big-league pitcher.
The exact words have blurred, but the sickening feelings remain all too vivid. "I felt cold in my stomach," he said. "I thought I was progressing well. I loved it. It was my life."
As a child, Misael had played outfield. But his pitching is what drew the attention of the Pittsburgh Pirates scout's attention and a place in the big-league team's academy in the Dominican Republic. There, he got food, a bed, coaching and a bit of instruction in English and American customs. Within two years, he was among the one out of 10 boys signed to a Pirates farm team. His signing bonus was less than $5,000, or a quarter of what most American players get.
The day before he left home, his mother, two sisters and neighbors gathered to pray for him. "They were asking God to make things go well for me," Misael said in Spanish. "There were a lot of emotions. My mother was happy and sad. I am her only son."
But things did not go well in Bradenton, Fla. English bewildered him and the strange food made him sick. The first month, he lost 20 pounds. But, he said, he still practiced for hours each day with the other rookies. "I practiced my curve," he said. "My pitching was good."
But not good enough. A Pirates coach, Pablo Cruz, said Misael's fastest pitch was clocked at 89 miles an hour. For a shot at the big leagues, he needed at least 92 miles an hour. "He's a good boy, a super boy," Mr. Cruz said. "He comes from a good family. He's got a loose arm, a strong arm. He worked as hard as anybody. But the fastball is not fast enough."
Mr. Quiroz was in Santo Domingo visiting his family when the letter arrived. "I was depressed," he said. "I did not eat. I did not go out. I could not go to the field anymore."
His reaction is common among Dominican farm-team players, who have devoted their lives to baseball, said Mr. Pabon, the Hispanic sports marketer.
"They feel totally lost and rejected," he went on. They feel their lives have been a waste. Everything they have dreamed of, struggled for, is totally lost. They feel embarrassed -- so embarrassed they won't go home."
Misael gave away his Pirates cap and glove. He fled to New York, to live with the only friend he had in the city, and got a $6.25-an-hour job washing dishes at the Silvio Claridad restaurant in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx. He wanted to get as far as he could from anything that reminded him of baseball. The mere thought of it shamed him. But escape was not so easy. It seemed that everywhere he turned he ran into other players from the Dominican Republic who, like him, had not made the grade. His friend's roommate, now Misael's roommate too, introduced him to Mr. Ramos, who persuaded him to pitch for the Yankees of East New York.
"They are friends," Misael said. "There is a lot of talent on the team. My arm feels ry good. If I dedicate myself, if I get another opportunity, I think I can make it."
 
Bodgea Owner, Sponsor And Second Baseman
 In the early 1980's, corporations looking to court Hispanic customers, like Goya Foods and Bustello Coffee, sponsored 27 Hispanic baseball leagues in New York, Mr. Maldonado said. The Federation of Hispanic Leagues set the rules and scheduled playoffs. But by the late 80's, corporate donations dried up and the federation disbanded. Today, the remaining leagues are grass-roots organizations that are run independently. They return year after year to the same fields, in East New York, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, Crotona Park in the Bronx and Central Park in Manhattan.
On the cold, drizzly opening Sunday, Domingo Bonilla is, as usual, covering second base for the Yankees. The owner of a Brooklyn bodega, he is also the team's sponsor, a dual role that helps fulfill his own long-held dream. As a child in Santo Domingo, he said, he yearned to play baseball but had to work in a grocery store to help support his family. "I lost my chance to be a pro," he said. Now he, his wife and two daughters live above the bodega in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and above them are tiny rooms -- large enough for only a bed and a chest of drawers -- that he rents to Dominicans who have been released from the minor leagues.
Mr. Bonilla says he spends about $18,000 a year to support the Yankees: $3,000 for bats and balls; $3,500 for 22 uniforms; an untotaled amount for after-game beer and dinner; $50 and $100 bills to reward the team's best players, and $2,000 to the Pedrin Zorilla league, which goes toward an end-of-season prize for the championship team: a trip to the Dominican Republic to play its baseball teams.
"I am not supposed to be spending the money," he said. "I should be spending it on my family. But I love it."
Up in the bleachers -- and despite the rain, in a suit and tie -- Alex Mendez, the sponsor of Alex Travel, the Yankees' opponents, watches intently. Although he too grew up in Santo Domingo, his boyhood dreams were not those of most Dominican boys. "I used to put a telephone on a desk, pretending I was a boss," he said. Now he prepares tax returns and owns Alex Travel, an East New York agency that books flights for Dominicans.
"I wanted to give back to the community," Mr. Mendez said, explaining why he spends $12,000 a year on the Alex Travel team. "And it is more publicity for the business." Unlike Mr. Bonilla, Mr. Mendez does not deal directly with the players. "I trust in my manager," he said. "I own the team because it feels good. I see a hat on my players and I feel proud."
 
Shortstop Carried Carpets On Opening Day
Jose Santana, the Yankee shortstop, could not take the field on the bone-chilling Sunday of his team's season opener. Instead, he went about grimly rolling, carrying and delivering rugs at ABC Carpet in Manhattan. At $6.50 an hour, it is not a bad job. And not only does he need to support himself but also to send $100 a month to his mother. But missing the game bothered him a lot. "Baseball is baseball and I love baseball," he said. "This is my profession. This is all I know how to do."
In Santo Domingo, Jose was accepted into the academy run by the Houston Astros. "Everybody told me: 'Santana, you can play baseball. Santana, you can make it.' " he said. "I got confident." He played for Astros farm teams in Orlando, Fla., then in Iowa.
"Nobody -- white or Hispanic -- ever worked as hard as Jose," said one of his farm-team coaches, Mike Rojas. "I put him into games just to reward his hard work."
But, again, it was not enough. Jose said Iowa's cold and the long absence from his mother dispirited him, He injured his right knee, which was operated on. When he tried to play again, he said, the knee still hurt. In 1994, the Astros let him go.
Many farm-team players are knocked out of the running by relatively minor injuries, said Roger Angell, the New Yorker baseball writer. The path from minor to major is a "Darwinian triangle," he said. "It eliminates the ones who can't keep up. The truth is, you really can't afford to be injured if you're a marginal player."
Jose said he decided to travel to New York "to make money," and to move to Brooklyn, where he has relatives. A friend introduced him to Mr. Bonilla, who offered him a bed, a job in his bodega and a spot on the Yankees. After four years, he still harbors hopes that a big-league scout will pick him out and give him another chance. "Everybody knows I can play," he said. 'Everybody says: 'What happened, Santana?' I think about it. I should try to come back, but I need connections."
During the week, delivering carpeting, he says he feels haunted by his old dreams. But on weekends, he and his teammates can one again sweat and strain and once again experience the unity and exhilaration of belonging, of playing the game.
"It's guys together, being in teams, with the rituals, habits, stories," Mr. Angell said. "La vida, the life. Old players never forget. When they talk about stuff in the past, they immediately talk in the present tense: 'I'm on first . . .' No association could be closer or tighter than baseball. Once you're in it, you're always a member."

Chart: "ROSTER: Different Routes to the Diamond"
The Pedrin Zorilla Baseball League was founded in 1956 in Brooklyn, its president, Vidal Maldonado, said. It was named for Mr. Zorilla, a third-baseman who played on teams in Puerto Rico in the 40's and 50's. Mr. Maldonado said Mr. Zorilla was talented enough for the major leagues but that he was discriminated against because he was a dark-skinned Hispanic player. Since 1957, the league's has been playing in a park at Fountain and Atlantic Avenues in East New York. Mr. Maldonado said they hoped to persuade the Department of Parks and Recreation to name the park for Mr. Zorilla. These are the league's eight teams, their managers and their day jobs:
 
Valdez Travel -- Edward Hodge, insurance agent, East New York.
Alex Travel -- Guillermo de los Santos, assistant bank manager, Bushwick, Brooklyn.
New York Yankees -- Jose (Cano) Ramos, postal worker, South Bronx.
New York Mets -- Omar Fonteboa, Columbia University psychology student, Elmhurst, Queens.
The Finest (Patrolmen's Benevolent Association) -- Ron Jacklin, police officer, Borough Park, Brooklyn.
Philadelphia Phillies -- Ivan Pol, car-service driver, Washington Heights.
Cepeda Blue Jays -- Luis Garrigas, unemployed, Park Slope, Brooklyn.
Cleveland Indians -- George Abreu, women's clothing factory foreman, South Bronx.

Unlearning the Lessons of Econ 101

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
THERE it goes again. Just when economists were wisely preparing a fat and happy America to face the inevitable unpleasant fallout from last summer's Asian financial crisis, the Government reported last week that things are going better than ever. Inflation is more or less gone. Jobs keep going up and growth continues.
That's been the story of the current economic boom, one of the longest and healthiest in American history. It has confounded everybody, not least of all the folks who are supposed to know what's going to happen and when to expect it: professional economists. Economic tenets, taught half a generation ago as immutable laws, are turning out not to be true. 
 Not all of them, of course. The vast bulk of mainstream economic theory has held up fine. Trade can make everybody better off. Free markets usually work best. High tax rates undermine incentives to work. The bedevilment is in the details.
Here are five economic principles, some called laws, others merely rules of thumb, that seem to have broken down:
 
Low unemployment = High inflation
Since 1960, the famous Phillips Curve posits that there can be low inflation or low unemployment, but not at the same time -- at least for long.
But so far in the 1990's, unemployment and inflation have not only been marching in the same direction -- south -- but they are now at their lowest levels in a generation. After seven years of economic expansion, unemployment dropped below 5 percent last fall for the first time since the early 70's.
Instead of accelerating, inflation has slowed even more. In the quarter that ended in March, the Government's broadest measure of inflation rose at an annual rate of less than 1 percent, the slowest rate since 1964.
What gives? Most economists agree with the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, who says the economy has a "natural" rate of unemployment, below which inflation accelerates, and above which inflation decelerates. Until recently, economists thought this natural rate was about 6.0 to 6.5 percent. It could be that the natural rate, which is affected by changes in demography, education and labor market institutions, has fallen sharply, perhaps to 5 percent, some economists say.
One intriguing explanation is offered by the Princeton economist Robert Shimer, who says, "The U.S. employment rate is so much lower because the population is so much older." Teen-agers have an unemployment rate roughly five times that of adult workers, the thinking goes, and the declining number of teen-age workers is enough to pull down the overall unemployment rate to its current low level.
Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, points to possibly temporary factors -- including falling computer prices, the strong dollar, the shift to managed health care and more accurate measurements of consumer prices -- to account for the unexpectedly low inflation rate of the late 90's.
 
Shrinking deficits = Slower growth
Ever since President Herbert Hoover made the Depression worse by trying to balance the budget as the economy was failing, deficit reduction has been widely held to be a drag on economic growth.
But growth has been stronger in the 1990's despite Washington's shift toward fiscal prudence. The Federal budget deficit, nearly $200 billion in 1992 and heading higher, is now effectively zero. Meanwhile, growth in the past eight quarters has averaged 3.8 percent.
The Government's most recent economic report drove the point home even more dramatically: In the first quarter, as Federal spending fell at an annual rate of $8 billion, the economy sprinted ahead at a 4.2 percent annual rate.
Today economists are more apt to claim, as the former Clinton economic adviser and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder did last year, that deficit cutting can lift the economy by encouraging lower interest rates and more capital spending. Proof of the turnaround in thinking can be found in the 1998 edition of Paul Samuelson's classic introductory economics textbook, which asserts, "a large public debt is likely to reduce long-term economic growth."
 
Rapid money growth = Higher inflation
Mr. Friedman's famous dictum that "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," -- meaning that inflation is caused by the Government's decision to print too much money -- is in no danger of becoming obsolete. Nonetheless, the historical link between the nation's money supply and inflation has all but collapsed. The money supply jumped sharply in the mid-1990's, yet no acceleration of inflation followed.
In the early 80's, the German, American and Canadian central banks adopted targets for money growth. But that experiment had barely begun when new financial innovations -- everything from money market accounts to electronic money transfers -- produced gyrations that all but rendered the money supply useless as a target for controlling inflation.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made it official in 1993, announcing that he was no longer paying attention to the money supply -- even though the Fed is still required by law to publish monetary growth targets.
 
World growth = Higher oil prices
Since energy stokes the machinery that drives the global economy, it seems perfectly reasonable to expect oil prices to rise during periods of economic growth.
Much of the global economy is growing now. But the price of a barrel of oil, if one takes inflation and changes in the value of the dollar into account, is about the same as it was on the eve of the Arab oil embargo of 1973 (around $3 in 1973 dollars). "It's definitely a surprise," says Geoffrey Heal, an economist at the Columbia Business School: "The conventional wisdom is that growth pushes up commodity prices."
What happened to the forecasts of $20 a barrel oil? Three things. Despite the proliferation of four-wheel-drive vehicles and outsized family homes, average energy efficiency is way up. Second, the spreading recession in Asia, a heavy user of oil, has cut into demand. But the main reason for low prices is a flood of new oil supplies. Not only is Iraq back in business, but hardly a day goes by without an announcement from another former Soviet republic of a pipeline project.
 
Stock prices = Earnings expectations
The value of stocks has quadrupled in the past six years, adding a staggering $1 trillion to household balance sheets in the last three months alone. Share prices are so high, in fact, that almost all measures of valuation are at record levels (and these records go back in some case to 1871). The rule of thumb is that when prices step out of the bounds of historical norms, investors had better watch out.
Some experts argue that the old rules no longer apply. Stock prices reflect the riskiness as well as the expected future returns of the investment. Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School, argues that stocks aren't as risky in the long run as everybody always thought they were, compared to low-risk investments like bonds. Since 1871, stocks have risen more than twice as fast as bonds -- 7.0 percent a year versus 2.8 when adjusted for inflation.
Thus, Mr. Siegel says, people are smart to pay a lot for the fast-growing stocks of the present bull market. There is some evidence, from surveys as well as the investment choices of participants in large retirement funds, that investor attitudes have indeed changed.
If Mr. Siegel is correct, the fact that today's share prices are historically high in comparison to companies' earnings doesn't necessarily mean stocks are overvalued.
But the Yale economist Robert Shiller cautions that the same "new era" claims were being made during another huge run-up in the stock market. He quotes a fellow Yale economist, Irving Fisher, who said in 1929 that, "It was only as the public came to realize . . . that stocks were to be preferred to bonds . . . that the bull market began in good earnest to cause a proper valuation of common shares."

THE PRINCIPLE
 The Phillips curve depicts the relationship between unemployment and inflation. The red wage-change scale on the right-hand vertical axis is higher than the black left-hand inflation scale by the assumed 2 percent rate of growth of average labor productivity
 The key assumption here is that inflation and unemployment are inversely related. This means that more unemployment is required if you want to hold down inflation

To the Editor:
Re "First Lessons in the Power of Money" (April 12), which looked at efforts to teach economics in primary and secondary schools: 
 As a college professor, I am well aware of the paucity of economics training for young people. Yet the economics curriculums described seem less like education than like one-sided indoctrination.
Consider, for example, one of the 20 principles from the National Council on Economic Education, an organization started by business leaders. It basically says that when people and countries concentrate on what they do best and cheapest, and then trade with others, a result is greater overall prosperity. This is false history and reflects the corporate view over any other consideration. The antebellum South did pretty well producing cotton, but one might wonder if overall prosperity was extended to slaves. Today, Indonesian workers might work cheaply and well for a big American corporation, but it is hardly clear that they have prospered.
With this kind of economics education, it is no wonder that ordinary Americans seem to submit as corporations and the elite few reap virtually all the gains from the last decades of economic growth. And no wonder I spend so much time stimulating real student debate about economic "principles" that pose as science but that are only justifications for power and inequality.

THE ECONOMY
Growth Without Inflation
Instead of slowing down because of Asia's recession, the American economy has picked up speed. It grew at an unexpectedly strong 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from a 3.7 percent rate the previous quarter. And the broadest measure of inflation, instead of drifting higher as Washington and Wall Street had feared, dipped below 1 percent, to its lowest rate since 1964. "We keep expecting a slowdown and it never comes," said Jeffrey A. Frankel of the Council of Economic Advisers, citing instead "a remarkable combination of strong growth without inflation." But consumers see no slowdown. The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index approached a three-decade high, rebounding to 136.7 in April, from 133.8 in March. 

MARKETS
Battered, Then Buoyant
Displaying the stability of a windsock, the stock market soared on the buoyant economic news. The Dow Jones industrial average tacked on more than 100 points on Thursday, its second consecutive day of gains, and erased the vestiges of its 146.98-point tumble on Monday. That plunge followed a report that the Federal Reserve had adopted a bias favoring higher interest rates -- a report that some in Washington viewed as having been planted by the Fed itself as a signal to investors. But the latest economic data largely erased any lingering fears of a rate increase soon, and the yield on the long bond fell back below 6 percent. The Dow average ended the week up 82.45, at 9,147.07, while the Nasdaq composite index edged up 4.48, to close at 1,873.44.
 
SOCIAL SECURITY
Doomsday Delayed
Young adults have been given a reprieve -- three more years to hone their survivalist skills, learning to prepare meals of berries and bark, say, or build shelter from tender young saplings. Thanks to the nation's booming economy, the Administration reported, the Social Security system's solvency has been extended by three years from the date projected last year, 2029. Even with the new projections, Social Security would be able to pay only three-quarters of promised benefits after the system exhausts its reserves in 2032. The Government reported that Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, would remain financially sound until 2008.
 
DEALS
BMW Captures Rolls
Vickers P.L.C. formally accepted a $566 million takeover offer for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from BMW, subject only to shareholder approval. But BMW's German rival, Volkswagen, vowed to fight on, promising a sweeter price for Rolls, Britain's premier luxury-car maker. . . . United Airlines and Delta Air Lines agreed on a broad marketing alliance, subject to approval by pilots. The deal would link the airlines' frequent-flier programs, allow each carrier to sell seats on the other's flights and give United passengers access to 39 new cities and Delta passengers access to 17 more. . . . Lucent Technologies agreed to acquire Yurie Systems, a maker of devices to send data and video over the Internet, for $1 billion. . . . Times Mirror will sell its legal publishing business to the British-Dutch publishing giant Reed Elsevier for $1.65 billion in cash.
 
HEALTH CARE
Limits for Viagra
Fearing huge payouts to millions of American men, large insurers, including Wellpoint Health Networks and Cigna Healthcare, are adopting strict reimbursement policies for Viagra, Pfizer Inc.'s new pill for impotence. The insurers require proof of a medical cause for the problem, and Cigna will pay for only six pills a month. Kaiser Permanente plans a similiar policy. Since its introduction in late March, Viagra has had one of the most successful debuts in pharmaceutical history, with some 20,000 prescriptions written daily.
 
EUROPE
Locking Exchange Rates
The dollar, after reigning supreme in global finance for the better part of this century, will soon face a new rival that could prove much more powerful than the German mark or Japanese yen: a single European currency, the euro. This weekend, 11 of the European Union's 15 member nations -- those that have chosen to participate in the first stage of monetary union -- will lock their exchange rates together. "The euro has the potential to reshape European and international financial markets," the I.M.F. said, and to transform the world monetary system.
 
MICROSOFT
States Slam Windows
Attorneys general from 13 states are preparing a joint antitrust action against Microsoft, seeking to block the company's release in June of Windows 98, the next version of its ubiquitious operating system for personal computers. Several said they would rather act with the United States Department of Justice, which has been conducting its own antitrust investigation, but they fear that the Federal agency is acting too slowly. Any lawsuit would become much more complicated, they added, once the software goes on sale.
 
PEOPLE
Honda's New Driver
Honda's president and chief executive, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, will retire. An engineer, he led the company to record profits and market share in the United States and Japan over the last eight years, after making his mark in 1974 as a member of the team that designed the first engine to meet Federal clean air regulations without a catalytic converter. Mr. Kawamoto has infuriated Detroit executives by contending that global warming is a serious problem that the auto industry should address. He will be succeeded by Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's head of research and vehicle development and a close associate. . . . Mario J. Gabelli, the mutual fund manager, wants to sell part of his fund and investment empire to the public. But he plans to keep control of the company -- and, perhaps, many of his best investment ideas. . . . Pepsi-Cola, stung by the lagging performance of its flagship brand, said its chief global marketing officer, Brian Swette, would leave at the end of the month and would be replaced by a three-executive marketing council.
 
UTILITIES
Pollution Sale Halted
At the urging of New York State, the Long Island Lighting Company said it would stop selling, to polluters in the Midwest and South, pollution credits it earned by cleaning its own smokestacks. The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act established the marketplace trading of the right to pollute as an inexpensive way to clean up the environment. But as New York State and its neighbors have learned, the marketplace cannot stop the wind from blowing pollution eastward. . . . Texas Utilities won Energy Group P.L.C., one of Britain's last remaining independent utilities, after another American utility company, Pacificorp, said it would not try to beat a $7.4 billion bid. . . . Two fast-growing Nevada utilities, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Resources, agreed to a $1.2 billion merger.

HEADLINE: An Anniversary Brings Pride and Resentment

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: MADRID, N.M., April 28

 BODY:
Swords of Toledo steel sparkled in the sun, the red and gold banner of King Philip II flapped in the breeze, helmeted pikemen stood at attention. Everything was in place for Manuel Gullon de Onate, a nattily dressed lawyer from Madrid, Spain.
With a flourish, he pulled a covering from a bronze statue erected here, showing his ancestor, Don Juan de Onate, pointing north. On April 30, 1598, Onate and 500 colonists from Mexico crossed the Rio Grande at El Paso and embarked on a journey that ultimately established the first European settlements in the American West, predating the first permanent English settlement in the present United States, Jamestown in Virginia, by almost a decade. 
 The 400th anniversary of Onate's journey has inspired 185 events and projects in New Mexico, celebrating the state's Spanish roots, like the ceremony here in Madrid, about midway between Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
At a thanksgiving dinner last Saturday night in El Paso, attended by 2,000 people, Mr. Gullon, Vice President Francisco Alvarez-Cascos of Spain and other dignitaries were feted with 16th-century dishes. El Paso is constructing an Onate statue that is to be the nation's largest equestrian bronze.
The next day, Mr. Alvarez-Cascos reviewed plans for a Camino Real museum to be built with Spanish, American and Mexican money near Socorro, N.M. The Camino Real, an ox cart track by which the Spaniards reached the Southwest, stretched 1,800 miles, from Chihuahua, Mexico, to Santa Fe, N.M. And on June 1, Albuquerque, N.M., will begin construction of a $45 million complex that will be the nation's largest Hispanic cultural center.
But beneath all the festive pageantry and construction plans, many Hispanic residents in the Southwest express an irritation that the rest of the nation is largely ignoring their anniversary. It is evidence, they say, of an enduring "English-centric" view of America's past.
"We are saddled with the history that England was the mother country -- well, Spain was also a mother country," said Thomas E. Chavez, a 13th-generation Santa Fe resident who directs the musuem at the Palace of Governors, which was built in 1610 and is the oldest government structure in the United States.
Although anniversary organizers say they notified 1,200 media outlets in advance, coverage has been limited largely to reporters from New Mexico and Spain. Frank Ortiz, a retired diplomat and a descendant of an Onate-era colonist, called the response odd, considering that "Hispanics are the fastest growing community in America, and that by the year 2020, one out of four Americans will be of Hispanic origin."
Resentment over the English interpretation of American history also echoed at the Rancho de Golondrinas, a ranch museum here that traces its beginnings back to 1710, when it was built as a way station on the Camino Real, or Royal Road.
"Who wrote the history? The Anglos," complained Rosana Ubanell, Washington correspondent for the Spanish weekly magazine La Tribuna and one of a large contingent of Spanish reporters here. "My son is in the fourth grade in Virginia. Their history starts with the Mayflower."
While the anniversary may not have made much impact outside the Southwest, it seems to have furthered a centuries-overdue reconciliation between American Indians and Spain. In January, New Mexico's anniversary year got off to a fractious start when an Indian commando group sawed off the right foot of an Onate statue in Alcalde, about 40 miles north of here. The attack was in memory of an incident in 1599 when Onate punished the rebellious Acoma tribe by cutting the right feet off 24 captive warriors.
This winter, Indian opposition forced Albuquerque to abandon plans to erect an Onate statue. Instead, a city board voted recently to build a memorial highlighting Spain's positive contributions to North America -- the introduction of horses, cattle, sheep, fruit trees, irrigation, wheat and chilies.
Worried about possible protests by Pueblo Indians, the tribes conquered by the Spanish, state officials and Spanish diplomats negotiated a "reconciliation" ceremony. Last Sunday, most of the 19 Pueblo governors traveled to the pueblo that was the site of the first Spanish village here, San Juan de los Caballeros, or Oke Owingeh in the local language, Tewa.
"Settlement of New Mexico by the Spaniards caused great conflict and suffering among all our people," said Earl N. Salazar, governor of Oke Owingeh. In 1680, a man from this pueblo known only as Pope organized an uprising that killed many Spaniards and that drove the rest down to El Paso. Spain reconquered New Mexico 12 years later.
Neither side apologized for the past bloodletting.
"Our Pueblo religion, our Pueblo philosophy and way of life," said Roy Bernal, chairman of the All Indian Pueblo Council, call for "respect and compassion for all people and the responsibility of maintaining balance and harmony in our personal lives, for our people and as well as those all over the world."
Mr. Alvarez-Cascos, who represents Spain's new conservative Government, called for "a new and prosperous relationship between us," offering the possibility of Spanish economic development aid and of joint business ventures. Spain's Vice President pointed to 17th-century royal decrees that recognized Indian sovereignty and granted ceremonial silver-tipped canes, which are sacred objects that for almost 380 years have symbolized Pueblo sovereignty.
Away from the ceremonies, Spanish officials and reporters contrasted the impacts of Spanish and British colonialism on North America's Indians. While New England's vanished tribes are remembered largely as place names, New Mexico's Indians still speak their ancestral languages, practice their ancestral religions and live on their ancestral lands.
In a peacemaking move, New Mexico's Governor, Gary Johnson, held a private dinner at his house here on Monday night for the visiting Spanish dignitaries and Reginald T. Pasqual, governor of Acoma Pueblo. As the guests were departing, Mr. Pasqual turned to the Spaniards and invited them to visit Acoma.
"It was enormously moving," Mr. Gullon, the Onate descendant, said. "It was such a generous, open attitude. It seemed incredible after all that Juan de Onate did to his people -- the massacre, the feet."

HEADLINE: Promise and Pitfalls of the Euro

 BODY:
Eleven of the fifteen members of the European Union are preparing to discard their marks, liras, francs and other national currencies by 2002 in favor of a new currency, called the euro. Their goal is to boost economic growth and political ties. But the euro could backfire, trapping unlucky regions in recession and triggering political resentment when no authority comes to the rescue. Americans can hope that the brash policy works because prosperity in Europe helps the United States grow, even if the rise of the euro diminishes the international clout of the dollar.
By adopting the euro, every country in the European Union except Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece would create the kind of common currency in Europe that Americans take for granted with the dollar. The euro is likely to boost economic activity by cutting the cost of buying and selling. Rather than juggling 11 different yardsticks, consumers can instantly compare the price of goods in Finland, Italy and other countries in between. The euro also eliminates the risk for investors that exchange rates will fluctuate and sabotage long-term contracts. 
 But a single currency also poses risks, because it robs countries of control over their own economies. If the French economy takes a nose dive, the Government can pump in francs, devalue the franc or cut taxes and raise spending. But under the euro, France would have no francs to inject into the economy or to devalue and would operate under rules that severely limit deficit spending.
Unlike the United States, where citizens commonly move from one state to another in search of economic opportunity, Europeans are unlikely to migrate to countries with different languages, cultures and laws. If the French economy slows, and the European central bank does nothing because the rest of Europe is thriving, the French may be resentful. A policy designed to unify Europe could intensify divisions instead.
If the euro boosts the European economy, it will also boost America's. But to the extent that it replaces the dollar as the currency of international trade, it will also trim some real financial benefits that come from America's current role as the world's banker. But the threat is small. The best guess puts the loss at a few billion dollars a year, nothing to fret about in an $8 trillion economy.
A more amorphous threat is political. If managed properly, the euro could assume an international presence comparable to the dollar's. There would be pressure on the Europeans to create a political body able to manage the euro for international purposes, like the bailout of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand led by the United States. Some in the United States welcome the political evolution of the European Union as a way to lighten the United States' economic and political burdens. Others fear Europe's potential political clout. The impact of this momentous decision goes way beyond economics in unpredictable directions.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Sudan to End Restrictions on Food Airlift to South

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Warning of a "human catastrophe" in which hundreds of thousands of people face death by starvation, the Administration has agreed to provide tons of food for the southern Sudan and is trying to bring pressure on the Sudanese Government to lift its restrictions on the distribution of food and medicine.
Administration officials say the Sudanese Government appears to be willing to allow mass starvation in the southern half of the country as a way of punishing rebels there, a view widely shared by international aid organizations. 
 The Government in Khartoum has limited relief flights to the southern Sudan for most of the year, arguing that the region is too insecure to allow the food to be delivered.
"The U.S. Government is gravely concerned about the human catastrophe that is unfolding in southern Sudan," said J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International Development, in announcing this week that the United States would provide more than 7,000 tons of food to the Sudan, worth about $9.2 million.
"We strongly urge the Government of Sudan to carry out its obligations under international humanitarian law by affording full air access to the war-affected populations, including approval of additional aircraft to deliver food and non-food items to the region," he said.
Administration officials acknowledged that they had no way of guaranteeing that the food would reach the remote areas where it is needed most urgently.
"They've always played political games on this, and I think the Government has been fully prepared to let people starve," said Dick McCall, chief of staff to Mr. Atwood. "What is required now is for relief workers to have access to virtually every area of the region because people are too weak now even to walk to landing sites."
Since the early 1980's, rebel groups from the mostly Christian and animist southern states of the Sudan have been fighting successive Governments dominated by Arabs from the mostly Islamic north. The rebel groups are demanding greater autonomy for the south and the repeal of harsh Islamic laws.
As a result of the 1989 famine, the United Nations began an airlift operation from northern Kenya that has provided most of the medicine and relief food provided to the southern Sudan in recent years.
But in February, the Sudanese Government imposed a ban on relief flights in the region, citing fighting with rebel groups. The flight ban was lifted for 4 airstrips in late February and for 46 other airstrips earlier this month. But aid workers say that unless the ban is lifted for all airstrips in the area, tens of thousands of people may die.
While the Administration has protested to the Government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir over its handling of the food crrisis, the United States and other Western nations have little leverage there.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Seeds Are U.N.'s Priority
 NAIROBI, Kenya, May 2 (Reuters) -- The United Nations said today that it hoped famine in Sudan could be averted and that a priority for tens of thousands of farmers in the south was seed for this season's crop.
"We believe we have all the food we need to meet the immediate needs of the population of south Sudan," said Brenda Barton, a Kenyan-based information officer for the World Food Program, a United Nations agency.

HEADLINE: China Protests Tibet Movie At Festival in Washington

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
A movie about young Tibetans searching for fulfillment and success has angered the Government of China, which complained this week to organizers of a film festival that the movie was meant to smear Chinese policy.
The Chinese Embassy sent a letter on Thursday to the head of the Washington International Film Festival, asserting that the story depicted in the movie, "Windhorse," was "completely false" and demanding that it be withdrawn. 
 The festival's director, Tony Gittens, said on Friday that the commitment to the film would be honored. "We will stand firmly by our decision and we will not compromise our right of free cultural expression," Mr. Gittens said.
"Windhorse" was shown at the Kennedy Center here on Thursday night, and it was to be shown tonight at a downtown theater, also as part of the festival.
The Chinese Government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, an autonomous region in southwest China that was occupied more than 40 years ago. In his embassy's letter to Mr. Gittens, the Chinese Minister-Counselor for Cultural Affairs, Li Gang, said China's policies had helped Tibet achieve "remarkable economic growth and social progress."
The film's director, Paul Wagner, said on Friday that the film was shot in October 1996, partly in Tibet and partly in Nepal. The Tibetan scenes, in particular, were shot clandestinely, with a small digital video camera more like a tourist's than a movie maker's, to thwart Chinese security forces, Mr. Wagner said.
The film "is the Tibetans' own story, told with their own voices," Steven Schecter, the cinematographer, said on Friday. The movie, 97 minutes long and with English subtitles, deals with the torture of a Buddhist nun and her relatives' decision to defy Tibet's Communist rulers.
"Windhorse," whose name is derived from the prayer-inscribed pieces of paper that Tibetans traditionally throw from high mountains in religious homage, was named best American independent film at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in California in March. Mr. Wagner won that festival's best director award. Earlier, he produced award-winning documentaries.
Mr. Gittens said he had sent an advance copy of the film to the Chinese Embassy as a courtesy and had invited the embassy to send representatives to see the film at the festival. "I respect the opinions of the embassy officials, and I hope they will also respect mine," he said.
Now in its 12th year, the Washington film festival began on April 22 and will end on Sunday night. The event drew about 30,000 people to about 70 movies last year, said Bill Bronrott, a festival spokesman.
In 1996, the festival annoyed the Chinese by showing "The Gate of Heavenly Peace," about the 1989 Government crackdown in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Bronrott recalled.
Mr. Gittens, the festival director, added: "Each year we travel the globe to bring back the best in world cinema. The films are chosen because of their high quality and interest to our audience -- not because of any political position they might express."

HEADLINE: Albright Finds Unalloyed Love in a Newly Minted Democracy

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ULAAN BAATAR, Mongolia, May 2

 BODY:
After her difficult and often tendentious negotiations with Chinese leaders over everything from human rights and democratization to trade and Tibet, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright basked today in the attention of the plucky young democratic reformers of Mongolia.
"This is definitely a feel-good stop," said a senior American official. "They love us here." 
 A country of only 2.5 million people, 40 percent of them nomadic, Mongolia shed 70 years as a Soviet-occupied client state in 1991, embracing democracy and market reforms.
Relics of Soviet colonial power are everywhere here -- from the mini-mausoleum that dominates a grandiose public square to the 36 MiG jets abandoned when 60,000 Soviet troops left. But despite the loss of markets and jobs that Moscow's retreat made inevitable, the Mongolians have taken up free-market democracy with astonishing ardor.
Even more remarkable, given the sour experiences of many new democracies in the region, last month Mongolia experienced another peaceful change of Government.
Its new Prime Minister, a 35-year-old former journalist named Tsahiagiyn Elbegdorj, spoke along with Ms. Albright here today in words that made her beam. Chinese leaders try to separate political and economic development, and leaders like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore criticize Western notions of human rights as foreign to Asian culture and values. But Mr. Elbegdorj asserted that the Mongolians were "challenging and breaking this stereotype."
"Mongolia is implementing political and economic changes simultaneously in Asia," he said. "This is the choice of our people."
Even more, he said, "we are showing that we can twin reforms in the political and economic field, while cherishing human rights as a universal value."
In turn, Ms. Albright spoke of Washington's strong support for Mongolia and enthused about Jeffersonian democracy. "When I leave here," she told the Grand Hural, or Parliament, "I will be able to tell all the people in my country and around the world that here in Mongolia, government 'of the people' has had a new birth, and is thriving in a distant but beautiful land."
She said she "couldn't feel more at home," adding, "The message of friendship and support for Mongolian democracy that I bring could not be more important." Mongolia's example, she continued, "is of fundamental importance to developing countries around the world."
In fact, Mr. Elbegdorj's ascension as Prime Minister is a result of a backlash against the economic costs of reform. He replaced Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, who had directed an International Monetary Fund-approved reform that cut inflation but increased unemployment.
Still, American support is highly valued here, given Mongolia's position as a sparsely populated country sandwiched between Russia and China, each of which has dominated it at one time or another.
Mongolians like Uuganbayar, a 29-year-old medical technician who works with the Peace Corps, remain grateful to Russia for helping to modernize. Russian remains the second language here. And Mrs. Uuganbayar, who like most Mongolians uses only one name, said her parents still worked in a Soviet-developed copper mine that continues as a Russian-Mongolian company.
"We miss the Russians a bit," she said. "There is a whole district of the city built by Russians and given to Mongolia, and we can't say that the Russians did nothing for us."
Ariunbat, a 30-year-old Mongolian journalist, said Mongolians feared the Chinese more than the Russians. China's last imperial dynasty ruled Mongolia until 1912, and its Communist Government rules Inner Mongolia as an autonomous region.
But American officials say that China has little interest in being seen to bully or threaten another country.
Ms. Albright is the second Secretary of State to come here. James A. Baker 3d arrived in August 1990 from Irkutsk, Russia, just as Iraqi troops crossed the border into Kuwait. He spent the night in a state guest house and then quickly flew to Moscow for consultations before returning to Washington. He visited again a year later.
The United States has provided Mongolia $80 million in aid over the last five years, some of it as emergency assistance for fuel, to keep Soviet-built power plants running through the long and deep winters.
The cold is so severe in Mongolia that many Ulaan Baatar residents abandon their city dwellings during the worst of it in preference for traditional felt tents, or gers, which Americans know as yurts. The gers are simply warmer than poorly heated Soviet-era apartment blocks.
On Capitol Hill, American officials said, Mongolia's democracy is extremely popular. The country, which was allotted $12 million in American aid last year, is one of the few to receive more money than the Administration requests. The amount may not seem enormous -- especially when compared, for instance, with the $225 million sent to Ukraine. But Ukraine's population is more than 25 times larger than Mongolia's.
Today, Ms. Albright delivered about $200,000 for women's projects here. A coalition of about 20 women's groups, all of which get some American aid, includes professionals, legislators and those working against domestic violence.
Ms. Albright approved a modest joint statement on United States-Mongolian relations that the Government here had sought as a formal recognition of American interest and support.
Washington is also supporting Mongolia for membership in the regional forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, an effort to pull the country from its isolation.
Mrs. Uuganbayar, the Peace Corps worker, said she had high hopes for her son, now 4. "We think all this will work," she said. "My sister, my mother, my husband, we all look forward to American help."

HEADLINE: In Niagara Falls, Pataki's Vetoes Rouse Anger as Economy Slumps

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., May 1

 BODY:
Roger Spurback, a lifelong Republican in this city of Democrats, used to heap praise on Gov. George E. Pataki and his fiscal policies. But his feelings changed when Mr. Pataki cut $20,000 from the state budget for a neighborhood crime prevention program that Mr. Spurback supervises from his home here.
The program is among hundreds that suffered when Mr. Pataki vetoed more than $1.5 billion in state spending last week, saying legislators had pledged far too many tax dollars to programs great and small. While the vetoes will affect the entire state, people like Mr. Spurback say their impact will be harshest in depressed upstate cities like Niagara Falls, where many community programs rely almost entirely on state aid. Even politically conservative residents like Mr. Spurback are livid, saying the vetoes will lead many to vote against Mr. Pataki this fall. 
 "When you batter the people who do the voting, you're going to hear back from them loud and clear," said Mr. Spurback, whose program provides walkie-talkies to residents who volunteer as neighborhood security guards, deadbolts for elderly people's homes and extra lighting for dark streets. "He's crushing these simple little programs that do so much good."
Mr. Pataki also vetoed $1,000 for a children's chess club, $2,500 for pregnancy prevention programs and $7,500 for the city's drug court, an alternative to prison for low-level offenders who abuse drugs and alcohol.
The Niagara Falls Fire Department lost $2,000 for a fire prevention program for schoolchildren, and a nonprofit group lost $2,500 that would have helped renovate a home for the mentally ill. The Legal Aid Society of Niagara County is $67,000 poorer, and the city will have $2,500 less to spend decorating neighborhoods for Christmas.
Niagara Falls will receive about $100,000 more in municipal aid than last year, city officials said, but Niagara County Community College, like others across the state, will lose some state aid and might have to raise tuition.
And while school aid will increase slightly, the Governor vetoed $500 million that would have renovated or replaced aging school buildings across the state. All in a year when Wall Street is thriving and state tax revenue is exceptionally high.
"All I can do is scratch my head and ask why," said Senator Anthony Nanula, a Democrat whose district includes Niagara Falls and who tucked money for some of the programs into the state budget last month. "One can only guess there is a political motivation behind Governor Pataki's actions here."
Others say the State Legislature's $72 billion budget was a foolish spending spree, contending that Mr. Pataki delivered the state from fiscal chaos by making painful but courageous cuts.
"The Governor had to make some cuts," James C. Galie, the Democratic Mayor of Niagara Falls, said. "I've done it myself, even at election time."
Chuck Steiner, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, also defended Mr. Pataki's vetoes, saying the tax cuts in the new budget would bring businesses to depressed cities like Niagara Falls. Many of those businesses would donate money to programs like the ones suffering from the vetoes, so they could thrive even without state dollars, he said.
But to many residents of Niagara Falls, who have seen business after business close and repeated attempts to rejuvenate their downtown fail, those arguments carry little weight. Unemployment hovers around 11.5 percent, compared with the statewide average of 6.5 percent. Even tourists, who used to count Niagara Falls among their favorite destinations in the world, do not come so eagerly anymore -- although Mayor Galie says 10 million a year still visit.
Mr. Pataki has called for reviving the tourist trade, describing Niagara Falls as one of "New York's treasures" in his State of the State Message in January and saying it was time to "make it the great national tourist attraction it should be." But last week he vetoed $5 million to help replace the observation tower at the falls. The next day, he announced the project would receive state aid after all, from a special fund for community projects.
Some question why the Governor would invest state money in a tourist attraction instead of programs that directly help the people of Niagara Falls. About half of the 55,000 residents receive some kind of public assistance, and a growing number are elderly. Although they are overwhelmingly Democratic, most voted for Mr. Pataki in 1994, hoping he would work some economic magic where Gov. Mario M. Cuomo could not.
But residents say Mr. Pataki has pulled no rabbits from his hat for Niagara Falls. In particular, they say he did not work hard enough to build legislative support for a bill to allow casinos in town. The Legislature rejected the bill last year, destroying what many residents saw as their best chance for steady work.
"If we had one it would help us, no doubt about it," said Edward Grochala, a retired mail carrier who was sitting in a used furniture store on Pine Avenue. "It's dying slowly, yet this town should burst right open, with one of the seven wonders of the world right here."
Mayor Galie said Mr. Pataki has promised to encourage lawmakers to reconsider the casino bill.
"I think the Governor is going to support casinos here," he said. "And in the next 10 to 15 years this town will compare with Disney World in terms of visitors. You can go anywhere to see a casino, but not with Niagara Falls alongside it."
But Judge Mark A. Violante, who runs the local drug court, and John Herowski, who runs the after-school chess club, said the local economy would never recover without the programs Mr. Pataki vetoed.
The drug court puts low-level felons who abuse drugs or alcohol through intensive monitoring and counseling instead of sending them to crowded jails. None of the 40 defendants who have completed the program since it started in 1996 have been arrested again, Judge Violante said.
The state funds would have been used to buy a computer for the courtroom and chemicals used to test for drugs and alcohol, he said.
Mr. Herowski started the chess club last year, when residents were complaining that too many children were wandering the streets after school. The $1,000 would have bought new chessboards and clocks and helped members travel to tournaments in other upstate cities, he said.
"These are underprivileged kids and we can change their lives," said Mr. Herowski, who added that members of the club would write to the Governor pleading for support. "I just wish they would take a better look at exactly what $1,000 can do. I know there's a ton of money going somewhere in this state."
Rosario Corieri, a barber who has owned Rosario's Hair on Pine Avenue for 30 years, said he knows where the money is going: to New York City and the surrounding suburbs, which he said get more attention because they have far more voters than far-flung rural counties like Niagara.
"When they take anything away from an area that's hurting this bad, they're going to have problems," Mr. Corieri said. "We don't ask for much compared to downstate. Why would he take this stuff away?"

HEADLINE: Rosie Speaks, and Broadway Ticket Sellers Cheer

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
It is a testament to the changing culture of Broadway that in the final weeks before the opening of "The Lion King" last fall, the show's producers and publicity agents turned their attention to winning the favor not of a theater critic but of a talk show host and comedian, Rosie O'Donnell.
First, they got the cast booked to perform on Ms. O'Donnell's show. Then they got her to see a preview performance. She was so bowled over, she returned with her 2-year-old son the next day, then went on the air the following morning and pronounced it "the best show I have ever seen in my 35 years." 
 She called it brilliant and astounding; she said she had been reduced to sobbing; she told John Travolta he had to see it. Buy your tickets today, she exhorted her audience of six million or so, because when the reviews come out, there will be none to be found.
"Based on that particular moment, our ticket sales took off," said Peter Schneider, president of feature animation and theatrical productions for Disney, which produced the musical. "The minute Rosie went on the air, we started to sell out. The impact of her personal opinion was phenomenal."
Rosie O'Donnell has become to Broadway what Oprah Winfrey is to books: a big-time celebrity with a hit television show and a largely female following who has made it her mission to breathe new life into a corner of American culture that badly needs help. Day after day, she executes the unlikely stunt of promoting Broadway theater from behind her knickknack-bespangled desk on a daytime talk show devoted to "celebrity-friendly" chat with the likes of Antonio Sabato Jr. and to upbeat banter about such cultural icons as Barbra Streisand and Drake's cakes.
Ms. O'Donnell's influence is indisputable. When she used her show, broadcast each weekday morning at 10 in New York City on ABC, to inaugurate a new toll-free line for ordering Broadway tickets, 5,000 people called the line in the first 45 minutes. When the cast of "Titanic" first performed on her show, box office sales doubled or tripled for that day.
Ticket sales for "Street Corner Symphony" rose by 50 percent and remained elevated for days after its cast performed on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show." And when Ms. O'Donnell was the host of the Tony Awards ceremony last spring, something she will do again next month, its television ratings leapt nearly 50 percent.
All of which is, in a way, Ms. O'Donnell's gift to Broadway. In an era in which television bookings are calculated to promote people or products for immediate consumption, Ms. O'Donnell has gone way out of her way to further the interests of an industry out of the reach of most of her viewers.
Tomorrow morning, the wisecracking Ms. O'Donnell, whose brain is an archive of plot lines from 1970's sitcoms and who redefined the role of Betty Rubble in the film version of "The Flintstones," will join the actors Peter Gallagher and Bernadette Peters to announce the 1998 Tony nominations at Sardi's.
"I believe Rosie has got our foot back in the door of popular American culture," said Bill Evans, a Broadway press agent. "It's the best thing that has happened to Broadway to have her be the enthusiast and the symbol. She represents Broadway."
The rise of Ms. O'Donnell as a force on Broadway exemplifies a shift in the culture and economics of New York theater, at least that of big-budget musical theater. Ten years ago, less than half of all Broadway ticketholders came from outside New York; now, two-thirds live outside New York.
With so many theatergoers living elsewhere, the power of critics has declined and the influence of marketing and promotion has grown, says Jed Bernstein, the executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade organization for Broadway theater in North America.
"Rosie O'Donnell is the personification of a trend toward the mainstreaming of Broadway as an entertainment form," Mr. Bernstein said. "Rosie is part of that phenomenon, but she really takes it to the nth degree."
Ms. O'Donnell's taste in theater might best be described as expansive. When asked, she said she could not think of a show she had hated. She never says anything negative about a show, and she said she could not remember having seen a show and not having mentioned it on the air.
On any given day, Ms. O'Donnell might be found raving to her band leader, John McDaniel, about Natalie Portman in "The Diary of Anne Frank," lip-synching a song from "Titanic," reminiscing with Hinton Battle about his Broadway roles or introducing a scene from "Cabaret."
She gives away free tickets and compact disks. She brandishes Playbills before the camera. She is not above using triple-exclamation-point adjectives like astonishing, phenomenal and epic. Often, she is simply an awestruck fan.
"Nothing quite excites me like a Broadway musical," she said on her show one morning earlier this year. "Except, maybe, a TV star from the 70's. Can you imagine my delight when I learned that my favorite star of the 70's was here in Broadway's 'The King and I'?"
And in walked Marie Osmond.
Ms. O'Donnell grew up listening to Broadway musicals. That is, her mother used to put on cast albums (and Streisand records) while cleaning the house. As Ms. O'Donnell puts it, she and her four siblings were the only second graders in Commack, N.Y., who knew all the words to "South Pacific."
But when she was 10, her mother died of cancer. She describes her father as remote. As soon as she was old enough, she says, she started stealing $20 bills from his wallet, cutting school, riding the Long Island Rail Road into New York City and going to Broadway matinees.
"In many ways, it was my moral guidance as a child," she said of musical theater. "I learned about good and evil and the Nazis from 'The Sound of Music.' It sounds so trite to talk about it, but I feel the human spirit is alive and thriving in musical theater."
That exposure also influenced her decision to perform. The world of movies seemed distant but Broadway was within reach. Standing outside a stage door, she says it was possible to think, "On this block, in this theater, people are doing what I hope to do."
It was there, too, that Ms. O'Donnell first uttered the words "I love you." The recipient was Lucie Arnaz, emerging from a stage door of "They're Playing Our Song."
"We were not an 'I love you' household," Ms. O'Donnell recalled recently. "That's odd to me that this was the first time I blurted that out."
She ended up doing stand-up comedy, television and movies instead of theater. (She did make it to Broadway in 1994 in a revival of "Grease.") But when she began her talk show in 1996, she deliberately made it a throwback, "a Merv Griffinesque show for the 90's," as she put it, with a lot of exposure for Broadway.
"I'm just trying to have people love it as much as I do," she said. "I want to try to encourage the 8-year-old kid sitting there to become the next Stephen Sondheim. I want to inspire people to create this kind of art."
Now in its second season, the show is the third-highest rated syndicated television talk show, after "The Oprah Winfrey Show" and "The Jerry Springer Show." It is especially popular among women, who also happen to dominate the ranks of Broadway ticket buyers.
Yet Ms. O'Donnell said she encountered resistance at first. When she wanted to book Julie Harris or Cherry Jones, she said, she got quizzical looks from her staff. "Or Patti LuPone for the Mamet play," she said. "They'll say, 'Can't you wait till she does an episode of 'Frasier?' "
But soon, the show was booking Broadway cast members to perform. It would share the costs with the Broadway producers -- sometimes tens of thousands of dollars to pay actors, wardrobe people, dressers, hairdressers, prop people and stage managers for a three-minute number.
In the case of "Titanic," Ms. O'Donnell and Mr. McDaniel both saw it in previews, then talked it up and played the cast album on the air. When it opened to mixed reviews, Ms. O'Donnell booked the entire cast to perform the opening number.
"I really sort of did pump it," she said. "One reason was I did love it. And another is that a show with bad notices is always in danger of closing, and I knew that I had a really enjoyable evening of theater and that I thought that people who valued my opinion would enjoy it as well."
According to Adrian Bryan-Brown, the publicist for "Titanic," box office sales rose by 100 to 200 percent after the cast appeared on the show. The impact lasted several days, but Mr. Bryan-Brown said there was also "a residual effect you cannot measure."
There are, of course, shows that even Ms. O'Donnell cannot save. One was "Side Show," the critically admired musical about a pair of Siamese twins. Ms. O'Donnell went to the opening night, led the standing ovation and, along with Mr. McDaniel, admired it effusively and repeatedly on the air.
But the subject proved daunting to potential audiences. When the show slid into trouble, its publicity agents turned to Ms. O'Donnell for help. She exuberantly doled out tickets and compact disks, and offered her own seemingly spontaneous testimonial: "It is not gross or scary at all."
To no avail; "Side Show" closed. But that has not stopped others from trying to enlist Ms. O'Donnell's support.
"That's the only negative thing about the clout of my show," she said. "When a show is up and in danger of closing, they want you to promote it and say, 'Go see it.' And I can't really do it for every show. Because then no one will believe me when I say, 'That's astounding!' "

HEADLINE: The Very Rich Pay to Learn How to Give Money Away

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
For most Americans, the formula for giving money away is easy enough: Choose the charity and write the check.
But for the mega-rich, that approach is hopelessly simplistic. They need professional help in parting with their money -- and some are willing to spend up to $20,000 to get it. 
 So they go to philanthropy school.
In recent years, a growing number of foundations and other organizations have begun holding workshops, field trips and even therapy sessions to teach the wealthy and -- in the words of one provider of such services -- the really extremely wealthy the finer points of giving. These include not only practical considerations such as how to evaluate organizations for their financial responsibility but also a lot of intellectual soul-searching about what values the givers are hoping to spread.
For $650, a Boston program will put you through the paces in a weekend. And for $150 an hour, another Boston outfit will provide one-on-one counseling and hand-holding for those traumatized about coming into sudden wealth. But the Rolls-Royce of this new educational discipline is without question the Rockefeller Foundation Course in Practical Philanthropy.
Created in response to demand from affluent families worried that the younger generation was losing the philanthropic touch, the course isn't easy to get into. To separate real grant-making material from hangers-on hoping for a chance to schmooze with the rich, the foundation puts candidates thorough a series of interviews, asks questions about their backgrounds and looks into their finances. Students pay $10,000 in tuition, plus $10,000 for travel and lodging.
During the course -- which meets for one week in October, January, April and June -- students read Aristotle, learn to analyze financial statements, travel abroad (this year to Rio) to view third world poverty close up and practice meditation.
But can't these folks figure out themselves how to donate their money? Not really, says Jacqueline Novogratz, one of the program's directors. "Philanthropy is no longer about writing a check for $10,000 to the opera," Ms. Novogratz said. "We're exposing our students to a whole new innovative way of looking at strategic philanthropy."
And the Rockefeller students seem satisfied with their investment. Elizabeth Wallace-Ellers, a former investment banker who lives in Philadelphia, took the course last year, she said, "as a reality check, to make sure that in all my self-education I hadn't missed anything."
Chara Schreyer, a current student, joined to get a better grasp of how to run her San Francisco organization, the Kadima Foundation, which distributes $1 million a year for causes ranging from the education of underprivileged teen-agers to diabetes research. "I guess I could have done this myself," she said, "but I wouldn't have gotten a complete overview. I wouldn't have even known where to begin."
On a gray afternoon in January, seven students -- from 30-somethings to graying baby boomers -- sat around a conference table on the 23d floor of the Rockefeller Foundation's Fifth Avenue headquarters, munching soggy tuna sandwiches and sipping soft drinks, their pens poised over note pads and their brows furrowed in concentration.
The talk among the group, which included Bob Vila, the television home-repair guru; Jeffrey Soros, a nephew of the billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros; and Ms. Schreyer, a California construction heiress whose father founded the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., was high-minded, almost solemn.
"I don't intend to emerge from this course as a fully fledged philanthropist," said Mr. Soros, 37, who is taking the course this year with his wife, Catherine. (Another Soros, George's daughter, Andrea, took it during its first year.) "What I hope to have are the skills necessary to continue my education as a philanthropist. To learn enough so that I know how to structure a grant, that I can be a vital, active part of my philanthropic giving."
Mr. Soros, who lives in Los Angeles and writes screenplays (although he has yet to see one produced), said that since he had started taking the course, he had been invited to join the boards of two nonprofit groups.

The Classics First, Then Practical Matters
Students start with the basics, reading and discussing great works of literature, such as Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics," James Agee's "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men" and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail." Their purpose, Ms. Novogratz said, is "to focus people on what their own values are, how they see the world, and how they see the good society."
"We use those texts as a jumping-off point to discuss the notions of leadership and responsibility," said Ms. Novogratz, whose office displays a flier that reads "Kill Your Television."
During the course's second week, students learn practical skills, such as how to evaluate an organization and read its financial statements, aimed at deciding whether it deserves a grant. They also spend an afternoon observing proceedings at New York City's Housing Court, so that those who have never seen an eviction notice might understand the human side of economic deprivation. Guest speakers -- from organizations like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and the Natural Resources Defense Council -- pay frequent visits. Students are also encouraged to seek advice from Rockefeller Foundation alumni -- who now number 17 -- on what groups are most deserving of their money. Ms. Novogratz said that at least one philanthropist-in-training had denied a grant to an organization as a result of a conversation with a graduate.
In a millionaires' variation of the Junior Year Abroad, the third week of the course takes students to impoverished areas of a foreign country. This year, they spent a week in Brazil, first checking into the Copacabana Palace and then setting to work studying the problems that besiege the poverty-stricken slums of Rio de Janeiro.
"Apparently, we may be able to draw conclusions about problems that we see in the U.S.," Mr. Soros said. "Maybe there are similar root causes in both New York and Rio."
Students also have to wrestle with the jarring contrast between the cosseted lives they lead and the struggle for survival they witness among the poor. In the course's first year, they flew to Nairobi, Kenya, to observe an AIDS program for prostitutes. One participant, who requested anonymity, remembered the shock of returning from a prostitute's one-room shack to the luxury of his room at the Intercontinental Hotel.
"Five days in Nairobi slums changes you," Ms. Novogratz said.
During the fourth week, students submit "mission statements" of their philanthropic goals, and go before the Rockefeller Foundation board to be grilled on a hypothetical grant proposal they have written.
As high-sounding as all of this might sound, not everybody is a fan of the program. Some politically conservative foundations see partisanship in the place of philanthropy. James Piereson, executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation in New York, said he believes that organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation focus their attention on issues dear to Democrats. He regards their programs as a frilly boot camp for wealthy leftists.
"It's an attempt to spread the influence of the Rockefeller Foundation, assume the ends of the foundation, and discuss the means to get to those ends," Mr. Piereson said. "The approach of the liberal foundations used to be that they would go after the professional managers, and they would use the professional, liberal managers to bend the previously conservative donors." Now, he said, Rockfeller is "going straight to the source." The Olin Foundation sponsors its own annual philanthropy meeting, the Philanthropy Round Table.
Ms. Novogratz brushes aside the criticism, insisting that her group has no political agenda. "I'd say one of the perceived strengths is that we are nonideological," she said.
While the Rockefeller Foundation program might well offer the best Philanthropy 101 course money can buy, it tops an increasingly crowded field. Advisory services have popped up all over the place -- and no wonder. A few years ago, two Cornell University economists estimated that baby boomers would inherit $5.6 trillion from their parents over the next several decades, the biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in American history. And that was when the Dow Jones industrial average was below 3,000. Since then, the number of the nation's millionaires has risen sharply.
In 1989, an estimated three million United States households had a net worth of $1 million or more; seven years later, that figure was 4.1 million, according to Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist. Americans' giving has kept pace, according to "Giving U.S.A.," an annual report on philanthropy published by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, soaring to $151 billion in 1996 from $111.5 billion in 1990, 43 percent above the gain necessary to keep up with inflation.
"We'd like to capture the hearts and imaginations of these people to be philanthropic with this newly acquired wealth," said Salvatore LaSpada, the co-director of the Rockefeller Foundation's course.
So would other groups. The Philanthropic Initiative Inc., a nine-year-old Boston nonprofit, charges $650 for weekend seminars that it holds twice a year on charitable giving. The retreats draw hundreds of people, "from the wealthy to the really extremely wealthy," said H. Peter Karoff, the founder and president, who considers just plain wealthy to be a net worth about of $25 million.
The Philanthropic Initiative has instructed about 7,000 people. "We are trying to promote philanthropy in an aggressive, marketing-savvy way," Mr. Karoff said. "The Rockefeller program is the high end of what's available." While his program is more modest, he added, "We had no idea when we started how much we would grow."

Invaluable Training At Bargain Prices
Most training programs teach the basics for prices that are pocket change to their customers. The Council on Foundations in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit membership association for charitable foundations and corporate grant-making programs, charges $1,000 for three-day annual workshops that have drawn 50 students in four years.
And the Impact Project, a Boston outfit founded seven years ago, advises younger people, for about $150 an hour, on how to deal with sudden wealth. The organization's newsletter, More Than Money, has 1,100 subscribers and offers first-person tales of philanthropic anguish. "My parents are terrified of being judged as wealthy, but they live in this enormous dream house and make large institutional donations that get the wings of buildings named after them," reads one, by a reader named Bob Styles. "They fight constantly because my Dad wants to give away more than my Mom."
In another issue, Patrick Reynolds, an heir to the R. J. Reynolds tobacco fortune, explained why he used his wealth to found the Foundation for a Smokefree America.
According to Christopher Mogil, the director, the Impact Project is unique in combining consulting and therapy. In one case, he sat side by side with a young woman who was afraid to look at the stock portfolio she had just inherited to see how much was in it. After he soothed her nerves, she opened the folder and learned she was worth $10 million.
"There can be a lot of guilt and trauma in the philanthropic community," Mr. Mogil said.
Of course, it's possible to learn how to give away money without attending philanthropy school. Twelve dollars will buy you a one-year subscription to the Better Business Bureau's quarterly newsletter, Give But Give Wisely. Or, if you have two years to invest, you can apply for the Nonprofit Management master's program at the Yale University School of Management.
But the Rockefeller Foundation is the place to be if you have deep pockets and a yearning to change the world. And the people who run it are delighted at the opportunity to show you how.
By midafternoon on that day in January, the seven students had made their way by taxi to the Rheedlen Center for Children and Families on West 144th Street in Harlem. They spoke with staff members, observed a class, then returned to downtown Manhattan to dine with Geoffrey Canada, the center's president.
"It's very interesting to know that there are folks out there who are that affluent coming to us to try to learn something," Mr. Canada said. "The best part is that we get to talk to them while they're still deciding what to do with their money."

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS ACCEPT A SINGLE CURRENCY DESPITE LATE SNAG

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sunday, May 3

 BODY:
A bold European Union plan to begin a common currency among 11 countries next year got underway this morning after temporarily running aground over a dispute between France and Germany about who should run the new European central bank.
Instead of celebrating economic and political unity by formally proclaiming the plan on Saturday afternoon, leaders of the 15 European Union countries spent hours in bitter argument between the two countries that have been at the heart of the European idea for decades. 
 France, apparently alone, had insisted that Wim F. Duisenberg of the Netherlands, the German-backed candidate to head the central bank that will run the new currency, the euro, should agree in writing to retire four years after the start of an eight-year term so that the president of France's central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, could take over.
Germany balked, citing the statutory eight-year term of the European bank's president and concerned about any compromise that would turn the euro into a poor substitute for the German mark.
The dispute was finally resolved at midnight by an agreement to appoint Mr. Duisenberg to an eight-year term after he suddenly let it be known that he planned to retire of his own free will by mid-2002, but gave no date, satisfying the German demand that none be specified.
The wrangling was an inauspicious start to a project intended to be a signal demonstration of European political will to become an economic superpower as strong as the United States. And it could weaken European currencies against the dollar when the financial markets open on Monday.
"There are no reasons for laughing," President Jacques Chirac of France chided reporters who hooted when Mr. Chirac told them that he and his fellow leaders had decided that Mr. Trichet would replace Mr. Duisenberg in about four years.
Jose Maria Gil Robles, president of the European Parliament, which has to ratify today's agreements later this month, said, "Let us hope that the baby which has been born in such bad form can recover."
The countries taking part in the new currency are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Britain, Denmark and Sweden decided not to join and Greece did not meet the criteria.
"I want to make the process irreversible," Chancellor Helmut Kohl had said of the often tortuous emergence of European unification, but even he described Saturday night's discussions as "combative." He sees European unity as the best guarantee against the wars that devastated the Continent twice in the first half of the century.
But as the latest dispute showed, the barriers were formidable.
Creating a central bank before a political union has never been done before in Europe; the European Union has often failed to agree on common foreign or security policies, as in Bosnia during the war there.
Setting up a common currency means that countries with very different economic needs will be bound by one common economic policy. That has already exacted political consequences. The French public's dissatisfaction with the austerity measures the Government proposed to keep its budget deficit low enough to qualify to join the euro was a major reason the Gaullist party lost in elections last spring.
Such tensions are bound to arise in the future. What if one country's economy is doing well, but another's needs relief? One policy will have to fit all, whether unemployment is at 6 percent, as in Austria now, or 22 percent, as in Spain.
In effect, the countries are giving up some part of their sovereignty to a central bank -- one reason why Britain has resisted joining.
Yet President Jacques Chirac of France was insistent on making Mr. Trichet, 55, a candidate for the presidency of the European central bank even after all the other countries and their central bankers had agreed on Mr. Duisenberg, 63.
Alistair Campbell, spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, whose country presided over the heated closed discussions, said Mr. Duisenberg had agreed to step down after the euro actually replaces the franc, the mark and other national currencies in mid-2002.
But Germany, where popular resistance to the new currency is strong and Mr. Kohl is battling against the odds for election to a fifth term in September, backed Mr. Duisenberg in refusing to agree in writing to a specific date, officials said. The bank's charter, the 1992 Treaty on European Union, specifies that the president's term is eight years.
"Mr. Duisenberg has indicated he doesn't want to stay for a full term," Mr. Campbell said. "Mr. Duisenberg should decide when he goes, rather than politicians."
But Peter Praet, a Belgian economist, said: "The central bank will have to recover from this attack on its credibility. The damage is done." Any damage will be attributed to France, which more than any other country wants a strong euro to stand up to the dollar on world markets.
The nations that join the common currency have agreed to keep their budget deficits to 3 percent of their gross national product. Germany insisted on that stiff requirement because of concerns about giving up its strong mark. That requirement has caused years of anti-inflationary, deficit-cutting policies by countries that wanted to join the euro. Those austerity measures, skeptics say, have taken a terrible political and economic toll, causing governments to fall, driving unemployment up to double digits and dooming much of the Continent to years of stagnation.
"The common currency has become the emperor's clothing in the Andersen fairy tale, with no important responsible politician willing to play the role of the little boy and tell the emperor, in this case the people, the truth," Emmanuel Todd, a French historian, wrote in a best-selling book, "The Economic Illusion," this spring.
Nobody really knows how a common currency will work among countries so big and economically disparate. "If the common currency works well, Great Britain will be in a position to take a decision very rapidly," Mr. Blair said before the meetings started.
But his Labor Government decided to wait and see what happens in 2002, when the the euro actually replaces national currencies, before deciding whether to join.
People and companies can start writing checks and keeping accounts in euros starting in January.
The European leaders here also planned to fix the value of the 11 currencies that are to be merged, freezing them against each other until the end of the year, when the value of the euro will be decided. If it were established on Monday, the euro would probably be worth about $1.10, close to the value of the floating European Currency Unit now on international currency markets.
The common currency is not yet the single currency that European Union leaders dreamed of in 1992, when the last customs duties were eliminated among European member nations. Even the 11 countries that will share the euro do not always think about money the same way, laying the groundwork for potential political clashes over the right monetary and economic policies they should follow with the euro when the next recession strikes.
Germany's collective memory includes the trauma of 1923, when hyperinflation made the mark worthless, and the German Bundesbank's charter in 1957 gave it the sole mission of "safeguarding the currency." But in 1958, France's currency had become so inflated that the Government took the step of decreeing 100 old francs worth a single new one and started all over, and millions of French people still tote up sums in their heads in old francs.
So central bankers and conservative politicians in Germany and the Netherlands tend to be much more skeptical than their French counterparts that Italy and Spain have actually got the better of free-spending deficit habits that sent inflation spiraling in earlier decades.
Despite the high hopes that are accompanying the adoption of the euro, the experience of the European Union suggests that abiding by a single monetary policy will not be easy. The European Union today is the world's biggest trading power, with a single trade policy for all its members, a single agricultural policy and a single market of 340 million people in its 15 member nations, expected to swell to 20 or more countries in the next decade.
European nations linked their currencies loosely together in the 1970's after the United States abandoned the gold standard and currencies were allowed to fluctuate in value on world money markets. Most were following Germany's lead by the late 1980's, since Germany had been most successful in fighting inflation.
But when Germany raised interest rates to ward off inflationary pressures caused by unification in 1990, its neighbors had to follow suit or see their currencies devalued by the markets. A result in France, Britain and eventually Italy was a recession and double-digit unemployment.
Britain and Italy had to bail out of the system in 1992. Liberated from the need to keep interest rates high and free of many of the inflexible welfare-state work rules of continental economies, Britain has boomed ever since.
France pursued monetary union as a way of getting out from under the domination of the Bundesbank while leaving most of its welfare state intact. Mr. Chirac, earlier a skeptic about the process, rallied to it and backed deficit-reduction measures that included an attempt to cut back retirement pensions for railroad workers.
That aroused French public outrage, which helped defeat the Gaullists last spring. French workers staged a national transportation strike in 1995 that paralyzed the country for three weeks and forced the Government to back down.
Last year, Mr. Chirac lost a gamble that voters would grit their teeth and back more conservative austerity moves to make the common currency a reality. Instead, they voted for a Socialist Government headed by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
So far, the French have been able to avoid making further budget cuts because the French economy bounced back at the end of 1997. But Mr. Jospin, backed by Mr. Chirac, pressed other European partners to keep political pressure on the new central bank to make job creation and economic growth as much a priority as controlling inflation.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND GETAWAYS;
The Madison Tale

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER; BARNABY J. FEDER is a reporter in the Chicago bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
I'M affectionate, loyal and a touch sentimental, but I have no flair for romance, which explains why I was a bit worried last spring as my 10th wedding anniversary approached. We had agreed to celebrate with an overnight getaway from Chicago and our three small children, but it was my job to choose the spot and I fretted that my wife, Michele, would be disappointed. My anxiety grew when I discovered that my first choice, the historic lodge at the scenic Starved Rock State Park on the Illinois River, was fully booked through winter.
Fortunately, I had a safe backup less than a three hours' drive away, in Madison, Wis.: a combination bookstore, cafe and inn called the Canterbury. We had enjoyed a brief stop at the cafe and bookstore a year before when our family passed through town. And I figured that the inn, with each room lavishly painted to celebrate a different chapter of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," would provide a mix of bawdiness and whimsy appropriate to a happy decade of marriage. 
 The July Saturday our trip began was the hottest day of the year. And the drive to Madison from Chicago, through miles of suburbs followed by vast corn- and soybean-covered prairie, will never make anyone's list of vacation thrills. But from the moment we passed along the shore of Lake Monona into Madison, we knew we had come to the right place.
Madison is routinely voted one of America's most livable cities. Founded in 1836 and named for President James Madison, who died that year, the city is blessed with a stunning setting: Lake Monona is flanked by two smaller lakes, Wingra and Waubesa, and the downtown area is squeezed into a hilly, eight-block-wide isthmus between Monona and the far larger Lake Mendota. Boating, swimming, hiking and biking opportunities abound -- with nearly 100 miles of bike trails, the city claims to have more bikes than cars. The 200,000 residents enjoy a strong economy and the rich cultural life that goes with being both the state capital and the home of the University of Wisconsin, which occupies a wooded 1,000-acre campus on Mendota's shore.
But Madison is really more like a large town in many ways, which is helpful to anyone making a quick visit. We were more than ready for lunch when we arrived, so we were delighted that it took us less than 15 minutes to get across Madison and check in at the Canterbury.
In the heart of the city in a nondescript 70-year-old brick building, the Canterbury once housed a car dealer, a nightclub and offices before Trudy Barash decided to open a bookstore and coffeehouse there in 1991. Two years later, Mrs. Barash and her husband bought the building and converted the upstairs into a six-room bed-and-breakfast. A small sitting room serves as an upstairs common area. The cloakroom-sized check-in desk at the base of the stairway has a separate entrance from the bookstore and cafe (the coffeehouse became a cafe as the menu expanded to serve overnight guests).
Since the Canterbury's rooms are not usually ready for occupancy until 4 P.M., we left our bag at the desk and zipped into the cafe, which features pastas, sandwiches, salads, desserts, wines and local beers and, of course, a wide range of coffee concoctions. The cafe is a roomy alcove with sit-down service for about 50 patrons. Some of the tables are set up to accommodate chess players, and other board games are also available, along with newspapers.
Once we had refreshed ourselves, we ventured out into the oppressively tropical air. We were thankful that the inn is only half a block from State Street, a funky half-mile strip of food, music, craft and clothing shops that runs from the university campus to the imposing state capitol building, which took over a decade to build starting in 1906. The domed white granite structure sits surrounded by lawn, gardens and towering trees on a hilltop in the center of town.
On another day we might have been sorry that we arrived too late for the Farmers' Market, one of the Midwest's largest, which rings the capitol on Saturday mornings from May through October. And had it been cooler, we would have stuck to our original plan to rent bikes and head out to the University Arboretum, a 1,200-acre refuge on the south shore of Lake Wingra with gardens and miles of trails through prairie and woodland landscapes. But it was so hot that we were content to dip in and out of the shops. I bought a sports shirt on sale at Jazzman and Michele struck paydirt at the Peacock, a quirky import boutique where she found two dresses, each less than $80, and a patchwork something-or-other that had the cut of a sweatshirt and the feel of a thinly quilted jacket, 50 percent off at $24.
In one of the music shops we found cassette tapes by Peter and Lou Berryman, a local folk-singing duo. I snapped up "Double Yodel," which has their song "Orange Cocoa Cake," a snapshot of a mother trying simultaneously to telephone a friend with a recipe and handle three children. It has been my nominee for the funniest song about motherhood ever since I first heard another singer's live version three years ago.
We left the stores behind to visit the Elvehjem Museum of Art on the university campus just beyond the end of State Street. Like many museums in smaller cities, it has that special mixture of secondary works by famous artists and beautiful surprises by local painters or other less familiar artists. We loved a small Georgia O'Keeffe painting of a single turkey feather in a ceramic vase and a Jack Butler Yeats longshoreman. There was also a large exhibition of Hiroshige prints that were originally collected by Frank Lloyd Wright, who got his start in Madison and was deeply influenced by the brilliant Japanese printmaker. (Wright's best known work in Madison is the First Unitarian Society Meeting House; he also designed a few houses there.)
The museum visit came to an unexpectedly dramatic finale shortly before closing time when tornado sirens began wailing. After a brief wait in the basement, we headed back down State Street to the inn under glowering but rainless skies.
We returned too late to sample the complimentary wine and cheese the Canterbury sends to the sitting room each afternoon, but our room, the Reeve's, turned out to be so delightful we could not help laughing. Although it is the second-smallest of the six at the Canterbury (only the Clerk's offers tighter quarters), it felt intimate rather than cramped. In addition to vivid murals depicting the avid bed-swapping of the characters in Chaucer's Reeve's tale, there was framed poetry and artwork celebrating books on several walls, a huge armoire containing a stereo system with CD player, TV and VCR facing the queen-sized bed, a love seat, a beautifully tiled bathroom stocked with luxury soaps, a small kitchen area with freshly baked cookies and a refrigerator containing free juices, bottled water and soda.
A copy of "The Canterbury Tales" lay on the bedside table, a version of the Reeve's tale with space for guests to leave their impressions on many pages lay by the telephone, and the bookcase was filled with an eclectic assortment of novels, poetry and nonfiction. I enjoyed discovering the poetry of Ronald Wallace, a local writer who described memory as "God's best punch line."
Our room, and the others we peeked into Sunday before we left, also had Scrabble and chess sets. The top-of-the-line Merchant's Room has a separate sitting and reading area and a whirlpool in the bathroom.
It was hard to leave such a cozy space once we settled in. Still, we were not going to miss our 7:30 dinner reservation at L'Etoile, one of Madison's most popular restaurants. L'Etoile had been fully booked when our check-in clerk at the Canterbury phoned for us shortly after our arrival, but happily there was a cancellation. It was a short walk to the restaurant, on the second floor of a small building at the north end of the Capitol grounds. Our window seat allowed us to watch fireflies popping up from the Capitol lawns.
L'Etoile's menu is built around organic meat and produce. My main course was tender pork garnished with currants accompanied by a potato-hickory nut side dish. Michele's Black Angus tenderloin was perfect. The hickory nut cake with peach ice cream we shared was delicious and the whole thing, with drinks, came to about $80.
Afterward we strolled to the new Monona Terrace convention center on Lake Monona, which had opened only the week before. Based on a bold 1938 proposal by Frank Lloyd Wright that the site be used for a huge architecturally dramatic civic center topped with fountains and glass domes, the center's public space includes rooftop gardens, where we encountered endearing evidence that Madison is a big town at heart. Visitors wended their way over hundreds of tiles bearing names, dates, or brief inscriptions from local residents who had donated money to the project. Almost all the people around us seemed to be looking for their own tiles or those of someone they knew, generating wonderful eavesdropping opportunities for us.
Back at the Canterbury, before heading for bed, we tarried for well over an hour in the bookstore and more than used up the $10 gift certificate that came with our room.
Our Continental breakfast was also included in the price of our room ($175, with tax). We chose a cheerful mixture of fresh fruit and muffins, served in the small upstairs sitting room. Other visitors preferred to have breakfast in their rooms.
State Street was just beginning to come to life when we ventured out. We headed for Shakespeare's, a huge second-hand book store facing the Capitol. While the Canterbury bookstore is fun, it had surprising gaps. Michele had been disappointed not to find a copy of Allen Ginsberg's "Kaddish." Shakespeare's had it, along with a copy of "Yankee From Olympus," Catherine Drinker Bowen's out-of-print biography of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. that we had been looking for ever since we realized that ours had not come back the last time we lent it out.
After prying ourselves loose from Shakespeare's, we visited several art galleries, had terrific hamburgers for lunch at the accurately named Sunroom Cafe a block from the university, and then reluctantly gathered our gear for the drive home.
We stopped by Babcock Hall, home of the university's school of dairy science, in search of straight-from-the-cow ice cream but discovered that the ice cream parlor was closed on Sundays. Well, no getaway is perfect. We drove off, the Berrymans on the tape deck.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Piggy-Bank Chronicles

BYLINE: By DAVID RAMPE

 BODY:
YOU know the type.
* Suzanna Markstein, 26, and an editorial assistant at Mademoiselle magazine, bought her first I.R.A. when she was 22. She had just graduated from college and earned only $6,000 that year but still managed to stash away $2,000. "Friends with similar salaries are certainly better dressed than I am," she says with little regret: Her $2,000 could grow to $55,000 or more by the time she reaches 65 -- in 2037. 
 * Kathryn and J. P. Clejan, a Manhattan couple in their 30's, put aside money every month for college for their 2-year-old son, Andre, and analyze every spending decision to a fare-thee-well. When the Clejans -- she works for a health company; he's a computer management consultant -- bought a ski house in Vermont, their preproject estimate of $20,000 for furnishings "came in so close it was scary," Ms. Clejan said. "We don't spend like most people in New York, on big dinners out and Broadway shows."
* Jim Flewelling saved enough of his earnings managing a small manufacturing company to toss it all in 1995, live off his nest egg and take things easy, doing a little traveling and dabbling in financial writing. At 48, he tells people he is "voluntarily unemployed": "Nobody likes to hear somebody in their 40's say they are retired."
They're the people who floss their financial teeth after every meal. They have zero-body-fat credit cards. They are supersavers.
And they can drive the rest of us, who struggle to salt away a little money for retirement or beat back impulsive spending, more than a little crazy. Sure, the supersavers' prudence and self-denial will probably leave them in the catbird seat financially come retirement, while most people wonder how they will ever catch up. But it may not just be envy that leads ordinary people to wonder whether supersavers might be overdoing it just a little.
Take heart: there may well be such a thing as oversaving.
Needless to say, very few people save too much. Most Americans are woefully unprepared for retirement, which nowadays might last longer than careers do.
And, of course, calculations about financial conditions many years in the future are fraught with uncertainty: Someone could save far too much, or far too little, and not know which for decades to come, because of imponderables like the fate of Social Security and inflation rates, wars and the stock market. Any decision is ultimately personal, springing as much from one's comfort zone as from material circumstances.
But it is clear that some members of the middle class have made themselves ultra-ready for whatever the future holds -- and actually relish life on a budget.
Such thriftiness can give a great sense of security to ride out storms, but it can also set some often-overlooked traps for the unwary. "If done to excess, savers take quality out of their lives," said Stephen M. Pollan, whose advice is summed up in the title of his business best seller, "Die Broke" (Harper Business, 1995), written with Mark Levine. "The guys who built the Pyramids were savers," putting aside possessions for the next life, Mr. Pollan said.
For instance, giant nest-egg builders might find themselves disqualified from Government benefits like Social Security and Medicare that now use or may adopt means tests. "You could save yourself out of a program you would otherwise be entitled to," Mr. Pollan said.
Tightened means tests for college financial aid already make it difficult for average middle-class families -- let alone supersavers -- to qualify for grants.
Supersavers may also be overreacting to the sirens of Wall Street, who have a strong vested interest in promoting oversaving because savings are generally invested in ways that will generate fees and commissions.
Those whose main focus is retirement may discover that they have tied up too much of their money in illiquid, though lucrative, retirement plans, and have trouble coping with big expenses or buying a house.
And extreme thrift can be dangerously habit-forming. Some people who make a cause of putting away for a rainy day find that, after decades of strict saving, they can't flip off the switch, and they miss out on some joys of life.
"The healthy use of money is really a reflection of self-image," said Kathleen Gurney, who runs the Financial Psychology Corporation, a company on Lake Tahoe in Nevada that tries to give clients insight into their financial behavior. The goal, according to Dr. Gurney, is to save and spend flexibly, not rigidly, and to make choices based on a sense of one's self and one's family.
CLOCKWORK savers who lack such flexibility may also lack the dash of the true entrepreneur, who earns more but saves less. Entrepreneurs "allow money to flow in and out of their lives and tolerate anxiety or volatility in the market," Dr. Gurney said.
Supersavers, on the other hand, often emphasize economy for its own sake. Dr. Gurney cites the example of a retired pediatrician who always wanted an ocean view but lived in a little trailer to get it. "She said, 'I never felt I could afford anything.' "
Dennis Filangeri, a certified planner in Metairie, La., described a client who lives on $75,000 a year, though he has a gross income of $150,000. He drives a Lexus, but he bought it used.
But Mr. Filangeri said that client hardly fit the caricature of a miserable miser. "He's not unhappy and doesn't feel he's depriving himself," Mr. Filangeri said. "And he's not going to stop being frugal."
Annoyingly, perhaps, there is no law requiring that zealous savers be maladjusted personalities.
In his career as a manager, Mr. Flewelling, the 48-year-old retiree, "never made close to earning $100,000 in a year and never expected to come close." When he turned 30, he and his wife, Sandra, a software engineer, decided to save their way to early retirement, and for the next 15 years the Flewellings put aside an average of 60 percent of their gross income every year. "We wanted to have the choice to work, or not," he said. Now, Mr. Flewelling doesn't, and she does, but only three days a week, two of them at home.
And the childless couple still keep saving money. "We've planned through age 90 to make sure the money lasts," Mr. Flewelling said.
But deep down, he says, "the purpose of having money isn't to have it, it's to be able to use it, whether now or 40 years from now," The Flewellings mete out their fun, traveling once or twice a year.
A balance of saving and spending is emphasized by Dr. James Gottfurcht, a psychologist in Los Angeles specializing in behavioral issues related to money. He says that when he meets clients, he asks: "What's the quality of their life? How much is money interfering in their free time? Are they obsessive, or enjoying life? If they are enjoying it and each other, and a rich quality of life, that way threads their needle."
NONETHELESS, some zealous savers may need a bit of reminding, especially at retirement. "To my extreme surprise, half the time I tell retired clients not to spend as much, and half the time to spend more," said Robin Sherwood, a financial planner in New Canaan, Conn. "One of my key jobs is to tell them what's appropriate to spend."
Dr. Gurney said that when she bought a cottage in a French village, she dismissed the questions from friends who wondered, "Couldn't you have used your money more wisely?" No one in France would ask that question, she said:
"I go to France to feed my soul. It is one of the wisest things I have ever done for myself."

Trees, Traffic and a Street Fight

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
The greening of Greenwich, a plan to plant trees on Greenwich Street and narrow it to two lanes from six on the eight blocks between Hubert and Chambers Streets, is a relatively small project. But there is nothing small about the dust-up it is causing, involving a titan of commerce, well-known restaurant owners and a movie star.
Conceived more than a decade ago, the plan was delayed by financing and planning difficulties until last year, when everything seemed to fall into place. The $2 million project awaited only final approval from the city's Economic Development Corporation. 
 But some residents and business owners began complaining that the street would be too narrow, resulting in traffic congestion. Among the most vocal critics were the restaurateurs Tracy Nieporent and his brother Drew, who own TriBeCa Grill on Greenwich Street and Nobu, the celebrity favorite on Hudson and Franklin Streets. They want three traffic lanes, and have said so, repeatedly, to local and city officials.
Now the plan has stalled again. "These guys seem only to be concerned about continuing the double- and triple-parking of their customers' limousines," said Paul Goldstein, the manager of Community Board 1.
Tracy Nieporent insists that is not true, and that a new traffic study will back up his concerns about congestion. But John Petrarcha, a community board member and a director of Friends of Greenwich Street, a group supporting the plan, said four studies have found no potential traffic problems. A state study, he added, showed that unless Greenwich Street is narrowed soon, traffic will spill over from newly reconstructed West Street, which will have more signals.
A February meeting between project advocates and opponents ended in a standoff. Since then, proponents of the plan have secured letters of support from, among others, Representative Jerrold L. Nadler and from Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the Travelers Group, whose headquarters are diagonally across from the TriBeCa Grill.
Even Robert De Niro, who is a restaurant partner with the Nieporents, favors the project. "Tracy Nieporent does not speak for Robert De Niro on this issue," said Jane Rosenthal, co-founder of Mr. De Niro's TriBeCa Film Center, in the same building as the TriBeCa Grill. "He has always been in favor of the greening of Greenwich."
Charles Millard, the chairman of the E.D.C., said he hoped to help the parties "resolve their differences." He declined to respond when asked whether the Nieporents are applying behind-the-scenes pressure, as some local officials privately suggest. Tracy Nieporent said that despite such talk there has been no such pressure. He said he and his brother "want trees."
"Our opposition has nothing to do with limousines," he said. "It has to do with the future of Greenwich Street." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: Over the Moon About Cows

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER is the author of "The Heartland" volume of the Smithsonian Guides to Natural America series.

 BODY:
IN Texas, where I am from, I spent a lot of time driving around. After some years of traveling up and down U.S. Highway 77, which cuts through the vast King Ranch, on trips related mainly to watching birds, I developed a love for Santa Gertrudis cattle. Love is not exactly the right word, but something synonymous, like fondness, is even farther off the mark. There may not be a word to describe how I feel. I just know that Santa Gertrudis became important fixed points in my moving landscape.
A Santa Gertrudis is boxy and chocolate brown and looks like a plush ottoman for a giant. It has big, brown eyes rimmed in pink, a detail that, improbable as it sounds, is visible from a vehicle moving at a fairly high rate of speed. 
 The breed was developed on the King Ranch in the early 1900's by crossing British Shorthorn and Indian Brahman cattle. It was named for Santa Gertrudis Creek, the sweetwater stream flowing through the otherwise arid coastal plain where Capt. Richard King, who once commanded steamboats, set up headquarters in the 1850's for the cow camp that eventually became the King Ranch. The mission was to create an animal capable of withstanding the hostile conditions and stifling heat that prevail much of the year, and the mission was achieved. Santa Gertrudis standing in the shade of a live oak motte on a hot, windless day is the essence of South Texas. Just the thought of this tableau makes me homesick.
It wasn't only Santa Gertrudis. I became enamored of Brahman cattle, which are also fixtures on the mirage-shimmering South Texas landscape. Brahmans are lean and bony and draped with an ill-fitting hide that is mottled in many beautiful shades of gray. One of my proudest possessions is a 12-inch-tall ceramic Brahman bull obtained from the proprietor of a used-furniture and knickknack store I stopped in years ago near McAllen, Tex. She would not sell me the one behind the counter -- it was her husband's, she said -- but made another for me.
While my bovine lust, or whatever it was, manifested itself with these two breeds, it began to dawn on me that cattle of any sort standing out in whatever wide world I was driving through held a great appeal. A herd of dairy cows, a scattering of grazing beef cattle -- whatever the assemblage -- seemed to me at once familiar and mysterious. By any definition of rural America, cattle are an indivisible part of the terrain, but what exactly are they doing out there? Who owns them? What is their significance to a particular place, to its culture and economy? In the mid-1980's, I developed a somewhat casual course of study whereby I would try to determine the names of the breeds I encountered and to gain at least a thimbleful of knowledge about them and about cattle on their home ground.
This has not been easy. I have bookshelves full of guides to birds, bats, plants, snakes, trees, insects, historic sites, cities, restaurants, architectural wonders, but I have never come across a field guide to livestock. I find the dearth of information amazing, because a person traveling across this continent is much more likely to see a cow than, say, a whooping crane. Could it be that I am the only nonagrarian in America who cares to distinguish between a Guernsey and a Charolais?
There is now some information on the Internet. To see a Santa Gertrudis without driving to South Texas, you can beam one up via www.king-ranch.com. The best survey of livestock I've found so far on the Web is at www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle. I'm happy to have this information. It will suffice in the absence of facts bundled in a fashion I find more useful, i.e., in a book I can throw on the seat of my car.
For a couple of years I wandered around livestock exhibitions -- places like the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo -- up and down aisles of gorgeous steers. I recall the hind ends of many huge purebreds, like chalk-white Charolais or burnished-red Limousin, being groomed by youngsters for the show ring. In 1985, a black baldy was chosen grand champion of the Houston show, a major arbiter of livestock, which at the time caused quite a stir. A black baldy would be a Hereford-Angus cross.
Black baldy is one of my favorite names because it actually gives a clue to what the animal looks like: typically it is jet black, like an Angus, with a Hereford's white blaze (hence baldy) on the nose. The win presaged a shift in cattle fashion from gargantuan steers like the Limousin, which had held sway through much of the 1970's and 80's, to more compact models like the black baldy. The shift actually had meaning in the real world of livestock production and market efficiencies: it takes too much time and feed to grow a giant steer.
Black baldies are a motley crew, which is another reason to like them. Because they are a crossbreed -- also referred to in the cattle business as a composite -- and because a producer will often throw other breeds into the mix besides Angus and Hereford, a bunch of black baldies standing out in a pasture can be quite varied in markings and coloration, a great display of genetic pyrotechnics.
Black baldies are still an industry mainstay, at least along the roads I'm driving these days. Thirteen years ago I moved from Texas to Minnesota, then six years later to Nebraska. Adios, Santa Gertrudis, bye-bye Brahman. My cow landscapes vastly changed.
IN Minnesota I lived in the southeastern corner of the state in a rented farmhouse surrounded by corn, soybeans and alfalfa. This was farm country, a quilt of small, discrete ownerships, decidedly more ordered than the cow country that makes up much of Texas. I drove around a lot in Minnesota, too, and in nearby Iowa, on birding trips or visiting remnant prairies or simply staring out the car window at what seemed to me a very exotic landscape.
People there either have small herds of beef cattle or keep dairy cows, of which the most vivid of all are the Holsteins. So bold, so black and white, so lovely standing on a greensward!
The main roads I travel now unfurl from urban Omaha into deeply rural terrain. It is a great base for a cow watcher. Omaha is four degrees east of the 100th meridian, the standard marker of where the West begins, which means it sits on the edges of two very different agricultural worlds. If I want cows in a Grant Wood landscape I go east; if I want something more along the lines of Remington or Russell, I go west.
A pleasant back road is Route 92, which heads east out of Omaha, over roly-poly hills straight into "Bridges of Madison County" country and the town of Winterset, birthplace of John Wayne. Though I seldom defend Interstates, I-80 between Des Moines and the Missouri River is quite splendid, and in winter it can be surreal. Everyone knows it's cold out here then, but few people appreciate how foggy it can get in December and January. When there is snow and fog, and the ground and sky are indistinguishable, it is the cows looming out in the corn -- most of them black baldies -- that provide a frame of reference.
When I head west it is usually into the Sandhills, an exquisite expanse of grass-stabilized sand dunes that occupies a large chunk of north-central Nebraska, via Highway 2 out of Grand Island. I am not the first person to remark that this is one of the most beautiful drives in America. For birding and cowing, there's nothing like a trip between April and June into the Sandhills, which combines an abundance of songbirds and waterfowl with an assortment of brown, blue-gray, brindled and brock-faced cows and calves.

A MOTHER'S PLACE
 Taking the Debate About Working Mothers
 Beyond Guilt and Blame.
 By Susan Chira.
 318 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $25. 
 Although I am not an expert on motherhood, I am an expert on motherhood books. I have lived long enough to witness about a dozen cycles of contradictory advice -- work/don't work; day care is good/day care is bad; don't work for the child's first six months/six years/lifetime -- that clarify one's perspective on the mom business wonderfully.
But it's also why reading Susan Chira's splendid book was both pleasing and depressing. Pleasing, because Chira, the deputy foreign editor of The New York Times, makes an eloquent, well-documented case that motherhood does not require martyrdom and self-obliteration; that motherhood and outside work are not only compatible but also beneficial to mothers and children; that day care does not harm children (on the contrary, it often improves their social and intellectual skills); and that much of what passes as "expert advice" is biased opinion, which is why it changes so rapidly with changing political climates and economic conditions.
"A Mother's Place" is depressing, however, because it makes me feel like Rip Van Winkle, awakening to the exact same arguments about working mothers that modern feminists were raising in the 1970's -- and that their predecessors were in the 1920's. Do we really need to be shown again that time spent with children is not the ultimate measure of good motherhood? That stay-at-home mothers who are bored, resentful, punitive, depressed or anxious about finances aren't going to be so great for their kids? It seems so.
The need for this book means that one of the most important messages of contemporary feminism and decades-old research in the social sciences has yet to penetrate even the skin of American culture: namely, that a mother's working does not, in and of itself, harm children. A woman (or, increasingly, a man) may want to stay home and watch the children develop; she (or he) may want to give up the corporate rat race. But this decision is a matter of preference, not a requirement for raising healthy children. Yet this preference is supported by a society that is still deeply suspicious of mothers who wish to work, need to work, or, God help them, love to work.
Chira wrote this book, she says, because she kept hearing "that what I wanted was impossible -- to be serious about both my work and motherhood." In the 1960's, women began to dispute the "cult of domesticity" of the 1950's, vigorously advocating that women could and should do both. That was news then. By the 1980's, after the mass influx of women into the labor market, the news was the women who were giving up their careers. Today the new news (again) is that women can combine work and motherhood. Chira's book, along with "The Sacrificial Mother," by Carin Rubenstein, and "When Mothers Work," by Joan K. Peters, is part of the latest turn of the wheel.
This endless debate about "a mother's place" could occur only in a culture that gives mothers no help, provides no universal and reliable system of day care, and then blames mothers for whatever they do: work (if they are middle-class), not work (if they are on welfare), work too much (if they are ambitious), or work too little (if they aren't ambitious enough and gutlessly take the "mommy track").
I mustn't be too curmudgeonly, however, about women's continual rediscovery of the mother-work dilemma. Motherhood, like illness, is another country: If you haven't been there, you can't quite imagine it. You can read about it, sympathize with those who have crossed the border, fume about the inherent unfairness of its burdens, but nothing takes the place of experience. That's why childless women can delusionally believe that having children won't affect their lives. And it's why they desperately start looking to experts for help once actual children arrive.
So, setting aside my sense of deja vu when reading Chira's book, I wholeheartedly recommend it to politicians, pediatricians, fathers and especially working mothers who feel buffeted by incessant criticism. These are perilous times for mothers who work outside the home, as revealed by the speed with which the trial of Louise Woodward, the au pair found guilty of the death of Matthew Eappen, was transformed into a trial of the baby's mother.
The national antipathy toward Deborah Eappen for having the temerity to work -- even if it was only three days a week, even if she came home for lunch, even if she taught her au pairs CPR and child-care skills -- is reflected, Chira demonstrates, in custody decisions nationwide. Judges routinely reward fathers who take any part in child rearing, and they routinely punish mothers who aren't home with the kids full time. Of course, staying home often means a mother doesn't have money to contest an ex-husband who sues for custody on the grounds that he earns more money than she does. And it often means that women won't have enough money in Social Security or pension plans to provide for their old age. But, hey, aren't women supposed to be self-sacrificing?
Chira's book is a harmonious blend of her own experiences, interviews and research. Her concerns about leaving her children in the care of others, her jealousy when her children turn to their father instead of to her for comfort, and her insecurity about how to balance work demands with those of her family will resonate with many women. She wittily dissects the baby-care advice biz, pointing out the stay-at-home bias of modern gurus such as Penelope Leach. And she highlights what social science has reliably indicated for years -- that there is no one right way to be a mother, that kids do fine as long as they get love and attention, and that parents are not the sole influence on their children, regardless of how much time and money parents lavish on them.
As Chira shows in her brilliant last chapter, "Reimagining Motherhood," it is time to drop that tired, unanswerable question -- "does working harm children?" -- and move to the more important one: how can we make sure it doesn't? It is time to replace "does day care harm children?" with efforts to make child care available to all who need it. Until we do, mothers will continue to feel defensive about the choices they make and blame those who make different ones. Who benefits from this division among women, and from blaming women for whatever choice they make? Those who want women out of the workplace and out of politics. Who loses? Everyone.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Tax Reform

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Anders Aslund (Op-Ed, April 28) suggests that the Russian state is still too large and needs further shrinking. He says that the Government "collected 32 percent of Russia's gross domestic product last year, the same proportion that the United States does." This is somewhat misleading. 
 The Russian Government collected 11 percent of gross domestic product in revenues in 1997, while the United States collected 23 percent. On top of that, Russian regional and local governments collected another 15 percent, and off-budget funds for pensions, health and social security another 6 percent.
Certainly, Russia needs to reform its system of public administration. But the federal Government also needs to increase tax revenue -- to pay its employees decent wages on time and to complete projects like the dismantling of nuclear and chemical weapons that are important to the United States.

HEADLINE: Income Gap Widens

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Economy Grew at Brisk Pace This Winter Despite Crisis in Asia" (front page, May 1): 
 Glowing reports on the economy obscure the struggle of the average worker and the widening income gap between the rich, the middle and lower classes. As of March 18, 1998, the average hourly wage according to the Department of Labor was $12.60 per hour, while in 1973 the average was $13.58 (in 1996 dollars). Since 1973 the average worker's salary has decreased in value, while corporations have experienced booming returns to the applause of Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Moving Up

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While the Urban Institute's disaggregation of legal immigrants, illegal immigrants and refugees sheds some new light on the immigration issue (news article, April 30), the disaggregation stops short of a more sensitive fact: immigrants from some regions do better than immigrants from others. 
 The report concludes that after 15 years of residence, legal immigrants in New York as a whole make more money and pay more taxes than natives, although they have higher rates of welfare use as they move into the economic mainstream.
The Rand Corporation's 1997 report, "Immigration in a Changing Economy," concludes that the income of Chinese, Korean and Japanese immigrants substantially exceeds that of natives after 10 years in the United States, while the income of Latin American immigrants is significantly below average after much longer periods. Few people take comfort from this disparity, but it is a reality that needs to be addressed.

HEADLINE: What Antitrust Is All About

BYLINE: By Robert H. Bork; Robert H. Bork, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, is representing Netscape in its efforts against Microsoft.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Rarely does a prospective antitrust case roil public passion. But since it became known that I represent a company urging the Justice Department to challenge certain of Microsoft's business practices, my mail has certainly livened up. One letter writer complained that I had sold my "sole." His spelling aside, that writer was at least kinder than the one who labeled me senile.
There seems to be a widespread impression that the Microsoft controversy should be resolved by an ideological litmus test: liberals are bent on punishing success, and conservatives must defend Bill Gates's company from any application of the antitrust laws. But the question is not one of politics or ideology; it is one of law and economics. And that is why an outspoken free marketeer like me can be found arguing against Microsoft. 
 Indeed, in Congress and among the players, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans are found on each side of the controversy. What, then, is the complaint of the many companies that are urging action by the Justice Department?
These companies -- customers as well as rivals of Microsoft -- challenge some of Microsoft's business practices as predatory, intended to preserve the company's monopoly of personal computer operating systems through practices that exclude or severely hinder rivals but do not benefit consumers. Microsoft's effort to maintain and expand a market dominance that now stands at 90 to 95 percent violates traditional antitrust principles. Specifically, it violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act, territory visited decades ago by the Supreme Court.
The case, from 1951, was Lorain Journal Company v. United States, and the Court's ruling is directly on point. The Journal, in the Court's description of the case, "enjoyed a substantial monopoly in Lorain, Ohio, of the mass dissemination of news and advertising." The daily newspaper had 99 percent coverage in the town.
"Those factors," the Court said, "made The Journal an indispensable medium of advertising for many Lorain concerns." A minor threat to The Journal's monopoly arose, however, with the establishment of radio station WEOL in a nearby town. The newspaper responded by refusing to accept local advertising from any Lorain County advertiser that used WEOL.
The Supreme Court called that an attempt to monopolize, illegal under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. There being no apparent efficiency justification for The Journal's action -- that is, no evidence that it resulted in an operation whose efficiency somehow benefited consumers -- it was deemed predatory. To those who say I have altered my longstanding position to represent an opponent of Microsoft, I'm happy to note that 20 years ago I wrote that the Lorain Journal case had been correctly decided.
The parallel between The Journal's action and Microsoft's behavior is exact. Microsoft has a similarly overwhelming market share, and it imposes conditions on those with whom it deals that exclude rivals without any apparent justification on the grounds of efficiency. In fact, the case against Microsoft is stronger, for there are many documents in the public domain that make clear that Microsoft specifically intended to crush competition.
We may not yet know all of the exclusionary practices, but we do know many. Here's a sampler:
* Microsoft's operating system licenses have forbidden "original equipment manufacturers" -- makers of personal computers -- to alter the first display screen from that required by Microsoft. Microsoft thus controls what the consumer sees. This restriction also hampers consumers' use of competing browsers to search the Internet or to serve as an alternative platform for other programs.
* Microsoft has restrained Internet service providers and on-line services, which are forced to deal with Microsoft because of its monopoly in the Windows system. For instance, it has forbidden service providers to advertise or promote any non-Microsoft Web browser or even mention that such a browser is available. Netscape and others are denied an important distribution channel to consumers.
* Companies that provide content on the Internet, to gain access to Microsoft's screen display, have been forced to agree not to promote content developed for competing platforms.
When a monopolist employs practices and makes agreements that exclude competitors and does so without the justification that the practices and agreements benefit consumers, the company is guilty, as was The Lorain Journal, of an attempt to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. When its own documents display a clear intent to monopolize through such means, the case is cold.
Netscape and the other companies seeking an end to these practices are not asking the Justice Department to take any action that would interfere in the slightest with Microsoft's ability to innovate. The department is simply being asked to stop Microsoft from stifling the innovations of others. The object is to create a level playing field benefiting consumers. That is what antitrust is about -- a view that should require no one to sell his "sole."

Bump in Road to Euro May Signal Trouble Ahead
A messy political compromise that marred an agreement among European leaders to adopt a new single currency is likely to leave world markets more suspicious than before about the fledgling euro, financial analysts predicted. But few expect that when markets reopen today investors will react dramatically to the squabble, which involved naming a chief for the new European central bank. 
Over the longer term, however, the incident may contribute to a feeling among officials of the new central bank that they must err on the side of toughness and higher interest rates to demonstrate credibility. Page D2.
 
Journalism Turns Inward
While the 1970's may have been the "Me Decade," a new study of news coverage over the last two decades shows that journalism in the 1990's is far more oriented toward the personal than it was 20 years ago, when Tom Brokaw interviewed former President Gerald R. Ford. D8.
 
History Yields Mixed Lesson
The Freedom Forum's Newseum, which is dedicated to demystifying the news business, has mounted an impressive monument to the profession. An exercise in comparative history that brought journalists and news makers together at the Newseum to discuss press coverage in 1968 was impressive in its own way. Felicity Barringer: Press. D8.

The Internet appears to be bringing together even stranger bedfellows than politics these days, with Bob Dole joining Ralph Nader in the fight against Microsoft, and Jack Kemp, long an opponent of government regulation, joining a freewheeling Internet telephony company. D4.
 
Data Pioneer Battles on New Front
An Internet pioneer who put S.E.C. data on line four years ago at no cost to computer users is now pushing the Government to make the nation's patent and trademark data base freely available. Carl Malamud says he will undertake the project himself as a guerrilla effort if the Government fails to respond. D6.

HEADLINE: Better Public Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If one person is unemployed and another person is earning minimum wage, and both live in poor conditions, should Federal housing policy punish the family of the person with a job? Your April 27 editorial suggests doing just that. Although the House and Senate are negotiating public housing reform, neither chamber's bill "redirects" assistance toward any group of residents at the expense of others. 
 The House bill lets authorities serve "working poor" families -- in which two people earn the minimum wage -- with vouchers. The Administration plan would force the working poor in many areas to compete for only 10 percent of the vouchers.
Our approach to public housing developments ends Federal preferences that resulted in the warehousing of the poorest of the poor. The real issue is whether this Administration and Congress are willing to make the rhetoric of mixed-income, healthy neighborhoods a reality for public-housing residents.
 
(Rep.) RICK LAZIO

HEADLINE: Chirac, the 'Bulldozer,' at the Birth of the Euro

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 3

 BODY:
If Europe gave out an award to politicians who shoot themselves in the foot, President Jacques Chirac of France might take the prize.
Two years ago, Mr. Chirac announced that France would like to rejoin the military structure of the NATO alliance 30 years after it pulled out. 
 Then he immediately made that impossible by demanding for France the senior NATO post in the Mediterranean, the Southern Command in Naples. It had always been held by an American admiral, since it would control the United States Sixth Fleet in wartime, and after Washington inevitably refused to give up the post, France decided to stay where it is: half in and half out of NATO.
Last year, Mr. Chirac -- whose conservatives controlled both houses of Parliament, the Government in Paris and most regional assemblies -- threw the electoral dice and called national elections in a gamble to win a mandate for austerity moves to get France ready for a common European currency.
The move was one of the most colossal blunders in French political history. Voters threw out Mr. Chirac's Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, and voted for a leftist majority in Parliament, forcing Mr. Chirac to share power with a Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.
This year, the Gaullist parties that brought Mr. Chirac to the presidency three years ago have collapsed in recriminations about accepting support in regional assemblies from the far-right National Front. Even Paris, a Gaullist fief that Mr. Chirac ruled as Mayor for 18 years, is now in danger of falling to the Socialists in the next municipal elections in 2001.
The President has long been nicknamed "the bulldozer." Franz-Olivier Giesbert, a biographer, once wrote of him, "Jacques Chirac charges through politics without baggage or memory."
And when European Union leaders gathered here over the weekend to decide to start the new European currency next year, the bulldozer went into action again, with results that had even some French officials shaking their heads in disbelief when the rubble settled at about 2 o'clock this morning.
Only a few years ago, Mr. Chirac opposed the common currency as an unacceptable diminution of French sovereignty.
But for more than two years now, he has been telling his compatriots that Europe needed a strong new currency to face up to the dollar on world financial markets and end the virtual dictation of international trading terms by the United States.
Germany, which has the strongest European currency to lose when the euro replaces the German mark four years from now, was a bit uneasy about the bluster.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl, battling for a fifth term in elections in September, needs to be able to reassure German voters that the euro will indeed be as sound as the mark, so he insisted on a European central banker with impeccable anti-inflationary credentials to run it: Wim F. Duisenberg of the Netherlands, which has pegged its currency to the mark since 1983.
Mr. Duisenberg was enthusiastically accepted as head of the new European central bank's predecessor institution in Frankfurt by all 15 European Union central bankers, including the President of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet.
But Mr. Chirac was furious at what he saw as an attempted coup d'etat by technocrats that would pre-empt him and his fellow European politicians from making the final decision. The Socialist Government, which wanted more political control over the independent European central bank anyway, supported him.
Mr. Chirac was also determined not to allow a candidate to be imposed by the Netherlands, a country that gave Mr. Chirac fits when he briefly resumed French nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1995.
The Dutch Prime Minister, Willem Kok, has also irked Mr. Chirac by demonstrating a lenient attitude toward marijuana and hashish in Amsterdam, where drugs easily find their way to France now that continental Europe has all but eliminated border controls.
Last year, Mr. Chirac nominated Mr. Trichet to run the new bank when it starts operations on July 1.
He maintained the nomination even after it became clear this year that only France among the 11 countries that will adopt the new currency was not prepared to accept Mr. Duisenberg for a full eight-year term.
Mr. Chirac bulldozed on even after Hans Tietmeyer, the head of the German central bank, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and other German leaders warned that his dissension was weakening the European central bank, and potentially the euro.
And he chugged into Brussels this weekend, his Socialist Finance Minister and Foreign Minister beside him, determined to force France's 14 European Union partners to agree to a compromise under which, if Mr. Trichet could not have the central bank presidency for the full eight years, he would at least have it for four.
On Saturday, Mr. Chirac was relentless in 12 hours of what a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called "hard pounding" for the only solution France would accept: an accord to let Mr. Duisenberg have an eight-year term but agree to step down after four years and be replaced by Mr. Trichet.
Mr. Waigel and Mr. Kohl fought the move as a fatal weakening of the statutory independence of the central bank laid down in the 1992 European Union Treaty to protect it from precisely this kind of political interference.
But in the end, they gave in, accepting a declaration by Mr. Duisenberg about his wish to retire before the end of his term that sounded like the kind of confession prisoners of war have been known to sign after prolonged torture.
"I want to underline that this is my decision and only my decision," said Mr. Duisenberg's statement, which was greeted with incredulous laughter by French, German and other journalists when Mr. Chirac and Mr. Kohl read it to them.
French and Belgian officials attributed some of the fiasco to the way that Prime Minister Blair presided over the discussions. Britain, though not in the common currency, holds the rotating European Union presidency until July 1, and some Francophones thought perfidious Albion might have been trying to sabotage the euro before exhausted leaders finally proclaimed it in the wee hours this morning.
"It's not good at all for the European central bank to begin like that," said Jose Maria Gil Robles, the President of the European Parliament, one of many who warned that the credibility of the bank, and therefore of the euro itself, could be badly damaged by the battle Mr. Chirac waged to put a Frenchman at the bank's head after 2002.
Some economists argue that if Mr. Chirac had deliberately set out to weaken the euro and strengthen the dollar, he could not have found a better strategy. Time and the money markets will tell.

HEADLINE: Democrats Agree to a Tax Package Including Rebates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 3

 BODY:
Four months ago, Democrats in the Connecticut House of Representatives dismissed as little more than an election-year ploy a proposal by Gov. John G. Rowland to send rebate checks of as much as $200 to thousands of taxpayers. On Saturday, many of those same Democrats swallowed hard and voted for a tax package with a rebate proposal strikingly similar to the one that Mr. Rowland, a Republican, had suggested in February.
The Democrats, who hold the majority in the House, were not making some last-minute conversion to the social benefits of handing out money a few months before voters go to the polls. Rather, they were acknowledging that Mr. Rowland held the political upper hand, and that their resistance had already wrung all the concessions it could. 
 This surrender left United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the likely Democratic challenger to Mr. Rowland in November, in an awkward spot, since she had argued that the rebate was politically motivated and a bad use of state funds.
Still, the decision to go ahead with the rebate can only help her fellow Democrats in the legislature, who also happen to be facing elections this November. "I think it's a very pro-incumbent document," said Representative Chris DePino, a Republican of New Haven and chairman of the state's Republican Party, speaking of the tax and spending plans that the state's House and Senate passed this weekend. Indeed, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle could hardly contain their praise for one another on Saturday.
What made fighting among the legislators so difficult was the projection that Connecticut would end the current fiscal year on June 30 with a surplus of more than $500 million, the biggest in state history. This would leave enough money for Mr. Rowland to achieve his top priority -- the rebate -- while also enabling Democrats to push for increased aid to cities, more money for public schools and greater property-tax relief.
The state passed a two-year budget in 1997, so this legislative session is supposed to address only modifications for the coming fiscal year. But the surplus made it possible to increase spending in both years as well as make additional tax cuts and rebates.
The difference of opinion over the rebate was between Mr. Rowland and Thomas D. Ritter, a Hartford Democrat who is House Speaker and a chairman of Mrs. Kennelly's campaign. The Democrats in the Senate did not object to the rebate.
In the horse-trading that occurred over the last month, the Democrats extracted sacrifices from Mr. Rowland. They won $40 million more for the state's Education Department, $12 million for job training for people being pushed off welfare; the Democrats also got tens of millions for a reserve fund to help the state through a future fiscal crisis. In total, the Democrats added about $67 million more in spending to the nearly $11 billion budget for next year.
The Democrats also stopped Mr. Rowland from making any further reductions in the income tax. Instead, Mr. Rowland agreed to increase next year the property tax deduction that people can take from their income tax to $350 from $285, a move that fits the Democratic goal of property tax relief.
"We got almost everything we wanted," said Mr. Ritter, adding that he could not let the politics surrounding the gubernatorial election affect his job in getting a budget passed. "The rebate was the Governor's priority, and he did everything he had to do to get it."
And it was difficult for Democrats to argue against it. The state had millions of dollars in surplus, and Mr. Rowland was broadcasting commercials insisting that taxpayers deserved to see some of it back.
Democrats whittled away at the proposal. They lowered the total being spent to $115 million from $125 million. They expanded the number of people receiving the rebate to 1.2 million from 800,000, a move that insured that more low-income people would get a check while lowering the maximum any individual would receive to $150. And the Democrats also moved up the date that the checks would be sent out from October -- just weeks before the election -- to July.
But ultimately, many Democrats in the House said, they had little choice but to yield to the Governor's will.
"You've got to understand that the Governor is the engineer who drives the train," said Representative Terrance E. Backer, a Democrat of Stratford. If the Democrats in the House had opposed the rebate, Mr. Backer explained, Mr. Rowland would have vetoed the budget, called them into a special session and attacked them for failing to give the people their money back.
Republicans praised the agreement this weekend as smart public policy. The money, they maintained, would reward residents who had seen tough times and give another boost to the state's booming economy.
Still, 19 of the 96 Democrats in the House broke ranks on the tax bill and voted against it. And in a unusual twist, they were led by the Democratic chairman of the legislature's tax policy committee, Representative Carl J. Schiessl of Windsor Locks, who delivered a half-hour speech against the measure.
"It may not be politically popular," Mr. Schiessl said of the rebate, "but I dare say there may be better ways" to spend the surplus. He said the money should be used to pay off state debt or pension fund liability, which ultimately would reduce spending in the future.
Whether that message will go over well with voters who get a check in the mail in July remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Mrs. Kennelly cannot count on the Democrats in the legislature to deliver that message for her.

HEADLINE: The Stuff of Memories And Manic Wit;
A Comic Revisits Queens, the Source Of Material for His Broadway Show

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
John Leguizamo was back home the other day, in what he once called "the large intestine that was Queens." He cruised down Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, past the Mexican mango vendors and the hustler pitching the services of a storefront fortuneteller. He pointed to the pet shop where he had tried in vain to steal parakeets. "They put locks on those suckers," he muttered resentfully. Up ahead, he stared, bewildered, at the man in the mangy chicken suit waving menus at the passers-by. "Maybe it has Hong Kong bird flu," he ventured.
Then, around the corner from the No. 7 train roaring overhead, Mr. Leguizamo swung down to Denman Street. He was 7 years old, he recalled, when he played at the end of this rutted cul-de-sac, while his mother kept watch from a corner apartment two floors up. He got into his first fight here and, he remembered with a little remorse, broke his little brother Sergio's arm. 
 On this breezy afternoon, a small crowd gathered around, trying to catch a glimpse of the star, trying to see if they remembered him. "Man, I lived there 22 years and I never seen you around," said James Newbold, 32. "You must have changed."
That he has. Mr. Leguizamo, whose latest one-man show is inspired by the flotsam and jetsam of Queens, is a celebrity now -- one who seemed a bit shy this afternoon, behind his silver wraparound shades. Jackson Heights and its Denman Street, where he lived for just a year or two, are only a memory now, feeding the bitter humor of his stage ruminations.
From the time his family landed here in 1969, from Bogota, Colombia, they shuffled from one Queens apartment to another. Every other year, Mr. Leguizamo found himself at a new school, making new friends once again, fending off new enemies, telling new stories about himself.
"I hated my childhood," he said. "People talked about memories. I had none, because I was new all the time."
In his first solo show on Broadway, "Freak: A Semi-Demi-Quasi-Pseudo Autobiography," Mr. Leguizamo, now 33 and living among the more fashionable tenements of the Lower East Side, remembers with a vengeance. And while the tales are his own, the memories are recognizable to immigrants of all generations, from all over.
He remembers parents with a rabid sense of ambition and enterprise ("immigrant drive on crack" is how he described it the other day). He remembers the run-ins with hostile neighbors in a borough much less diverse and welcoming to newcomers in the 1970's than it is now. He remembers being a misfit at home and on the streets of Queens.
"What a confused mongrel I was," he said. "So needy, needing to belong so bad."
On stage, Mr. Leguizamo is a maniacal entertainer, bouncing, dancing and darkly funny, prattling on in the voices of a dozen loony characters. But this trip back to Queens provoked as many poignant recollections as goofy wisecracks. Indeed, he seemed a little bewildered by this place he once called home and more than a little envious of the latest generation of young Latinos here.
"It's so much easier for them," he said. "When you're by yourself and somebody calls you names, you believe it. I thought, 'We are the parasites of the universe.' "
In the 1990 Census, nearly 25 percent of all youngsters under 18 in Queens were Hispanic; in 1970, the year after the Leguizamos arrived, the Census had not even begun tallying people of Hispanic origin. Today, Roosevelt Avenue is packed with telefonereas offering discount rates to Quito and Karachi. Colombian restaurants sit next to Indian sweet shops and all-night Korean diners.
Back then, Jackson Heights, once a white, affluent suburb of Manhattan, was just becoming a gleam in the eyes of newcomers from Latin America and a few from Asia. And like generations of youngsters who have crossed the borders of New York's ethnic enclaves, Mr. Leguizamo found there were few neighborhoods where a Latino boy could safely wander. "If you went this way too far," he said, pointing west, to Irish-dominated Sunnyside, "or that way," pointing east toward Italian-ruled Corona, "it was trouble."
In "Freak," he remembers these confrontations with scathing impersonations: the band of truculent Irishmen who approach with curled upper lips after Mr. Leguizamo tries to "riverdance up to" an Irish girl at a Sunnyside bar; the Indian merchant in Jackson Heights who tries to sell him "curry candy"; the brutish Italian in Corona whom he taunts with "a book of Guido jokes."
In fact, after several stops in Jackson Heights, Mr. Leguizamo's family took a step up the economic ladder ("Beans don't stick to the pan," he noted) by moving to Corona, then an enclave of second- and third-generation Italian-Americans who had themselves stepped up from the tenements of Little Italy and were not altogether happy to see the likes of young John.
That, too, has changed; in the 1990 Census, more than half of Corona's 75,000 residents called themselves Hispanic, and in the first half of the 1990's, nearly 12,000 newcomers, the vast majority from Latin America, made Corona their first stop in America.
During this afternoon's tour, Mr. Leguizamo's musings on Queens, past and present, burst out despite his insistence that he would maintain complete silence. He said he wanted to save his voice for the evening's performance, and he had brought along a laptop computer, intending to type out his observations.
(He had also vowed not to eat -- again worried about his condition for that night's show -- but he quickly broke that promise, unrepentantly diving into a plate of plantains and pork at his favorite Roosevelt Avenue spot, La Pequena Colombiana. In an E-mail message a few days later, he wrote that he had not actually digested the pork, but had had it surgically removed. "They're using it to feed a family of four in Bolivia who live in a zapato," he said, using the Spanish word for shoe.)
As for his vow of silence, he seemed unable to resist a running commentary. He cruised past a quiet stretch of 32d Avenue and pointed to the site of his first robbery, stealing cupcakes in the dead of night from a parked lunch truck. He swung down 80th Street, past Junior High School 145, his alma mater, and the park down the street where he learned to smoke reefer and listened to the stories of the older bad boys of the neighborhood.
He recalled his best friend back then, a Brooklyn boy who belonged to the Latin Tops posse and in whose company John managed to score some attention from the girls. Mostly, though, he did not. "Only the ugly ones, the ones with braces," he said, adding that he could not exactly turn them down. "I was a desperate soul. Beggars can't be choosers."
Young John seems to have been a magnet for trouble, though. Perhaps as a way to compensate for how hard his parents worked, he worked extra hard to have fun. He was arrested twice -- once for jumping a turnstile and once for truancy. "Now this was ridiculous, because I had only seen that on 'The Little Rascals,' " he explained. "Me and about 20 other kids went to see our first porn movie, and I was arrested before I got to see the opening credits. I love that sequence. The names are so cool. Steve Tool. Rod James. Anyway, cuff, report, Family Court."
Exasperated, his parents shipped him back to Colombia -- just as today's immigrants often do when they cannot handle their American children -- where he stayed for a year with relatives. When he returned, he was sent out of the neighborhood again and enrolled in Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in Manhattan.
He was already doing imitations at family parties, but his parents -- especially his father, Alberto, who after a variety of jobs eventually became a real estate broker -- didn't exactly encourage an acting career. His parents wanted him to go into accounting, "or some mundane, dull existence where I would surely have gone postal," Mr. Leguizamo typed during a lunch break, momentarily resuming his vow of silence.
A teacher in high school suggested that he try acting instead of acting out. He went on to study theater at New York University and dabbled in stand-up comedy before earning critical attention with his one-man Off Broadway shows, "Mambo Mouth" and "Spic-O-Rama." He played a cross-dressing diva in the film "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar" and had a brief run on television with the Fox sketch-comedy series "House of Buggin'." (His work in the 1993 clunker "Super Mario Brothers" received less acclaim, he notes.)
"Freak," playing at the Cort Theater through July 4, is by far his most personal venture. He calls it his very own "emancipation proclamation."
"Even the ugly pain has some great redeeming qualities," he explained. "Because now, anything that happens to me can't be as bad as when I was growing up. I feel like I can survive anything, and I have. You saw 'Super Mario Brothers.' Oh well, maybe not."
His mother cried for days after seeing "Freak," Mr. Leguizamo said; he had neglected to tell her what it was about. "If I saw my son write a play about me, from his point of view, I'd be in tears," he conceded. "And then, I'd get a switch and beat his little Latin buttocks till they were lox-colored."
With his father, "Freak" worked a small miracle. The two men hadn't spoken in two years when Alberto Leguizamo -- excoriated on stage as a boozy and bitter man who won't stop drinking because "I'm not a quitter!" -- appeared backstage after the show recently, his face as lox-colored as a bad boy's bottom.
"The blood was rushing to his head, and it distorted his features," John Leguizamo recalled.
Later that night, father and son drove around the city, screaming at each other and crying over all that had not been said in life. "Now I'm closer to him than I have ever been," he typed feverishly. "We go to lunch. I bring my computer. I swear."

HEADLINE: Behind I.R.S. Hearings, a G.O.P. Plan to End Tax Code

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The taxpayer abuse hearings that Senate Republicans held last week were designed to show that the Internal Revenue Service is out of control. And with tales of tax agents in flak jackets storming houses and forcing teen-age girls to change their clothes at gunpoint not leavened by any testimony from the accused I.R.S. agents, the case seemed overwhelming.
But the hearings were just another step in a much larger strategy by Republicans in Congress who have vowed to replace the income tax system with a new tax code. 
 The Republicans want nothing less than "to pull the current income tax code out by its roots and throw it away so it can never grow back," Representative Bill Archer of Texas regularly tells audiences. Mr. Archer is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, where tax bills originate.
In March, Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, introduced a bill, which quickly found many co-sponsors, that would repeal the Internal Revenue Code beginning in 2002.
The Republicans want to eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, rents, royalties and interest. Doing so, they say, would bolster savings and investment and help the economy. Opponents say eliminating such taxes would mainly benefit the wealthy.
The Republicans also want to eliminate the estate tax, which applies only to the richest 1 percent of Americans.
Polling has shown the Republicans that attacking the I.R.S. is their most effective tool to win votes in this election year and raise money. Mass mailings from Speaker Newt Gingrich and Steve Forbes, a magazine publisher who is seeking the Republican nomination for President in 2000, asking for donations to eliminate the I.R.S. and its abuses of power have brought in at least $3.6 million.
But even if the Republicans cannot find an alternative to the current income tax, the attacks on the I.R.S. provide political cover for them to make other changes in the tax code that, opponents say, directly benefit the wealthy.
A week ago Mr. Gingrich told an investment conference in Smyrna, Ga., that he will sponsor legislation to further cut the maximum tax on long-term capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent. Last summer the Republicans forced President Clinton to accept a cut in the long-term capital gains rate to 20 percent from 28 percent as the price for his education tax credits.
The Senate Finance Committee hearings demonstrated how the Republicans approach tax issues with what appears to be a clear strategy and policy objectives combined with marketing savvy that couches complex tax issues in plain language.
The Democrats, in contrast, remain in disarray on taxes, their public comments filled with the arcane lexicon of distributional equity and refundable tax credits.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and other Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee repeatedly described the I.R.S. last week as an agency with no checks or balances, ignoring laws that give the Justice Department control of all criminal tax prosecutions.
When Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, suggested that the hearings be expanded to investigate the conduct of the Justice Department and of the 90 United States Attorneys, who he noted are selected by senators, his remarks went nowhere.
Yesterday, two days after the hearings, Senator Moynihan said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation": "The I.R.S. is not out of control, it's just not under control. There is no management system." But Mr. Moynihan expressed confidence in Congress and in the agency's new director, Charles O. Rossotti, to create such a system.
The most significant testimony on tax policy came from three auditors who told of corrupt audits of large corporations in the Manhattan and Los Angeles tax districts.
In detail, but without naming companies or taxpayers, they explained how the system lets individual audit supervisors eliminate tax bills that can run to the hundreds of millions of dollars. They told of companies that had agreed to pay tax bills only to have those bills cut by audit supervisors who hoped to get lucrative jobs helping companies negotiate lower tax bills with the I.R.S.
One of three, Maureen O'Dwyer, an auditor who works on multinational companies based in New York, told of orders to purge audit papers that supported her findings of huge corporate taxes that were due. Ginger Mary Jarvis, another tax auditor in New York, gave details of influence peddling on behalf of rich individuals and corporations by former I.R.S. officials who now work in private practice. And Minh Thi Johnson told of orders to send unsophisticated companies bogus tax bills.
The Democrats complained that the hearings were one-sided and partisan. Mr. Moynihan noted that committee rules required that all senators receive copies of testimony a day in advance, but that Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is the chairman of the committee, kept the Democrats in the dark until testimony began.
Mr. Roth said he was trying to protect witnesses from reprisals by the I.R.S. His implicit criticism of the Democrats as allies of the tax agency went unchallenged by the Democrats on the panel.
Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat and a key player in efforts to restructure the I.R.S., said that the one-sided nature of the testimony carried dangers for taxpayers who want help from Congress.
He said that the I.R.S. restructuring bill that the Senate is expected to vote on this week may not be enough to protect taxpayers. He called for holding the bill in abeyance until the Senate hears both sides of the stories told last week. Mr. Roth brushed aside the proposal.
Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who was once his state's elected tax commissioner, issued a similar warning.
Despite these concerns, Mr. Moynihan said, the bill probably would pass the Senate unanimously.

U.S. Officials Pessimistic Over Middle East Talks
American officials continued to say they had little expectation for a breakthrough in the Middle East peace effort during meetings scheduled in London today. They suggested that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was not prepared to accept American proposals for compromise and that he thinks he can withstand any political pressure that might result from public American disapproval of his position. A10
 
Vice President Al Gore met separately with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, urging them to use the London meetings to break the impasse in the peace effort. Mr. Gore then took the message to Cairo, where he said the United States regarded the talks as "an important opportunity." A10 

Sharing Power in Bosnia
The surprising new relationship between two war-time enemies who have now become Mayor and Deputy Mayor of a Bosnian town is a clear signal of the political changes that have taken place. The sharing of power seems to be the beginning of joint local administrations to replace those created during the war, which were almost always made up exclusively of officials from whatever ethnic group had seized control of the area. A6
 
Afghanistan Talks Suspended
Peace talks between the Islamic militants of the Taliban and its opponents to resolve years of bitter conflict in Afghanistan broke down and were "suspended indefinitely," said the United Nations representative at the negotiations. A5
 
British Uproar Over Book
Thirty years after 10-year-old Mary Bell strangled two little boys, becoming one of Britain's most notorious criminals, the revelation that she was paid to cooperate on a forthcoming book about her case has created a furor around the country. With some Britons demanding that the book be banned outright, and others calling for bookstores to refuse to sell it, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that he would seek to change the law governing criminals' ability to profit from their crimes. A6
 
Japan's Premier Under a Cloud
As the bad news on Japan's economy continues, the Japanese are expressing contempt for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who started his term as one of the nation's most popular leaders. A poll issued last week by Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading national dailies, showed that Mr. Hashimoto's approval rating dropped to 24 percent, its lowest level since he took office in January 1996. A survey by Asahi Shimbun, another top daily, showed a majority of respondents calling for him and his Cabinet to be replaced. Mr. Hashimoto, however, has no opposition. A8
 
Remains Confirmed as Nazi's
DNA tests have verified that remains found in Berlin in 1972 are of Hitler's private secretary, Martin Boermann, who helped organize the Holocaust and who was rumored to have escaped Germany. A10

Republican Under Attack Over Edited Transcripts
Representative Dan Burton, the Republican leader of the House investigation into President Clinton's campaign fund-raising, came under sharp criticism for releasing edited transcripts of prison conversations with Webster L. Hubbell, in particular for omitting one passage favorable to Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Burton then said he would release in their entirety the conversations with Mr. Hubbell. A1
 
Attorney General Janet Reno defended her decision not to name an independent prosecutor to look into fund-raising by the President and Vice President. But Congressional Republicans said that they believed there was new information demonstrating abuses and that she should rethink her position. A16
 
Ground Zero on Preferences
Opponents of affirmative action have succeeded in placing a measure on the November ballot that would effectively end most such programs in Washington state. Both sides say the outcome of this battle will echo far beyond the state, where minorities make up only 14 percent of the population. A1
 
A Chocolate Scramble
With researchers predicting a shortfall in cocoa beans, the raw material from which chocolate is made, in as little as 5 to 10 years, an unusual alliance of manufacturers and environmentalists has come together to try to keep chocolate within reach. A1
 
Titanic Adventure Hits Snag
Operation Titanic -- a chance to spend $32,500 to go into the inky depths of the North Atlantic to view the rusting hulk of the Titanic -- may be blocked. Today, RMS Titanic, the American company that owns the salvage rights to the wreck, plans to file a motion in Federal court seeking a preliminary injunction against the company offering the expeditions and its officials. A12
 
Gay Professor Resigns
The Rev. David Garrick, a theater professor at the University of Notre Dame who disclosed two years ago that he was gay but celibate, has resigned, saying that this university so closely associated with Roman Catholicism has failed to embrace the broader Catholic family of gay men and lesbians.

Barneys to Try Again
After spurning various potential buyers, Barneys New York will try to emerge from bankruptcy court proceedings as an independent concern. The creditors' committee for Barneys, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996, is close to signing an agreement in principle among its members that would give the creditors and other investors control of the company, people involved in the negotiations said.

Fighting the Mob
A Federal judge is expected to rule soon on the request by prosecutors to bar Bruce Cutler, the boisterous defense lawyer, from the racketeering trial of John A. Gotti. The prosecutors say Mr. Cutler faces conflicts of interest as a result of being so involved with the Gambino crime family that he should be considered "house counsel." B6
 
Greeks Heal Schism
A 27-year-old schism between 30,000 Greek Orthodox, who follow the old Julian calendar, and their 1.5 million brethren in the United States, who follow the Gregorian calendar, was healed over a couple of hours of celebration in Astoria, Queens. The reconciliation, approved on April 7, was simple. Neither group had to give up its method of counting the days. The Old Calendrist clergy were reordained last month. The sacraments that they had celebrated were deemed retroactively proper. B3

HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Immigrants Lag in Housing Study

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Black and Hispanic immigrants -- particularly those from the Dominican Republic -- continue to live in New York City's most dilapidated housing, pay among the highest percentages of income for rent and have the lowest rates of home ownership, according to a study commissioned by the Fannie Mae Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered home-mortgage provider.
The report, prepared by the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law and released Friday, found that European, Russian and Asian immigrants tend to live in far better housing, though Russians pay more of their income for rent than any other ethnic group. 
 "European and Asian households experience a far lower incidence of housing-related problems," said Michael Schill, director of the university's real estate center. "Indeed, they usually have lower rates of housing problems than even native-born minorities." The study was done by Professor Schill, Samantha Friedman of the real estate center and Emily Rosenbaum, a professor of sociology at Fordham University.
The report found that 34 percent of the Dominican households are in homes with three or more major deficiencies, like rat infestation or plumbing breakdowns, while the rate for native-born blacks is 27.2 percent.
The study also looked at households in the most seriously dilapidated buildings: those that do not provide safe and adequate shelter or that have problems that normal maintenance cannot correct. Immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Latin America, other Caribbean countries and Africa top the list, followed closely by native-born blacks and mainland-born Puerto Ricans. (For statistical purposes, the study considered island-born Puerto Ricans as an immigrant group.)
The study said 47.2 percent of Russian immigrants pay half or more of their incomes for housing, followed by 40.3 percent of Dominicans.
Immigrants from the Indian subcontinent were found to be 12 times more likely than native-born whites to be living in overcrowded conditions, with Latin Americans 10 times more likely.
"We wanted to quantitatively document some of these conditions," said Patrick Simmons, a demographer for the Fannie Mae Foundation. He added, "It's important just to document which groups face which housing problems and, in particular, those groups like Dominicans who face problems across the board."
Factors like poverty, cultural differences and the propensity of immigrants to move into neighborhoods where their compatriots have already settled play a significant role in the substandard housing conditions they face. But Mr. Simmons said, "Even after you control for nativity, race makes a difference."
As Professor Schill said: "The proportion of Dominicans living in seriously deficient housing, 34 percent, is much closer to the 27.2 percent rate among native-born blacks than it is to any group of Asian or European immigrants. These data indicate that race and ethnicity play a much stronger role in influencing housing outcomes than merely being born in a foreign country."
Data for the study were taken from the 1996 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, which sampled 15,752 households, 5,933 of them headed by immigrants. The survey, conducted every three years by the Census Bureau under contract with the city, is considered the best source of housing data in the city.
Looking at costs, the study found that while more Russians pay at least 50 percent of their incomes for housing than any other group, black and Hispanic groups -- both native- and foreign-born -- rank second, third, fourth and fifth. For native-born whites, the rate is 20.1 percent.
Asked why Russians are at the top of the list, Dr. Rosenbaum said: "Russians move to predominantly white neighborhoods. In addition to Brighton Beach, they move to Forest Hills, which, of course, is more expensive than Washington Heights. So the costs of housing might present a heavier burden."
Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have the highest rate of overcrowding, at 28 percent, the study found. Overcrowding was defined as more than one person in one room, not counting bathrooms, hallways, unfinished basements and attics. Latin Americans are second in overcrowding, at 22.4 percent, and Dominicans place third, at 19.8 percent. Native-born whites have the lowest rate of overcrowding, 2.3 percent.
Dr. Rosenbaum said the high overcrowding rate among Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis may reflect the fact that among those groups, more males than females come to this country. "These men live together to share costs," she said, "or may live with family members who are already here. And culturally, there is more of an emphasis on sharing space than among Americans, so it may not be viewed as onerous."
The study also found that Dominicans have the lowest rate of home ownership, 5.7 percent, followed by island-born Puerto Ricans, 11.6 percent, and mainland-born Puerto Ricans, 14.7 percent. The study found that 21.3 percent of native-born blacks own their own homes, as do 42.9 percent of native-born, non-Hispanic whites.
Dr. Reynolds Farley, vice president of the Russell Sage Foundation and a demographer who studies immigration, said, "What strikes me quite clearly, particularly when looking at housing deficiencies for Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Caribbeans, Latin Americans and Africans, is that there certainly is the suggestion that the color line has something to do with housing opportunities."

Central Bank Chief Resigns in Thailand

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 4

 BODY:
The chief of Thailand's central bank resigned today after being linked to past mistakes that led to a plunge in Thailand's currency, the baht, depleting the country's foreign reserves by billions of dollars.
The official, Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, said his resignation would take effect on Tuesday. The Finance Minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, said he would nominate Chatu Mongol Sonakul, the ministry's former permanent secretary, to the post. 
 The central bank said in a statement that the deputy governor, Jaroong Nookhwun, had also tendered his resignation.
Mr. Chaiyawat is the third governor of the central bank -- now riding out its worst economic crisis in decades -- to quit in three years. He was appointed to the job in July.
The findings of a Government panel investigating the central bank's performance linked Mr. Chaiyawat to past mistakes during a period when he was deputy governor.
The panel said several other senior finance officials shared the blame for the baht's plunge last year.
The panel also criticized the central bank for losing billions of dollars in loans to debt-ridden finance companies, 56 of which are now closed.
Mr. Tarrin said he was forming a panel of international experts to help revamp the central bank. Those approached about joining the panel include former officials of the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Appointee Announces Plans to Quit Central Bank

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Federal Reserve Board since December 1991, said today that she would resign from the central bank on June 30.
Ms. Phillips's term expired on Jan. 31, but she had agreed to stay on while two new Fed governors, Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Edward M. Gramlich, were taking up their positions on the seven-member board. She is leaving the Fed to become dean of the School of Business and Public Management at George Washington University in Washington. 
 White House officials said they hoped to have a successor to Ms. Phillips named by the end of June. The position requires Senate confirmation. The Administration had all but announced a selection for the post several months ago but had to begin the search again when the candidate, whose name was never publicly disclosed, backed out at the last minute.
 Ms. Phillips, a former finance professor, was appointed to the Fed by President George Bush. She helped lead the Fed's bank-regulation activities and took a particular interest in assessing the risks of complex new securities like derivatives.
But Ms. Phillips, who is 53, was never influential within the Fed on interest-rate policy. Analysts who watch the Fed said she tended to follow the majority opinion within the central bank's policy-setting committee, which has long been dominated by the chairman, Alan Greenspan.
In her resignation letter to President Clinton, Ms. Phillips called for the nation to update its banking laws to reflect the rapid changes brought to the financial world by technology and globalization.
The House is scheduled to vote on the first major overhaul of banking regulation in decades on Thursday, but the legislation's chances of passage have been clouded by disputes among banks, Wall Street, insurers and regulators over the powers the bill would allocate to each.
"Given the significant changes and integration of the world's financial markets and of market participants, I believe that significant revision in this country's banking laws are now required," Ms. Phillips said.
Separately, Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent a letter to Capitol Hill today urging the House to pass the proposed banking legislation. The bill, which would break down many of the remaining barriers between banks, securities firms and insurers, is opposed by most banks and appears likely to face strong objections from the Clinton Administration.
The departure of Ms. Phillips from the Fed means that aside from Mr. Greenspan, who was appointed to a third four-year term by President Clinton two years ago, the board will have only one Republican-appointed member, Edward W. Kelley Jr., who was first appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and later reappointed by President Bush. The other four governors -- Mr. Gramlich, Mr. Ferguson, Laurence H. Meyer and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman -- were named by Mr. Clinton.
So far there has been little to suggest any tilt in monetary policy as the board has been filled with Democratic appointees. Given Mr. Greenspan's clout within the Fed, in Washington and on Wall Street, there is unlikely to be any as long as he remains chairman. The most prominent of Mr. Clinton's appointees, Mr. Meyer, has proved to be even more hard line an inflation fighter than Mr. Greenspan is.
The Fed also announced today that its longtime spokesman, Joseph R. Coyne, would be replaced when he retires on June 1 by Lynn S. Fox, who is currently the central bank's deputy Congressional liaison.

Currency Markets Largely Discount Maneuvers Over Euro

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 4

 BODY:
World currency traders today largely disregarded embarrassing political squabbles among European leaders this past weekend over plans to introduce a common European currency on Jan. 1.
On the first business day after 11 European nations signed an agreement to adopt the euro, traders initially sold currencies such as the German mark but later bought them back at the expense of the dollar, leaving them little changed for the day. Many European stock markets posted big gains. 
 Both the London and Tokyo markets were closed for holidays, which may have helped exaggerate currency swings as trading was thin. But the reactions still suggested that currency traders remained confident about the euro's credibility and were not particularly concerned over the back-room machinations Saturday and early Sunday over the leadership of the new European central bank.
Indeed, if currency traders took any cue from the political contortions that preceded agreement on the euro, it was to bet on a more conservative monetary policy from European central bankers. who may feel increased pressure to prove their toughness.
In the past, anxiety about a potentially weak euro has prompted investors to sell German marks and French francs and buy dollars, British pounds and Swiss francs -- currencies that will remain outside the monetary union next January.
Today, despite scorching newspaper headlines about the compromises that European leaders struck in Brussels over who would head the new central bank, the mark maintained its resilience. Late in New York trading, the dollar sold at 1.7803 marks, little changed from a three-month low of 1.7799 marks late Friday.
Although the mark's recent ascent against the dollar may have little to do with the euro, it suggests that euro-anxiety has not increased as the point of no return drew closer.
"The reaction was really positive," said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "It speaks to the fact that the euro is now a reality, and that the economic fundamentals are present for a strong and stable currency."
After months of feuding over rival candidates to head the bank, which will control monetary policy under the new currency union, France and Germany reached a much-criticized agreement early Sunday morning to split the first president's term between the rival candidates. Economists and many political leaders complained that the deal could undermine the euro because it violated at least the spirit of laws intended to guarantee the new bank's political independence.
Wim Duisenberg, until recently head of the Dutch central bank, will take the job first and retire about halfway through his eight-year term and make way for the French candidate, Jean-Claude Trichet.
Financial analysts generally agreed today that the unseemly deal making, which stemmed primarily from France's dogged demands that a Frenchman run monetary policy, represented a bad start for the new central bank.
But they also said that the markets' potentially negative reaction had been offset by several factors. For one, proposals for a "gentleman's agreement" had been widely reported and debated for weeks and the outcome was therefore not a big surprise.
In addition, both Mr. Duisenberg and Mr. Trichet are respected hard-liners on monetary policy, and the bank's other voting board members are almost all conservative as well.
Indeed, analysts said investors may have taken the political skirmishes as a signal that monetary policy would become a bit tougher as European central bankers will feel more pressure to prove their credibility.
"One impact of this could be a slight loss of reputation for the European central bank," said Holger Schmieding, a Merrill Lynch economist in London, "but this also slightly raises the risk that the German Bundesbank will raise interest rates earlier than it might have planned."
The Bundesbank has been expected to nudge up German rates late this year, to bring them closer into line with the higher rates that prevail in countries like Spain and Italy. But Germany's central bank has been hostile toward the idea of splitting the term of the European central bank's first president, and investors suspect that it might raise rates earlier than originally planned to shore up the new currency's credibility.
Mr. Ramm of Commerzbank said both the possibilities of a soft euro and of a hard-line reaction by central bankers had been overestimated.
Analysts pointed out that almost all the board members of the new central bank were demonstrated hawks who had frequently imposed restrictive monetary policies to suppress inflation and stabilize their individual nations' currencies.
"These are all technocrats, and they will probably behave like technocrats in setting monetary policy," said Graham Bishop, an adviser on the euro to Salomon Smith Barney.

Booting Up Africa

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Jim Lowenthal is wiring Timbuktu.
Mr. Lowenthal runs a small Internet company based in Morocco that has an unusual contract from the U.S. Agency for International Development. His job is to go to the most remote African countries and establish Internet nodes in their capitals so that anyone there can make a local phone call and get on the World Wide Web. He's already helped bring Mali, Madagascar, Mozambique and Guinea on line, and is in the process of wiring Benin, the Ivory Coast and four others, as well as helping design Internet access for Timbuktu, in Mali -- the city that is a synonym for the most obscure spot on earth. 
 "Timbuktu is a small town, but in the 14th century its university was a center of learning for the Arab world, because it was a key crossroad for caravans traversing the Sahara," said Mr. Lowenthal. "It's now a town of sand and shrub but with amazing archives that are piled up and deteriorating. The Mali Ministry of Culture would love to share them with the world but they never had a way. The Internet gives them the way."
Projects like Mr. Lowenthal's highlight why globalization can leave one simultaneously optimistic and pessimistic about Africa. Globalization does two things at the same time: It increases the gap, further and faster than ever before, between those partaking of the information revolution and the global economy and those who are not. So the gap between the Rift Valley and Silicon Valley is growing exponentially.
But at the same time, globalization and the information revolution offer an escalator from poverty into the global economy that also moves further and faster than ever before for countries that get the basics right. Global investors are always looking for the next great opportunity, and Africa has the potential to be that.
"What U.S. A.I.D. is trying to do," says Mr. Lowenthal, "is broadly disseminate the basic information infrastructure that will allow African countries to move from one step to the other. And the great thing about the Information Age is that you can move from 0 to 60 much more quickly than in the Industrial Age, if you get the basic digital information technologies. I just came back from Guinea-Bissau. It has one of the least developed telecom systems in Africa, but two entrepreneurs there just put up a three-story building that is completely wired. They're now running a computer training center, an Internet cafe and a marketing business for next-generation information technology solutions. You should see the colorful web page designs now coming out of Africa by their own Webmasters."
Sure, it's just one building in a big continent, but that's how it starts. Americans don't realize that when they go to the doctor and get examined and the doctor dictates his notes from the examination onto a tape, that tape often gets shipped on the Web to a housewife in Ireland who transcribes it in her spare time for a fee and then sends the transcript back on the Web. There is no reason, with some basic English education and digital infrastructure, that Africans cannot get into this lucrative area of telecomputing and data processing.
No, the Internet will not solve the problems between Hutu and Tutsi in central Africa or cure AIDS in Kenya. And yes, power in Africa still resides with those with the guns, not those with the phones. Africa's tribal and economic problems will not be solved overnight or on line. But all of these problems are related to, or exacerbated by, chronic underdevelopment, and the Internet gives Africans a new tool to leapfrog back into the game.
In 1977 there was a movie, "Black and White in Color" about French and German army units that were caught in West Africa at the end of World War I, but because the local newspapers were six months old, they never got the news that the war was over, so they went on fighting while the Africans watched in amusement.
"If they made that movie today it would be about how Deutschtelekom and France Cable et Radio were competing over who will get to privatize the telephone system in Senegal by offering the most connections at the cheapest cost," argued Mr. Lowenthal. "If you don't factor the Web into your analysis of Africa, you're going to miss something. We're just two years away from large numbers of people in Africa being able to tell their own story, and that has got to impact politics there."

Germans to Mourn Mark, The Symbol of Revival

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, May 3

 BODY:
Half a century ago, from the ration lines and ruins of defeated Germany, a new German mark was born. Like many a child of postwar occupation, the mother was German, the father a foreigner. The date was June 20, 1948.
But with the coming of a European single currency, its details agreed to at a heads of government meeting in Brussels this weekend, that 50th anniversary is likely to be much more of a wake. Among the 11 European nations ceding fiscal sovereignty as they shed marks, francs and pesetas for the euro, Germans will mourn the most. 
 Anyone seeking to understand why need look only at the tumultuous days when the mark was born -- not simply the new coinage of a fallen realm, but the infant emblem of Germany's regeneration as postwar Europe's economic colossus.
As the Brussels meeting got under way, the latest opinion survey here said 56 percent of Germans remained opposed to the new currency because its introduction, quite simply, meant the end of the mark that many people still associated with that first Volkswagen Beetle and that first postwar vacation in the sun -- the budding fruits of Germany's economic miracle.
"The Deutsche mark is the incarnation of 40 or 50 years of prosperity," said Prof. Klaus von Beyme, a political scientist at Heidelberg University. And as they contemplate a future without it, many Germans are reminded of a past in which inflation wiped out savings and left their parents and grandparents bereft. "Every monetary reform has been associated with a loss of money," Professor von Beyme said. "And people are afraid."
As of Jan. 1, 1999, the euro will be used in some electronic trading. By 2002, euro notes and coins will have banished not just the mark, but francs and many other currencies, in the one of the boldest financial adventures undertaken by a group of disparate lands.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl came under fire over the weekend for making a last-minute political deal with France to introduce the euro. Under the arrangement, Wim Duisenberg, a Dutchman favored by Germany, will step down voluntarily as head of the forthcoming European central bank after only four years on the job, to be replaced by a Frenchman.
Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party lambasted Mr. Kohl's maneuvering to placate France, asserting that the Chancellor had "lost trust over his foreign policy." Even allies of Mr. Kohl, including the Bavarian state premier, Edmund Stoiber, said the compromise had "thrown shadows over the start of the currency union."
The prickliness of Germans was perhaps not surprising, because in this country, the loss of the mark carries a lot more emotional freight than Europeans normally associate with pocketbook issues. Currencies, of course, are national totems -- just as the dollar is part of being American or the pound sterling, part of being British.
But the mark was always more than that -- an emblem of a new respectability after the horrors of Nazism, of success and prosperity and, above all, of stability.
As a measure of its meaning, consider, for instance, that the postwar mark -- the Deutsche mark in West Germany as distinct from the reichsmark of the Weimar and Nazi eras -- was born 11 months before the Bonn Government was created. It entered history on the front line of the cold war, at a time when many Germans were beginning to sense that postwar deprivation was coming to an end.
"After the war, there was nothing to eat, nothing to wear," said Erika Ritter, now a pensioner, who was 18 when the new money was introduced. "Everything was rationed and families would send their children into the food lines in relays, the queues were so long. We were given the new money with our ration cards, and the shops suddenly filled up with glasses, food, everything."
Indeed, a commentator, Michael Schmidt-Klingenberg, writing in the news magazine Der Spiegel, said, "The founding myth of the new state was not the Constitution, but the miracle of the store windows."
From its birth, with Americans and the other Western Allies as midwives, the mark molded postwar Germany as a land whose fortunes were intertwined with those of the West and of capitalism.
For 49 days from April 1948 onward, sequestered in an attic conference room near Kassel in central Germany, in a villa encircled by American barbed wire, a group of German financial experts, nudged forward by the Occupation powers -- the United States, Britain and France -- met quietly. As they met, rumors swirled about of an impending currency reform in a land that had no real currency.
And when on June 20, 1948, Germans in the west were permitted to exchange 40 old, virtually worthless reichsmarks for 40 of the crisp new notes (printed in Philadelphia), the Soviet occupiers of eastern Germany followed suit, issuing their own Ostmarks.
The dispute over which currency would be used in divided Berlin led to the Soviet blockade of the city, and to the beginning of the Berlin airlift. If ever there was an emblem of Germany's division, and a defining symbol for the split-up of Europe for decades to come, this was it.
Compared with some other European currencies, the mark has kept its strength: These days, one mark has 27 percent of the buying power it had in 1948. By contrast, the Italian lira has 4 percent of its 1948 value.
The fear of losing all that, perhaps, is why Chancellor Kohl has had some difficulty in persuading his compatriots that, as he frequently insists, the euro will be "as stable as the mark."

HEADLINE: Italy's Leader, Due on Visit, Praises U.S. for Backing Euro

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, May 4

 BODY:
Prime Minister Romano Prodi may well be the happiest man in Europe.
Only a year ago, Italy was disparaged as the biggest country least likely to qualify for membership in the European economic union. Two years ago, when the former economics professor was elected on a pledge to either get Italy into Europe or resign, he was widely dismissed as a hopelessly naive academic. 
 When he arrives in Washington on Tuesday for his first state visit, Mr. Prodi, 58, will be feted as the first European leader to visit the United States since he and his counterparts made the momentous decision on Saturday to go ahead with plans for the single currency, and as a statesman who, against all odds, led Italy into the euro. It was a remarkable feat and showed in Mr. Prodi political skills that rival those of President Clinton.
"Politics," he said with a convert's relish, "is beautiful."
In an interview today, Mr. Prodi beamed as he praised the United States for its "magnanimity" in supporting the euro, which, he warned, could soon rival the dollar as an international currency.
"Americans have been very, very generous," he said. "They have flashes of vision. Unlike Europeans, they have understood that long-term stability and simplicity should prevail over sectoral interests of the United States. The euro is in the long-term interest of the U.S., but we are building a competitor to the dollar, there is no doubt about that."
Mr. Prodi was so buoyant about Europe -- and Italy's up-from-behind inclusion in the euro -- that he could not help laughing at the dispute over the presidency of the European central bank, a tussle between France and Germany that largely overshadowed the historic drama of the weekend. "Given their grand and marvelous love-hate relationship, did we really expect the French and the Germans to say to each other, 'You first,' and 'No, no after you?' " he said, chuckling uncontrollably. "There is a folkloric aspect to the longstanding rivalry between France and Germany, which can even be entertaining."
He said he considered that the compromise reached at the Brussels meeting -- Germany's choice, Wim F. Duisenberg, the Dutch central banker, will split the eight-year term with France's central banker -- was by no means a serious problem. "Four years are a century!" Mr. Prodi said.
By Italian political standards, certainly, Mr. Prodi's two-year tenure is nothing short of a miracle. His coalition Government is the third longest-lasting in Italy since World War II, and his prediction that he can stay in power until the next parliamentary elections in 2001 no longer sounds so laughable to Italians. But having cut Italy's deficit, lowered interest rates and begun to reduce the staggering public debt to qualify for European membership, Mr. Prodi now faces a new host of challenges.
He must continue to cut Italy's debt -- which at 121 percent of gross domestic product is still double the European limit -- while addressing painful domestic problems like a 12 percent unemployment rate.
After holding their breath for the sake of European membership, Mr. Prodi's partners in his coalition, which is dominated by former Communists, are already grumbling about Government plans to cut Italy's bloated welfare state and demanding a 35-hour work week. Mr. Prodi, whose approval ratings rose to 60 percent earlier this month, said he was confident that he could lower taxes and unemployment rates during the next three years.
He said that Italians would continue to make the necessary sacrifices to reduce its debt, but that he was not expecting them to suffer unduly. "I've explained to the Italians that it won't be paradise," he said, "but a nice purgatory with air-conditioning and decent toilets."
Mr. Clinton is scheduled to see Mr. Prodi on Wednesday. Yugoslavia, and the crisis in the Serbian province of Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, will be high on the agenda.
Italy, which has strong ties to Albania and commercial investment in Kosovo, recently was host to a meeting of the so-called Contact Group, six nations that monitor events in the former Yugoslavia. The group agreed in Rome to impose new sanctions if Serbia does not agree to negotiate a settlement in Kosovo.
Mr. Prodi said that Europe and the United States alike want to put pressure Serbian and Kosovan leaders to negotiate a peace settlement, but that they differed slightly on "tactics," most notably the American desire for tougher sanctions on Serbia if it rejects peace talks.
But Mr. Prodi, whose coalition nearly collapsed a year ago over his decision to send Italian troops to restore peace in Albania, said Italy had earned the right to speak its mind. "We are fulfilling our leadership role in the region," he said. "We couldn't say that a few years ago."
Diplomatic relations between the United States and Italy hit a low point in February, when an American military airplane sliced through the cables of a ski lift in the northern Italian town of Cavalese, killing 20 people. Italian officials said that despite warnings, American pilots had repeatedly flown recklessly low in training missions.
The four crew members involved in the accident will face a military legal proceeding in the United States, and Mr. Prodi said that while he intended to raise the subject with Mr. Clinton, he was fully satisfied with American efforts to bring the case to justice and prevent future incidents.

HEADLINE: Smoking Foes Battle the Industry's Specter of Smuggling

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
In fighting the anti-smoking legislation before the Senate, the tobacco industry argues that the current bill would lead to a black market in cigarettes and a crime wave that would rival the rum-running and gangsterism of Prohibition.
Children would no longer be buying cigarettes from convenience stores or "stealing them from their mother and daddy," J. Phil Carlton, a top industry lawyer, said in a television interview last month. "They're going to be out on the street dealing with drug dealers." 
 No one doubts the potential for smuggling cigarettes. But advocates of a strong anti-smoking bill believe that the problem can be controlled through regulations and law enforcement and that the importance of deterring teen-agers from smoking outweighs the threat of a black market.
Many influential lawmakers have adopted the industry's view on the likelihood of a serious contraband problem. At a Senate hearing last week, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, held up a blue pack of Chinese cigarettes and declared, "The real concern I have is that we're going to be flooded with this stuff."
But other senators agree with Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, who characterizes the black-market argument as a "red herring."
At a hearing today, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, called the cigarette makers' specter of a black market "as false and misleading as the industry's past assertions about addiction, health effects and marketing to kids."
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told Congress last week that it was not groundless to fear that a black market could develop if cigarette prices rose steeply, as they would under a bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. But he said cigarette smuggling could be avoided if Congress enacted a rigid system of licensing tobacco wholesalers, exporters, importers and distributors.
Cigarettes, Mr. Summers said, should be stamped in such a way that law-enforcement authorities could tell at once whether they were smuggled. The rules would be similar to those now applied to alcoholic beverages. Government officials say that because of the regimen of licensing and policing, no serious black market in wine and spirits exists in the United States.
The Senate is tentatively scheduled to vote on the Commerce Committee's bill the week before Memorial Day, but Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, raised some doubt today about whether the schedule could be met. Mr. Lott and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, agreed that the prospects of getting tobacco legislation through the Senate were slim if it did not happen before Memorial Day.
It was unclear whether Mr. Lott seriously intended to postpone action on the tobacco bill or was using the threat to prevent Democrats from tying up the bill now before the Senate that would overhaul the Internal Revenue Service.
The potential for cigarette smuggling when prices rise steeply is apparent. Last month Sweden, which had one of the highest tax rates in the world on cigarettes, cut its tobacco tax by more than 25 percent to stop trafficking.
In 1994, Canada reduced its cigarette tax in the face of widespread smuggling. The Canadian experience is offered by opponents of the Senate legislation as the prime example of the threat of a black market in the United States.
Increased taxes imposed by the Canadian Government and the provinces had pushed the average price of a pack of cigarettes, in 1994 Canadian dollars, to $5.65 in 1993 from $2.64 in 1984.
By 1993, more than 60 percent of the cigarettes smoked in Quebec were contraband. Organized criminals had purchased Canadian-made cigarettes that had been exported to the United States and were not subject to Canadian taxes, smuggled them back into Canada and sold them at a discount. From 1990 to 1993, United States imports of Canadian cigarettes increased more than tenfold.
After the Canadian taxes were reduced in 1994 and a new tax was levied on cigarettes exported from Canada, the black market ceased to exist.
But that chronology does not tell the whole story. First, according to David Sweanor, a lawyer in Ottawa who works full time on anti-smoking campaigns, the number of cigarettes smoked per capita fell by 40 percent in Canada during the years the high taxes were in effect, half again as much as the decrease in the United States. The prevalence of daily smoking by Canadians 15 to 19 years old fell to 16 percent from 40 percent.
Moreover, the Canadian tobacco companies, affiliates of American and British companies, were complicit in the black market. When the Canadian tax was lowered in 1994, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said, "The fact is that the Canadian tobacco manufacturers have benefited directly from this illegal trade."
In the United States, the source of cigarette smuggling would most likely be Mexico, where cigarettes cost less than $1 a pack. Under the Senate bill, the average price in the United States, now about $2 a pack, would rise to at least $3.50 by 2003, taking account of inflation, and as high as $5 by some industry and Wall Street estimates.
The authorities are concerned because two American tobacco companies, Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, have recently bought interests in companies that make cigarettes in Mexico.
One way to prevent a black market in the United States, Mr. Summers testified, would be to make sure that the law penalized American tobacco companies if evidence of smuggling arose.
Smuggling cannot occur, Mr. Summers said, "without the complicity of those who are involved in the industry."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Sets Record, With Gains Mostly in a Few Companies

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Investors propelled stocks further into record territory yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting a new high.
But analysts offered mixed views of the market's rise. Although some pointed to optimism about the continued prospect for low interest rates, based on economic data released last week, others discounted the gains, which came in only moderate trading volume and were concentrated among a few large companies. 
 "This move is not as significant as other highs," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore.
"You're not seeing that broad conviction," Mr. Cripps added, noting that the Nasdaq composite index, which had been leading the market higher in recent weeks, had only modest gains.
Yesterday's gains may not have resulted from any strong belief about the prospects for companies and expectations of strong future earnings growth, analysts said.
"There's a big fear of missing the next leg up," said Jim Benning, a vice president and trader at BT Brokerage in New York. "It's more like a defensive kind of buying. I think they're more afraid of missing the upside than getting caught on the downside," he said, noting that traders who bought shares after last Monday's plunge of nearly 147 points saw the Dow rebound to end last week up 82 points.
After rising more than 114.25 points yesterday, the Dow lost more than half those gains, closing up 45.59 points at 9,192.66. That was still enough to allow the average to eclipse its previous record high of 9,184.94, reached April 21. Two stocks, Union Carbide and Eastman Kodak, accounted for half of the average's gains.
A computer-generated sell program erased 46 points from the blue-chip average in the final 30 minutes of trading, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. In total, computer buy and sell programs shaved a total of 38.63 points off the Dow and 5.06 points off the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a Birinyi official said.
The S.& P. 500 inched up 1.07 points, to 1,122.07, led by Philip Morris. The Nasdaq composite index, added 5.42 points, to 1,878.86. Despite the limited rise, Internet-related shares, including America Online, Excite, K-tel International and Lycos, again had strong gains.
As stocks wound modestly higher, Treasury securities were virtually unchanged, after two days of gains, as investors turned cautious ahead of Friday's employment report.
"It looks O.K. for a while, but I wouldn't stray too far from the door," said Peter J. Canelo, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
Although Mr. Canelo forecast that the Dow could rise as high as 9,500 to 9,600 before late summer, a number of factors, including an increased amount of cash flowing into investments and continued strong economic growth, could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to curb growth, he cautioned.
"This economy is just too strong -- there's no visible slowdown," he said. "All that this does is postpone the moment of truth until sometime in the summer."

HEADLINE: Union Upholds Trusteeship For School Workers' Local

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A union's appeals board has upheld a decision to put the local representing 22,000 New York City school cafeteria workers and crossing guards into trusteeship, finding that its president improperly took $1.1 million.
The ruling against the local's longtime president, Charles Hughes, was disclosed yesterday by Jean Nolan, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Mr. Hughes was suspended by the union's national leaders on Feb. 3. 
 Mr. Hughes, who is one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's closest union allies, has repeatedly asserted that he was owed the $1.1 million as overtime and expense reimbursements.
But the parent union's appellate board found on April 23 that Mr. Hughes was wrong to take the money because he did not provide documentation that it was owed him and there was no proof that the local's board had approved the payments.
Lee Saunders, a senior aide to the national union's president, will run the local until the financial situation has been cleaned up.
Local 372 is one of the largest in District Council 37, the umbrella group composed of 56 locals and representing 120,000 municipal employees. Local 372 has long been a political powerhouse because of its campaign contributions and phone banks. During last year's mayoral campaign, Mr. Hughes appeared in a commercial for Mr. Giuliani and held a fund-raiser for him.
The appellate board's decision comes as Mr. Hughes's local and seven others in District Council 37 are being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney or the United States Attorney in Manhattan.
The appeals board also found that under Mr. Hughes, the local's funds were quickly dwindling.
"The board found that the funds of 372 were being dissipated in a very rapid and increasing rate," Ms. Nolan said. "It determined that there was every reason to believe that this spending would continue at a rate exceeding the local's ability to pay."
In an interview in February, Mr. Hughes denied receiving any improper reimbursements. He said he had forgone a salary increase in the early 1970's and was thus owed 26 years of payments at $12,000 a year, with 8 percent compound interest added. Mr. Hughes, whose salary last year was $241,000, said he was owed hundreds of hours of overtime and compensatory time because he often worked more than 35 hours a week.
Mr. Hughes's lawyer, Robert Schmukler, said he might appeal the board's decision. "I'm saying Mr. Hughes did not improperly take that money," Mr. Schmukler said. "As far as I know he didn't get any more than he wasn't entitled to."
Mr. Schmukler insisted that District Council 37 was in part at fault because it wrote $1.1 million in checks to Mr. Hughes after the union leader had requested the payments.
"If they're entrusted with the money obtained by dues checkoff and they don't keep sufficient control, don't they have some fiduciary responsibility?" Mr. Schmukler said.
Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, said it would be irresponsible to respond to Mr. Schmukler's criticisms, because "there are judicial processes that are going on."
In January, Mr. Hill asked the parent union to suspend Mr. Hughes and create an emergency trusteeship because Local 372 was $8 million in debt and had not paid rent to District Council 37 for 27 months.
The case has been an embarrassment to Mr. Hill as well as to Mr. Hughes. Some union members have criticized Mr. Hill for waiting until Local 372 was $8 million in debt before moving against Mr. Hughes and for having District Council 37 guarantee a multimillion-dollar bank loan made to Local 372.
Although Mr. Hughes has been criticized for a life style that includes a BMW automobile and a luxurious house in Georgia, Mr. Schmukler said Local 372 members were in no rush to have Mr. Hughes pushed out. Mr. Schmukler said Local 372 was one of the few locals comprised mainly of part-time workers to obtain pensions for its members.
"Charlie Hughes has been president of this local for 30 years," Mr. Schmukler said. "He built it into a force to be reckoned with politically. Charlie Hughes gets people out there to work for politicians and then gets them to work for his members."

HEADLINE: Roukema Again Has Conservative Challenger in Primary

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 4

 BODY:
"Why are they doing this to me?" Representative Marge Roukema asked with a laugh of mock despair. "I can't explain it, and I am completely confounded."
But not too worried: On June 2, with 18 years in Congress from her Bergen County district behind her and the kind of seniority that makes most incumbents immune to challenge in a party primary, Mrs. Roukema, a moderate Republican on issues like abortion, crime and welfare, will again face a challenger from the conservative wing of the Republican Party. It is the fourth consecutive primary she has had to fight, and the fifth in seven elections. 
 Mrs. Roukema's race in the 5th District is one of only two primary contests to draw much party attention in a year when New Jersey politics has been dominated by state issues like auto insurance and school finance reform, and in which Congress has not made much news.
The other race is in central New Jersey's 12th District, where two Democrats are battling to face Michael Pappas, the only freshman on the 13-member state delegation. Republicans hold 8 seats, the Democrats 5.
If the past is any indication, Mrs. Roukema will beat State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett with the same ease with which she dispatched the last four party challengers she faced. But in a New Jersey election year that seems otherwise to lack any dominant political or ideological theme, the fact that Mrs. Roukema is again the only incumbent with a primary race underscores the almost open warfare that continues among Republicans over the fulcrum issues of taxation and abortion.
"It's the right wing of the party going after someone they think is vulnerable," a moderate Republican said of Mrs. Roukema, speaking on condition of anonymity. "She keeps winning, but they keep coming back."
Mr. Garrett, a trial lawyer from wealthy, conservative Morris County, with eight years in the Assembly, says his polling shows that Mrs. Roukema is too liberal for the 5th District. As to why she has always been re-elected, he said, "Marge has been the incumbent for 18 years and has never had a solid challenger in all that time."
He is emphasizing three elements of his Assembly record: that he was part of the successful vote to override Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's veto of a bill outlawing partial birth abortions, that he was the sponsor of a measure -- still locked in committee -- to outlaw homosexual marriage in the state and that he supported a bill to create a charter school in each district.
Mr. Garrett said he had never voted for a tax increase, and he attacked Mrs. Roukema's success in bringing Federal highway money to her district. "My view is that we should not be taxing at the Federal level for the things that New Jersey can do for itself," Mr. Garrett said. "New Jersey has done very poorly under Marge for the last 18 years, because we send more money to Washington than we get back."
Mrs. Roukema has countered Mr. Garrett's campaign by emphasizing that she is as conservative as Mr. Garrett on fiscal matters. But on the issue of abortion, Mrs. Roukema is unbending.
"If we're talking about people having a choice and not being controlled by the Government," Mrs. Roukema said, "this is so clearly an issue that should be strictly between the woman and her doctor and her religious counselor -- not the Government."
The strength of the conservative wing among the state's Republicans is also an element in the 12th District, which Mr. Pappas won two years ago even as President Clinton carried the district.
This year, even though the state Democratic Party did not bother to nominate candidates for Congressional races in the strongly Republican 2d and 3d Districts, the Democrats believe that they can field a winner against Mr. Pappas, who is campaigning against inheritance taxes and for a flat income tax.
"The 12th is the one where we would say all of the evidence is most conducive to our picking up a seat," said Rick Thigpen, executive director of the state Democratic Party. "Pappas is a little to the right of the voters in the district, he doesn't enjoy strong Republican support and we think he's vulnerable."
Mr. Pappas, in response, said he remained confident. "But I run scared in every election that I run in," he said. "I did that in the primary two years ago, that most people thought I couldn't win, and I won the general election even though the President carried the district."
But before facing Mr. Pappas, the Democrats have to get through a potentially bruising primary fight of their own between Rush Holt, a physicist and party favorite, and Carl Mayer, a wealthy maverick and one-term Princeton Township Committeeman who is running in his fourth primary race for a Congressional nomination. Mr. Holt beat Mr. Mayer for the party nominations from the five counties that make up the 12th District, and Mr. Mayer's persistence has created some ill-concealed dismay among party leaders.
"There is a grand opportunity out there for us to win against Pappas, but unfortunately we Democrats too often find ourselves circling the wagons and shooting at each other," said Alan Karcher, a lawyer and chairman of the Democratic Committee of Mercer County, which has the largest voting bloc in the 12th District.
Mr. Mayer contributed nearly $1 million of his own money to his campaign in the first three months of this year. He has rented office space and hands out professionally prepared brochures and campaign videos. Mr. Holt, who until October was the assistant director of Princeton University's Plasma Physics Laboratory, raised $114,000 in the same period. He said the 12th District, which was drawn by Republicans to skirt the region's Democratic-voting cities, represents the future.
"If the Democrats are ever going to regain control of the House of Representatives, it will be in districts like this one," Mr. Holt said. "This is where America lives, and this is where the issues that motivate Americans are -- education, the environment, will Social Security be there when you retire."
Mr. Mayer, who beat Mr. Holt in a three-way primary in 1996 but came in second to David M. Del Vecchio, said that his three years on a township committee trump Mr. Holt's lack of any elected office.
"I think the issues of the quality of suburban life cut to the core of this district," Mr. Mayer said. "The people here pay the highest auto insurance rates, they pay the highest property taxes, they pay the highest electric rate, they sit in traffic -- you can't say that the economy is doing well and nothing else matters when people are dealing with issues like that."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The New World Order

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
April 30 -- U.S. approves another $1 billion in aid to Indonesia as part of the international $40 billion economic bailout. President Suharto refuses to break up the multibillion-dollar monopolies controlled by himself, family and friends. He says no political reforms until 2003, at earliest. Police break up student protests.
May 1 -- Washington Times and A.P. say C.I.A. reports China has nuclear missiles targeted at U.S. 
 May 3 -- President Clinton's June visit to China will include welcome ceremonies at Tiananmen Square. Washington preparing to allow U.S. companies to sell nuclear reactors to China.
May 4 -- Human rights workers report continued oppression in China and Indonesia; more executions in China than in all the rest of the world.
The U.S., its democratic allies and major dictatorships are rapidly building a new world order -- not quite finished yet but already a central part of international life and values.
Its ideology, powers, rewards and punishments are supplanting those that prevailed internationally until 1994, when President Clinton joined the new order. If it continues, it will be the most important new international concept since the end of World War II.
The order was created without formal parliamentary approval by its sponsors, or any treaty. But every week, sometimes every day, the underlying tenets are revealed, in action. See above.
The following description of objectives and goals of the new order is so different from principles recently assumed in the West, though not always followed, that it may read as satire. It is not.
The fundamental change, demanded by the dictatorships and agreed to in practice by the democracies, is that the internal policies of persecution by the rulers, and the rights of the governed, are not a primary moral or economic consideration of the world.
The democracies, under these values, can protest some internal acts of the dictatorships -- torture and such. But they must do so quietly, not allowing these acts, or often even security interests, to damage the new overriding value of the democratic leaders.
That value is the trade and investment with the dictatorships that the democracies believe important to their national economies -- which are sometimes called jobs, but usually interpreted as corporate profit.
In exchange, dictatorships allow democracies to invest and trade in enterprises the capitalists consider profitable to their corporate strength, although not necessarily to their own employees or the national economic health of their countries.
If the dictatorships, or authoritarian governments as some are known more pleasantly, find their economies collapsing through the corruption generic to such societies, the International Monetary Fund and individual democracies rush to arrive with bailout.
The explanation given is that otherwise the dictatorships' economies would disintegrate, bringing revolution. Now, the people of the dictatorships may long for revolution. Obviously that cannot be allowed to overcome saving the dictatorship and thus rescuing the money invested by nationals of democracies.
Accepting these values, the events dated above become understandable, and even neatly logical.
The Indonesian dictator, for instance, was installed by the army 33 years ago and has been in power ever since. Now he needs scores of billions with which to overcome his own ineptitude and family corruption, and do the right thing by his foreign investors. Who can deny him?
The U.S. gets to sell strategic material to China, offering as an extra a visit by the U.S. President to honor the Communist leaders and expand their power and political life span.
Religious and political mavericks in the totalitarian partners of the new world order get prison, or death, often both.
The press of the democracies gets to write stories about the growth of order in the new order. Other citizens of the democracies get to say costs of imported goods are down, how nice.
Americans and Europeans may come to object for political or moral reasons, or because the new world order may after all cost them their jobs. But they will never be able to say they never knew; see above.

 BODY:

Friendly $3.6 Billion Bid Could End Brawl for Echlin
Dana made a friendly $3.6 billion stock offer to acquire Echlin, a smaller rival in the auto parts industry and the target of a hostile $3.1 billion bid of cash and stock from SPX. Echlin shares rose 8.4 percent and Dana fell 5.2 percent. The bid could end a takeover battle that began nearly three months ago.
Echlin would, in effect, become a seventh business unit at Dana. Echlin's chairman and president, Larry W. McCurdy, would be named president of the Echlin Strategic Business division and would lead Dana's entry into the aftermarket, where Dana has little presence. Page D2. 

Dow Hits Record in Cautious Market
The Dow Jones industrial average posted a new high of 9,192.66, up 45.59 points. But some analysts were not impressed, noting that volume was moderate and that the gains came mainly from a handful of blue chips, notably Union Carbide and Eastman Kodak. D12.
 
The Treasury market ended its two-day rally, as investors grew wary ahead of a jobs report due Friday. The yield on the long bond was unchanged at 5.93 percent. D12.
 
ARCO in $2.47 Billion Deal
Atlantic Richfield, which has been under pressure to find new oil reserves, said that it would acquire Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, an independent oil company based in Houston, for $29 a share, or $2.47 billion in cash, plus the assumption of debt and preferred stock. D4.
 
Merrill Settles Discrimination Suit
Merrill Lynch and lawyers for female brokers who sued the nation's largest securities firm for gender discrimination reached a settlement that awards the plaintiffs $600,000 and abolishes Merrill's mandatory arbitration process. The settlement affects 2,500 of the firm's current or former brokers. D11.
 
Fed Governor Resigning
Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 1991, said she would resign from the central bank on June 30. Aside from Alan Greenspan, the chairman named to a third four-year term by President Clinton two years ago, the Fed will then have only one Republican-appointed member, Edward W. Kelley Jr. D2.
 
Tobacco Suit Settlement Sought
Tobacco companies and an insurer have stepped up talks to settle Minnesota's lawsuit against the tobacco industry, lawyers with direct knowledge of the talks said. The state would receive $500 million to $1 billion more than the $4 billion it would have collected under last June's proposed $368.5 billion deal between the industry and 40 states. A28.
 
Traders Dismiss Euro Rancor
World currency traders largely disregarded embarrassing political squabbles among European leaders over plans to introduce a common European currency Jan. 1. European central bankers are expected to face increased pressure to maintain a conservative monetary policy to defend the euro's credibility. D6.
 
Price Shock in Indonesia
President Suharto's Government said it would raise the price of fuel and electricity by as much as 70 percent. The announcement, which shocked many Indonesians, was clearly timed to coincide with the I.M.F.'s decision to restore $1 billion in aid to the country. A6.
 
China's exports and foreign investment surged in the first quarter, defying predictions of harm from neighboring economic crises. D7.

HEADLINE: Clinton Unveils Plan to Help Households in U.S. Use Less Fuel

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 4

 BODY:
President Clinton today announced a Government-industry initiative to reduce the gases that contribute to global warming by making homes in the United States more fuel-efficient.
The goal of the program is to cut household energy use in new homes by 50 percent by 2010 through better windows and insulation, energy-saving appliances and more efficient heating and cooling systems. 
 The plan would also help owners of 15 million existing homes cut their energy use by 30 percent by 2010.
The program needs little new money, relying instead on existing tax credits and Federal research money to help spur the development and use of more efficient building technology. The plan is part of the Administration's five-year, $6.3 billion proposal to help the United States reach greenhouse gas emission targets set at the environmental conference in December in Kyoto, Japan.
That plan faces stiff opposition from business groups and Republicans in Congress, many of whom believe the alarms over global warming are overblown and think the proposed solutions will cost businesses billions of dollars and will slow economic growth.
Speaking at a San Fernando Valley site where 186 energy-efficient homes are to be built, the President said that there was "virtual unanimity" among scientists that greenhouse gas emissions were rising at a dangerous rate. He said that while vehicles and industry account for two-thirds of global warming, residential housing contributes 20 percent of the total emissions.
The President said the new program, the Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing, or PATH, would save consumers as much as $11 billion a year in home energy costs and reduce annual carbon emissions by 24 million tons. That represents about 5 percent of annual carbon emissions in the United States, officials said.
"It will be the most ambitious effort ever to help private home builders and homeowners make cost-effective, energy-saving decisions that will pay big dividends throughout the 21st century," Mr. Clinton said.
Earlier today, Mr. Clinton spoke against a California ballot initiative that would limit unions' ability to use dues from members for contributions to candidates or other political activities. The proposal would require unions, as well as corporations, to get employees' consent in writing each year to use payroll deductions or union dues for political action.
Republicans in Congress argue that such a requirement should be part of any Federal campaign finance legislation. But since little appears to be happening in Washington, opponents of unions' political spending are pushing the issue in several states.
The California measure, Proposition 226, is backed by business groups and Republican politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson. It also has support from union members, according to California polls.
The Clinton Administration and labor leaders oppose the measure, saying it would limit the ability of unions to match business groups' political spending.
"This is just an attempt to put unions at a disadvantage to other organized groups in the political marketplace and thereby to diminish the voice of working men and women," Mr. Clinton said at a breakfast to raise money to fight the measure.
Mr. Clinton returns to Washington tonight, after a stop in Chicago to raise money for the re-election campaign of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois.

HEADLINE: A Plot on Castro Spotlights A Powerful Group of Exiles

BYLINE: By ANN LOUISE BARDACH and LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., May 3

 BODY:
When the Coast Guard approached the cabin cruiser La Esperanza near Puerto Rico last October, the four Cuban exiles aboard said they were on a fishing trip.
But the only fishing gear on the boat was still in plastic wrappers, and the men said they had sailed the 900 miles from Miami in a single day -- a nautical improbability in their vessel. 
 Suspicions aroused, the Coast Guard escorted the boat to shore, searched it, and found beneath a throw rug a secret compartment built into the stairs leading to the cabins. Inside was an arsenal of weapons, including nightscopes and two high-powered sniper rifles.
With that, one of the men aboard blurted out an explanation that prompted their immediate arrest.
"These weapons are mine," Angel Alfonso Aleman was quoted as saying by a United States Customs investigator who searched the ship and later testified in court about the remark. "The others know nothing about them. I placed them there myself. They are weapons for the purpose of assassinating Fidel Castro. "
The incident touched off a widening Federal investigation that Government officials say has led authorities to one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the United States, the Cuban-American National Foundation.
The group, which has raised more than $1 million for both Republicans and Democrats, has publicly advocated nonviolent approaches to foment change in Cuba and has forged close ties to every President since Ronald Reagan.
Its combative chairman and founder, Jorge Mas Canosa, was the behind-the-scenes architect of America's hard-line policies on Cuba before his death last year from lung cancer.
President Clinton met privately with two of the foundation's leaders at a fund-raiser in Miami last year, shortly after Federal investigators had begun to examine the group's possible role in a plot to kill Mr. Castro.
Investigators began scrutinizing the foundation shortly after the discovery of the weapons aboard La Esperanza.
The navigational coordinates aboard the boat were set for Margarita Island off Venezuela, where Mr. Castro and other Latin American leaders were to meet for a summit meeting in early November.
One of two .50 caliber Barrett assault rifles seized on board turned out to be registered to Francisco (Pepe) Hernandez, president of the the foundation, according to an F.B.I. report. The tan 46-foot cabin cruiser itself, Florida state records show, belonged to a company owned by Jose Antonio Llama, a member of the foundation's executive board. The boat set sail from Coral Gables, Fla., from the private dock of another foundation member whose business partner is the group's treasurer.
 
Two Are Notified They Are Targets
Since then, according to lawyers involved in the case, both Mr. Hernandez and Mr. Llama have been notified that they are targets of a Federal investigation, a formal step prosecutors take when they are seriously considering an indictment. Neither man was aboard the boat.
Ninoska Perez, a spokesman, said the foundation and its leaders had no comment on any aspect of the case.
"You can publish whatever you want, but we're not going to make any comment whatsoever," Manuel Vazquez, a Miami lawyer who represents Mr. Hernandez, said in response to a request for his client's version of events.
Jose Antonio Pagan, who represents Mr. Llama, acknowledged that his client owns the company that owns La Esperanza and that he was asked to supply fingerprint and handwriting samples to the F.B.I., but that he "definitely denied" he had sought to kill the Cuban leader.
The lawyer representing Mr. Alfonso, Ricardo Pesquera, warned in an interview that should the Justice Department try his client, "we will go after the Government very strongly" and "attack their hypocrisy." Brandishing a sheaf of declassified C.I.A. documents about Government efforts to overthrow the Cuban leader, he complained that "for 30 years they tried to kill Castro and now they say others can't do the very same thing they were doing."
The only charges brought in the case thus far were against the four men arrested aboard La Esperanza, who have been accused of conspiracy to commit murder, weapons smuggling and making false statements.
At a pretrial hearing, defense lawyers persuaded a judge here to dismiss the conspiracy charge on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. But defense lawyers and Federal investigators say they expect the conspiracy charges will be reinstated in a more detailed indictment. And one investigator predicted that the case would expand.
"You don't go out on a fishing expedition with .50 caliber weapons," said Hector M. Pesquera, chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in San Juan. "It doesn't compute. We have got to pursue this. Most likely, additional defendants and counts will be added."
In those circumstances, he continued, "there could be foreign policy implications." He added, "We are not ruling anything out."
 
A Leader's Death Leaves a Vacuum
The inquiry comes at an especially delicate and troubling time for the Cuban-American National Foundation.
Since its founding in 1981, the group has argued to America's 1.5 million Cuban-Americans that the most effective way they can undermine Mr. Castro is through lobbying and legislation in Washington.
In August, the foundation startled some in Miami when it declined to condemn a string of bombings ofhotels and restaurants in Cuba.
The death of Mr. Mas Canosa has left it with a leadership vacuum that remains unfilled.
In addition, Miami-Dade County is now investigating irregularities and possible overcharges in a $58 million contract awarded to the Mas family business, and Congress is considering new legislation that would somewhat loosen the 36-year economic embargo against Cuba that the foundation vigorously supports.
If the Federal inquiry establishes that its leaders supported commando activities against Mr. Castro or the Cuban Government, that would weaken the organization's credibility on Capitol Hill and leave an opening for those who favor a less confrontational approach to Cuba.
Among the items Customs and Coast Guard officials found aboard La Esperanza were seven boxes of ammunition, military fatigues, six portable radios, a satellite telephone, night vision goggles, nightscopes and the two assault rifles, which sell for about $7,000 apiece and can hit a target more than mile away. Extra fuel tanks holding an additional 2,000 gallons of fuel had also been built into the vessel.
Shortly after the boat's seizure on Oct. 27, numerous news organizations in Miami received anonymous telephone calls or letters asserting that the assassination plot against Mr. Castro was an attempt to grant Mr. Mas Canosa a deathbed wish.
 
A Man's Self-Portrait: 'A Cuban Patriot'
In a series of interviews at his home in Union City, N.J. and here, Mr. Alfonso said that, on his lawyer's advice, he could not discuss the statements that Government officials have attributed to him. But he made no secret of his loathing of Mr. Castro and his admiration for Mr. Mas Canosa, whom he described as "a true leader who dedicated his life to the struggle."
"I am a Cuban patriot," said Mr. Alfonso, who now works at a textile company in Union City. Referring to his fight against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, he added: "I was a revolutionary, and I am a revolutionary. But I was not a Fidelista."
Mr. Alfonso, 57, who is an active member of the Association of Former Prisoners, a fraternity of some 300 veterans of Cuban jails, said he had visited the White House on four occasions, "once with Reagan, once with Bush, and twice with Clinton."
With pride, he produced a photograph of himself alone with Mr. Clinton, as well as other pictures that show him with Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey; Mr. Mas Canosa, and Felix Rodriguez, the C.I.A. agent who captured Che Guevara and later became embroiled in the Iran-contra affair. The photo with the President was taken two years ago at a White House ceremony for the signing of the Helms-Burton Act, which expands the American embargo against Cuba.
A passionate, voluble man with courtly manners, Mr. Alfonso scoffed at the notion that he was acting on behalf of Mr. Mas Canosa or anyone else. "Nobody can use me," he said. "I think for myself."
He said that he first met Mr. Mas Canosa in Miami in 1980, just before the Cuban-American National Foundation was founded, and last saw him about six months before his death, when Mr. Mas Canosa visited Mr. Alfonso's group in Union City.
Because of his anti-Castro activities, Mr. Alfonso served 18 years in Cuban prisons, where he first met Francisco S. Cordova, one of the men arrested with him aboard La Esperanza. Mr. Cordova, in turn, told F.B.I. investigators that he had been a friend since childhood of Angel Hernandez Rojo, the captain of the vessel, and knew Mr. Llama, the owner of the boat, through what an F.B.I. document described as "casual social contacts."
Both Mr. Hernandez Rojo and Mr. Llama took part in the C.I.A.'s Bay of Pigs operation in 1961.
 
12 Mysterious Bullets: Where's the Gun?
According to an F.B.I. report, Mr. Cordova, 50, a fisherman who lives in the Florida Keys town of Marathon, said he was on the trip to sell the vessel on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia and was unaware of the arms on board.
He was quoted as saying that had he known, "he would have discarded them overboard" when approached by the Coast Guard, "a technique," the report said, "commonly utilized by Cuban exiles when confronted by law enforcement on the high seas."
In fact, investigators are puzzled by the presence on the boat of 12 rounds of .357 bullets with no corresponding pistols, and suspect that at least one gun may have been tossed overboard.
All four men were eventually released on bail. Mr. Alfonso said his $50,000 bail and a $50,000 retainer for a lawyer "was paid by Cuban exile groups and individuals" in the United States, though he declined to be more specific.
As part of their investigation, Federal agents have been looking into the flow of money in and out of a Miami bank account in the name of Juan Bautista Marquez, 62, a former merchant marine who runs a boat rental business in Cancun, Mexico, and was the fourth man aboard the vessel. Investigators have submitted those records to the grand jury here, focusing on a $2,000 transfer into the account in July 1997, court documents show. The source of money has not yet been publicly identified.
Mr. Marquez's lawyer, Juan Massini, said his client was asked by an acquaintance he knew as "Mr. Otero" to sail the boat for Mr. Llama for a fee of $2,000. Mr. Marquez, who was retained to be the navigator, knew both Mr. Hernandez Rojo and Mr. Cordova, Mr. Massini said, but had never met Mr. Alfonso before La Esperanza set sail.
The seriousness that the Government attaches to the case can be measured by the number of agencies collaborating in the investigation. Government officials say these include the United States Attorney here, Customs, the Coast Guard, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Maritime Enforcement Agency, the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the State Department. The prosecution is being directed by Miguel Pereira of the division of violent crimes and terrorism at the Justice Department's Washington headquarters.
 
Two Different Accounts Of the Boat's Voyage
Government investigators acknowledge that the case began by sheer chance. The Coast Guard cutter Baranof was making a routine patrol off northwestern Puerto Rico when it spotted La Esperanza. Only after the captain gave an incorrect registration number and asserted that La Esperanza had sailed from Miami in a single day was it decided to board the vessel.
Initially, the captain, Mr. Hernandez Rojo, said that the purpose of he and the others "was to go fishing," but that they had run into bad weather and were turning back because a pump had failed and they were taking on water. However, when investigators contacted Mr. Llama, the boat's owner, in Miami, he told them the four men were on their way to Venezuela to sell the vessel.
"They were looking for drugs, frankly," one official said of the Coast Guard "When four men on a boat in trouble tell you a funky story, we look for drugs."
Once the arms cache was found, Mr. Alfonso, described as visibly agitated, also acknowledged a Venezuelan connection. "I have a contact on Margarita," Federal agents said he told them, referring to the island where Mr. Castro and leaders of more than 20 other countries were scheduled to meet on Nov. 7-9.
"Look at all the entries in my passport going to Venezuela," the agents testified that Mr. Alfonso also said. "Do you think I went there on vacation?"
After the arrest, the Venezuelan Government made an unusually thorough security sweep on Margarita Island. All Cuban exiles found on the island were taken into custody and forced to leave, though the reason for those actions was never made public.
As for Mr. Alfonso, the incident does not appear to have diminished his devotion to the anti-Castro cause.
"I love life, I love my children," he said. Then, pressing his hand to his heart, he added: "But the most important thing are my principles, and for these I am prepared to sacrifice everything and return to jail. I am not afraid. I am at peace with my conscience."

HEADLINE: COLLEGES;
Assistant Coaches Win N.C.A.A. Suit; $66 Million Award

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A Federal jury in Kansas awarded more than $66 million yesterday to 1,900 assistant college coaches whose salaries were found to have been illegally restricted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The penalty, which included more than $22 million in back wages, penalties and legal fees that were tripled under Federal antitrust law, was by far the largest court assessment against the association, which regulates and administers major intercollegiate sports.
The verdict came after five years of often tortuous legal wrangling, in which the coaches contended that a blanket rule imposed by the N.C.A.A. in 1992 to restrict the salaries of certain assistant coaches to $12,000 for an academic year had stifled competition and deprived them of fair market wages. 
 The N.C.A.A., which said yesterday that it was considering appealing the award, had established the salary limit for certain assistant coaches at the 300 major athletic programs that make up Division I college sports as a way of containing costs.
The N.C.A.A. likened the lower-tier assistant coaches to graduate student teaching assistants in history or math, who traditionally work long hours for low pay and valuable experience.
In effect, the jury agreed with the contention of the coaches that the millions of dollars generated by college sports made any comparison to teaching History 101 misplaced.
The coaches had sought $30 million, basing their claim on estimates of what they would have earned in a fully open market. The $12,000 cap, the coaches said, often amounted to less than a third of what others who did similar work at major universities were paid.
"We didn't want it to come to this," said Andy Greer, an assistant men's basketball coach at Northern Illinois University. "They made a mistake and now they're learning a very painful lesson -- that when people in your organization have concerns, you need to take some time and listen."
The N.C.A.A. has said the policy limiting salaries for the assistant coaches was lifted in 1995 after United States District Judge Kathryn H. Vratil ruled that the restrictions violated antitrust law. The judge's ruling was appealed by the N.C.A.A. and affirmed by a Federal appeals panel in Denver earlier this year.
Yesterday's monetary penalty was the second major blow to the association this year, and another in a series of rulings that curtails its authority. In March, the N.C.A.A. agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle a long-running and highly publicized lawsuit by Jerry Tarkanian, the head basketball coach at Fresno State University, who had contended that the association had persecuted him in applying its rules.
The chief attorney for the association, Elsa Cole, said the judgment would almost certainly be appealed. Ms. Cole said that financial reserves at the association, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., were inadequate to the penalty assessed, and that revenue payments to schools for sports programs would have to be reduced if the order stands.
"It was designed to create opportunity for new coaches and not hurt anybody," Ms. Coles said of the salary limit. "This verdict far exceeds fair compensation, and we cannot pay a judgment that in our judgment unjustly enriches plaintiffs."
Neither the coaches who were involved in the suit nor the N.C.A.A. said they expected any immediate impact from today's award, either in back pay or in some diminished level of collegiate sports financing. Several of the coaches who sued said their salaries had since risen to a level of parity with other assistant coaches, and that money was apparently found to pay them without reductions in coaching staffs.
The rule restricting salaries, approved by the N.C.A.A.'s board at its national convention in 1991, took effect in August 1992. It was aimed at controlling costs, but also, the association said, at providing a career ladder for beginning coaches. The new rules eliminated one coaching position from Division I rosters, cutting the number of assistants to four from five, and capped the salary of the fourth and lowest member of the staff.
The suit, while originally filed by a group of men's basketball coaches, was expanded when it became a class action case to include assistant coaches in men's baseball and in other sports. While the suit was filed on behalf of 1,900 coaches, hundreds of additional assistant coaches could receive compensation under the award, lawyers said.
The jury, which calculated the monetary award after hearing testimony from economists from each side, awarded $11.2 million to the basketball coaches, $1.6 million to the baseball coaches and $9.5 million to coaches in all the other sports -- all tripled. The N.C.A.A. was also required to pay the legal fees and costs of the plaintiffs, which some lawyers said could total another $5 million or more.
Ms. Cole said she would advocate two potential appeals -- a review of the jury's financial award, and of the separate ruling by Judge Vratil. Since the judge's ruling had already been appealed unsuccessfully, another appeal would have to be pursued with the United States Supreme Court. An appeal of the jury's award would go to the circuit court appellate level, where it could take perhaps a year or even two for a resolution, Ms. Cole said.
In the meantime, she said, the association would implore its member colleges not to retaliate against the coaches involved in the suit. Some coaches said they were nonetheless afraid that the N.C.A.A. would retaliate in some way, either against them or with cuts in revenue for certain sports.
"For a while there is going to be a little fear," said Mike Jarvis Jr., another plaintiff, who is an assistant men's basketball coach at George Washington University and the son of the team's head coach, Mike Jarvis. "But hopefully we can get it resolved soon so that everybody can move on."
Mr. Greer and other coaches said they had a hard time believing the association's claim that it could not afford the jury's award. The N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament alone is worth an average of $215 million, for example, under an eight-year contract with CBS signed in 1994.
But the coaches also said the suit was always about more than money.
"The coaches came together and pulled as a group, united as one -- that's as big a thing as anything," Mr. Greer said.
 "But this is something they chose to happen," he added, referring to the N.C.A.A., "not the coaches."
Murray Sperber, a professor of English and American studies at Indiana University and an expert on the N.C.A.A., said: "Very few Americans believe that college basketball and football are really amateur sports anymore.
"Today the jury basically said, 'No, it's a professional organization and the market should rule.' "

HEADLINE: Jolting Its Citizens, Indonesia Sharply Raises Energy Cost

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 4

 BODY:
Just hours before the International Monetary Fund unanimously approved restoring financial aid to Indonesia, President Suharto's Government announced plans today to raise the price of fuel and electricity by as much as 70 percent.
The announcement, fulfilling commitments to the I.M.F. that the Government has long resisted, left many Indonesians shocked, and they lined up by the thousands at gas stations here to buy a last tank of cheap gasoline. President Suharto clearly timed today's announcement to coincide with the I.M.F.'s approval of $1 billion in emergency aid to his ailing country. 
 In Washington, the United States, which holds enormous sway within the I.M.F., said on Monday that it approved the I.M.F.'s moves. Officials declared that Indonesia is finally enacting a number of major economic reforms after months of delay. But they said they insisted that Mr. Suharto's progress must be evaluated month by month. Officials praised Indonesia's progress in tightening credit, restoring discipline over the central bank, beginning to deal with insolvent commercial banks and negotiating with overseas creditors, who are owed about $70 billion.
 "We are under no illusions that everything will be smooth sailing from now on out," Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund, said at a news conference. "We will follow it very closely. There really is not much room for slippage."
Responding to sharp criticism from the I.M.F., the Suharto Government also announced plans to dismantle a vast monopoly in cloves. The continuing monopoly -- despite past commitments to dismantle it -- had been another major sticking point with the I.M.F. It is controlled by Mr. Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, and epitomizes the crony capitalism that has weighed down Indonesia's economy.
Last week Indonesian officials were already insisting that the monopoly had been broken up. But in interviews, people involved in the Indonesian cigarette trade, in which the cloves are used, said that Government officials were not providing the stickers necessary to sell cigarette packs unless the companies were buying their cloves from the younger Mr. Suharto's business.
The I.M.F.'s effectiveness in breaking up the Suharto family empire, which dominates business here, is clearly one of the most important yardsticks of progress to Indonesians who are protesting the 76-year-old leader's rule. In central Indonesia this weekend, protesters broke into a showroom and burned a car produced by the national car company, which Tommy Suharto also controls.
Other disputes have centered on a cartel in the plywood industry, which was controlled by one of Mr. Suharto's closest friends, Bob Hassan. Mr. Hassan is now Minister of Industry and Trade.
But the I.M.F., which has made Mr. Suharto's industrial monopolies a clear target, has clearly decided that the best way to deal with Mr. Suharto is to praise his moves toward reform, and reward them with relatively small injections of cash from the $43 billion bailout package.
In Singapore today, the director general of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus, commended Indonesia for taking steps toward reform.
But for Indonesia's citizens -- who are already struggling with rampant unemployment, spiraling inflation and a devalued currency -- economic reform seemed just another word for misery.
"It's always the common people who get hurt," said Nana, a 45-year-old driver, as he sat in a two-hour traffic jam on a sweltering side street to fill up his van. "I oppose the Government's policies, but what am I going to do about it?"
The bigger threat to the Suharto Government comes from students, who have staged increasingly violent protests in recent days and stridently oppose increases in fuel and electricity prices. Students clashed with the police again today in Medan, a city in northern Indonesia, and there were scattered protests on campuses in Jakarta and Surabaya. A mob of more than 1,000 people in Medan burned a police post and a shopping mall and damaged dozens of small shops during a riot on Monday night that lasted into the early hours of Tuesday before the police broke it up, Reuters reported.
One student leader hinted that the students would organize a major demonstration in Jakarta later this week to protest the higher prices.
"The Government's policy is counter-productive," said Rama Pratama, chairman of the Student Senate at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta. "The rising price of fuel only makes matters worse for people."
Economic hardship and politicized students are a volatile mix in Indonesia. Today Indonesia's Defense Minister, General Wiranto, warned that the military would take "stern action" against any demonstrations that moved outside campus gates. But the price increases will provide fresh ammunition for students who have been calling for President Suharto to step down.
Indonesian officials acknowledged at a news conference today that the decision to raise prices was difficult. But they noted that the Government was spending more than $3.5 billion a year to subsidize fuel and electricity -- money that could be better spent on medicine and food. The level of subsidies exploded after Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, collapsed last fall, which made imported petroleum more costly.
The price increases will also ripple through the transportation industry, making buses, trains and taxis more expensive.
The I.M.F. originally demanded that Indonesia scrap the subsidies by April 1, but the Suharto Government negotiated a one-month reprieve. The I.M.F. also backed away from its earlier insistence that it immediately end subsidies on major food products and that the Government-controlled food monopoly be broken up. The monopoly controls the food distribution system, and without it, officials feared, food riots would quickly spread around the country.

HEADLINE: New Operators Likely for Rainbow Room at End of Year

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Seeking to garner even more revenue from the Rainbow Room, which paid $3 million in rent last year, and to update its image, the landlord of the famous tourist destination said yesterday that it would be turned over to new owners when its lease expires at the end of the year.
"The restaurant will change hands," said Jerry T. Speyer, the president and chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, which is both a part-owner and the manager of Rockefeller Center. 
 On the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the 1930's-era Rainbow Room -- known for its sweeping views, 12-piece orchestras and slowly revolving dance floor -- is the second-highest-grossing restaurant in the nation.
Recently, after weeks of heated negotiations, the current operators, Joseph Baum and David Emil, agreed to join forces with Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur, to spice up the Rainbow Room. But they refused to accept the financial terms that Mr. Speyer had set for renewing their lease.
Under those terms, the restaurateurs would have paid about $4 million a year in rent, said by real estate experts to be the highest in the industry. Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil decided against the new lease because it would not allow for a rent reduction if the economy soured.
"Our negotiations with the Baum-Emil group terminated approximately two months ago," Mr. Speyer said. "We do not expect to resume those negotiations."
Now, Tishman Speyer is talking about leasing the Rainbow Room to the family that owns Harry Cipriani, a restaurant at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. "We are hoping we can take over by the first of the year," said Jeffrey S. Vasser, the chief financial officer for the Ciprianis, who are planning to open a luxury hotel and banquet hall at 55 Wall Street and another restaurant at Grand Central Terminal.
The Ciprianis also own the renowned Harry's Bar in Venice, but they have never operated a restaurant on the scale of the Rainbow Room, where up to 700 meals are served on a busy Saturday night.
As late as Friday, a person connected to Tishman Speyer who insisted on anonymity said the Ciprianis were close to reaching a deal. But late yesterday, he said that some "sticking points" had materialized that could derail the negotiations.
Mr. Vasser said he knew of no obstacles. "What I'm hearing is that everything is moving ahead," he said.
After first being hired as consultants, Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil assumed control of the Rainbow Room in 1985, spending $20 million to renovate it and increasing its gross income to $32 million from about $8 million.
Last month, a trade publication, Restaurants and Institutions, ranked the Rainbow Room as the second-highest-grossing restaurant in the nation, after the Tavern on the Green in Central Park. (In January 1997, after a new chef, Waldy Malouf, was hired, Ruth Reichl, the restaurant critic for The New York Times, awarded the Rainbow Room a three-star rating.)
Even so, Tishman Speyer apparently decided that the restaurant lacked one ingredient to earn even more revenue: a trendier image that would draw more New Yorkers as customers. Since the rent for a restaurant is usually based on a percentage of the gross revenue, more business would mean more income for the property owners.
One person close to the negotiations who insisted on anonymity said Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil were told that their restaurant catered to a "fuddy-duddy" clientele. But Steven Rubenstein, a spokesman for the landlord, denied that such a characterization had been made.
With the expiration of the lease little more than a year away, Tishman Speyer invited proprietors of several of the city's more glamorous restaurants to apply to take over the Rainbow Room.
Among those approached was Mr. Nieporent, the owner of such chic TriBeCa spots as Nobu and Montrachet. He was tempted, he said. "Getting the Rainbow Room is like someone saying, 'Would you like a piece of the New York Yankees?' " Mr. Nieporent said.
Instead of submitting his own bid for the restaurant, however, Mr. Nieporent chose to remain loyal to Mr. Baum, who has been in the restaurant business for nearly half a century, and become a partner. "Joe Baum is one of the people I patterned my own career after," Mr. Nieporent said.
The addition of Mr. Nieporent enhanced the team's prospects of holding onto the restaurant. After what some people in the restaurant business described as a "bakeoff" to secure the lease, the Baum-Emil-Nieporent team beat out two other finalists: Alan Stillman, the owner of Smith & Wollensky, and Warner LeRoy, the owner of the Tavern on the Green.
Included in the winning proposal was a plan to turn a storage area two floors above the Rainbow Room and another space adjacent to the main restaurant into a second restaurant, with a chef hired by Mr. Nieporent. David Rockwell, who designed Nobu, would spruce up the Rainbow Room's Art Moderne interior.
By opening the restaurant for lunch and adding new space, Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil estimated that the restaurant would eventually gross $40 million, and the rent was set to take that increased revenue into account.
But the deal foundered in February when lawyers for Tishman Speyer drafted a lease agreement that would not allow for a reduction in rent if the economy soured. Mr. Nieporent said these terms were too onerous and placed too much of a burden on his shoulders.
Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil decline to discuss the stalled negotiations publicly. "We've always been proud to run the Rainbow Room, and we would like to continue," Mr. Emil said.
Mr. Rubenstein said that Tishman Speyer had been eager to renew the lease with them. "They wanted Joe Baum to remain a part of the Rainbow Room, while reinvigorating it with Drew Nieporent," he said.
Other restaurateurs said they doubted that the Rainbow Room would be turned over to the Ciprianis. "It would surprise me that they would consider anyone who didn't have that kind of experience," Mr. Stillman said.
Like several other restaurateurs, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the owner of the hot new restaurant Jean-Georges, expressed warm support for Mr. Baum and said he saw no reason to change a winning format. "The food shouldn't be too serious," he said. "It should be simple and straightforward, and that's what it is now. It's a big place. To do really precise food would be a mistake."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 1999, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 5 about the decision to turn over the Rainbow Room to new operators misidentified the restaurant consultants who planned its renovation in the mid-1980's. In addition to Joseph Baum, they were Michael Whiteman and Dennis Sweeney, not David Emil.
The article also referred incorrectly to the ownership of the company that assumed control of the restaurant in 1987. Mr. Baum and Mr. Emil were among the owners, but were not the only ones.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
Beaujolais That Ages As Well as Burgundy

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
IT was in the dead of winter some 20 years ago, and the dining room at La Pyramide was half empty. The glory days of the famous restaurant in Vienne, 20 miles south of Lyons, where Fernand Point once reigned, were long past, but there was a feeling about the place -- that at one time great things had happened there.
In an effort to bring back that time, if only for a few minutes, I let the elderly sommelier pick our wines. It was a mistake. Not that his choices -- a St.-Joseph to start and a Cote Rotie from Ampuis, just across the river -- were bad. These are classic wines of the region. 
 But halfway through the meal, I began browsing through the wine list, something I should have done earlier. Among the rare and reasonably priced wines I discovered a small cache of old Beaujolais. Reluctantly pushing the Cote Rotie aside, I ordered a 1937 Morgon.
What a revelation. It was old but still strong and well structured. It had Burgundy characteristics, but it was a gamay wine. A great treat, probably never to be duplicated. Then again, as someone once put it: never say never. There are Beaujolais around that just might have that kind of longevity.
A year ago, The International Wine Cellar, a reputable newsletter, printed an article titled "Real Beaujolais for Real People." There is a lot of good Beaujolais to choose from, the article said, but most people's experience is limited to nouveau, the young wine that appears around Thanksgiving, and to the wines of "the ubiquitous Georges Duboeuf."
Mr. Duboeuf is a negociant, or shipper, who buys his wines from hundreds of small producers in the Beaujolais region. His success in the United States and worldwide is incontestable. Year in and year out, his Beaujolais Villages sets the standard for what a fine commercial wine should be, and his smaller bottlings, like the Jean Descombes Morgon and the Domaine des Rosiers Moulin-a-Vent, rank among the best fine-wine bargains.
So it is no criticism of him or his wines when people whom he has introduced to Beaujolais choose to expand their horizons. In that light, here is a primer for Beaujolais fans.
The Beaujolais region runs from just outside Lyons some 35 miles north to Macon and produces 15 million cases of wine a year. Most of it is called Beaujolais or, if it is a little better stuff, Beaujolais Villages. Some small areas that produce particularly good wine can use the local name. They are Brouilly, Cote de Brouilly, Chiroubles, Chenas, Julienas, Fleurie, Regnie, Morgon, Moulin-a-Vent and St.-Amour. All Beaujolais is made from the gamay grape. There is also a little white Beaujolais made.
The Moulin-a-Vent (which means windmill) from Jacky Janodet is a good example of what smaller winemakers can do. This intense, concentrated wine comes from 65-year-old vines, is dark garnet in color and needs an extra five years in bottle.
In Paris a few months ago, I had a Fleurie from Yvon Metras. It was a beautiful wine but, I thought, available only in France. No longer. Kermit Lynch imports it and, hopefully, doesn't keep it all for his shop in Berkeley, Calif.
Alain Michaud, a producer in Brouilly, makes four versions of his wine. The first, from young vines, is sold to one of the big shippers. The second is a blend from young and old vines; the third is from old vines, and the fourth, from vines more than 90 years old, is made only in the best vintages and, Mr. Michaud says, should be aged eight years.
The felicitously named Louis-Claude Desvignes produces two Morgons, Javernieres and Cote de Puy, from very old vines. These are concentrated wines that will surprise anyone who thinks Beaujolais must taste like strawberry jam.
What will not surprise is that these small-batch Beaujolais are relatively expensive. Some are more than $20 a bottle, where most of the more commercial Beaujolais sell for $7 to $10. The small-producer wines cost more because the gnarled old vines produce less fruit, because the wines get individual care and because the economies of scale available to shippers like Duboeuf elude mom-and-pop winemakers.
Not that all these alternative styles are produced in cottages. In 1996, Louis Jadot, the prominent Burgundy shipping and winemaking firm, purchased the 69-acre Chateau des Jacques, an estate in Moulin-a-Vent that produces wines from five separate vineyards. Two of them tasted recently, the Clos de Rochegres and the Clos de Grand Carquelin, both from 1996, were exceptional Beaujolais in the big style. Both could have used another three to five years in the bottle.
Henry Fessy makes a full-bodied Chiroubles, Cuvee Payraud, that will distinguish anyone's cellar.
Then there is Georges Duboeuf. Along with his separate bottlings like the Descombes Morgon, the Domaine des Rosiers Moulin-a-Vent and his praised Fleurie, Chateau des Deduits, he at times releases older wine, purchased from one of his suppliers or set aside in his own cellars.
These are extremely limited wines and usually will not show up in your local wine store. The Burgundy Wine Company, a retailer in New York, has a few of them. Recently it offered a 1989 St.-Amour at a modest $12.50 and a 1990 Moulin-a-Vent for $29.50, definitely not a hamburger wine.
 
Tastings
Rounded Blend
Lambert Bridge Winery, Crane Creek Cuvee 1994. Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma County, Calif. About $28.
 
THIS is the initial release of Crane Creek Cuvee, a proprietary wine from Lambert Bridge. Proprietary wines are blends, and this one is made of 67 percent cabernet sauvignon, 22 percent merlot and 11 percent cabernet franc. The blend will change from vintage to vintage to achieve a desired style, much the way it is done in Bordeaux. In this case, the wine is unmistakably a cabernet blend, with the signature cassis taste in evidence. The merlot adds roundness and the cabernet franc a touch of austerity. The wine has spent 20 months maturing in French oak, but could easily use two or three more years' time in the bottle to be at its best.

HEADLINE: For Passionate Home Cooks, It's a Magnificent Obsession

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
WHEN dusk gathers and the dinner hour approaches, New Yorkers quietly divide into two tribes: the consumers and the creators. They look the same. By demographic, ethnic, religious and nearly every other measure, they are indistinguishable. But when it comes to food, they lead different lives.
The consumers eat out, or they buy out. They keep the city's innumerable restaurants afloat. They have made Chinese takeout an internationally recognized symbol of life in New York. In a pinch, the consumers can operate a microwave or give orders to a caterer. They don't like to get too near a stove. 
 The creators cook. They entertain. They shrug off the obstacles posed by tiny kitchens, and make time in a city that gives them none. And New York being the highly competitive, food-obsessed place that it is, the creators firmly believe that they can turn out meals that hold their own with the best restaurants in town. Their guests agree. The creators may not be famous, but they have reputations. Their names get around. They are the ones whose dinner invitations do not get turned down.
On a recent evening, with spring showing signs of serious intent, Deirdre Livingstone organized her first affair of the season, a dinner for her brother, his fiancee and a half-dozen friends.
Ms. Livingstone, a Scotswoman who works as a marketing manager for the British Tourist Authority, started with bite-size portions of haggis piped into phyllo pastry cups that had been lined with turnip mousseline. A pea, pear and mint soup followed. The main course was a steak and kidney pie made with Yorkshire ale, served with sugar snap peas, roasted carrots and parsnips, and funny potatoes carved to look like poached pears. (One baffled guest, insisting that he loathed poached pears, put up fierce resistance but in the end took a tentative bite.) Dessert, another invention, was pecan-whisky-ginger ice cream.
All in all, it was the sort of meal that Ms. Livingstone produces every six weeks or so at her house in Weehawken, N.J., almost as a matter of course. "I don't think of it as work," she said. "I genuinely enjoy the process, which is creative. I also think it's more intimate to entertain or be entertained at home. I miss that eating in a restaurant."
Two nights earlier, and two rivers away, Gordon Churchwell, a writer, was bent over a small, rather battered-looking stove in Park Slope, Brooklyn. A small party of friends seated around his kitchen table had already made quick work of the steak tartare and the silky homemade gravlax. Now, the magic stove was starting to yield a profusion of dishes. Four cats, sensing important developments, filed in through an open window from the backyard.
Mr. Churchwell, who is half Korean, had devised an Asian menu. Pork and beef dumplings in a rich, savory broth. Braised and marinated short ribs with chestnuts, accompanied by homemade kimchee. Spicy, garlicky bulgogi, sizzling on the backyard grill. Sea bass marinated in three misos and accompanied by braised kale and kochijang, Korea's national hot sauce. Mr. Churchwell's wife, Julie Metz, pitched in with a pear tart festooned with a bit of rosemary.
Mr. Churchwell brooded a bit over the gravlax. "I think it could be too subtle," he said. The kimchee bothered him, too. "It really needs another couple of days to ripen," he said. The guests were not complaining. Besides, they were used to Mr. Churchwell's obsessiveness.
"He once called me up and said, 'I think you'd better come over, because I just made 300 dumplings,' " said Jill Herzig, an editor at Glamour magazine and a devotee of Mr. Churchwell's cooking. "Then there was the time we were all supposed to go to a restaurant and celebrate his birthday, but he changed his mind at the last minute and made dinner for 14. I came over and he was in the backyard, grilling more varieties of meat than I've ever seen in one place before."
Food lust in New York is usually measured in phone calls per hour to Balthazar or Le Cirque 2000. But even as untold hours are spent speed-dialing the city's top restaurants, a dedicated population of gifted amateur cooks roam the markets, sniffing fruit, staring fresh fish in the eye and plotting grand culinary adventures. When they eat at restaurants, they tend to be thinking about how they can lift a few ideas from the chef and bring them home to the kitchen.
"I think the joy of food is the adventure of preparing it yourself," Mr. Churchwell said. "The latest restaurant and the latest chef -- that's not where it's at."
The passionate amateurs are a varied bunch who discovered a love for cooking in all sorts of ways. Cheryl Tenia, a nanny from Trinidad, took over the cooking in her family after her mother died. Now, every Sunday, she has as many as 20 friends and relatives over to her house in the Flatlands neighborhood of Brooklyn for dishes like oxtail and beef stew, kingfish or shark stew, callaloo, and macaroni and cheese pie.
Steven Powers of Greenwich Village, an antiques dealer, discovered cooking after becoming a strict vegetarian soon after high school. He picked up a few vegetarian cookbooks but found them long on virtue, short on flavor. "They seemed too countercultural to me," he said. "I'm not a crunchy vegetarian -- too bland."
To please himself, he began developing his own vegan interpretations of classic dishes, like a shepherd's pie made with a Guinness broth, or a lasagna layered with hamburger substitute, portobello mushrooms, spinach and carrots.
Charles Michener of the Upper West Side, an editor at The New Yorker, fumed when his father would parsimoniously divide scrambled eggs for the family. He begged his mother to give him an omelet pan for Christmas. As a teen-ager, he banded together with two school friends and formed a gourmet club, hoping to attract girls by inviting them over for fancy meals. It worked.
The connecting thread that unites these very different people is an almost carnal desire for good food, scant regard for printed recipes, strong organizational skills and more than a dash of hubris.
"I can master some supposedly pretty difficult stuff," Chantal Meyers said. "Not stuffed pig's head yet, but I try to make things that guests would not order out. I'm not intimidated or insecure. When it's good, it's good and I know it."
Like her colleagues in the amateur food fraternity, Ms. Meyers simply loves to entertain, to round up a good-size group, put them together and cut loose. "I can cook all day," she said. "For me it's not a slog, it's an outlet."
Often, she organizes dinners around an ethnic theme. Last month, it was Moroccan night at her Upper West Side apartment, where 16 guests -- "if you have 8, you might as well have 16," she said -- worked their way though a bisteeya with squab, a lamb and prune tagine, chicken with olives and preserved lemon, and couscous.
The meal had a soundtrack, which Ms. Meyers described as "Frenchy funky African." She said: "I like to theme the music. I go out, pick up six or seven CD's, and just blast it."
In the same way that stylish people simply know how to put an outfit together, breaking rules when they feel like it, good amateur chefs work with a free hand. They rummage through cookbooks for ideas but do not feel obliged to follow them exactly. They plagiarize restaurant chefs if they like an idea, or they come up with their own inventions.
"I make it up as I go along," said Usha Cunningham, a physical therapist from Bombay, who routinely gives dinner parties on the Upper East Side for 20 guests. "I don't hesitate to mix Indian and Western spices. I'll mix coriander and tarragon in the same dish. It's never a problem. If I happen to have both I'll use both."
The relaxed approach to flavors, rules and boundaries between cuisines can mask a sometimes ferocious culinary drive, the kind that causes an otherwise rational cook to make 300 dumplings for no apparent reason. At times, the amateurs can sound like the fussiest of fussy French chefs.
"I'm an obsessive maniac," said Howard Adler, a lawyer who learned to cook after his mother, a home economics teacher in the city school system, died when he was 13. "I'm fussy, picky, crazed if I can't find exactly what I want. I'll go to 10 different places to do my shopping. It makes up a large part of my life."
There are strong indications that Mr. Adler, who entertains at the drop of a hat, does not quite know when to stop. He built and installed a wood-burning brick pizza oven in his country house, for one thing. And when 10 guests sat down to dinner last week at his apartment in SoHo, a printed menu lay on each plate.
It's not surprising that most of the amateur chefs describe a similar path of development: initial fumbling efforts, followed by a manic experimental phase, followed by a relaxed simplicity, which is as much a survival tactic as an esthetic choice. The trick to cooking for a dozen guests, they say, is to zero in on dishes that can be prepared either in advance or in stages over several days. Because a fancy dessert can consume precious hours, and there's far less room for error, many of them just buy it.
"We used to have these dinners where we'd just shoot for the moon," Mr. Churchwell said. "You know, things like porcini-mushroom-and-truffle risotto for 18, or a pork roast marinated for five days in a dry rub. That one almost killed me. I worked like an animal and didn't get to enjoy anything."
Rose Marie Morse, the head of Morse Partners, a public relations agency, began cooking as a 16-year-old out of frustration at the small portions her mother served. "She thought eating a lot was vulgar," Ms. Morse said. "I thought it represented abundance and warmth."
In the early 1970's, Ms. Morse said, she entered a manic phase, spending long hours deboning entire chickens for galantines, making puff pastry, baking the tricky meringue cakes known as Windtortes. Eventually, she came out the other side. "Now I've adopted the philosophy that you can judge a cook by how well they roast a chicken," she said. "I make more consoling food now. But delicious. The standard is that it has to be delicious."
Supposedly, one should eat to live, not live to eat. For some New Yorkers, it's not that simple. If you are not eating, or cooking, or planning to cook, can you truly be said to be living? It's all well and good to order from a menu, but where is the sense of satisfaction in signing the check for a meal?
"If people weren't afraid to cook, they'd be much more willing to have people into their homes, and that would affect the rest of their lives," said Martin Fisher, a Manhattan real estate broker, who grew up working in his family's wholesale grocery in Brooklyn. "It leads to friendships and relationships. There's a great social purpose here."
 
PAPPARDELLE AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS IN SAFFRON CREAM SAUCE
Adapted from Rose Marie Morse
Time: 30 minutes
 
 Salt
 2 tablespoons light olive oil
 10 large shiitake mushroom caps, cut into thin strips
 1 large tomato, cut into small dice
 2 yellow bell peppers, cut into thin strips
 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
 20 ounces pappardelle or large bow-tie pasta
 1 1/2 pounds rock shrimp (or other small shrimp), peeled and deveined
 1/2 cup white wine
 1/4 cup fish stock or bottled clam broth
 1/4 cup chicken stock
 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
 2 large pinches saffron
 Freshly ground black pepper
 2 tablespoons butter (optional)
 3 tablespoons chopped chives (cut into 1/2 inch lengths).
 
 1. Place a large stock pot (8-quart or larger) of lightly salted water over high heat, to bring to a boil for the pasta. In a large nonstick or well-seasoned saute pan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and add mushroom slices. Saute until mushrooms are limp, about 2 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon, and set aside in a bowl.
 2. Add diced tomato to the pan. Saute until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon, and place in a bowl.
 3. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining oil to the pan. Add yellow peppers, and saute until limp, about 3 minutes. Remove to a bowl. Add garlic to the pan and saute lightly; do not brown. Remove to bowl of peppers. Place pappardelle in pot of boiling water, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes.
 4. While pasta is cooking, add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the saute pan. Increase heat to medium-high, and add shrimp. Saute until shrimp are pink but not fully cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and place in a bowl.
 5. Reduce heat under pan to medium, and add wine, fish stock or clam broth, chicken stock and any juices collected in the bowls of mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers and shrimp. Stir well with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pan. Add the cream and saffron, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring, until sauce thickens and turns yellow from the saffron, about 3 minutes. Add the reserved vegetables and shrimp. Heat through, and add salt and pepper to taste. Add butter, if desired, and stir gently until it has melted. Add chives, reduce heat to very low, and cover pan.
 6. Drain pasta well, and transfer to a warm serving bowl. Add saffron cream sauce, and toss gently to mix well. Serve immediately.
 Yield: 6 servings.
 
KALBI-CHIM
Adapted from Gordon Churchwell
Time: 5 1/2 hours

 3 pounds beef short ribs, or other meaty ribs cross-cut into two strips
 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
 1 tablespoon sesame oil
 4 large cloves garlic, minced
 6 scallions, chopped
 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
 3 tablespoons dry sherry
 4 tablespoons tamari (Japanese soy sauce)
 3 tablespoons mirin (sweet rice wine)
 2 tablespoons peanut oil
 1 onion, chopped
 2 carrots, one minced and the other cut into 1-inch chunks
 3/4 cup chicken or beef broth
 1cup red wine
 10 to 12 dried shiitake mushrooms
 12 fresh chestnuts, peeled, or 12 dried peeled chestnuts, soaked in water for 2 hours, or 12 jarred peeled chestnuts
 1 pear or apple, peeled, cored, chopped.

 1. Score ribs diagonally, and place in a large bowl. Add sugar, and rub into the meat. Rub sesame oil into the meat, and let rest for 15 minutes. Add garlic, scallions, ginger, sherry, tamari and mirin. Rub into meat, and marinate, refrigerated, 2 to 3 hours.
 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a Dutch oven or other covered pan large enough to hold ribs in one layer, heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil over medium heat; add chopped onion and minced carrot. Saute until vegetables are tender, 5 minutes. Place ribs on vegetables, meat side down. Add marinade, broth and wine. Bring to a boil on top of stove; cover and place in oven for 1 hour.
 3. While meat is in oven, reconstitute mushrooms by adding boiling water to cover and soaking until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry with paper towels and slice thinly. In a small skillet over medium-low heat, heat remaining tablespoon peanut oil, and add mushrooms slices. Saute until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Set aside.
 4. Remove pan from oven, skim fat, and turn ribs meat side up. Add mushrooms, carrot chunks, chestnuts and chopped pear or apple. Cover, and return to oven 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until liquid is almost evaporated.
 5. Before serving, skim fat from liquid in pan. Accompany with rice, kimchi and other Korean condiments and side dishes. Kalbi-chim improves with rest, and may be made the day before, refrigerated and reheated for about 10 minutes in a 350-degree oven.
 Yield: 4 servings.
 
SINGLE MALT WHISKY, CRYSTALLIZED GINGER AND PECAN ICE CREAM
Adapted from Deirdre Livingstone
Time: 20 minutes, plus freezing time
 
 8 tablespoons butter
 1 cup chopped pecans
 Pinch salt
 2 large eggs
 3/4 cup sugar
 2 cups heavy cream
 1 cup milk
 1 cup chopped crystallized ginger
 2 tablespoons single malt whisky.
 
 1. Have ready an ice cream maker with a frozen bowl, or whatever equipment will be needed for freezing the ice cream.
 2. In a small heavy skillet or saucepan over very low heat, melt butter and add pecans and salt. Saute pecans until they begin to darken, 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a plate. Reserve butter.
 3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs by hand for 1 minute. Gradually add sugar, and whisk until blended, 2 minutes. Add cream and milk, and blend. Add melted butter; whisk until smooth and thoroughly blended.
 4. Pour mixture into ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. When ice cream is stiff and about 2 minutes from finished, add pecans and chopped ginger while the drum is still turning. When really stiff and frozen, add whisky, and blend until whisky is incorporated. The ice cream will soften slightly with the addition of whisky. Transfer to an airtight container, and store in freezer until serving.
 Yield: 1 quart.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Rose 0.2% in March

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Strong stock market gains helped push an important gauge of future domestic economic growth ahead in March, the Conference Board said today in a report suggesting the economy will expand steadily.
The group's index of leading indicators, which combines 10 measures of economic activity into one index, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March after increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in February and one-tenth of 1 percent in January. 
 Five measures were higher in March, led by stock prices and money supply, according to the Conference Board, a private research group based in New York. Four fell, notably consumer expectations and the length of the workweek. One, weekly unemployment claims, was unchanged.
The latest data supported the view that the domestic economy remains vibrant despite economic turmoil in Asia.
Michael Boldin, director of the Conference Board's business-cycle research, said it was a positive sign that money supply and stock prices were driving the leading indicators up and suggested they could be signaling continued growth.
"Because these financial series have historically proven to be some of the best predictors of growth, not only is the risk of a recession in the foreseeable future almost nil, but the economy is likely to expand at a brisk pace throughout 1998," he said.

Overseas airlines are following the lead of United States carriers in cutting fares for slow periods.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
UNITED STATES airlines have become skillful at offering periodic low fares and special deals designed to fill seats during slow periods. Foreign airlines have wasted little time following this lead, and at the moment, carriers from three different continents are offering substantial reduced fares -- with the usual restrictions.
Tomorrow only, Britain's Virgin Atlantic is offering a free companion ticket for anyone buying a round-trip economy-class ticket between London and any of the carrier's eight United States gateways: New York; Newark; Boston; Washington; Miami; Orlando, Fla.; Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The one-day sale is to commemorate the cameo appearance tomorrow night of Richard Branson, Virgin Group's chairman, on NBC's "Friends." Fares, depending on the city, range from about $720 to $970. Travel must begin before June 1 and be completed no later than June 15. 
 Those who buy two round-trip adult tickets before June 1 on Air New Zealand for nonstop travel between Los Angeles and Sydney, Australia or Auckland, New Zealand, will get a three-night cruise for both passengers (double occupancy) between Los Angeles and Encanada, Mexico, on Royal Caribbean's Viking Serenade. Air travel must begin before Aug. 16, while cruises must begin before Dec. 14.
And travelers who buy a first-class or business-class ticket for travel by June 30 on Lan Chile Airlines between Miami and any of three South American cities -- Bogota, Colombia; Guayaquil, Ecuador, or Caracas, Venezuela -- will receive a free ticket for a companion flying the identical itinerary.
In other airline news, Delta Air Lines is offering double frequent-flier miles for travel in first class or business class between June 15 and Sept. 1. That is in addition to the usual 50 percent mileage bonus for first-class passengers and 25 percent for business class.
Last Friday, AMR's American Airlines became the first United States carrier to install on a domestic aircraft enhanced medical kits, plus an automatic external defibrillator to treat heart problems.
American has had such equipment on its trans-ocean fleet since last year, and expects to install them in all its 649 jets by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, Varig Brazilian Airlines recently equipped its fleet with the defibrillators and separate handheld electrocardiogram monitors, which the airline said minimized the danger of exhausting batteries in the defibrillators.
 
Delayed Maiden Voyages
Add the 2,600-passenger Grand Princess to the list of new ships that have been delayed this year. The Disney Magic was delayed twice, at a cost of 15 voyages, and is now scheduled to sail July 30, while delay of the Sun Princess resulted in three canceled cruises. Because of what a Princess spokeswoman described as the need merely to "fine tune" the Grand Princess, its maiden voyage will be delayed 12 days, until May 26, when it sails from Istanbul, Turkey, to Barcelona, Spain. Passengers who had been booked on the canceled voyage will receive a full refund plus a 25 percent discount on any future Princess cruise, depending on space available. Princess ships are owned by the Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company.
 
A Limited Strike
The strike called against Air France for today will have no effect on long-haul flights, the airline said, but could disrupt medium-haul and domestic flights.

4-Day Rally Comes to Halt On Fear of Rate Increases

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A four-day rally in stocks fizzled yesterday amid renewed fears that strong economic growth may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Investors received little consolation from the latest economic reports -- the March index of leading economic indicators and a monthly retail sales report -- which showed further evidence of the robust growth that was glimpsed in last week's reports. 
 The data added to concerns that April's employment report, due Friday, will continue that trend.
"The perception of our market is that this is the last major piece of information before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that could sway the Fed" to act, said Robert J. Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper Investments, of the Fed's meeting scheduled for May 19.
Despite the strong evidence of economic growth, Mr. Froehlich and some other analysts believe that the Fed is unlikely to take any action then. "A strong economy isn't enough to get them to act," said Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management.
While Asia's economic turmoil has had a muted impact on domestic growth thus far, both Mr. Froehlich and Ms. Marcin believe the Fed will not act until it has a clearer indication of how much American corporations will be hurt by the slowdown.
"Until we can get that quantified, they're not going to run the risk of slowing down our economy," Mr. Froehlich said. "There are too many mixed signals and uncertainty."
In the current environment, Ms. Marcin continues to favor financial services stocks, including brokerage firms, insurance companies, asset management firms and banks. Those companies will continue to benefit from the industry's consolidation wave, which may expand to include domestic and international combinations, she said.
Mr. Froehlich suggests investors diversify among various assets and investment strategies, putting some cash into growth and value-oriented investments, for example. Sectors he likes include health care, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as furniture and appliance companies.
After posting a new closing high Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back almost all of those gains yesterday, falling 45.09 points, to 9,147.57. Large, multinational issues such as American Express, General Motors and Eastman Kodak led the declines.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 6.57 points, to 1,115.50. The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.95 points, to 1,864.91.
Among individual stocks, the Cendant Corporation barely nudged yesterday, closing at 24 9/16, down 15/16 after the company reported preliminary first-quarter earnings of 26 cents a share, in line with analysts' forecasts. Cendant fell 46 percent April 16 after the company disclosed accounting irregularities in one of its units. In the health care sector, Pfizer slipped 1 1/16, to 111 5/8, after news Monday that eye doctors and surgeons of the American College of Ophthalmology warned that the Pfizer's potence drug, Viagra, might cause vision problems.

Prices of Treasury Securities Fall for Second Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities declined for a second day yesterday, as investors await Friday's jobs data and ponder the probability of an increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Prices were also weighed down by a meeting between President Clinton and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. 
 The 30-year bond dropped 21/32, to a price of 102 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.98 percent, from 5.93 percent on Monday.
Many moves in the bond market come on speculation alone and yesterday's meeting at the White House was no exception. The meeting in all probability was to update the President on all of the nuances of the current economic and inflation picture. Some of the downward price pressures came as some market participants began speculating that the meeting might mean something else: for instance, that the Government was giving the central bank permission to raise interest rates.
"News tape items by Fed officials, speculation about a meeting between the White House and Chairman Greenspan, and other assorted sundry tidbits of market gossip and innuendoes generally kept bond prices within a relatively contained range in thin trading," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.
He said market reaction to economic data released yesterday was barely perceptible. The index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March, an expected outcome as a result of increases in stock prices and money supply.
The employment data for April will be released on Friday and market attention will be focused on the payroll number in order to interpret the trend. Mr. Fine said that the number of new jobs added to the economy averaged 205,000 a month in the first quarter, which he thought was a relatively small number compared with recent economic growth. Most analysts expect a gain of roughly 250,000 jobs for April.
Elsewhere, in the corporate market the AT&T Capital Corporation sold $1.05 billion through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities. The debt offering was broken down into $750 million of three-year notes priced to yield 6.269 percent, or about 63-hundredths of a percentage point more than a three-year Treasury, and $300 million of seven-year notes, yielding 6.614 percent, or about 88-hundredths of a percentage point over the seven-year Treasury note.

Clinton Sees Greenspan; No Word on Rates

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
President Clinton held his first official meeting in 16 months today with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in what the White House described as wide-ranging talks that had not been prompted by any specific economic policy issue.
There was no word from either the President's staff or the central bank as to whether the talks had touched on the future direction of domestic interest rates. The meeting lasted about an hour and had earlier been characterized as routine. 
 The session, also attended by Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and by Gene Sperling, the head of Mr. Clinton's team of economic advisers, had been requested by the Administration.
Advance word of the talks contributed to speculation in financial markets today that Mr. Greenspan might have been seeking to prepare the President for an impending increase in interest rates.
The last official meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan came in January 1997, two months before the Fed's most recent rate increase. The central bank's policy-making committee will next meet on May 19 and again on June 30.

HEADLINE: Jumping On America's Hospitality Bandwagon;
Foreign Students Choose U.S. for Studying Tourism

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
Nothing is fueling the world's economy quite like its inhabitants' wanderlust. Within the next decade, the global tourism industry is expected to triple in size, to almost two billion travelers spending $1.83 trillion a year, or $5 billion a day. All that growth could create as many as 100 million jobs.
So where is the world turning for guidance on how to handle the crush of visitors? To the Europeans, famed for their grand old hotel schools? Or to the Asians, renowned for their skill at pampering the road-weary? Guess again. It is turning to those masters of nuts-and-bolts business management and McDonald's-style mass marketing -- Americans. 
 Foreign students, many subsidized by governments desperate for more tourism dollars, are flocking to tourism schools across the United States. "We have over 1,000 international students from more than 85 countries this year, 54 percent majoring in hospitality or tourism," said Ana Roche, director of the International Student Center at Johnson & Wales University, which specializes in those trades. "Both those figures are up 75 percent just since 1993."
Statistics on foreign students studying hospitality and tourism in this country do not exist, but the number is thought to be well in the thousands -- and climbing rapidly. Surges similar to that at Johnson & Wales have been recorded in recent years at scores of other American institutions of learning, including George Washington University, Florida International, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, the University of Houston and Northern Arizona University.
"Twenty-five years ago, about 20 schools in the U.S. had four-year programs for hotels, restaurants and tourism," said Lee Dickson, associate dean of the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International in North Miami, which attracts many students from the Caribbean and Latin America. "Today, at least 160 schools have them."
Aspiring hotel administrators, restaurant managers, casino executives, tour organizers, theme park directors, resort developers and candidates for all the other myriad positions opening up in the industry are streaming to the United States from every continent. And despite tourism's reputation as a source of mostly low-wage jobs, many are making great personal sacrifice for the chance to join the business.
Bridget Mavuma, 26, for example, left her two young children in Botswana two years ago to earn degrees in travel and tourism management here. She misses her children every day, she said, but they are well taken care of by her husband, who was reluctant to trade the African warmth for Rhode Island winters, and by their extended African family. Furthermore, she is confident the sacrifice will pay off after she returns.
"Before, when my country limited the number of tourists, we would study tourism in the U.K., because we're a protectorate of the British Isles," Ms. Mavuma said. "But now, our Government wants more tourists, so they want us to study the U.S. educational system to learn how to do it." Those who do learn, she added, will have the inside track for the best new jobs that will become available.
Andrea de Freitas, 31, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was also eager to study in America, but did not want to leave behind her 7-year-old son -- so she brought him along to Johnson & Wales. They live in an apartment in nearby Greenville, where the boy is enrolled in a public school, learning English and playing soccer.
Ms. Freitas is looking for part-time work while she attends college, but meantime is sanguine about the future. "When I go back home with my degree, I'll be able to choose whom to work for," she said, adding that her sights are set on an international hotel under construction in Bahia in Northeast Brazil. It should be just about ready to open by the time she returns.
The sudden popularity of American mentoring is largely a reflection of the United States' economic ascendancy in the 1990's. With the nation leading the way into the global economy, even as Japan stagnates and Europe struggles to unify its currencies, American management and marketing techniques are being imitated everywhere as the path to business success.
"There are good, inexpensive schools in Europe," said Donald Hawkins, chairman of the department of tourism and hospitality management at George Washington University in Washington, "but students coming to study in the U.S. want to learn about hospitality and tourism from the world leader." At George Washington, the biggest number of such students in recent years has come from China.
John J. Bowen, the president of the main campus of Johnson & Wales (which has branch campuses in Charleston, S.C.; North Miami; Norfolk, Va., and Vail, Colo.), says the difference between European and American educational priorities is stark. "My European hotel school director friends say, 'We understand service; you understand management and profits,' " Mr. Bowen said.
And if it is a choice between knowing how to deliver good service or making a hefty profit, few tourism industry leaders-in-training hesitate. "We were shocked when our international students told us that American hotel work experience is a more highly valued commodity than European experience," said Moira Oliver, director of human resources at the Hyatt Orlando hotel. Not only does the Hyatt Hotels Corporation hire hundreds of interns each year, its sister company, Hyatt International, often sends fast-track employees to the United States for as much as a year, Ms. Oliver said, to acquire the experience necessary to advance through Hyatt International ranks.
It isn't just a yen for American knowledge and skill that draws so many foreign students to these shores. The fact is, there just are not that many slots open anywhere else. Despite an unprecedented boom in the construction of hotels, resorts, entertainment parks and other tourist attractions worldwide, few foreign colleges have degree programs to teach the necessary management and financial skills to the people who will run them.
For example, Switzerland's highly regarded Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne, founded in 1893 and the world's oldest hotel school, did not offer a four-year university-level program until 1996.
"We have schools in my country," said Nava Singam, a Malaysian who is studying for a master's degree at the School of Hotel and Restaurant Management at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. "But they only offer a two-year diploma. That wouldn't take you beyond middle management with the international hotels, and I always had a vision to do better than that."
An American education can also be a short cut to a career with one of the giant American hotel chains or entertainment conglomerates that straddle the globe. In addition to Hyatt, American Express Travel Services, Inter-Continental Hotels, Universal Studios, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and assorted cruise lines have recently hired foreign graduates of American schools.
"Experience is important," said Yap Che Che, an ebullient 20-year-old junior from Kuala Lumpur. "But most of the international hotels in Malaysia are American, so it's important to learn American standards and the American system."
Going to school in the United States has the added bonus of familiarizing foreigners with American culture -- handy knowledge when they take up jobs with their government or their country's domestic tourism industry.
"If these countries want to capture the American market, and they do," said Patti Shock, head of the tourism and convention department at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, "they have to learn what Americans want and expect, as well as their idiosyncrasies."
The course work at most American schools centers on marketing, accounting and management. But it also covers such topics as the economics of tourism, managing meetings and conventions, food and beverage operations, travel agency procedures and administration of amusement parks and cruise ships. Courses in tourism range from so-called eco-tourism (a discipline that covers everything from game parks in Africa to protecting local flora) to packaging the historic sites of a city or region in order to attract visitors -- preferably overnight visitors.
"The hands-on approach is important," said Prof. K. S. Chon, who specializes in tourism and hospitality marketing at the University of Houston, "but today you also have to learn marketing, accounting and managerial skills."
After a class in eco-tourism, which on this particular day focused on acid rain formation and ozone depletion, Helena Lofroth, 30, a senior from Skelleftea, Sweden, said, "A lot of people talk about preserving the environment, but it's important for everybody involved in the tourist industry to understand the relationship between nature and tourism."
The economic potential is enormous. Every year, the number of travelers grows by the tens of millions. Yet, some parts of the world have barely begun to build the infrastructure to receive them.
Last year, for example, the entire African continent counted a paltry 23 million visitors who spent $8.7 billion -- compared with 30 million visitors who poured $9.9 billion into Las Vegas alone.
Even wealthy industrialized countries see opportunities to expand. While tourism already accounts for some 200,000 full- or part-time jobs in Sweden, which has a population of 8.9 million, the Government is investing in small tourist businesses in the hopes of creating more jobs. Margareta Winberg, the Swedish Labor Minister, said the Government is counting heavily on tourism to meet its goal of reducing unemployment to 4 percent by 2000 from 6.7 percent today.
Indeed, the second-biggest foreign contingent studying hospitality and tourism at Johnson & Wales (trailing only the 106 students from Thailand) are the 96 students from Sweden, many of whom studied tourism at home before deciding they needed a degree from the United States.
The American economy, too, gets an enormous boost from the travel-and-tourism industry, which accounts for 15.8 million jobs, or one of every 17 working Americans, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
If a meeting of hotel school directors from some 30 countries here three years ago was any indication, the Europeans and Asians can learn something about responsive service, too.
According to Mr. Bowen, the school's president, the coffee served at the receptions on the first day of the conference tasted weak to most foreign delegates, who were used to the potent concoctions served back home. The next day, after Johnson & Wales doubled the amount of coffee used in brewing, conference participants were astonished.
"Several of them told me if that happened in their country," Mr. Bowen said, "it would have taken a week to change things."

HEADLINE: Public Lives;
On Writing Well and Teaching Even Better

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
William Zinsser is the author of "On Writing Well," a quiet how-to bible that has sold nearly a million copies in 22 years. At 75, he has come to see the teaching of writing as his ministry. Here are some things Mr. Zinsser has told his flock:
Clutter is the disease of American writing. Never use "quotidian" for "daily" or "venue" for "place." Be economical with the semicolon, unless you want to sound like Thomas Hardy. (Maybe you do; Mr. Zinsser himself uses the semicolon more often these days.) The dash -- unfairly considered "a bumpkin at the genteel dinner table of good English" -- will get you out of tight corners. 
 Above all, remember that writing well is lonely and hard, and that all writers are vulnerable and tense.
"They're always going to be vulnerable and tense," Mr. Zinsser said the other day. "And so am I." But try to enjoy yourself, he said. Good writing should entertain. It should also tell readers why an article is being written, and get to the point.
So. Next week Mr. Zinsser is donating his papers to the Fales Library of New York University. There will be a party on Tuesday to celebrate, and also to mark the publication of the sixth edition of "On Writing Well," which Mr. Zinsser updates whenever he learns something new. "I'm still learning stuff that I didn't know five years ago," he said. "No one comes to you in the mid-Medicare years and says, 'That's it! You got it!' "
Mr. Zinsser spoke in his office on East 55th Street, a sparse fourth-floor room rented from a near-bankrupt ad agency, as he luxuriated in the noise of buses groaning down Lexington Avenue. "I love it," he said. Mr. Zinsser grew up in Great Neck on Long Island, now lives on East 62d Street and since the 1970's has worn sneakers with his jackets and ties. He is the courtly offspring of a "very tidy WASP family" -- specifically, a mother who clipped funny newspaper articles for him as a child and a father who was sad when Mr. Zinsser rejected the family shellac business for the wonders of the old New York Herald Tribune. It was, of course, a gentle rebellion; no one has ever called Mr. Zinsser a revolutionary. But dignified and principled, yes.
Mr. Zinsser has had many jobs over the years (chief movie critic of The Herald Tribune was among the best), but the one he cherishes most is teacher. From 1970 to 1979, Mr. Zinsser taught a nonfiction writing course at Yale that grew into his book.
SOME of his students became professional writers, Christopher Buckley and Mark Singer of The New Yorker among them, but many more were civilians who became doctors and lawyers. Mr. Singer has solicited testimonials from them for Mr. Zinsser's party, and judging from the quality of their E-mail, they know, mostly, how to whack through verbal weeds. Mr. Zinsser will be pleased.
"My dad thought that Mr. Zinsser was great, though he never met the man," wrote a succinct Steve Ballou, a family doctor in northwest Quebec. "Of all the work I brought home from Yale, it was my creative-writing papers, and especially the profuse comments in the margins, that interested him. My dad said that he really felt he was getting his money's worth."
Irwin Popowsky, the less succinct Consumer Advocate of Pennsylvania, wrote that Mr. Zinsser's course "had a greater impact on my life" than any other at Yale, and that full sentences from "the best thing" he ever wrote -- a brief for a case he argued before the Supreme Court -- made their way into the court's decision, written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. In other words, the provenance was Mr. Zinsser, and from there the good writing found its way into the language of Mr. Rehnquist, affecting the lives of us all.
Mr. Zinsser has spent a lot of time this past year pulling together what New York University calls the William Zinsser Papers. Since he hates pomposity, written and spoken, he is quick to say that his "papers" consist of his newspaper and magazine articles, as well as 15 books he wrote and 6 he edited. He also has letters from readers and students.
How has he organized it? "Well," he said. "What you do is get new manila envelopes." He gestured to his office bookshelf, where the envelopes were neatly filed, and to a few cardboard boxes on the floor. "My entire life is in this corner," he said. Inside one of the envelopes was a 1963 article from The Saturday Evening Post on a promising new comic, Woody Allen -- one of about 200 magazine articles Mr. Zinsser wrote in a decade as a freelancer.
"I look back on it as being a lonely period," he said. "In fact, my children were born and then they went off to nursery school and I was the only one left at home." Mr. Zinsser's two children are now grown. His wife, Caroline, former director of the Bank Street School, is the program officer for education at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. They have a weekend house in Connecticut, where Mrs. Zinsser gardens and Mr. Zinsser does not. "I just sort of bicycle around looking for people to talk to," he said cheerfully. "I am not that self-amusing."
Mr. Zinsser went to Princeton and teaches writing at the New School, but is giving his papers to N.Y.U. because the school wants them. Besides, he likes the idea of having the record of his entire professional life in New York.
And he doesn't mind parting with them?
"Well," he said slowly, "I do. But I can get on the No. 6 train and go down and see them."

HEADLINE: Preservationists Criticize Rockefeller Center Renovation Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Rockefeller Center's plan to accommodate large-scale retailers by expanding its jewel-box Fifth Avenue shopfronts came under criticism yesterday from preservationists who worried that the commercial gain would come at the expense of mid-Manhattan's architectural soul.
At a hearing before the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, whose approval of the plan is required, the owners of the landmark center also parted the curtains slightly on what would be one of the biggest stores in the complex: a two-level NBC retail and entertainment center across 49th Street from Studio 1A, home of the network's "Today" show. 
 The commission will not vote on the proposal until next month. Yesterday, the panel listened to the owners and their architects, Beyer Blinder Belle, and then to private preservation groups that were generally, though not unanimously, opposed to the plan and concerned about how the gilded Prometheus would look in a reconfigured Lower Plaza.
How one views the renovation depends on how one sees the center: as an enormous sum or as many fine parts, as a superbly preserved esthetic masterpiece or as an ever-evolving commercial enterprise.
"Rockefeller Center, since the beginning, has been a dynamic landmark," said Geoffrey P. Wharton, a managing director of Tishman Speyer Properties, the part owner and operator of the center. He said the center "has not, throughout history, successfully addressed itself to Fifth Avenue."
Among many changes contemplated at the center, Tishman Speyer would convert the one-story showcases along Fifth Avenue into two-story storefronts with much more glass and larger signs.
The change would affect the British Empire Building, Maison Francaise, Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North, between 49th and 51st Streets, as well as the Atlas Court.
"Carrying out this significant change would alter the entire architectural arrangement of the Fifth Avenue facades," Charles A. Platt, the chairman of the preservation committee of the Municipal Art Society, wrote in a letter that was read aloud at the hearing.
Replacing the second-story office windows with display windows would have a "particularly disturbing effect on the beautifully executed existing entrances," Mr. Platt wrote.
David Garrard Lowe, the president of the Beaux-Arts Alliance, went further. "It absolutely destroys that facade," he said, "to go from the great, 1930's sophisticated Art Deco to a banal storefront that could be in Ho-Ho-Kus. Wherever that is."
"New Jersey," someone in the hearing room volunteered.
Preservationists also took issue with the proposal to create new entrances from the Lower Plaza to the underground shopping concourse on either side of Paul Manship's statue of Prometheus.
To accomplish this, the red granite backdrop behind Prometheus would be reduced 5 1/2 feet on either side and a new semicircular basin would be constructed, which Mr. Lowe likened to a soap dish.
The most striking objection came from Gene A. Norman, who was chairman of the landmarks commission in 1985 when Rockefeller Center was designated. Former chairmen rarely testify in public on applications before the commission.
Describing Prometheus as an identifying icon of the center, Mr. Norman said, "To change the relationship between the statue and its surroundings I believe to be a mistake."
Referring to Prometheus's mythological role, Christabel Gough, secretary of the Society for the Architecture of the City, said, "Bringing fire from the gods is an activity that requires a little latitude."
Not every preservationist at the hearing spoke against the renovation plan. In fact, the influential New York Landmarks Conservancy offered its support "enthusiastically," said Roger Lang, the director of community programs.
"The best way to preserve landmark buildings is to insure that they're economically viable," Mr. Lang said. "Merchandisers now need larger spaces at many levels to compete."
Like the opponents, however, Mr. Lang urged the commission to reject the proposal for a large granite NBC peacock set into the pavement of Rockefeller Plaza, the three-block private roadway, in front of Studio 1A.
The corner of Rockefeller Plaza and 49th Street would be dominated by NBC if the network signs a lease for 20,000 square feet of space in the base of the G. E. Building. It would build a store whose working name is the "NBC Experience," not only to sell television-related merchandise but to supplement the popular studio tours.
Rockefeller Center has been owned since 1996 by the Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. Trust, which includes Tishman Speyer, Goldman, Sachs & Company, David Rockefeller (who watched the center being built from his bedroom on West 54th Street), and members of the Agnelli and Niarchos families.

HEADLINE: Mayor Proclaims Arts Week To Showcase Student Talent

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
With schoolchildren at his side literally singing his praises for providing money to help restore arts education in some city schools, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday declared May 18-22 Arts Education Week.
Organized by the New York International Festival of the Arts, the event will allow 485 schools, almost half of the schools in the system, to showcase their glee clubs, bands, student artwork and other offerings with special performances and presentations at their schools and elsewhere. 
 The 129 cultural institutions that now assist schools with visiting artists and field trips will also participate as will about 40 professional artists, from the cellist Yo-Yo Ma to the guitarist Vernon Reid, who are scheduled to visit schools.
"New York City, which is truly blessed with boundless treasures of art and culture and is filled with millions of the most talented and creative people on the planet, should have the best arts education in the world," Mr. Giuliani said at City Hall.
Shortly thereafter the "Mosaic Minstrels," a troupe from Public School 254 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, serenaded the Mayor and other officials with a song promising that "New York will have a treat, come May 18" with all the singing and dancing.
"Oh, the Mayor, Chancellor Crew, our love to you," the children sang as Mr. Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew smiled and chuckled.
The cheery song and laughter reflected the sunnier mood these days among many arts educators. After a fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's and a recession in the 1980's, thousands of teachers were laid off and programs cut, with music and art often the first to go. But over the last few years, initiatives financed by the city and the private Annenberg Foundationhave sought to revive the arts.
The city provided $25 million last year to the Board of Education for Project ARTS (Arts Restoration to the Schools) and has earmarked $50 million for next year. So far, it has reached 438 schools and has led to the hiring of 486 full-time teachers, school officials said.
The Annenberg Foundation has provided $12 million toward a $36 million effort in which 61 schools have been linked with an array of cultural organizations to develop arts-related curriculums over five years.
But many schools still do not have full-time art or music teachers and only limited arrangements with outside artists that often do not involve all students in the school.
Indeed, P.S. 254 in Brooklyn has one music teacher for 570 students and no visual arts teacher. The school, with pupils in kindergarten through fifth grade, did not receive Project ARTS money this year but is scheduled to next year, said the principal, Pearl Glassberg.

Stocks Decline on Fears Of Higher Interest Rates
A four-day rally in stocks ended amid renewed fears that robust economic growth may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average, Standard & Poor's index and Nasdaq composite all declined.
Investors are also waiting for Friday's employment data for April and a clearer indication of just how much American corporations will be affected by the economic turmoil in Asia. Page D10. 

Prices of Treasury securities declined for a second day, sending the yield up to 5.98 percent, from 5.93 percent on Monday. D10.
 
Shares of Donna Karan Soar
Shares of Donna Karan rose nearly 12 percent after the fashion house said first-quarter earnings had more than doubled. The company attributed the increase to its decision to license large parts of its business and the hiring of a new chief executive, John D. Idol, who has cut costs. Donna Karan went public in June 1996 at $24, but its stock has disappointed investors since then. D2.
 
Merrill Case Could End System
A proposed settlement of a discrimination suit filed by women brokers against Merrill Lynch could lead to the end of Wall Street's system for dealing with employee cases through mandatory arbitration. Market Place. D9.
 
Cox Buying Las Vegas Cable System
Cox Communications is buying Prime South Diversified, the cable television system that serves Las Vegas, Nev., as part of a larger deal valued at $1.33 billion. D9.
 
Violence Threatens Indonesian Aid
The International Monetary Fund, with the backing of the Clinton Administration, has sent $1 billion in aid to Indonesia, rewarding the nation for beginning to enact long-promised economic reforms. Yet escalating violence could quickly sink the effort to stabilize the economy. A12.
 
Leading Indicators Climb 0.2%
The Conference Board's index of leading indicators, which combines 10 measures of economic activity into one index, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March. Half of the measures, including stock prices and money supply, increased, while four fell, notably consumer expectations and the length of the workweek. Weekly unemployment claims were unchanged. D3.
 
Vote Postponed on Financial Bill
Voting on a bill to revamp laws governing the financial services industries will be delayed until next week, the House Republican leader, Representative Dick Armey, announced. D2.
 
Cendant Earnings Top Expectations
The marketing and franchising company Cendant, which reported accounting problems last month, said it earned $230 million, or 26 cents a share, in the first quarter, slightly beating Wall Street expectations. The results, however, may be revised because of the investigation of the accounting irregularities at one of its units. D2.
 
Investigation Focuses on Allstate
Federal investigators are looking into allegations that Allstate Insurance doctored documents to reduce policyholders' claim amounts following the 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif. D9.

HEADLINE: A Huge Building Honors A Foe of Bigness: Reagan

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
They have short memories inside the Beltway.
Ronald Reagan, you may recall, was the President who abhorred big Government, cost overruns and busybody Federal regulators. He made that clear as soon as he hit town, declaring in his inaugural address in 1981: "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." 
 And he kept right at it. Once he told a crowd in Montana: "The source of our economic problems is finally beginning to dawn on the bafflegabbers and those fancy dudes in Washington: Government is too big and it spends too much."
Well, nobody as much as breathed such ideas today, at least in public, when some of the capital's fanciest dudes turned out to help dedicate the second-biggest United States Government building ever constructed (after the Pentagon). It came in at $816 million, a mere $448 million more than Congress projected in 1987. It will house, among others, a large contingent from the Environmental Protection Agency, which President Reagan cordially loathed.
But the Gipper's name is chiseled into the limestone facade anyway. The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center joins a medical institute at George Washington University, the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport across the Potomac River in Virginia, a bridge in Illinois, a freeway in California, a turnpike in Florida and a state office building in Los Angeles on the long list of tributes to the nation's 40th President.
Standing in the building's soaring atrium, President Clinton said that he sensed "the essence" of Mr. Reagan in "this incredible space." Standing in for her husband, now 87 and ill with Alzheimer's disease, Nancy Reagan hailed the sprawling, L-shaped, sort-of-modern structure as "magnificent."
Magnificently big, without question; the concrete used in the building would pave 106 miles of two-lane highway, the floor space exceeds that of the Empire State Building and the exterior contains 42,000 slabs of Indiana limestone. There are no fewer than 13,000 doors and 21,000 light fixtures inside.
Designed by James Ingo Freed, the building completes the Federal Triangle, a complex of Government properties authorized by Congress in 1926 to replace a shabby neighborhood along Pennsylvania Avenue, a few blocks from the White House.
The style of the structure is severe. Unlike the 1908 John Wilson building that nestles within its "L," its columns have no fluting, its capitals have no carving and its facade is bereft of swags, shields and moldings. It looks like a neo-Classical building waiting for the stone carvers to show up.
The idea was to complement but not to mimic the academic style of its neighbors. In that it succeeds, but it has none of the freshness or clarity of Washington's most celebrated modern building, the angular East Building of the National Gallery, farther down the avenue. That was designed by Mr. Freed's partner, I. M. Pei.
Eventually, the structure will house 7,000 Federal workers, a 980-seat food court, restaurants and a privately run trade center that includes office space, a 650-seat auditorium and extensive exhibition spaces.
For his part, Mr. Clinton used the occasion to recall Mr. Reagan as an internationalist and to urge Mr. Reagan's Republican followers in Congress to honor his legacy by providing money for the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations.
"President Reagan once said we had made what he called 'an unbreakable commitment' to the I.M.F., one that was unbreakable because in this age of economic interdependence, an investment in the I.M.F. is simply an investment in American prosperity," Mr. Clinton said today.
Then he quoted Mr. Reagan as saying in 1985: " 'The U.N. stands as the symbol of the hopes of all mankind for a more peaceful and productive world. We must not disappoint those hopes.' We still must not disappoint those hopes."
There is almost as much disagreement over the building as over international spending. Some find it dignified and impressive; Benjamin Forgey of The Washington Post called it "brilliant." But Deborah Dietsch, former editor of Architecture magazine, said its "watered-down classicism" was "neither fish nor fowl."
Michael Reagan, the President's eldest son, derided it last year as Mount Wastemore.
Representative John J. (Jimmy) Duncan Jr., a Tennessee Republican who has been one the project's most persistent critics, said: "It's one of the biggest boondoggles ever seen in Federal construction.. We will wind up with a beautiful, well-constructed building, but one that will cost twice what it should have."
Washington is like that, as Ronald Reagan himself discovered. Things grow. When he took over from Jimmy Carter, the Federal deficit stood at $73.8 billion. Eight years later, as George Bush took office, it stood at $155 billion.

HEADLINE: The Indonesian Tangle: How It Enmeshes the U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
In the last few days, President Suharto has ruled out any significant expansion of political freedom in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, until 2002, if not later. And his military chief has warned that protests could grow into anarchy, and promised "stern action" to quell student unrest.
Inside the Clinton Administration, those announcements signaled the possibility of enormous trouble ahead, as it worried that repression would only worsen the unrest. 
 On Monday, thousands of people angry about price increases rampaged in the worst outbreak of violence in Indonesia since its economy buckled last year. At least 94 people were taken into police custody.
Unlike student protesters, the rioters focused primarily on economic problems.
Officials in Washington worry that it is not possible to reverse Indonesia's flight of investors if they are fretting that the country is about to descend into chaos. And without the return of investors, the economy will worsen further.
So even as the State Department was expressing "extreme concern" about reports of escalating violence and the kidnapping of dissidents, the Clinton Administration on Monday voted through the International Monetary Fund to restart aid to Indonesia.
As it has since the Indonesian crisis began, the Administration once again put the top priority on economic stability. The fund, rewarding Indonesia for enacting some long-promised economic reforms, sent $1 billion and promised that more would follow if reforms continued.
As Administration officials readily concede, this could be their year of living dangerously with Indonesia. The entire economic rescue, a top official noted recently, "goes down the tubes if the place erupts," in a vicious cycle of economic and political collapse.
This was not a problem in South Korea and Thailand, the other Asian countries receiving I.M.F. aid, which were strengthening democratic institutions at the same time as they were undergoing economic reforms.
In recent days, in conversations with Indonesian officials here and in Jakarta, Administration officials have repeatedly warned that growing violence is undermining the confidence of the markets, just as President Suharto is desperately trying to raise the value of the country's currency.
In short, they are suggesting that the markets may accomplish what Washington cannot compel: meting out punishment if Indonesia cannot avert growing instability and a political crackdown.
And yet, in public at least, the Administration continues to maintain that questions of human rights and economic stability are divorced from each other. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's priority throughout the Asian crisis has been to contain economic contagion -- keeping what ails Indonesia from re-igniting a crisis elsewhere in Asia.
And at the I.M.F., officials note that their charter prohibits them from delving into a nation's political life when setting conditions for economic bailouts.
That sounds fine, but in Indonesia's case, it is an impossible line to draw: there is nothing more political than dictating whether a country can subsidize food, or whether it must break up a monopoly owned by the President's family.
Yet the Clinton Administration has insisted that it is economic reform that will determine its vote on whether to turn the fund's aid on or off.
Asked about how the Administration was squaring its concern about political repression with its votes at the I.M.F., Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said today, "We are aggressively pursuing these issues on parallel tracks."
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, tried a somewhat different formulation, reaching to celestial geometry. "We are working in separate orbits that intersect," he said, pursuing economic reform at the Treasury and I.M.F. and raising concerns about political stability and human rights through the State Department.
Mr. Rubin tried to align the planets a little differently, declaring, "The best protection against a political breakdown is the restoration of financial stability."
Administration officials involved in the hours of meetings over how to deal with the possibility of economic implosion or violent political upheaval in a country of 200 million say there has been little doubt that continuing aid is needed.
The State Department is clearly worried that if it does not provide some kind of economic aid it will be cut off from any kind of dialogue with the 76-year-old Mr. Suharto. "This puts him in the position of needing us and needing to engage with us," a senior official said, while admitting that Mr. Suharto has ignored much of the advice he has received. Cutting off the aid, the official argued, would "worsen the economic crisis, and probably precipitate a deeper political crisis."
Nonetheless, there is no way to provide aid to a country without appearing to strengthen its leader. That leaves Mr. Clinton in the position of doing exactly what he accused George Bush of doing during the 1992 Presidential debates: propping up dictators in the name of trade and stability.
Mr. Clinton's advisers do not deny that in stabilizing the Indonesian economy, they may also be stabilizing Mr. Suharto's hold on power. But the alternative, they say, is to imperil the lives of Indonesians and risk a new eruption in Asia just as the last one appears tamped down, at least for now.
"The Indonesian people -- particularly the poorest -- have a tremendous interest in seeing financial stability restored," said David Lipton, the Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs. "And so do we."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Race for California Governor Is Not Necessarily the News

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 5

 BODY:
California's closely contested race for governor took a significant turn the other day: a new poll showed that for the first time in months, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, a phlegmatic 20-year veteran of state politics, had edged ahead of his richer, flashier rivals for the Democratic nomination.
The local CBS television station reported that development on its evening news, but only after its accounts about a rash of freeway shootings, a case of suspected child abuse, a veterinarian accused of torturing cats, pirated "Titanic" videos, a new kind of lie detector, a new car alarm that shocks would-be thieves, the Lakers, the weather, Monica S. Lewinsky and a wave of rattlesnake sightings induced by El Nino. 
 The sole mention of Mr. Davis in the first half of the hourlong newscast was a 30-second paid commercial, about his support for education. And this was on a station, KCBS-TV, that local political professionals credit with doing among the best reporting about their business.
Here in the state that gave the nation the tax revolt, managed health care, the explosion of the ballot initiative and the rise of environmentalism, another phenomenon has been introduced: the all-commercial political campaign.
In a primary election on June 2, the nation's most populous state will begin choosing a new leader for the world's seventh-largest economy. But except for the millions of dollars in paid advertising that floods the airwaves day and night, hardly anyone would know it. The campaign is all but invisible on television news and only sporadically gets front-page newspaper coverage.
"You're looking at the epicenter of complete disinterest in politics," said Douglas Sosnik, senior adviser to President Clinton and former White House political director, who noted that Los Angeles was the only market in the nation where even a Presidential visit did not automatically draw notice on the local news. "It's the toughest media market in the country to break through. You have to buy time to break through."
That is an old complaint from scholars and political professionals, and one that is echoed, to a lesser degree, in other big media markets at a time when the economy is strong and the public not seized by consuming conflicts like the cold war or the civil rights struggle. But longtime veterans of California politics agree that this election year marks some kind of new low in a state where politics has often been much less of a spectator sport than in places with more combative partisan traditions, like New York or Illinois.
A recent statewide poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that just 6 percent of voters were following news coverage of the campaign very closely, roughly half the levels reported at comparable periods before recent primary elections for governor in New Jersey and New York.
The news gap here is part of a broader fragmented political culture. This state is so big and diverse, and with such distinct regions, that it actually amounts to three or four good-sized states thrown together. Distances are vast, cities lack a single unifying core, and the gulf between California's population (increasingly young, diverse and nonwhite) and its electorate (increasingly older, white and conservative) has been growing for years. There are, in short, other reasons why campaigns here seem so distant, and at times surrealistically disconnected, from daily life.
All that said, veterans of politics say California's lack of news coverage plays a big part.
"It's pathetic," said Josh Mankiewicz, a former political reporter for WCBS-TV in New York, who moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to cover politics for KCAL, an independent station, and is now a network correspondent for "Dateline" on NBC. "In New York, being a political reporter's a big deal; in L.A., it's a backwater."
The absence of much coverage of the current campaign is exacerbated by timing: the June 2 primary immediately follows the May television ratings "sweeps" period, when local newscasts run all sorts of sensational stories and series intended to increase viewership. Until two weeks ago, Bill Carrick, the chief strategist for one of Lieutenant Governor Davis's rivals, Representative Jane Harman, had not received a single query about the campaign from a local television reporter. Then one called to say that coverage could begin in earnest at the end of May, after the sweeps ended.
"There is a sense here among local news people that people do not care about politics, and it has to do with ratings," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School who provides commentary for KCAL. "If there was a debate held on a freeway that could be covered by helicopter, then we might get some coverage."
The news director at KCBS, Larry Perret, said viewer surveys repeatedly showed that Californians "just don't seem to have a keen interest in following politics."
"In Chicago and Boston, we covered politics as sports," said Mr. Perret, who worked in both cities before returning to his native California a decade ago. "The figures there seem more colorful; they come out swinging. Here people just don't do that as much."
That is true enough, and the perpetual joke about Gray Davis among politicians is that he is aptly named.
But his campaign manager, Garry South, complains that the last time Mr. Davis even got the chance to make much of a splash on television was 16 months ago, when Gov. Pete Wilson was out of state and Mr. Davis, as Acting Governor, offered a reward in the killing of Bill Cosby's son, Ennis. "If what you're saying or proposing does not have a nexus with some extremely hot issue, like crime or a car chase or a beheading or child molestation, it's just not news," Mr. South said.
Is lack of public interest driving the lack of coverage, or the other way around?
"The public's interest is not the issue," said Patrick Caddell, who was Jimmy Carter's pollster and political strategist and has lived here for a decade. "It's a circular argument. How can you be interested in politics if there's no coverage of it?"
Mr. Caddell said he was considering suing one or more of the local network-owned and -operated stations to have their Federal licenses revoked on the ground that they had failed to fulfill their public service obligation.
The current state of affairs "reduces politics to nothing but commercial television, and to the question of who has money and who can get on TV," he said. "It creates an artificial political atmosphere."
The issue is especially acute this year, because one Democratic contender for governor, Al Checchi, former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, who is worth three-quarters of a billion dollars, has already spent more than $25 million of his own money on the race -- most of it for advertising -- and is poised to break all election spending records for a non-Presidential contest. Ms. Harman is also wealthy, but she and Mr. Davis can barely begin to match Mr. Checchi's spending and must depend more on news coverage.
Ms. Harman's campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, said she had made a splash on statewide television only once during the race, when stories surfaced that she might have illegally employed a British immigrant as a nanny for her children nearly a decade ago. On the day she declared her candidacy in March, Mr. Kuwata said, no radio stations covered the speech, and they even declined the campaign's offer to have Ms. Harman call in to talk-show hosts.
Paid television advertising so dominates the discourse that Mark H. Willes and Michael Parks, the publisher and the editor of The Los Angeles Times, decided that the paper should sponsor a candidate forum next week -- a step it had not generally taken in the past -- where the contenders could talk in a setting with time for more than slogans and sound bites. All three Democrats and the certain Republican nominee, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, have agreed to participate, in what seems likely to be the sole face-to-face encounter of the campaign.
Students of California agree that part of the reason for the apathy about politics here lies in the state's progressive past, in which strong partisanship never played quite the role it played in Eastern and Midwestern cities. Another factor is the rise of the ballot initiative, in which controversial matters are decided directly by voters, thus minimizing the leeway that the Governor and the Legislature have over taxes, spending and major policy issues.
"We've so tied down representative government that there's less and less action by elected officials, and the people don't focus on it," said Peter Schrag, who recently retired after nearly 20 years as editorial page editor of The Sacramento Bee and has just published a book on California's political culture, "Paradise Lost: California's Experience, America's Future" (The New Press).
And, Mr. Schrag added, "I don't know of any time when it's been as bad as it is now."
Until a decade ago, the network-owned and -operated stations in Los Angeles had Statehouse bureaus in Sacramento. Then they closed them, in a cost-saving move, although Mr. Perret of KCBS said his station was considering stepping up its Statehouse coverage once again.
There may be an appetite. Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who conducted the recent statewide poll that found scant public following of the campaign, said a separate series of focus groups with 140 voters in six regions throughout the state had shown wide dissatisfaction.
"We heard over and over again that people were really tired of getting their information through TV ads and were looking for better sources of information," Mr. Baldassare said. "People were very clear about how few opportunities they had to judge the candidates side by side. They know they're making their choices based on television advertising alone, and they're very unhappy about it."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Ties Early Release From Prison to Frequent Drug Testing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
In an effort to trim its overcrowded prisons and stop drug-using felons from committing new crimes, Connecticut's Legislature passed a bill this week that will drastically cut prison time for nonviolent offenders on the condition that they undergo frequent testing for drug use.
The offenders may be tested as often as three times a week, and every time their urine test proves positive, they will be detained for two days in a spartan halfway house that falls just short of being a jail. If they fail the test repeatedly, they can be sent back to prison. 
 Although Maryland was the first to pass such a law, Connecticut, with a single state judicial system instead of many county courts, will likely be the first to put it into place statewide.
If they succeed, other states may look to follow their lead. Next year, the Federal Government will require states to have a plan for regularly testing prisoners and parolees to qualify for Federal funds to build new prisons.
Keeping an inmate behind bars costs about $25,000 a year. But Connecticut Representative Robert Farr, a Republican from West Hartford, who proposed the bill, estimated that the drug-testing program would cost $3,000 per person a year, plus probation costs.
The bill would make nonviolent prisoners eligible for this type of parole after serving at least half of a two- to four-year sentence. Typically, prisoners in Connecticut served at least two-thirds of their sentence before parole, and, although they could be tested for drugs while on parole, such tests have been random and infrequent.
The bill sailed through both houses unanimously; the State House of Representatives passed it on Saturday and the State Senate on Monday night. Lawmakers said that they expected Gov. John G. Rowland to sign the bill.
Republicans embraced the notion of a "zero-tolerance drug supervision program," as the bill is titled, while Democrats welcomed the alternative to long prison terms for addicted offenders.
The bill does not provide any extra money for drug treatment, although Connecticut is in the advantageous position of having enough treatment slots for drug abusers who want to quit. The problem had been in motivating them to do so.
But Representative Farr, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said that the threat of repeated short-term confinement provided an incentive for an addicted criminal to find treatment and take personal responsibility for his or her rehabilitation.
"In our prison and parole programs, a substantial number of our people are using drugs," he said. "Now for the first time, we're saying there will be consequences."
Nationwide, four out of five prisoners behind bars are there because of some direct or indirect involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, according to a recent study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
The study, released in January, also found that half the people who committed a new crime while on parole or probation were under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The drug-testing program that Connecticut is planning has no large-scale precedent, though Washington, D.C., and Lansing, Mich., saw success with smaller pilot programs.
In a trial program last year in Coos County, Ore., the number of drug offenders who tested positive dropped from 40 percent in the first month to 10 percent by the sixth month, according to Mark A.R. Kleiman, an expert on drug policy who presented the testing concept to some Connecticut lawmakers late last year.
Professor Kleiman, a professor of policy studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, has promoted frequent drug testing for offenders on probation and parole, who he said account for 60 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.
"This program will encourage people to go into treatment if they need it, will encourage them to stick with it and will encourage them to succeed," he said in a telephone interview yesterday. "This is the single best shot we have at reducing hard-drug use and shrinking prison populations."
Representative Michael P. Lawlor, co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee of Connecticut's General Assembly, described the bill as a saner way to handle addicts who keep committing crimes to buy their drugs.
"Our policy has been a huge failure," Mr. Lawlor said. "We need to measure its effectiveness rather than its sexiness at election time."
He said that drug-related crime helped swell Connecticut's prison population to nearly 16,000 at the end of March, from 3,600 in 1980, and that one-quarter of the imprisoned were locked up for selling or possessing narcotics. Like many other states, Connecticut now finds itself spending more on its prisons than on its public universities and colleges. Mr. Farr estimated that there were about 20,000 regular drug users on probation or parole.
A program of coerced abstinence does not look likely to be implemented in New York or New Jersey soon. New Jersey tests selected parolees for drugs. In New York, state prisons held 23,510 drug offenders -- one-third of the total population -- including 5,724 locked up for possessing illegal drugs, as of the end of 1996. Republican lawmakers representing rural constituencies that benefit economically from new prisons have opposed relaxing the state's tough mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses.
And treatment centers in New York State are hard put to provide help to everyone who needs it. John J. Coppola, executive director of the New York State Association of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Providers, said that "when the person is leaving prison and going back to their community, if they're not in touch with a treatment provider, they're left to their own devices."
Connecticut's drug offenders who opt for parole or probation would likely be tested three times a week at first, then less often if they come up drug-free. Representative Farr said the routine of testing and sanctions could be phased in by this autumn. He envisioned starting with 10 beds for violators and expanding gradually to more than 300 slots.
"We have to start small, we have to start slow," he said. "We don't have any experience running this program."
Connecticut's new state budget includes an initial appropriation of $420,000 for three more probation officers, drug tests and a halfway facility to start the program.
Last year, the General Assembly voted down a broader package of legislation that treated drug abuse as a public health problem rather than a criminal justice issue.
No such antipathy has been expressed toward the tough-sounding program of zero-tolerance drug supervision. Representative Richard D. Tulisano, a Democratic majority whip who represents Hartford's southern suburbs, said the bill should be used as a tool to turn drug users into productive citizens.
"We know that addicts fail," he said. "That's got to be built into this. One failure in two or three years is different from one failure every week."

HEADLINE: A Monet Leads a Modest Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Even in today's market, with buyers hungry for good material, few were tempted by the unsavory and in some cases overpriced offerings at Christie's sale of Impressionist and 19th-century art last night.
Of the 44 works up for sale, only 31 found buyers. The sale totaled $35.6 million, far below its low estimate of $62.9 million. Not since the art market took a nose dive in the early 1990's has Christie's has seen such poor results. 
 The salesroom was by no means overflowing, as it usually is at important evening sales of Impressionist art. The scarcity of works fresh to the market may have been one factor; classification was another.
Last night, Christie's broke away from the traditional categories, pairing top-flight 19th-century works by artists like Bouguereau and Boldini alongside those by masters like Monet and Degas. Christie's experts said they felt the change reflected their clients' buying patterns. (Sotheby's has not followed suit.) While many 19th-century paintings performed well, in some cases better than they might have if they had been in a strictly 19th-century sale, the combination may have turned off buyers of Impressionist and modern art.
The date may also have been a negative factor. The sale came a week before all the other big evening sales: Sotheby's auction of Impressionist and modern art, its sale of contemporary art and Christie's sale of 20th-century art. Many European and Asian collectors who usually fly to New York to attend all the sales had to make a choice, and they didn't choose Christie's. "Some lots were ambitiously estimated, but the sale was not of the quality of the last two years," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America, who was the evening's auctioneer. "It was an anticlimax from last season."
Mr. Burge pointed out the lack of estate property available this spring, which accounted for the slim sale. Moreover, given today's strong economy, collectors interested in selling weren't willing to part with their art, believing the market hasn't reached its peak.
Certain paintings, however, brought strong prices. Monet's "Waterloo Bridge in the Fog" (1903), a pale, hazy painting, had several bidders interested. It finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $5.2 million, just above its low estimate of $5 million. One reason for its success, Mr. Burge said, was that last fall, another Monet of the same series and the same date, "Waterloo Bridge in the Mist," brought $8.2 million, well over its high estimate of $6 million.
(Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Another high price for a popular painting was the $2.2 million paid for Courbet's "Gust of Wind or the Approaching Storm," a dramatic 56 1/2-by-90-inch landscape painted in 1855. It set a record for the artist when Bruno Meissner, a private dealer in Zurich, bought it for $2.2 million, nearly twice its high estimate of $1.2 million.
"We had very strong bidding on this picture coming from traditional Courbet buyers and collectors of Impressionist paintings and even 20th-century works of art," said Franck Giraud, who runs Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments in New York. "It is the best Courbet landscape to come on the market in memory."
But the Courbet was one of the evening's few bright spots. The sale included seven Renoirs, and many went unsold. The painting with the evening's highest estimate, Renoir's "Young Girl Holding a Bouquet of Tulips," an 1878 profile portrait, was estimated at $15 million, but there were no takers at that price. When bidding stopped at $11.5 million, gasps reverberated around the salesroom. By the time many of the artist's fleshy nudes came on the block, no one blinked when they went unsold.
Much of the property up for sale last night came from Europe. Many European sellers are shipping art to New York for sale, given the advantage of avoiding large import taxes now imposed on works coming into European Union countries and the depressed economies of countries like France and Italy. Sellers also believe America is where the big money is spent. Last night, they were wrong.
Degas's "Dancers in a Studio" (1900-05), for example, came from a private collector in Switzerland. But it failed to elicit a bid of more than $4 million, $1 million short of its low estimate, and went unsold.
One of the best works in the sale, van Gogh's "Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer," an exquisite pen-and-ink drawing from 1888, was thought to have many interested bidders. While there were several, no one was willing to overspend. The drawing was sold to an unidentified private collector for $5 million, just at its low estimate.
Many works came from Japan and had been bought in the height of the market in the late 1980's by Japanese businessmen who were in financial trouble just a few years later. Last night, the sellers were in many cases creditors who wanted high prices that the market was simply unprepared to pay.
"There was too much lackluster material, which brought lackluster prices," said Guy Stair Sainty, a Manhattan dealer. "Auction houses experts were so desperate to fill these sales they had to promise sellers big prices, which in the end they couldn't get."

HEADLINE: TV Notes;
'Lolita' Reaches A U.S. Audience

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Showtime announced yesterday that it had acquired the rights to Adrian Lyne's much-debated new film, "Lolita," which means the $58 million movie, based on the Vladimir Nabokov novel, will be seen on American television without a prior release to theaters in this country. "Lolita" is the most expensive film ever to go directly to television.
The deal, which was months in the works, was completed after Showtime agreed to buy all United States rights to the film, including any future theatrical release and videocassette sales, and to give it additional exposure on the Sundance Channel, which is devoted to independent films and is programmed by Showtime. The film will have its American premiere in August on both channels, with Showtime running a standard format and the Sundance Channel showing the film in the letterbox format (a wide frame with black borders on the screen) that Mr. Lyne, the director, preferred. 
 "It's a huge relief," Mr. Lyne said yesterday by phone from his home in France. "I'm very happy. I'm excited the film will finally be seen in America after all the nonsense and lies that had been told about it."
Mr. Lyne's "Lolita" had been searching vainly for a theatrical distributor in the United States since it was completed more than a year ago. "Lolita" was first made into a film in 1962, but the new movie's presentation of the subject matter -- the love affair of a man in his 40's, played by Jeremy Irons, and a pre-teen-ager, played by a newcomer, Dominique Swain -- was clearly deemed too risky for conventional film distributors.
Showtime entered the negotiations for "Lolita" several months ago, but Mr. Lyne was still hoping to gain some initial release in American theaters. The deal yesterday closed out that hope, although Showtime did make a commitment to seeking a release in theaters after "Lolita" plays its initial five or six runs on Showtime and the Sundance Channel.
Jerry Offsay, the president for programming for Showtime, said he had held discussions with several distributors. "It's my expectation that the film will get a theatrical run, if the economics makes sense," he said. He added that film distributors had shied away from the film because of its content and the costs of promotion and advertising, which might have run as much as $15 million. But after a release on Showtime, with all the publicity that it is expected to generate, there may not be as much need for expensive promotion, Mr. Offsay said.
He did not disclose what Showtime paid to acquire "Lolita," but said it was "not an unusual price" for the television showings. What made it unusually high, he said, was Showtime's agreement to buy all American rights to the film. "That clearly made it a higher-cost deal," Mr. Offsay said, adding that Showtime was pleased to deliver a much-talked-about film to the public.
"Our job is to put on the best programming available," Mr. Offsay said. "This is a terrific film. If there's a terrific film out there, it's our job to get it in front of people."
Last year, Showtime purchased the rights to "Bastard Out of Carolina" which had been rejected by the cable channel TNT because of concerns about its content. (A child was raped in the film.) Mr. Lyne said he had been impressed with how Showtime handled "Bastard Out of Carolina," which was later nominated for an Emmy as the best film of the year. BILL CARTER

Sales Tax Exemption Is Proposed for Film Work

DATELINE: WEST ORANGE

 BODY:
In an effort to help New Jersey's growing movie industry, lawmakers plan to unveil legislation tomorrow that would exempt from the state's 6 percent sales tax purchases related to the production of films. 
 The tax break would apply to hotel rooms, catering fees and other purchases by film production companies that would ordinarily be subject to sales taxes. The break would cost an estimated $1.2 million to $1.4 million in tax revenues, but could help generate much more than that in economic activity, said State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos, a Republican from Middletown, who is a co-sponsor of the bill with Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains. The two Senators are to announce the measure at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, home of the Black Maria, considered the first film studio.

HEADLINE: April's Auto Sales Prove Unexpectedly Strong

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 5

 BODY:
The auto industry turned in unexpectedly strong April sales results today, the first month this year in which customers bought more cars and trucks than they did during the same period of last year.
The sales spurt came as heavy mortgage refinancings in the first quarter of the year gave buyers extra money to spend on monthly car payments while hefty rebates drew them to showrooms. 
 Industry sales rose 6.3 percent in April, compared with April 1997. Sales hit a brisk seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.5 million, above the 15 million rate in March and well up from the 14.5 million pace in April 1997.
The General Motors Corporation turned in particularly strong results today, double some analysts' expectations. Its sales last month rose 8.5 percent, with car sales edging up seven-tenths of a percent and sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans rising 18.9 percent compared with April 1997.
Most Wall Street analysts were expecting a sales decline at the Ford Motor Company, but again, their estimates turned out to be too pessimistic. Ford sales rose 1.6 percent, with car sales up 2.3 percent and sales of light trucks up 1 percent.
"Everybody came in with numbers better than we were looking for," said Nicholas J. Colas, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. The industry's results were pushed up by G.M.'s strong showing, which in turn was the result, he said, of "cash on the hood."
In addition, a boom in home mortgage refinancings in January and February left many consumers with more money to spend on car payments. "We're starting to get payoffs to mortgage refinancing activity," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist at the First Chicago NBD Corporation in Chicago.
In mid-March, G.M. began offering more generous rebates and discounted lease deals, and in late April it ignited an industry price war by piling on additional discounts by sending coupons to tens of millions of previous G.M. buyers. Those loyalty rebates were matched late last month by Ford and the Chrysler Corporation, which agreed to accept G.M.'s coupons for their vehicles, too.
G.M. estimated today that the loyalty coupons won it about 9,000 additional sales in April, but predicted those rebates would have a more dramatic effect this month. April's strong sales were the result of G.M.'s earlier increased rebates and financing discounts, strong sales from the Chevrolet division and better supplies of trucks with popular V8 engines and four-wheel-drive capability, said Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s director of market research and forecasting.
Some analysts said the higher rebates offered by the Big Three American auto makers would spur sales this month and later this year by changing price dynamics for the least expensive cars and trucks. "The coupons on top of the incentives already out there are making the new cars more competitive with used cars," particularly for small cars and small pickups, said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Earlier this year, it tended to be cheaper to buy a two-year-old midsized car coming off lease than to buy a new small car or pickup, but the rebates have reversed that equation, she said.
Most other auto makers reporting sales this week posted strong results. Volkswagen A.G. sales jumped 58.7 percent; Porsche A.G. sales increased 59.3 percent; BMW A.G. sales rose 12.2 percent, and A.B. Volvo sales climbed 8 percent. But, Hyundai sales fell 37 percent and Mazda Motor Company sales declined 5.4 percent.
On Friday, other large auto makers said their sales were strong. Chrysler sales rose 8.2 percent, Toyota sales jumped 10.5 percent and Honda sales increased 12.5 percent.
Among big auto makers, the only dismal results in April were reported by the Nissan Motor Company, which is the sixth-largest seller in the United States market after G.M., Ford, Chrysler, Toyota and Honda. Nissan announced Friday that its sales plunged 24.2 percent last month, and were down 29.5 percent for the first four months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year.
The Japanese auto maker notified employees today that its huge factory in Smyrna, Tenn., will be closed every Friday through Oct. 2. Factory workers will be given a choice of taking vacation time on those days or receiving half pay.
The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. has repeatedly replaced senior sales and marketing executives over the last several years, with little success so far. Nissan is suffering from what the company now describes as a failed experiment in improving its long-term brand image by running abstract advertisements that won praise in the advertising industry but complaints from dealers because the ads said little about Nissan's cars.
"We focused on 2005 and 2010 and forgot to focus on 1997 and 1998," said Michael J. Seergy, the new general manager for Nissan cars and trucks. The company changed ad strategies this spring and has now returned to the industry tradition of emphasizing vehicles' features.
Nissan has also suffered from the withering of the small-car market in the United States and the company's own slowness in moving into faster-growing market segments. While the Toyota RAV-4 and Honda CR-V small sport utility vehicles have sold briskly for more than a year, for example, Nissan does not offer a small sport utility vehicle. Its small sport utility vehicle is due next year.

HEADLINE: High Point Rejoices as Furniture Sales Climb

BYLINE: By LIZ SEYMOUR 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C.

 BODY:
MODERNISM steamed into the International Home Furnishings Market, the world's largest wholesale furniture exposition, with all flags flying.
After several seasons of cautious experimentation with cleaner looks, the American furniture industry embraced 20th-century design with a fervor that took even longtime market goers by surprise. 
 The most startling symbol of High Point's sea change rose four stories in the middle of town. Natuzzi, the giant Italian leather producer, commissioned the Italian architect Mario Bellini to design its sleek 110,000-square-foot showroom and American headquarters with a skyward-jutting glass and bronze prow.The building evokes an ocean liner, but it could have been the Good Ship Lollipop, judging by the benign mood of buyers and sellers at this market, which ended on May 1.
In sharp contrast with the last few years of sluggish business, many companies were reporting double-digit sales increases.
"This could turn out to be the biggest market in history," said Carl Levine, an industry consultant and former home furnishings merchandise manager for Bloomingdale's. "In more than 30 years, I have never seen such complete enthusiasm and excitement from retail buyers."
The furniture industry was, in fact, finally getting its share of a five-year trend toward greater spending on home furnishings in general. The retail analyst Kurt Barnard noted in the April issue of his newsletter, Barnard's Retail Trend Report, that since mid-1996, Americans have been spending more on items for their homes -- everything from sheets and towels to paint -- than on apparel. Based on his own research and on figures from the United States Commerce Department, Mr. Barnard pegged home spending at $296.3 billion in 1997, compared with $277.9 billion on apparel. "It's partly a function of demographics," Mr. Barnard said. "People are less concerned with preening and a lot more concerned with enhancing their home environment."
With designers like Todd Oldham using upholstery fabric on the runway and Donna Karan and Calvin Klein designing home and apparel collections simultaneously, interiors are becoming a fashion force. "They can see what's happening," said Catherine Stein, the founder of the Color Council, a trend forecaster. "If you follow the money trail, home is where the action is."
A survey by the Home Furnishings Council and Hearst Magazines showed that 62 percent of single consumers under 35 bought a piece of furniture in the last year and that younger consumers were the ones most likely to agree with the statement "I like to shop for furniture."
There was no denying that the stock market deserved a lot of the credit for High Point's optimistic mood. "Five years ago, our biggest competition was with savings for retirement," said Jay Reardon, the president of the Hickory Chair Company. "Now, people are feeling that they've taken care of the future and they're ready to spend."
But there was also a sense that the industry was finally addressing some of its internal problems, from styling to quality to delivery times.
Buyers shopping the market -- the actual furniture will reach stores in the fall -- seemed particularly eager to connect with sleek, mid-century style. The Bernhardt Furniture Company reported that its 1930's-style Paris group, introduced last year, had been a best-seller; so it followed up in the same vein this time with a collection of streamlined tables. Larry Laslo's new collection for Bexley Heath invoked the spirits of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean-Michel Frank and Andre Arbus. Ralph Lauren weighed in at Henredon with his Penthouse line, a beautifully proportioned group in mahogany veneer and with silver-plated hardware. The New York designer Vicente Wolf split his new Art Deco-style collection between two mid-price companies, Carsons and Casa Bique.
"Retailers are starting to understand that they're losing a lot of customers to Pottery Barn," Mr. Wolf said. "People are just not buying that old Shinola anymore."
In fact, the big mainstream furniture companies were taking the success of stores like Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel and Restoration Hardware very much to heart. Pale wood, brushed nickel, frosted glass, the hybrid Shaker-Mission-contemporary style that the industry newspaper Furniture Today has dubbed "boomer casual," was everywhere, from small designer-owned companies to industry giants like Thomasville, Stanley, Bassett, Broyhill and Pennsylvania House.
Perhaps with that shopaholic apartment-dwelling Generation X buyer in mind, storage and multi-functional pieces were important elements in many new collections. One of the cleverest introductions was Normand Couture's Cameleon at Shermag, which goes from daybed to sofa with the addition of interchangeable arm and back pieces.
Even more adventuresome modern style -- long anathema to most High Point fair buyers -- showed surprising strength. Exhibiting back-to-back at the Milan fair and High Point, the Italian company Zeritalia introduced a brightly colored bent glass shelving system and painted glass tables. "We've been surprised by the people who have come in here," said Keith Derose, the company's American sales manager. "Everyone seems to be more design conscious, more fashion conscious all of a sudden."
Alexander Chan and Shelly Wong, the young husband-and-wife team who founded Sitcom, an Oakland, Calif., company, found themselves nudged toward a crisper modern by their customers. "We have a table that started out pretty conservatively, with clear glass and brushed steel," Ms. Wong said. "The buyers from Spiegel came in and asked us to do it in frosted glass and chrome legs with industrial wheels. Suddenly, it's modern."
All that contemporary segued easily into Asian looks. Traditional chinoiserie was out, and a kind of spiritual spa-style Asian -- clear finishes, clean lines -- was in. Shermag developed an Asian-inspired bedroom group called Now and Zen in cooperation with Federated Department Stores, for instance.
But Asia seemed to be more a state of mind than a pure style. The Henredon showroom had an opium den-like corner where chairs upholstered in Chinese patterns posed against walls that were papered in bright red embossed lizard skin. Others, however, hewed closer to true Asian style -- notably Drexel Heritage, which evoked Southeast Asia in its extensive new Mandalay collection, and Century, which brought out some Chinese-inspired tables and a wedding chest-style armoire.
The market's other accent was decidedly French. Many of the Art Deco-style pieces were inspired by what has come to be called the French flea-market look, of which the leather club chair is still the ne plus ultra. Almost as strong was straight-down-the-middle French Provincial.
Some of the most exciting introductions at the market, however, will be visible only on the bottom line. Over the last few years as the American economy has improved, weaknesses in the furniture industry became glaringly obvious: consumers chose to dispose of their disposable income elsewhere. Heeding the wake-up call, furniture makers have revamped everything from production equipment to employee relations in an effort to get delivery times down to 8 weeks from 12.
"It's remarkable how fast the hurdle is being raised in operation," said George Revington, the president of Universal. "We're not even looking at furniture manufacturers -- we're benchmarking ourselves against other industries now."
As consumers demand better communication and quicker deliveries, the fashion hand-off from apparel to home design is becoming lightning fast. "I can remember when we would see something in ready-to-wear and it would be two years before it had an impact on furniture," said the manufacturer Mitchell Gold, who showed some jaunty round ottomans covered in shiny Prada bag-style fabric. "Now we see something in December, we've got it in April and it's on the retail floor by July."
A few designers have started building couture shows into their itineraries. "I don't even decide on color until I've see what's on the runways," said Mr. Laslo, who settled on bronzy leather, white linen and a shade of purple he called "chicken soup with beets" for his collection of upholstered pieces for Directional.
There were hints of a more John Galliano-esque extravagance waiting in the wings. Sheer fabrics were stitched into pillow coverings at Susan Sargent. At MU/H (pronounced MOO-ha) some buyers were wrapping themselves in the silk throws.
Certainly the crossover minimalism of the Calvin Klein and Donna Karan apparel and home collections (neither of them show in High Point) had an influence. But buyers were not quite ready for total minimalism: Jean-Paul Drovet, the Swiss architect hired to design the Preview company's new showroom, spent the last hours before market hanging art on his strikingly curved walls. "I wanted it very clean, very European," he said with a shrug. "But they tell me I am in America now."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
What's a good word for updating one's competitive position? At Burnett, it's Vigilante.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A GIANT agency company that usually plays by the book is now trying to rewrite one: the dictionary, to redefine "vigilante."
Vigilante is the name of a specialty shop opened in New York by the Leo Burnett Company of Chicago, which is revamping its operations after setbacks involving dissatisfied clients and lost accounts. 
 Vigilante, supported by Burnett's copious resources, is creating advertising campaigns, promotional events and other marketing programs aimed at a fledgling niche known as urban consumers: younger trend-setters who have turned aspects of their distinctive culture from rap music to Tommy Hilfiger apparel into mainstream mainstays.
"Urban culture is consumers of like mind-set, like attitude, whose race, gender or socio-economic background are not defining factors," said Marc Stephenson Strachan, executive vice president and chief marketing and operations officer at Vigilante.
"It's not a black or white thing," he added. "It's an opportunity."
Mr. Strachan, 38, described the audience as people "who believe you don't necessarily have to follow traditional trends and tracks, who want to get their piece of the pie without waiting for it, who want to find and make brands for themselves."
His partner, Danny Robinson, who is executive vice president and creative director at Vigilante, estimated that there is "a core group of 15 million people who live the urban culture life style and influence everyone else." Including the influenced, he numbered the market at 35 million to 40 million.
Mr. Robinson, 37, demonstrated his point by raising his hands in the air, palms up, a gesture that he said originated in the urban market, among basketball fans. The gesture, he said, meaning "Push it up, raise the roof, make some noise," is now expanding to the general population.
While urban marketing is becoming more popular among big advertisers, there has been carping about the formation of Vigilante and another specialized agency, Spike DDB, a joint venture of the director Spike Lee and the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. The critics complain that urban marketing is merely a recasting of what has long been known as ethnic marketing, particularly aimed at black consumers.
"The hurdle is the word 'urban,' " Mr. Strachan said, being perceived as a signal "that it's going to be for African-Americans, the inner city."
"This is different,' he added, because "we're not going after a specific target."
Mr. Strachan and Mr. Robinson had worked separately before joining forces a year ago on a project for Burnett, which hired them to develop urban marketing ideas for an account, Reebok International Ltd., that Burnett later resigned.
"Burnett flew some people to New York and we spent three weeks together," Mr. Robinson recalled. "Then Rick Fizdale said, 'Let's figure out a way to do this for real.' "
His reference was to Richard B. Fizdale, the chairman and chief executive of Burnett, who said of Mr. Robinson and Mr. Strachan: "They put together what to this day was the best and most interesting presentation I've been part of."
Their ideas included a Reebok retail outlet that would be "less a store than a community center," Mr. Fizdale said, and a Reebok-sponsored basketball league. After that, he added, "I decided I wanted an ongoing relationship with them." An agreement was reached last summer, and Vigilante was formally announced in December.
As for assertions that agencies like Vigilante are intended to siphon business from or compete against ethnic agencies, Mr. Fizdale said: "This is not an ethnic advertising agency. This is an advertising agency that hopes to seize a target that's multiracial, as white or Hispanic or Asian-American as it is black."
Vigilante's work so far includes a project for the "Vibe" syndicated television series and ads for the Johnnie Walker Black brand of Scotch whisky sold by the Schieffelin & Somerset unit of Diageo P.L.C.
The general market campaign for that brand, created by Burnett, presents it as a reward, using the theme "Welcome to civilization." The Vigilante ads, by contrast, present it as "a trophy," Mr. Robinson said, "to let everyone know you've made it, which this market still needs to show." That is apparent in the theme of those ads: "Step up. Your drink is waiting."
The goal of the Burnett and Vigilante executives is to spin off Vigilante as an autonomous unit by the end of the year, with Burnett as a part-owner.
"And if we're as successful as we think we should be in year five," Mr. Strachan said, "after that there'll be a Vigilante in Japan, in Europe, on the African continent."
Vigilante is one of several ambitious, unconventional efforts by top Burnett executives that are meant to alert potential clients -- as well as rival agencies -- that they will do whatever is necessary to improve and update their competitive position.
"We saw that this Midwestern, traditional, conservative, corn-flake agency was now willing to change," Mr. Strachan said.
Still, Mr. Robinson said, "Marc and I would read about a lost account" at Burnett "and we'd say, 'Did we pick the right agency?' "
"But anything like this would be a gamble," he added, "and we were looking for a calculated risk with potential upside. This just felt right -- the right chemistry between us, the right chemistry with Burnett."
There is also some carping that agencies like Vigilante and Spike DDB are ploys, half-hearted attempts by hidebound agencies to portray themselves as trendy.
"Our first reaction was, 'What do these guys in the Midwest want with us?' " Mr. Strachan acknowledged. "But we're here today because it's not a front. It's not a way for Leo to get P.R. spin. It's real because the opportunity is real. The dollars are there; the support is there; the resources are there."
Mr. Fizdale, not surprisingly, also took issue with the charges that Vigilante is old wine in chic new bottles.
"It's not a desire to be hip," he said, "but a desire to connect clients with an understanding of an aspect of the market superior to ours."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Fed is trapped between expectations and reality.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LOW unemployment, rapid economic growth, the lowest rate of inflation in decades: what more could a Federal Reserve chairman want?
Nothing, if the views of a respectful Congress, an enthusiastic financial industry and a worshipful press are to be taken at face value. In fact Alan Greenspan is in a bind, trapped between the public's expectation of perpetual economic bliss and evidence that even the Goldilocks Economy is not immune to the ailments of inflation and recession. 
 By some readings of current events, the Fed deliberately set the stage for a tighter monetary policy later this year by leaking cautionary words from the still-secret minutes of the March 31 meeting of its policy-making committee. But it's probably going to take more than a few well-placed leaks to generate a soft landing in an economy that has grown accustomed to hearing only good news. "They should have raised interest rates a year ago," said William Dudley, chief United States economist for Goldman, Sachs. "Now it may be too late."
By conventional measures, the American economy is overheating. Economic growth has exceeded 4 percent for more than a year -- roughly 1.5 percent more than Laurence H. Meyer, a Clinton appointee to the Federal Reserve, argues is sustainable in light of the modest growth of the labor force and the trend in productivity. Wages grew about a half percentage point faster than labor productivity, a figure consistent with the view that at 4.7 percent unemployment is close to a percentage point below the "noninflationary" rate.
How does that square with the latest figures showing low inflation? Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, attributes it to the serendipity of "a series of little price shocks" that have permitted businesses to hold down prices in the teeth of accelerating labor costs and still have plenty left as profits. Oil prices have been falling, health insurance premiums have risen less rapidly than the general price level and the strong dollar has reduced the cost of imports. So unless conventional explanations of "cost push" inflation are wrong, wage pressures will continue to build, adding half a percentage point to inflation for every year unemployment remains a percentage point below the noninflationary rate.
Can we be certain that the noninflationary unemployment rate is really somewhere in the mid-5 percent range? No, but William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, notes that "the wage increases of the past year are entirely consistent" with the standard model -- which probably explains why the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Congressional Budget Office have stuck by their independent estimates of 5.4 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.
Then why hasn't the Fed already made a pre-emptive strike on inflation? Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs recites a laundry list of reasons: the risk of sucking capital away from Asia, the hope that productivity growth will continue to accelerate and offset accelerating wages, and the worry that an interest rate increase would come just as the American economy was beginning to cool on its own.
But it is safe to say that two other concerns dominate Fed thinking. For starters, the fruits of the long economic boom of the 1990's have been entirely captured by college graduates, business owners and stock market investors. Now that wages are finally beginning to rise at the middle and low ends of the scale, steps to choke off growth won't be greeted with enthusiasm on Main Street. "It would look like the Fed was crushing the workers in order to save the capitalists," allowed Mr. Dudley.
Probably more important, interest rate changes have become problematic in the face of what The Economist magazine labeled "America's bubble economy." A modest rate increase might lead to an equally modest correction in the stock market. But it is also possible that it would help cause a sharp drop in stock, bond and housing prices, which in turn could result in recession. "It is hard to explain why the Dow went from 6,000 to 9,000," noted Robert Solow, an economist at M.I.T. -- and it is thus equally hard to predict how efforts to let the economy down gently would affect markets.
Barring fresh evidence that the economy is cooling on its own, the Fed will doubtless act sometime this year. Does it really matter when?
Certainly the predominant view is that delay will compound both the pain of taming inflation and the risk of overshooting. But Mr. Solow is not especially worried. "The evidence suggests that inflation is reversible," he said, adding that a modest acceleration in prices from the current, very low level could be halted without a recession and with only a modest increase in unemployment. Virtually everyone acknowledges, though, that the impact on stock and bond prices in the current speculative environment is not easy to predict.
Mr. Nordhaus of Yale suggests the sensitivity of markets is partly the Fed's fault. Before the 1980's, he notes, the norm was small, frequent changes in interest rates. But in an era when interest rate changes are few and far between, the markets not unexpectedly assume that small changes presage larger ones. "When the Fed moves, people become hysterical," he said.

Samsung in Talks to Sell Units and Consolidate

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, May 7

 BODY:
The Samsung Group, one of South Korea's biggest industrial conglomerates, said on Wednesday that it was in talks to sell some of its units to General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as part of a move to raise $13 billion to repay debt and reduce the sprawling organization to five main businesses.
Hewlett-Packard, the world's second-largest computer company, confirmed that it had discussions since February to buy all or part of Samsung's 45 percent in HP Korea, a 14-year-old joint venture that sells computers and printers and makes power-supply devices. Samsung and G.E. have a medical-equipment joint venture in South Korea. G.E. officials here and in the United States declined to comment. 
 The huge Korean conglomerates, known as chaebol, have come under increased pressure from the Government and investors to raise fresh capital and reduce their towering debt burdens by focusing on fewer businesses. Economists have warned that without such steps, South Korea's recovery from economic and financial crisis could be seriously impaired.
Samsung's negotiations, if they result in the sale of units, could become a model for other Korean companies.
It plans to reduce the number of businesses it specializes in to five -- electronics, finance, services, and two other unspecified industries -- and will sell new shares in many of its companies, said Cho Chang Won, a spokesman. "We expect tangible results in the first half of this year," Mr. Cho said of the G.E. and Hewlett-Packard talks.
The company plans to repay $21 billion of debt in the next five years and will seek to raise money through foreign investment, he added.
Talks with Samsung are in an advanced stage, a Hewlett-Packard spokesman, Brad Whitworth, said, declining to comment on when a final decision might be made. Mr. Whitworth said HP Korea was profitable, though sales in Korean won and American dollars had fallen as the won's value tumbled and the South Korean economy slumped over the last six months.
Analysts have said that G.E. plans to invest as much as $40 billion in Asia over the next four years. Its medical-equipment venture with Samsung was formed in 1984 and has about 250 employees. It makes ultrasound and CAT scan equipment sold worldwide.
Samsung also said that its units would make their finances more transparent, partly by halting the common practice of guaranteeing each other's debts. In arranging a $57 billion bailout for South Korea in December, the International Monetary Fund insisted that South Korean companies adopt internationally accepted accounting rules and make their finances more comprehensible to investors.
While these steps, if carried out, would go a long way toward meeting the demands of the Government, the I.M.F. and international investors, in one key area Samsung's plans fell far short of what analysts say is required.
The company said it had no plan to spin off its fledgling auto division, which is proving a heavy drain on its finances. Instead, Samsung said it would form a strategic alliance with foreign investors and join in the Government's push to overhaul the overcrowded auto industry. Car sales in South Korea have plunged as much as 60 percent this year as the economy contracts.
Samsung's announcement is the latest response to criticism from President Kim Dae Jung that corporate debt and inefficiency helped cause the Korean debt crisis.
Samsung Group sales totaled $64 billion last year. Its businesses range from computer chips, ships and automobiles to insurance, entertainment and kitchenware.

Rising Budget Surplus Spurs Changes in Treasury Note Sales

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The growing Federal budget surplus -- which has been increasing faster than expected -- pushed the United States Treasury today to eliminate one benchmark note and to alter the issuing of another. They were the first major changes in Treasury auctions since the sale of 30-year bonds was cut back in 1993.
The two moves, analysts said, will give the Treasury more flexibility in adjusting its borrowing needs as the outlook for the Government surplus changes. Just yesterday, the Clinton Administration said the surplus for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 could reach $40 billion. 
 The Treasury also said that the change was the kind of move that should help keep the American bond market attractive as Europe created the world's only other large bond market when the single currency -- the euro -- goes into effect next year.
"What we did today will help benefit our bond market," Gary Gensler, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for financial markets, said in an interview. "Markets want concentrated, large bond issues."
The Treasury also said that it would sell a smaller than expected $22 billion of three-year and 10-year notes at next week's quarterly auction, another reflection of the Government's declining borrowing needs as it prepared for its first budget surplus since 1969.
Investors responded positively to the news, ending a two-day slide in bond prices. The decline in Government borrowing is being met by continuing strong demand, forcing prices lower and pushing interest rates lower. The price of the 30-year bond rose 22/32, to 102 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent Tuesday. Two- , three- and five-year Treasury notes also rallied.
In its two main auction changes, the Treasury decided to eliminate the three-year note, which has been auctioned quarterly. Its last auction will be next week. Mr. Gensler said that "the market was telling us this was the least needed security," given that there are also a two-year and a five-year note.
The second move was to shift the current monthly auction of five-year notes to a quarterly sale and increase the size of each issue. The last monthly sale will be in June and the first quarterly auction of five-year notes will be in August.
These changes will also allow the Treasury to stop cutting back on its issuing of three-month and six-month Treasury bills. This is the main way it has adjusted to the Government's declining borrowing needs over the last two years. The market for privately held Treasury bills has fallen $130 billion, or 22 percent, over the last two years.
Bond traders had been expressing concern about the declining size of the Treasury bill market and whether it would affect the ease of trading and prices. "The Treasury has made a trade-off between auction frequency and liquidity," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "There will be fewer auctions but larger auctions."
Mr. Gensler also said that the move to increase the sale of Treasury bills would help keep the Government from changing the average maturity of its portfolio, something it wants to remain relatively constant so that it is not appearing to change its bet on the longer-term direction of interest rates. As one of its changes in 1993, the Treasury shifted to more short-term borrowing.

HEADLINE: Compaq Said To Plan Cuts In Digital Jobs

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation will cut 15,000 jobs, or 28 percent, of the Digital Equipment Corporation's work force after the expected merger of the companies is completed later this year, an executive at one of the computer makers said yesterday.
The cuts, which have been expected since Compaq agreed in January to buy Digital for $9.6 billion in cash and stock, will cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to a document filed yesterday by Digital with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If completed, the merger would be the largest in the history of the computer industry. 
 Despite estimating the cost of the layoffs, neither company would confirm the elimination of 15,000 jobs. Even so, the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "It's a real solid number."
The expected cuts, which would have been a devastating blow as recently as five years ago, aroused little concern in Massachusetts, where Digital has its headquarters. A high-tech boom in the state has lowered unemployment to 3.7 percent from levels of 10 percent seven years ago.
"If ever there was a time to be looking for a job in Massachusetts, this is it," David Tibbetts, the state's director of economic development, said in an interview yesterday. "Many high-tech companies are salivating for those workers."
Compaq, based in Houston, is the world's largest maker of personal computers and is aiming to transform itself into a supplier of a full range of computers, from PC's to the most powerful systems that corporations use to run their businesses. It is buying Digital, a onetime leading-edge computer maker that stumbled badly in the PC era, primarily to acquire its services arm and direct sales force.
Dan Kaferle, a Digital spokesman, said that the services division, which employs about 25,000 of Digital's 53,500 employees, as well as some other divisions would continue to be based in Massachusetts after the merger. But he and Rebecca Nahas, a Compaq spokeswoman, declined to say where the anticipated cuts would be made until after the deal was closed.
Certainly, Compaq will have little need for most of Digital's headquarters staff after the merger is completed. But Wall Street analysts disagreed over where other cuts would be made.
Stephen C. Dube, an analyst at Wasserstein Perella in New York, said that Compaq would probably eliminate almost all of Digital's computer manufacturing, many of its administrative offices in Europe and some of its research and development while retaining its services employees and it sales force of 5,000.
But Gary Helmig, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn., said that Compaq might eliminate some sales and services jobs and shutter some of Digital's weaker business, like its line of computer work stations, as well.
He said that Compaq had talked about cutting Digital's expenses by 50 percent, adding, "You don't do that without doing major surgery."
One employee who is likely to lose his job is Robert B. Palmer, Digital's chairman and chief executive. Yesterday's filing said that Mr. Palmer would receive $6.45 million in severance pay. He also holds more than a million Digital stock options that would vest immediately after the takeover was completed, netting him an estimated $12 or $13 million.
The analysts greeted the news of the cuts as a sign that the merger was moving forward on schedule despite recent setbacks at Compaq, which saw its earnings plunge 96 percent in the first quarter because of an inventory glut. Compaq has said that the acquisition of Digital will add to its earnings in the second half of this year, which means that it must cut Digital's expenses quickly.
Compaq is offering $30 in cash and 0.945 share of Compaq stock for each Digital share. Yesterday, Compaq stock closed at $31.25, up 69 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. Digital shares also rose 69 cents, closing at $58.69.
The deal must still be approved by two-thirds of Digital's shareholders and the Federal Trade Commission, which has asked both companies to provide additional information about the transaction.
"We have no reason to believe that the F.T.C. will not let this go forward," Mr. Kaferle said.
Digital shareholders are scheduled to vote at an extraordinary meeting on June 11. Compaq and Digital executives expressed confidence yesterday that the deal would be completed by the end of June.
Mr. Tibbetts, the Massachusetts development director, said that the job losses at Digital would be countered by one of its rivals, Sun Microsystems, which is building a campus for 4,000 workers outside Boston in the town of Burlington. Other companies in telecommunications and computer storage as well as Internet start-ups are also actively recruiting, he added, part of the high-tech revival that has turned the state's economy around in recent years.

HEADLINE: SHAPING A GLOBAL GIANT: THE CORPORATE CULTURES -- Two Auto Makers With Long Histories Attempt a Trans-Atlantic Marriage;
A Slimmer Daimler-Benz's Big Gamble

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 6

 BODY:
Long before he orchestrated the stunning takeover of the Chrysler Corporation, Jurgen Schrempp had been setting the stage by overhauling his own company from top to bottom.
In the three years since Mr. Schrempp became chairman of Daimler-Benz, he has lopped off more than a dozen companies and reversed the disastrous diversification effort of his predecessor, Edzard Reuter. Mr. Schrempp has reorganized the company, eliminating more than a thousand midlevel managers and forcing those who remained to focus relentlessly on profit performance. 
 The results have been impressive. After logging a $3.2 billion loss in 1995, mostly as a result of writing off its investment in the Fokker aircraft company, Daimler-Benz's sales climbed 19 percent last year, to $68 billion, and operating profits soared 79 percent, to about $2.5 billion.
Mr. Schrempp is now about to take his biggest gamble ever. Having slimmed down Daimler-Benz by bailing out of businesses from airplanes to insurance, the combative 53-year-old chairman if bulking up again with one of the biggest takeovers in history.
He is also embarking on a huge exercise in cross-cultural management. As Germany's biggest industrial conglomerate, Daimler-Benz's history date's back to the late 19th century and includes a sordid period as a major component of the Nazi war machine during World War II.
In the decades of Germany's "economic miracle" immediately after the war, Daimler-Benz grew rapidly into a major manufacturer of expensive, high-quality cars. As Germany's prosperity soared, so did that of Daimler-Benz.
Things became unglued in the early 1990's, when Mr. Reuter embarked on a sweeping program to expand into new industries. Convinced that the company should become a wide-ranging "technology" enterprise, Mr. Reuter expanded into aerospace and aircraft, data processing and even insurance. Most experts now say the strategy was grievously flawed, but the problems were compounded by recession in the United States and a soaring value of the German mark, which made exports difficult.
Though Mr. Schrempp had been part of Mr. Reuter's regime, he quickly began to carry out a counterrevolution after he took over in early 1995. Daimler-Benz shed more than 40,000 workers in less than two years as it sold or simply shut down marginal business. By late 1996, Mr. Schrempp had refocused the company on automobiles and trucks, which account for about 70 percent of Daimler-Benz's sales.
The transformation has not always been pretty. Last year, Mr. Schrempp reorganized the company structure and did away with the separate Mercedes board. In effect, the move gutted the power of the highly respected Mercedes chief executive, Helmut Werner, who adamantly fought the changes but lost and ultimately quit.
Under the proposed new merger, Mr. Schrempp will at least nominally be sharing power with Chrysler's chairman, Robert J. Eaton. But Mr. Eaton's position as co-chairman of the new Daimler-Chrysler conglomerate is expected to be a transitional post -- certainly if Mr. Schrempp has his way.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Slides by 92.92 as Uncertainty Surrounds Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply again yesterday, continuing a recent volatile trading pattern that reflects the uncertainty of the outlook after a rally that has pushed the market to repeated new highs this year.
In the last 11 trading days, the Dow Jones industrial average has plunged 267 points in four trading days, shot up 275 points to a new high in five, and fallen 138 points in two, including yesterday's 92.92-point, or 1 percent, decline to 9,054.65. 
 Nearly 60 points of the decline yesterday came at the end of the day, after Alice Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said on CNBC that she "sees cause for concern about the values in the stock market."
Although she added, "That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bubble," such a comment from an official at her level at a time of uncertainty can make investors jittery.
"When the market is overbought and a cautionary comment comes out, the market can tumble," said Richard McCabe, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.
The uncertainty for investors is being created by the outlook for both earnings and economic growth. First-quarter earnings have been relatively weak. Although forecasters expect them to rebound, investors will have to wait to see if that will happen.
In addition, although many forecasters are expecting economic growth to slow down, there are no firm signs of that yet, and the expected drag from Asia has not shown up as quickly as expected.
The current stronger-than-expected growth has lead to a reported shift at the Federal Reserve to a bias toward raising interest rates. Forecasters are not betting that the Fed will act soon -- its next policy meeting is May 19 -- but the threat led to the big selloff on April 27 and it is still overhanging the market.
Also, the riots in Indonesia are shifting some attention back to Asia, with investors realizing that the recovery from last year's currency devaluations is still a long way off.
"The market has run very hard without much support from lower interest rates or stronger earnings," said Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities.
If interest rates fall further, he said, that could help. But he does not expect that to happen because the economy is not yet slowing down as forecast. And if earnings improve, that could help.
But he does not expect a real bounce-back until next year, in part because of the drag from Asia. "I don't think it's a long-term earnings problem, but we have a few weak quarters ahead of us," he said.
This view has lead him to cut his asset allocation for equities by 10 percentage points, to 60 percent. He put half of this into bonds, raising that portion to 35 percent, and the rest into cash, raising its share to 15 percent. "We are in for a pause, but not an end to the bull market," he said.
The market was led down yesterday by American Express, off 2 15/16, to 99 1/2 Walt Disney Company, off 2 1/2 to 124 3/16; Pfizer, down 2 15/16, to 108 13/16, and Microsoft, off 1 3/8, to 86 3/8. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 10.58 points, to 1,104.92, while the Nasdaq index dropped 8.23 points, to 1,856.68.

HEADLINE: Growth of Budget Surplus Outstrips Plans for How to Spend It

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The nation's fiscal condition continues to improve at a startling pace, so much so that Washington is having trouble keeping up.
After saying less than two weeks ago that it saw no reason to increase its estimate that the Federal budget surplus would be around $18 billion this year, the Congressional Budget Office reversed itself late Tuesday and told lawmakers that a surge in tax receipts in late April meant the Government would run in the black by $43 billion to $63 billion this year. 
 The White House also quietly increased its informal estimate of the surplus to around $40 billion, about twice what it had been projecting. The new forecasts moved Congress and the White House into a range that private analysts had been predicting for months and suggested that the nation would enjoy substantial surpluses as long as the economy remained healthy and the stock market high.
Much of the late surge in tax receipts appeared to come from capital gains reaped by investors in the booming financial markets. The new calculations were the latest in a long string in which budget analysts have been surprised by the strength in revenues. The Congressional Budget Office in particular came under attack today from Republicans for once again having to revise an overly pessimistic projection.
The good news only served to highlight the deep divisions among Republicans about how to approach the new era of fiscal plenty. Many want bigger tax cuts. Others are loath to risk a confrontation with Democrats over President Clinton's demand that any surpluses be left untouched until the nation settles on how to fix the Social Security system. Some want to use the money to pay for legislation like the recently passed highway and mass transit bill.
So deep are the divisions that the House has still not taken up a budget plan, and any measure that does make it through the House is likely to be very different from the budget resolution passed last month by the Senate. Republicans concede that they might not even try to reconcile the House and Senate budget blueprints and instead may have to leave the tough decisions to the spending bills that both chambers must pass to keep the Government running.
"As long as we were in deficit, we were unified in pursuing the goal of a balanced budget," one Republican staff member said. "Now that that's been achieved, folks have different thoughts about what we should do next. Trying to build a consensus among those differing views is a difficult process, and that's what you're witnessing."
The size of this year's surplus has no direct effect on the debate over next year's budget. It simply means that the Treasury Department can pay off a small slice of the nation's $5.5 trillion debt. Moreover, the budget is only balanced when taking into account the proceeds of the tax levied to finance Social Security. If that money was not included, the Government would run a deficit this year of around $50 billion.
A bigger surplus this year, though, suggests a bigger surplus in coming years. The budget office says it now expects a surplus next year of $30 billion or more, at least $20 billion higher than it had been projecting.
As the estimates have grown, so have demands to allocate any leftover money to a host of uses. While Democrats have acceded with little objection to Mr. Clinton's demand to deal with Social Security before dipping into the surplus, Republicans are chafing under that restriction.
Representative Bill Archer, the tax-cutting Texas Republican who is heads the Ways and Means Committee, said that since Mr. Clinton had signed a $2.9 billion emergency bill to fund the American military operation in Bosnia without finding offsetting spending cuts, he had broken his own pledge not to touch the surplus.
"By funding the Bosnia mission out of the surplus, you have demonstrated that your Social Security pledge can be altered when it conflicts with other important priorities," Mr. Archer said on Tuesday in a letter to Mr. Clinton. "Mr. President, if it's good policy to use the surplus for a mission that helps the people of Bosnia, why would you oppose using a portion of the surplus to help the taxpayers of America?"
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been pressing for deep spending cuts, including measures that harken back to the Republican revolutionary spirit of 1995, like eliminating the Commerce and Energy Departments.
Mr. Kasich had already run into considerable opposition from his fellow Republicans, who think such deep cuts are politically unpalatable. Republicans said the growing surplus would only make it harder for Mr. Kasich to win support for his approach.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Indicates Growth Free of Inflation

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's latest reading on the economy points to inflation-free growth as some manufacturers contend with weaker demand from Asia for electronics and other products.
"Economic growth generally continued to be strong in March and April," according to the Fed's latest regional economic outlook, which was released today. "Expansion was occurring in nearly all districts," except those served by the Federal Reserve banks of Dallas and Minneapolis. 
 In other economic news, the Commerce Department said today that factory orders rose moderately in March as demand for industrial equipment and electronic devices like laptop computers helped offset plummeting aircraft orders. New orders for manufactured goods rose three-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $336.23 billion. Orders fell a revised seven-tenths of a percent in February, slightly less than the previously reported drop of nine-tenths of a percent.
The Fed report said there was no inflation. "Competitive pressures were holding prices in check for most goods," the Fed said, though the Fed banks in Dallas and San Francisco reported increases in the costs of some services.
"It looks like we're going to keep on keeping on with more positive signals on growth and inflation," said Raymond Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
The report, which is based on information from the Fed's 12 district banks, is published eight times each year. The latest edition was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and will help guide the discussion on interest rates at the May 19 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The latest Fed report, commonly called the beige book, was based on information collected before April 27. It said shortages of workers persisted as the economy grew. "Labor markets continued to be tight," the Fed said, adding that "there was some evidence of increased wage pressures in service industries and for computer and technical professionals."
On other topics, the Fed said "consumer spending was generally robust," as prices for goods "are nearly steady." Manufacturing grew and real estate markets were generally strong, the report said. However, manufacturers of electronics, chemicals and industrial machinery reported weaker export demand stemming from the economic turmoil in Asia while makers of metal products reported competition from cheaper imports.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Economy Remains Vigorous but Moderate in Places"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Moderate growth was evident in most urban areas and strong growth was seen in some. Manufacturers were generally busy.
 
Chicago -- The economy expanded moderately in March and April with little evidence of a slowdown. Consumer spending stayed robust with a bulk of the strength in housing.
 
Cleveland -- Economic conditions remained strong, particularly in residential and commercial construction.
 
Boston -- Retail and manufacturing revenues rose. Commercial real estate markets improved.
 
New York -- The economy maintained sturdy growth. Manufacturing grew while product costs were flat. Fees for contract services accelerated.
 
Philadelphia -- Manufacturers reported an increase in activity. Retail sales rose, though auto sales were flat. Industrial prices were steady.
 
Richmond -- The service industry revenues grew rapidly, fueled by real estate and air transportation.
 
Atlanta -- The economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Retail sales met expectations; manufacturing slowed last month.
 
St. Louis -- The economy continued to operate at high levels. The solid economy and low mortgage rates led to a housing boom in most parts of the district.
 
Kansas City -- The economy expanded at a moderate pace. Retailers reported strong sales; construction activity improved; manufacturing stayed fairly strong.
 
Dallas -- Economic activity slowed slightly. Most were optimistic about the economic outlook, though some expressed caution about the forecast over the next few months.
 
San Francisco -- The economy grew at a strong pace during March and April. The effects of Asian economic turmoil were moderately evident in several sectors.

HEADLINE: Astronomers Detect Immense Explosion 2d Only to Big Bang

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
Astronomers have detected a titanic explosion in the outer reaches of the cosmos -- one so violent and bright that for about 40 seconds it apparently outshone all the rest of the universe. Except for the Big Bang that is generally believed to have created the universe, no other cosmic explosion of such magnitude has ever been discovered.
The observations that led to this finding caught theorists completely off guard, Dr. John N. Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., said yesterday. 
 Science has no models that would produce an explanation for so stupendous an outpouring of energy. And so either new observations of similar explosions will lower the estimated energy output, or theorists will be forced to seek some explanation.
"I'm a very troubled theorist," Dr. Stanford E. Woosley of the University of California at Santa Cruz said of the explosion, which occurred 12 billion years ago. "We're really struggling to find a theoretical basis for this."
The results of an investigation by many scientific institutions in the United States, Europe and Asia were announced at a news conference held yesterday in Washington by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and are being published in papers today by the journal Nature.
The event that brought on these frantic international studies was detected five months ago. On Dec. 14, at 6:34 P.M., Eastern standard time, an exquisitely sensitive orbiting gamma-ray observatory called BeppoSAX, which was built by an Italian-Dutch collaboration of astronomers and launched two years ago, signaled to its operators that it had recorded something interesting. For about 40 seconds, the satellite measured a sharp pulse of gamma rays. More important, it pinpointed the position of the rays' source in the sky.
The pulse was also detected by the United States' Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite. As measured by the American satellite, the burst's gamma-ray brightness appeared fairly typical of gamma-ray bursts in general. But what astronomers did not realize at that point was that the event had occurred almost incredibly far away, and must therefore have been immensely powerful to look so bright from Earth.
Thousands of gamma-ray "bursters," as such events are called, have been detected since the 1960's, but they remain mysterious, because each one disappears in seconds or minutes and has not been known to recur for further study. Except for the Dec. 14 burster, none of their distances from Earth have ever been determined.
But this burster, designated GRB971214, gave astronomers some of the clues they had long sought.
Right after the gamma-ray burst was detected, dozens of scientific institutions in many parts of the world raced to look for any traces it might have left. Gamma rays are the most energetic of all forms of electromagnetic radiation, but as an object emitting them cools, it radiates waves of lower energy: X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared rays and, at the lowest range of the energy spectrum, radio.
Since BeppoSAX was launched in 1996, its unmatched ability to detect the exact location of a fleeting gamma-ray burst has allowed scientists to look for a burst's lingering afterglow, which can take the form of X-rays, visible light and other types of radiation.
Twelve hours after the December burst, Dr. John R. Thorstensen of Dartmouth College, using a 94-inch-diameter telescope at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, found a visible afterglow.
This visible light persisted for about two weeks, and then something even more interesting turned up at the same spot in the sky: scientists found a faint galaxy.
Astronomers realized that this galaxy was probably the host of the gamma-ray explosion and that its distance from Earth must therefore be the same as that of the burster. Many large telescopes were brought to bear on the galaxy, and the Keck II in Hawaii, one of the two largest ever built, hit pay dirt. A team of American, Italian and Indian astronomers led by Dr. Shrinivas R. Kulkarni and S. George Djorgovski, both of the California Institute of Technology, managed to measure the distance to the burster.
Dr. Kulkarni said yesterday that the distant galaxy that spawned the burster appeared to be creating a myriad of new stars, and that the burst might in some way be associated with this process.
Three reports by separate collaborations studying GRB971214 are being published today in Nature. In one, Dr. Kulkarni's team describes how it used the giant Keck instrument to gather enough light from the burster's host galaxy (dubbed "K") to analyze its spectrum. This was no easy task; the apparent brightness of the galaxy is only about the same as that of a 100-watt light bulb viewed from one million miles away.
The astronomers found that lines marking the presence of hydrogen in the spectrum of light coming from the galaxy had been vastly shifted from their usual spectral positions toward the red end of the spectrum.
The Keck measurement revealed that Galaxy K is receding from Earth at enormous speed. This speed, as Edwin Hubble showed, can be used to calculate the distance of any receding celestial object; the greater its speed of recession from Earth, the greater its distance.
The "red shift" of light from the galaxy that apparently spawned the gamma-ray burster was measured as 3.418. From that, the Caltech group calculated that the explosion occurred about 12 billion years ago, when the universe was about 15 percent of its present age. This showed that the distance to the galaxy from Earth was a staggering 12 billion light-years.
From this distance measurement, combined with the measurement of the gamma-ray intensity observed by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, it became possible to calculate that the energy released by the blast was about 3 times 1053 ergs, an amount several hundred times greater than the energy released by the explosion of a supernova. Supernova explosions, produced by certain types of dying stars, are the most violent blasts astronomers knew until now. Put another way, the energy released during the 40-second gamma-ray burst detected on Dec. 14 was about equal to the amount of energy that Earth's entire galaxy radiates over a period of several centuries.
Astrophysicists cautioned that in one unlikely situation, their estimate of the punch packed by GRB971214 might be too high: if the object released all or most of its energy along a narrow beam aimed right at Earth, then estimates of the total energy, released in all directions, would be excessive.
Even so, said Dr. Jules P. Halpern of Columbia University, leader of one of the teams studying the burster, its energy must be enormous.
What could account for the monster explosion?
"Most of the theoretical models proposed to explain these bursts cannot explain this much energy," Dr. Kulkarni said. And, he said, while some recent hypotheses involving rotating black holes might explain it, "this is such an extreme phenomenon that it is possible that we are dealing with something completely unanticipated and even more exotic."
One possibility favored by some theorists is that a superdense neutron star might have been ripped apart as it spiraled in toward a neighboring black hole, and that the disk of debris it formed around the black hole created a gamma-ray burst just before disappearing into the black hole.
Another member of Dr. Kulkarni's team, Dr. Alexei V. Filippenko, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley, suggested that the burst could have been caused by the violent merger of two black holes.
A question that might one day affect the survival of life on Earth is the distribution of potential gamma-ray bursters throughout the universe. If most of them are at enormous distances from Earth, they will pose no significant threat. But indications are that they are randomly distributed, and that some must therefore be relatively close to Earth.
In the February issue of Sky & Telescope magazine, two gamma-ray specialists, Dr. Peter J. T. Leonard and Dr. Jerry T. Bonnell, described gamma-ray bursters as potential killers. They quoted two astrophysicists at the Israel Institute of Technology, Dr. Nir Shaviv and Dr. Arnon Dar, as having calculated that if a burster occurred within 3,000 light-years of Earth, the flood of high-energy gamma rays bombarding Earth's atmosphere would spawn a cascade of cosmic-ray particles.
"Gamma-ray bursters are definitely a potential threat to life on Earth," Dr. Filippenko said. "But happily, we don't see a statistical likelihood of one going off near us for many millions of years."

HEADLINE: A Pentagon Report Now Belittles the Menace Posed by Cuba

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
This just in from the Pentagon: Cuba is not, after all, much of a threat to national security.
The Pentagon's intelligence report, like all matters Cuban, ignited controversy on Capitol Hill. Even before its release, Speaker Newt Gingrich protested to the Pentagon that Fidel Castro remained "a dangerous and unstable tyrant." 
 In the report, the Pentagon concludes that the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1991 gravely eroded the size and power of Cuba's military, leaving it barely able to support itself, let alone attack its neighbors.
The nation, once a flash point for nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, now poses "a negligible threat to the U.S. or surrounding countries," said an unclassified version of the report released today.
The Pentagon's analysis, ordered by Congress last year, was no surprise, given Cuba's economic implosion after the end of Soviet-era subsidies. But it still provoked anger among Cuba's critics in Congress, who accused the Clinton Administration of softening its stand toward President Fidel Castro.
Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Cuban-born Republican from Florida, said the Pentagon had "blatantly minimized" what he called "asymmetric threats" posed by Mr. Castro's Government, including its support for drug traffickers.
In March, after Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba, President Clinton announced an easing of some American restrictions on aid, allowing Cuban-Americans to send money directly to relatives in Cuba and loosening regulations on providing humanitarian supplies. Asked at a news conference today whether he would consider additional gestures, Mr. Clinton said Cuba's rulers had not yet shown "whether they really wish to have a rapprochement."
He added that the Helms-Burton Act, which tightened sanctions on Cuba in 1996, restrained him from more humanitarian gestures, but that he could never "accept some of the anti-democratic and, frankly, clearly anti-human-rights policies of the Government."
When drafts of the Pentagon's views first circulated this spring, they raised such an outcry that the report's release was delayed while Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen oversaw its completion. A senior defense official said Mr. Cohen did not alter the report's conclusions. But in a letter to Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, he addressed concerns raised by critics, citing Cuba's "continued dictatorship" and noting its failure to apologize for shooting down two unarmed planes piloted by Cuban-Americans in 1996.
The report said Cuba's army could no longer mount "effective operations" since most of its equipment is in storage. It said the navy could not operate in force outside of territorial waters, while the air force, with fewer than two dozen Soviet-era MIG jets still able to fly, could not even defend Cuban airspace against a large attack. In fact, the report said, the military "must now grow its own food and raise money to pay for some of its own expenses."
The report also offered what may be the most understated reason that Cuba's military has never posed much of a threat to its big neighbor to the north: "The Cubans almost certainly calculate that any attack on U.S. territory or forces would draw a swift, forceful U.S. reaction."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers End Their Session By Increasing State Spending

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 6

 BODY:
After three years of moderate fiscal austerity, the State Legislature today wrapped up its fourth session under Gov. John G. Rowland after enacting a series of budget revisions that will lead Connecticut to surpass its spending cap for the first time since it became law in 1991.
But Mr. Rowland, a Republican, and top legislators from both parties declared the Legislature's work a success today, noting that it included another year of tax cuts, as well as more spending on education and job training for the poor. 
 "Never in my memory have Democrats and Republicans from all over Connecticut worked so well together for the people of this state," Mr. Rowland wrote in his end-of-session speech, citing the "spending restraint of the last four years" and tax cuts of almost $1.5 billion.
And Mr. Rowland singled out the retiring three-term Democratic Speaker of the House, Thomas D. Ritter. "The remarkable bipartisanship of the last six years is due almost entirely to your leadership as speaker," Mr. Rowland wrote.
The increased spending is not necessarily cause for alarm: the growth rate is smaller than in almost every year in the two decades before Mr. Rowland took office in 1995. Still, the sudden spurt in payments is a step away from the more frugal line that Mr. Rowland had once vowed to toe, and it has raised questions among a handful of lawmakers and fiscal watchdog groups about whether he and the Legislature have lost their fiscal way.
The concerns of these budgetary monitors have been compounded over the last few days as the Legislature, with the Governor's blessing, has approved plans to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars for major urban development projects, school construction measures and the purchasing of open space.
With the state government already having one of the nation's highest per-capita debts, critics worry that the state is burdening future generations with loan payments and additional expenditures. To make matters worse, they charge, tax cuts that are to be phased in over the next four years could leave the state with even less revenue to cover these costs, creating a projected deficit of $500 million in 2000.
"Remember what happens if the economy goes south," said State Representative Carl J. Schiessl, the Democratic co-chairman of the Legislature's tax policy committee, as he took the unusual step of voting against the tax plan that was enacted Saturday. "The choice is between short-term political benefits and long-term stability."
But the state is projected to have a surplus of at least $460 million this year, the largest surplus ever, and one-third of that amount is being set aside in a rainy-day fund for any future deficits. The Office of Fiscal Analysis, a nonpartisan legislative agency, estimates spending increases of 4.5 percent this year and 6.1 percent next year, which are higher than in Mr. Rowland's first two years but are lower than the double-digit growth rates the state racked up in the 1980's.
And although the latest spending package caused the state to exceed the mandated cap -- Mr. Rowland and the Legislature had to approve the overrun -- that may have more to do with the law's quirkiness than with indiscriminate spending.
The Legislature, for instance, approved returning $115 million of the surplus to taxpayers in July in a rebate, and that money is counted as part of the spending that puts the state over the cap.
"This is not a time for wailing and gnashing of teeth," said Michael Meotti, president of the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a nonpartisan research group. The state had legitimate reasons for forgoing the spending cap, he added, though he noted that he was concerned about the growth of spending.
Connecticut has a two-year budget cycle, and the biennial budget that was passed last year set aside $10.5 billion for the second fiscal year, starting July 1. The budget that the Legislature finished today has spending going up by as much as $800 million that next fiscal year, to about $11.3 billion, according to the Office of Fiscal Analysis.
Mr. Schiessl noted that the state had depended on tremendous growth in income-tax revenues -- which account for almost one-third of state revenues -- because of the boom on Wall Street. That trend may not continue, he said.
Mr. Ritter said today that he was concerned about projections of a deficit, but said that the state had added millions to its budget reserve fund. Pointing to the surplus, he added, "I believe the year we're in had a similar estimate for a deficit."

HEADLINE: Stadiums Are Proposed, but Public Isn't Always Disposed to Pay Price

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Seventy-five years ago, Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L. Huston built Yankee Stadium for $2.5 million, without debates over where to locate the stadium, how much money the city would chip in or how many luxury suites were needed to maximize their cash flow. It was their money, no arguments.
Today, it is almost impossible to find a city where there isn't fierce, even ugly, debate. From New York to Pittsburgh to Milwaukee to Seattle, governments and taxpayers have been faced with the question of how much to pay for building new stadiums or arenas -- or risk teams fleeing to other cities. At the same time, economists continue to cast doubt on the monetary benefits cities reap from new playing fields. 
 Such a debate has erupted in New York between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants to use at least $600 million in city business taxes to help finance stadiums for the Yankees and Mets, and City Council President Peter F. Vallone, who wants a November referendum to let the voters decide.
Mr. Giuliani, who sarcastically dismissed Mr. Vallone's call for a referendum, said he was prepared to invoke little-used powers under the City Charter to block a vote in November. If the experience of other cities is any guide, the Mayor may have good reason to want to avoid such a vote.
Although referendums have passed in some cities over the last few years, voters in others have rejected measures to use tax money to build new arenas and made their political displeasure known.
On Tuesday, for example, voters in two North Carolina counties roundly defeated a plan to raise money from taxes on food and baseball tickets to finance a stadium to lure the Minnesota Twins to the region. The rejection of numerous plans by the Minnesota Legislature to publicly finance a new stadium led to the team's owner, the banker Carl Pohlad, to tentatively agree to sell the club to a businessman in Hickory, N.C.
Last November in Pittsburgh, voters in an 11-county area overwhelmingly rejected a half-cent sales tax increase intended to bankroll new stadiums for the Pirates and Steelers, the expansion of a downtown convention center and other projects.
The previous May, in Columbus, Ohio, voters defeated a half-cent sales tax increase that would have financed the construction of a hockey arena and a soccer stadium. And in San Francisco, voters have repeatedly rejected using tax dollars to finance a new stadium for the Giants.
But if those cities are examples of voter dissatisfaction -- and sometimes disdain for using public funds to help out wealthy team owners -- they also provide lessons for government officials on coming up with other, more creative tactics.
When Pittsburgh voters turned down the sales-tax increase, politicians went to work on alternative financing. Now a hodgepodge of proposals called "Plan B" has developed, including using a portion of an existing county sales tax, a ticket surcharge, a tax on visiting athletes, and hefty contributions from the teams.
"The referendum vote was against a new tax," said Bob Cranmer, an Allegheny County commissioner who is pushing Plan B, as long as he can force the Steelers and Pirates to chip in more than they have promised. "But a lot of people want the new stadiums. They just didn't want a tax."
Pittsburgh is not alone. While the 1990's have seen a surge in the construction of sports stadiums and arenas, they are being financed with a smaller percentage of public dollars.
David Swindell, an assistant professor of urban studies at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, estimates that local governments have paid an average of about 55 percent of the cost of sports facilities in the 1990's, compared with nearly 100 percent during the 1970's.
But even as governments are paying a smaller percentage to build them, stadiums and arenas are costing substantially more than ever before.
"In the '70's, the payments by teams to the cities were big enough for the cities to break even on their investments," Mr. Swindell said. But with governments offering teams financial incentives to relocate, and signing leases that let the teams keep almost all revenues from the stadiums and arenas, "virtually no payments go back to the governments," he said.
In Columbus, officials eventually found private financing for their arena, with Nationwide Insurance and Dispatch Printing agreeing to pay the entire $125 million.
With a $306 million price tag for a Giants stadium, San Francisco had to be more inventive. Officials there raised funds by selling the naming rights to Pacific Bell, and also raised money from advertising, deposits for high-priced seats, concession rights and bank loans.
As with most projects dubbed "private," governments have made financial contributions through improvements in roads, sewers and other infrastructure. San Francisco is investing about $15 million in such improvements.
But when cities, states and counties have gone beyond financing infrastructure improvements to paying part or all of the cost of a stadium or arena, they have used a variety of sources: admission taxes, hotel and motel taxes, car rental taxes, cigarette and alcohol taxes, direct contributions from their treasuries, and revenues from sports lotteries. Other financing tools include special districts that collect taxes from businesses in a stadium's vicinity, and sale-tax funds dedicated soley to stadium construction.
And there have been successful referendums, including ones in Seattle, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Cleveland.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Giuliani will prove successful in his own approach -- using the commercial rent tax, which he had pledged to abolish -- to help provide money for stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets. But the political and public debate is sure to grow more intense in the coming months, with the Mets having recently unveiled a $500 million plan for a new ball park and the Mayor pushing a West Side stadium for the Yankees at a cost of $1 billion.
But the political cost of advocating government financing for a new stadium can be steep. In Wisconsin, the thorny debate cost one lawmaker, State Senator George Petak, his job.
In an April 1995 referendum, voters sent to a thumping defeat a plan to use a lottery to finance a stadium for the Milwaukee Brewers -- and entreaties to move the team were coming from Charlotte, N.C.
In October 1995, state legislators faced a vote on a plan for a 0.1 percent sales tax increase for the five counties in the proposed stadium's vicinity. Mr. Petak, who supported the plan, nevertheless sought to exclude his district's county, Racine, because he felt it was outside the general Milwaukee area. In the first two votes on the package, Mr. Petak voted no and the legislation failed, 16 to 15. It went to a third vote.
"The question I faced was, do we approve a five-county tax and keep baseball, or say no and not keep baseball?" he said. "So I changed my vote." The legislation passed, 16 to 15, to the delight of Gov. Tommy Thompson and Bud Selig, the Brewers' owner, who subsequently raised $90 million in private money for Miller Park.
Eight months later, the furor over Mr. Petak's vote had not subsided, and he faced a recall election in June 1996. His Democratic opponent labeled the stadium bill "the Republican rape of Racine." Mr. Petak lost by about 1,300 votes, the first lawmaker in Wisconsin history to to be removed by recall, providing the Democrats with a one-vote majority in the State Senate.
"The stadium was the most contentious issue I faced," Mr. Petak said, "and it became part of the Democrats' focus on controlling the Senate."

HEADLINE: SHAPING A GLOBAL GIANT: THE INDUSTRY;
Risking Labor Trouble and Clash Of Cultures, 2 Makers Opt for Size

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 6

 BODY:
A quarter of a century ago, most auto makers were convinced that the only way to thrive was to imitate a then-wealthy General Motors and become as big as possible, producing cars of every size and shape and selling them in every market around the globe.
After many years in disrepute, the same theory is back in fashion now and is fully reflected in the planned merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation. 
 The deal would turn two medium-sized auto makers with limited vehicle lineups into a single, nearly global manufacturer selling everything from economy cars to luxury sedans to sport utility vehicles and mini-vans.
The short-term advantages of the merger are clear, and sent both companies' stocks up today. Daimler's automotive unit, Mercedes-Benz, will no longer be so dependent on European sales and on the luxury-car market, which is vulnerable to tumbles in stock prices. Chrysler will no longer earn almost all its profit from sales in the United States of a few models of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans.
But several obstacles remain to any long-term success from a merger, auto executives said. One lies in avoiding the ponderous decision-making that has plagued G.M., partly because of its enormous size.
Another danger comes from combining two giant corporations with very different business cultures.
And a third pitfall may lurk in the auto makers' sometimes contentious labor relations.
Just as many airlines now see their futures in mergers and joint marketing agreements that span continents, a combination of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler will put new pressure on smaller auto makers around the world. Small producers must now choose either to form their own alliances or risk being trapped in their home markets with a limited lineup of models.
While mergers used to be the refuge of the weak in the auto industry, the decision by Chrysler to renounce its independence despite strong sales and near-record profit shows that all but the world's largest auto makers no longer want to stand on their own.
"All of the smaller players from Chrysler on down have to be more worried now about what comes next," a top Detroit auto executive said today. "The weaker players have to begin wondering how they survive."
Oddly enough, one of the strongest critics of very large auto producers is Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's vice chairman. Mr. Lutz said in an interview in January that when he was an executive vice president of BMW in the early 1970's, he was often asked whether the company would soon be forced to merge because it produced fewer than a million cars a year and seemed to have few economies of scale.
"Here's BMW 25 years later, still gloriously independent," Mr. Lutz noted.
He added that the most efficient manufacturers produced 300,000 to three million vehicles a year. Then he stopped and quickly revised the upper limit for efficient production to five million a year. Since Chrysler made nearly 2.9 million vehicles last year, an upper limit of three million would rule out any mergers. Daimler produced 1.1 million cars and trucks last year.
The son of a Swiss banker and fluent in German, Mr. Lutz may soon prove important in dealing with cultural differences between Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler. Mercedes is known for conservative automobiles with meticulous attention to quality. Chrysler has a reputation for producing many of the most eye-catching vehicles on the road, like the Dodge Viper sports car and the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
But its vehicles also dominate the bottom rungs of the annual auto-reliability ratings by Consumer Reports magazine.
Merging European and American auto makers is not a new idea, and the result last time was a disaster that Chrysler executives know particularly well. In 1981, Renault of France took control of the American Motors Corporation, which made Jeeps and Eagle cars. Years of struggle followed between Detroit and Paris over who would make the decisions, as Renault insisted that American Motors try to sell French-designed cars that often did not meet American quality standards.
Squabbles among executives ended up dooming the Renault merger, said Gerald Meyers, who was the chairman and chief executive of American Motors until 1982, when he resigned.
"On paper, it was a marriage made in heaven," he said, but in practice, "the cultures couldn't get together, and that was the reason it foundered."
Renault ended up selling American Motors in 1987 to Chrysler, which promptly turned Jeeps into one of the world's most valuable brands. The last senior French executive at Chrysler from that era, Francois Castaing, was passed over for the company's presidency a year ago and left his position as an executive vice president to become a consultant to Chrysler.
Mr. Meyers said that while Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, has some international experience from having run G.M.'s European operations, Mr. Lutz would be the key to preventing the Daimler and Chrysler merger from running into the problems that Renault and American Motors encountered.
Mr. Lutz is known for his passion for car design, like many German auto executives and unlike most top Detroit auto executives, who commonly rise to the top through their companies' financial operations. He is famous in Detroit for ridiculing financial executives, and contended in an interview last year that "loving the product does not mean fiscal irresponsibility and you're going to splurge on your hobby."
One question, though, is how long Mr. Lutz will remain at Chrysler. He is 66 and stepped down last year from the positions of president and chief operating officer, although he continues to play an influential role in the design of new vehicles. Mr. Lutz had been expected to retire at the end of this year from his post as vice chairman, when his current contract will expire, but hinted in the January interview that he would be willing to stay longer if really needed.
"Would I work to the age of 85 until some cleaning woman finds me slumped over the desk? Probably," he said, adding that he still thought Chrysler should force older executives to retire. Like other Chrysler executives, Mr. Lutz declined to be interviewed today.
Another long-term problem for the two companies may lie in labor relations. Jurgen Schrempp, Daimler's chairman and chief executive, has restored his company's profitability partly through a series of showdowns with German labor unions, although the unions continue to be represented on Daimler's board. When Mercedes decided in the early 1990's to begin producing sport utility vehicles in the United States, it chose to build a nonunion factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
All of Chrysler's factories in the United States are represented by the United Automobile Workers union, which has had no success until now in organizing foreign auto makers' factories in the South. Chrysler endured a 29-day strike here a year ago that temporarily crippled profits.
U.A.W. leaders said today that they were withholding judgment on the proposed merger until they had more details. But people close to the union predicted that it would seek the right to represent the Tuscaloosa workers, and said that the union was nervous that in the next recession, Daimler might lay off Chrysler workers in the United States before Mercedes workers in Germany.

A merger would rank the new company in 5th place in terms of total vehicle sales worldwide.

HEADLINE: As Hills Fill Hollows, Some West Virginia Residents Are Fighting King Coal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BLAIR, W. Va.

 BODY:
Sylvia Weekley's family has lived here, in Pigeon Roost hollow, for so many decades that the 84-year-old matriarch no longer recalls precisely when her ancestors first arrived.
Like other hollows tucked into the folds of southern West Virginia's mountains, Pigeon Roost is a lush and woody haven that appears much as it did centuries ago. A whispering creek, six feet wide in some places, passes close to Mrs. Weekley's front door. Her son, daughter-in-law and a grandson live nearby. 
 It is a place largely untouched by time and technology. Until now.
For all its rustic charm, Pigeon Roost is about to be obliterated.
The hollow lies at the foot of two mountains whose tops will be blasted away by Arch Coal Inc., a mining company in search of the valuable low-sulfur coal that is abundant throughout the region and is sold all over the world as a major source of electricity. When the work begins, the hollow and the surrounding terrain will become become part of a 3,100-acre strip mine, the largest in the state's history.
In strip mining, mammoth machines remove coal from veins near the surface by stripping away the land and vegetation. In mountaintop strip mining, the remaining rock and earth are usually dumped down the mountain, burying hollows and streams.
Strip mining is hardly new to West Virginia and other coal-producing states. It was a hot environmental issue in the 1970's, when mining companies began using it as an alternative to underground mining, which is costlier and more dangerous. Because of the moonlike terrain it left behind, strip mining become so controversial that it led to Federal regulations intended to protect the land and waterways.
Mountaintop removal, a form of strip mining, is not new either. Over the last decade it has become favored by many mining companies as the most efficient strip mining, allowing them to remove coal faster and with fewer workers than in any other process because the coal generally lies close to the surface at higher elevations.
Recently, however, the debate over strip mining, which receded through the early 1990's, has been reinvigorated by a measure signed into law in April by Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, a Republican who is a former coal company executive. The law would allow companies to dump even more of the stripped earth into the hollows and waterways below the mining sites before they would have to compensate the state for the damage.
Companies say they need the law to lower costs. West Virginia has a stake, too. Coal production has always been a major source of employment and tax revenue in a state with few comparable options.
But the law has frightened residents of Pigeon Roost and places like it and has renewed bitter complaints that strip mining is an environmental disaster, destroying scenic vistas and a small-town way of life. They say the law is another in a long line of concessions to coal companies at the expense of the environment.
 
Fighting for Life 'We Hold So Dear'
Anger over Arch's pending operations in Blair, where mining has already driven out many families, led to a recent hearing where local residents and environmentalists expressed opposition to the magnitude of the operation.
"This is our culture, life in these small hollows," Patricia Bragg, a resident of Pigeon Creek, said in an interview. Pigeon Creek is in Mingo County, the state's leading coal-producing county.
"We know that the quality of life we hold so dear is weighed against progress of the country," Ms. Bragg added. "But we're paying for that progress. People raise millions to save whales and walruses and birds, but the state doesn't lift a hand to save the most precious thing in the world, a person's way of life."
The law has also touched off a dispute between state and Federal officials who disagree over whether West Virginia is doing an adequate job of protecting the environment. One local group has already notified the state's chief environmental officer that it intends to sue, contending that the state has violated the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The law sets standards for granting permits, inspecting mines and reclaiming land damaged by the mining process.
The new state law increases to 480 acres from 250 the number of acres of valley waterways, like the creek running along Pigeon Roost hollow, that mining companies can bury before they have to compensate the state. Under the old regulation, the companies paid the state $200,000 for each acre of stream buried above 250 acres. Under the new law, they pay up to $225,000 per acre of stream buried after 480 acres.
Although residents have focused on this latest development, it is mountaintop strip mining itself that is at the core of the dispute. In mountaintop operations, workers use explosives to blast away rock so that giant machines can scoop out the coal. The process can take months.
It is only then that the companies, under requirements of the 1977 Federal act, begin their reclamation projects. Typically, tons of debris are placed at the head of the hollows, then contoured and seeded to approximate land and streams that were obliterated, and ponds are built to replace the creeks.
Over the last three decades, mining companies have reclaimed millions of acres. But critics maintain that too many sites are left unfinished and that ecological systems fed by waterways, now buried under debris, are changed forever.
 
Technological Gains Accelerate Change
With recent technological advances and 20-story machines that cost as much as $100 million, mountaintop mining has accelerated, enabling companies to produce record amounts of coal in West Virginia, far more than was possible through other forms of strip mining.
Mountaintop mining now accounts for nearly a third of the coal produced in the state, a 50 percent increase in 10 years. It is a major reason that coal remains far cheaper than gas or oil as a source of energy.
In 1987 surface mining accounted for 29.7 million tons of coal produced in West Virginia, just 21.6 percent of the total mined. By 1996, the last year for which statistics are available, the total had reached 54.9 million tons, or 31.6 percent of the state's total production.
Most of the largest coal companies operating in West Virginia supported passage of the new law. Industry executives, as well as elected officials who voted for it, contend that it levels the competitive playing field with neighboring Kentucky, where compensation starts at 480 acres.
Proponents also insist that the law will have little if any adverse effect on West Virginia's environment.
"I do not think you will see any degradation of the environment in West Virginia," said William B. Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, a trade group "If you do, I'll be the first in line to call attention to it."
Mr. Raney and other industry officials also say increasing sales of coal help stabilize the economy of a relatively poor state where the coal industry accounts for 16 percent of the state's revenue in a $2.5 billion budget this year.
 
A Federal Warning And One From Citizens
Those arguments wear thin on Federal officials who believe the state acted hastily in approving the new legislation. In a letter that had urged Governor Underwood to veto the measure, W. Michael McCabe, a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, protested several items, including the compensation change. Not that the old regulations were particularly expensive for the companies. According to E.P.A. records of mining applications from 1991 to 1997 in West Virginia, 65 mining sites that affected more than 250 acres of valley waterways brought the state 24 projects and 41 "monetary commitments" of about $7 million.
Mr. McCabe warned the Governor that if the measure passed, "we would regretfully have little choice but to increase our reviews" of all mountaintop mining applications, delays that industry officials assert are unwarranted and expensive.
After Mr. Underwood signed the bill, he criticized Mr. McCabe, for "making threats."
The residents' planned suit against the state cites many of same issues the E.P.A. raised, but more broadly. Challenging the consequences of mountaintop mining, the plaintiffs told John E. Caffrey, director of the state Division of Environmental Protection, they were concerned about the "loss and degradation" of state waters" from mining.
"There is no science on this," said Joseph Lovett, a lawyer in Charleston who is representing the group. "Nobody really knows the effects of filling valley streams. Before, the state had an informal policy. I think the policy was illegal, and now they have put it into law."
Robert S. Kiss, Speaker of the West Virginia House of Representatives, who was a leading proponent of the new law, said that if the new acreage limit proved detrimental to the state he "would not be adverse to revisiting the issue."
At the same time, Mr. McCabe of the E.P.A. said several Federal agencies have begun talking about a comprehensive study of the potential consequences of valley fills.
 
A Community Left With Only Its Dead
But people like Larry Gibson, a retired auto worker whose family settled in Kayford more than 150 years ago, do not need studies to confirm what they see.
At one time, he said, 30,000 people lived in Kayford, about 20 miles from Blair. Now the only permanent residents are the 100 or so members of Mr. Gibson's family who are buried at the top of Kayford Mountain. Mining on nearby peaks, which once were taller than Kayford Mountain, forced the remaining residents to leave, Mr. Gibson said. He and his relatives resisted selling the cemetery and adjacent land, on which they have built a small park.
"It's emotional for me, walking around here," he said, moving about headstones that had been broken by flying rocks from the blasting. "My target is to slow or stop the devastation coal is doing to this state. It used to be a showcase around here."
Dynamite explosions that cause flying rocks as well as cracks in walls and ceilings far from the blast site are a constant problem for people living nearby. They have caused many residents to accept buyouts from the coal companies, who offer $100,000 and more for some homes. While the price may seem generous, many residents say it barely compensates for the cost of moving to new communities, finding new jobs and buying other homes.
But the difficult choice of enduring months of noise, dust and rocks or abandoning towns where relatives have lived for generations is beyond reasonable for many residents of southern West Virginia.
 
Toughing It Out Despite Everything
"The bottom line, whether they offer you a fair price or not, is why do I have to move?" said Ms. Bragg, a plaintiff in the proposed lawsuit. "As an American, I can choose where I want to live. If I choose to live in a hollow, call me a hick or a hillbilly, but that's where I want to live."
For the Weekleys it is no longer an issue. Unlike dozens of their neighbors, they have refused all offers from Arch. Even in the face of thunderous blasting and a reconstructed valley that could come within 300 feet of where they live, they have vowed to stick it out.
James Weekley Jr., Sylvia Weekley's 57-year-old son, walked up the creek to a point several hundred yards away, where the replacement pond is planned. Along the way he spotted "crawdads and other varmints" in the creek.
He looked around a place he knows well. "I'm not leaving," he said. "This is my home, and they are destroying what God created. I'm beginning to know how the Indians felt, and I've told the coal companies that the only way they'll push me out is with a bulldozer. I'm too old to change my life style."

HEADLINE: House Approves Cheaper Loans to Help Students and Bankers

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The House tonight overwhelmingly passed an education bill that would make loans cheaper for millions of students but would soften the blow for banks through a new Federal subsidy.
In a late night vote of 414 to 4, Democrats joined Republicans to approve the higher education reauthorization bill, putting the House on a collision course with the Clinton Administration over student loans. The Administration objects to the loan provision, arguing that banks would profit excessively at the expense of other education programs. 
 Today's resounding vote may make it more difficult for the White House to oppose the legislation. The Senate, which has been working with the House on the reauthorization bill, is expected to take the measure up next week.
"If banks don't make a profit, they will go into lending something else," said Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, who brokered the compromise bill and said it would give students the lowest interest rate in 17 years. "Banks are cold. I would rather make sure we protect students."
Unlike interest rates on mortgages and car loans, which are set competitively by banks, the rate on college loans is fixed by Congress and is scheduled to be readjusted July 1. The current rate is 8.23 percent.
In a bipartisan compromise that seeks to strike a balance between the concerns of students and banks, the House bill would create two separate interest rates for the loans, one for students, 7.43 percent, and a slightly higher one for banks, 7.93 percent. The Federal government would make up the difference.
Late last night, the House also roundly rejected an amendment to end affirmative action programs in public universities.
The battle between the Clinton Administration and the House over loan interest rates comes at a time when college tuition is skyrocketing and a greater number of students are relying on loans. Loans account for 60 percent of Federal student aid, compared with 40 percent in 1980. About 5 million students benefit from the loan programs, a higher number than for any other Federal programs, except Medicare and Social Security.
For months, commercial banks had threatened to abandon the student loan business, saying it would not have been profitable enough for them to continue making loans under the lower rate.
The administration argues that the banks should lower their rate to 7.43 percent without the proposed subsidy, which ranges in cost from $1 billion to $3.8 billion over five years.
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said in a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich that the House bill would create excessive profits.
The Federal government's direct student loan operation handles about 35 percent of the total number of loans, and administration officials say they would be ready with a back-up plan if banks decide pull out.
The problem, said Terry Hartle, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, a trade group representing 18,000 universities and colleges, is that nobody knows if it is the government or the banking industry that is exaggerating. "Because the government doesn't have a market-based way to determine what the interest rate should be, there is no way to tell," he said. "Congress has to guess at the prices."

HEADLINE: SHAPING A GLOBAL GIANT: THE OVERVIEW;
DAIMLER-BENZ WILL ACQUIRE CHRYSLER IN $36 BILLION DEAL THAT WILL RESHAPE INDUSTRY

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
Daimler-Benz A.G., the German industrial giant that makes Mercedes-Benz automobiles, will acquire the Chrysler Corporation in an estimated $36 billion merger expected to be announced as early as this morning.
The deal would be the biggest industrial takeover in history and the biggest acquisition of any American company by a foreign buyer. It would reshape the United States automobile industry by uniting America's third-largest car maker with Germany's renowned producer of luxury cars and heavy-duty trucks. 
 The merged company -- which would combine one of America's greatest industrial comeback stories with a stodgy but tough German industrial icon -- carries significant risks. Other big automotive mergers have not worked well, and the partners in this proposed marriage differ starkly in culture and product.
Nonetheless, the combination would still create a formidable competitor on both sides of the Atlantic. The companies' combined auto sales, ranging from the $11,000 Plymouth Neons to the $40,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees to the $135,000 Mercedes 12-cylinder CL600 coupes, totaled $131 billion last year.
Terms of the deal, a stock swap that values Chrysler at about $36 billion, are expected to be announced as early as this morning in London, considered a neutral ground between Chrysler's headquarters in suburban Detroit and Daimler-Benz's home in Stuttgart. The deal is a windfall for Chrysler shareholders, whose stock rose nearly 18 percent yesterday on reports of merger talks with Daimler-Benz. Page D1.
Both Chrysler's board and Daimler-Benz's management board met separately yesterday and approved the terms, a person close to the talks said. Daimler-Benz's supervisory board, the second in its two-board structure, is expected to approve the deal over the next few days.
While the two companies are likely to pitch the combination to investors as a merger of equals, Daimler-Benz is expected to be the dominant partner in the future. The new company, which would be called DaimlerChrysler, would be incorporated in Germany with headquarters in Michigan and Stuttgart, and Daimler-Benz's shareholders would own a majority of the shares. It would be jointly run for a number of years by Jurgen Schrempp, the chief executive of Daimler-Benz, and Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chief executive, and it is thought Mr. Schrempp could take control after their joint term.
The end of Chrysler as an independent auto maker would mark a stunning turn of events for a company that lurched from one crisis to another in the 1970's, culminating in near collapse, a Government rescue and re-emergence as an agile, low-cost producer and design leader that invented the mini-van.
For Daimler-Benz, known for decades as a ponderous, slow-moving and intensely conservative corporation, the Chrysler marriage promises immediate access to the North American mass market for automobiles without diluting the carefully cultivated upscale image of its Mercedes-Benz brand. It would also give the German company production capacity outside Germany, where worker wages and benefits are among the highest in the world. It further offers Daimler-Benz an opportunity to learn from Chrysler's envied process of making decisions quickly and bringing new vehicles to market promptly -- attributes that have become more important as competition in the industry has escalated. DaimlerChrysler would rank as No. 5 among world auto makers behind General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen.
News of negotiations over a merger, first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal, electrified financial markets. Chrysler shares surged $7.375, or 17.8 percent, to $48.8125; Daimler-Benz's American depository receipts rose $6.50, or 6.4 percent, to $108.5625. Anticipation of other mergers pushed up shares of Europe's other big car companies, including Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault and Peugeot.
The proposed deal stunned industry analysts and automobile executives, and not simply because of its size. Except for the fact that both companies make cars, they could not be more different. Chrysler, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is fundamentally middle class and Midwestern. About 70 percent of its sales come from Jeeps, vans and pickup trucks. It has a negligible European presence.
Daimler-Benz, by contrast, is elite and European. Most Mercedes passenger cars range from $30,000 to more than $100,000, and most of its sales are in Europe. Though sales by Mercedes in the United States soared 65 percent last year, it commands less than 1 percent of the American market.
Rumors of a Chrysler merger have been circulating for a long time, but because the company lacks the resources to compete on a global scale, few people expected a merger with Daimler-Benz.
"We wise industry pundits, who are always keeping lists of possible mergers, would have probably put it at the bottom of our B-list," said John Lawson, an automobile industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
Unlike many other industrial mergers, analysts said, Chrysler and Daimler-Benz are not likely to benefit from quick cost reductions by eliminating extra factories and laying off thousands of workers. That is because Daimler and Chrysler have such fundamentally different businesses that they barely compete.
But at least theoretically, analysts said, the merger could make good strategic sense over the longer term. By joining Chrysler, Mercedes would obtain a huge position almost overnight in the United States -- the world's biggest market. Chrysler has an enormous network of dealerships in the United States and an insider's feel for how to design and sell vehicles in that market. It is also unlikely to face any antitrust objections from United States or European regulators.
The merger is expected to be what is known as a pooling of interests in which Chrysler and Daimler-Benz shareholders will exchange their shares for shares of DaimlerChrysler. Daimler-Benz shareholders would receive one share of the new company for each Daimler-Benz share. Chrysler shareholders would get about 0.55 share in the new company for each Chrysler share, but that ratio was expected to be adjusted later.
Mr. Eaton and Mr. Schrempp met mostly in New York and London, and once in Switzerland, over the last few months to discuss the merger, a person close to the talks said. While the two companies have held merger discussions before, it was not until the two ran into each other at an auto show several months ago that discussions resumed. The two were in New York as recently as Monday working out the details as well as running through a dress rehearsal of the news conference.
Under Mr. Schrempp, Mercedes has expanded its line of passenger vehicles in directions that were once unthinkable -- sport utility vehicles, snappy new convertibles and even the A-Class subcompact. But company officials have long acknowledged that it would be too dangerous to head too far in the direction of middle-class sedans under the Mercedes name.
Mr. Schrempp, for example, has emphasized that the quirky two-seater "Swatchmobile," which is to be introduced in the next year, is not and will not be a "Mercedes." Indeed, Daimler executives have flirted with the idea of starting a new brand.
The deal is also unusual in that it unites two companies that are both enjoying big profits and big growth. After nearly going bankrupt in the early 1980's, Chrysler now earns more profit on every car than any other company in the industry. Daimler-Benz, which lost billions of dollars in a disastrous effort to diversify into fields like aircraft and insurance, has now refocused on its core automotive business and is enjoying spectacular growth.
But both companies lack important building blocks to become truly global. Neither has a meaningful position in Latin America or Asia, where the biggest demand is for small and modestly priced cars.
Chrysler was forced to sell its overseas subsidiaries in the late 1970's as a condition of receiving Federal assistance and has lagged behind Ford and General Motors in capitalizing on the surge in demand in countries like Brazil and Argentina. Chrysler is building a Jeep plant in Argentina but continues to play catch-up.
Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz's dependence on high-priced cars produced in comparatively low volumes -- only 726,000 automobiles last year, compared with 2.3 million by Chrysler -- has meant that it could not achieve the economies of scale that come with more mass-market products.
Given the complementary strengths of each company, analysts and industry executives said the proposed merger could solve some of those problems.
"It would have to be viewed as a very good strategy, though in a 5-to- 10-year view," said Martin Ziegenbalg, an automobile industry analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London. "It will create a true global player that will be more balanced in terms of geography and in terms of product line."
Indeed, some industry experts said the biggest barrier to such a match in previous years had been the incompatibility between strong-willed executives. "These two have been obviously marriage prospects for at least 10 years, but it was totally impossible because of the personalities," said Gerald Meyers, the former chairman and chief executive of the American Motors Corporation, which Chrysler acquired from the French car manufacturer Renault in 1987. Specifically, Mr. Meyers said, a merger involving Lee A. Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman, would have been unworkable.
That does not mean it will be easy. The cultural differences between one of Detroit's Big Three and Germany's biggest industrial corporation will almost certainly be huge. And the experience of trans-Atlantic automobile mergers is not entirely convincing.
Perhaps the clearest demonstrable success story is General Motors, which took over Germany's Adam Opel A.G. decades ago. Despite its ups and downs, Opel is one of Europe's biggest automobile producers and has generally thrived.
But other cases are not so reassuring. The Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar and Aston Martin and sank huge sums of money to renovate their factories and car lines. But Ford's European operations are still struggling to make money in Europe. G.M. bought 50 percent of Saab of Sweden, but the company has yet to be a big source of profits.
The biggest failure in uniting an American and European company was the French company Renault's acquisition of the American Motors Corporation in 1978. Renault invested more than $1 billion in American Motors, which once made Ramblers but was best known for its Jeeps, only to see the company's sales plunge by more than half in the mid-1980's. Renault finally sold the company to Chrysler for $741 million in 1987, and it has achieved huge success as the base for Chrysler's thriving business in sport utility vehicles.
In Daimler-Benz, Chrysler would be getting a strong partner with a very aggressive management. Mr. Schrempp, who is 53, has put Daimler through a radical and often painful overhaul since he took over as chairman in 1995. Daimler shed more than 40,000 employees in less than two years, refocused on its core automotive business and began expanding into new areas like sport utility vehicles.
Daimler's sales and profits have both soared, and its American sales have jumped 65 percent in the last year thanks largely to its hugely popular new M-Class sport utility vehicle, which is being build in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Daimler's stock price has more than tripled in the last three years and has climbed 40 percent since the start of this year.
All of that has put Mr. Schrempp in a powerful position to make a big move. With Daimler's stock at all-time highs, the envisioned exchange of stock allows Mr. Schrempp to take a huge step onto the global stage without having to borrow heavily or bankrupt his treasury.
What is unclear is how long Mr. Eaton, 58, will stick around after his joint term ends. According to Chrysler's most recent proxy statement, Mr. Eaton and Gary Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer, are not eligible for early retirement unless there is "the event of a change of control" in the company's management. That would include an acquisition or merger, a person close to the talks said. In fact, a harbinger of how well Mr. Eaton and Mr. Schrempp will ultimately get along could be the site of the news conference to announce the deal. It is thought they picked London because neither chief executive wanted to be upstaged on the other's home turf. "Merger of equals is the term that has to be used to make this palatable," a person close to the talks said. "You have to have a crystal ball to see how this will work out."

HEADLINE: Battle of Conservatives In Nebraska's Primary

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Neb.

 BODY:
From the stockyards and railroads of Omaha to the cattle-roaming flat lands of western Nebraska, this state has grown far more conservative in the 100 years since its native son William Jennings Bryan ran for President as a radical populist.
While Bryan attacked the wealthy in his "cross of gold" speech, it is now more often welfare recipients who are portrayed as the culprits in advertisements for the Republican candidates for governor as they head into the May 12 primary here. 
 The front-runner in the Republican contest, which is expected to yield the strong favorite in the general election, is Representative Jon Christensen, one of the most conservative voices in Congress, a man who recently became engaged to a former Miss America, and soon after disclosed that she was a virgin.
The other Republican candidates are John Breslow, the State Auditor who has poured more than $2 million of his own money into political advertisements, most of them intent on showing he is just as conservative as Mr. Christensen; and Mike Johanns, the Mayor of Lincoln, and a moderate.
In the view of most political experts, the race is expected to be between Mr. Christensen and Mr. Breslow.
"Between those two, it seems to be a competition of who can position themselves farther to the right on taxes, on standing pro-business, and being anti-gay and lesbian," said Loree Bykerk, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska.
Mr. Breslow has said that, as governor, he would veto any measure passed by the Nebraska Legislature allowing marriages between homosexuals. "As if that would ever come across his desk," Ms. Bykerk said, noting that the Nebraska Legislature is scarcely on the brink of pushing ahead for gay rights.
But Mr. Christensen has gone a step further, saying he would never hire a homosexual in his administration.
"I would not -- if I knew someone was a homosexual -- I would not knowingly appoint somebody to a position of leadership," he said in a recent debate. "Because I believe it is important that any person model who I am as a person. They model my ideology, my belief system, my conservative values, my belief as a family man."
On the Democratic side, Bill Hoppner, a lawyer and former aide to Senator Bob Kerrey who ran a previous campaign for governor, faces James McFarland, a lawyer and former professional football player -- and, more important, a star for the University of Nebraska in the late 1980's.
Mr. McFarland, who spent one term in the state's unicameral legislature, has some blemishes in his past. He disclosed several years ago that he had struck his wife and son on two occasions in 1985, and that they had sought help at a shelter for battered women. He later divorced and remarried.
The current Governor, Ben Nelson, a Democrat, cannot run for re-election under the state's term-limits law.
A state that is overwhelmingly white and lacking any strong labor union presence, Nebraska has been one of the most Republican states in Presidential elections for at least a generation. Still, it elects plenty of Democrats to state-wide office. In fact, both of the state's senators were Democrats until 1996, when Jim Exon retired, and a Republican, Chuck Hagel, won the seat. This year, the Republicans are expected to win the governor's race, because their candidates have greater name recognition and the Democratic field is considered relatively weak.
As is the case in most of the rest of the country in this election year, Nebraska is enjoying relative prosperity. The farm economy is much stronger than in the 1980's, when foreclosures were common. Omaha, the state's largest city, is booming, with the construction of high-priced housing in the neighborhoods that stretch west of Boys Town.
Nebraska is the home of Conagra, a huge farm products company, and of Warren Buffett, the investor who is considered the richest American after Bill Gates of the Microsoft Corporation.
Perhaps the most contentious issue in Nebraska's general election this year is the increasing number of large hog farms, where the swine are crowded in enclosed quarters, a practice known as confinement.
The odors from confinement hog farming can be noxious, and people who live in small towns near the farms complain about being unable to step outside when the wind blows in a certain direction. Moreover, advocates for smaller farms say the factory-like hog operations threaten to run family farms out of business.
The three Republicans in the governor's race have strongly defended the big hog operations, often by attacking environmentalists as extremists.
"Once they go after the hog producer, the next thing they are going to do is go after the cattle producer," Mr. Christensen said. "Then it is just going to be a slippery slope before they come after us all."
Mr. Johanns has ridiculed environmental rules in Lincoln that protect "carp and bullheads and the mosquitoes flying by."
And Mr. Breslow has argued that the state needs more big hog operations, not fewer. "I think Nebraska has to give a message all around the country that we are here and we want good businesses," he said, "and I believe these are good businesses."
On the Democratic side, Mr. McFarland has called for a moratorium on large-scale hog operations. Mr. Hoppner has said he prefers a strict environmental approach, making sure that big hog farms do not foul the countryside and small towns.
Mr. Christensen, a relative newcomer to state politics, has risen quickly: In 1994 he defeated a Democratic Congressman, Peter Hoagland, to represent the district that includes Omaha and its suburbs. In that campaign, Mr. Christensen, a fundamentalist Christian, relied heavily on support from evangelical churches.
When he divorced during that first campaign -- a potential political liability among religious conservatives -- his wife signed an affidavit attesting to her unfaithfulness, and took the blame for the divorce. Now that Mr. Christensen has publicly lauded his fiancee, Tara Dawn Holland, for "saving herself for marriage," some Nebraskans say Mr. Christensen, 35, should keep some things to himself.
"A man announcing that his betrothed is a virgin sounds backwoods," wrote Rainbow Rowell, a columnist for the Omaha World-Herald. "Example: Yep, she's a virgin with a fine set of teeth, and I got 23 chickens for taking her off Pa's hands."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
As an Etcher, Whistler Did More Than Scratch the Surface

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
If James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) did not single-handedly revive the art of etching from its post-Rembrandt doldrums, he had much to do with repopularizing it. Convinced that prints could be as vital as paintings, he became a master of the medium, and there have been collectors so hooked on his etchings and lithographs that they scarcely acknowledge his talent at the easel.
The scope of Whistler's innovative printmaking is evident in the show of 50 etchings and 31 lithographs at the National Academy Museum, parts of his acclaimed sets of views of France, London, Venice and Amsterdam. The show is drawn from the well-rounded collection of Whistler's prints at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, and it makes clear the technical and artistic accomplishments of Whistler the etcher. 
 Whistler was born in Lowell, Mass., but later became a Londoner by choice. He had always been interested in printmaking, experimenting with etching and lithography in his youth. Expelled from West Point for poor grades in chemistry, then dismissed from a job with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for erratic attendance, he went to Paris at age 21 to study painting. He arrived at a time when the tide had turned again to etching as a fine-art medium, and he took it up eagerly, while pursuing his painting studies.
In fact, in the 1850's, his talents as an etcher were more apparent than his prowess as a painter. After a walking tour of northern France, Luxembourg and the Rhineland with a friend in 1858, he produced "Twelve Etchings From Nature," later called "The French Set." The prints were full of details that reflected the powerful trend of realism championed by Gustave Courbet (1819-77).
Only a few are in this show, but they reveal a strong grasp of the etching technique as a medium of light and shadow. Whistler's awareness of Rembrandt and other 17th-century Dutch masters is evident in a striking work from the series, "The Kitchen," a gloomy interior illuminated by a window set in a deep alcove. A lone woman stands at the window, back to the viewer, poignantly silhouetted by the light. In Whistler's time, it was the most popular print of the group.
Yet he apparently considered his first important contribution to etching the group of prints known as the "Thames Set," produced in London, where he settled in 1858. The bustling life on the river was a symbol to him of the city's vitality. And the Dickensian mix of sailors and longshoremen, ships, docks, bars and crumbling warehouses lent itself to his realistic approach. His skill at drawing and use of the etching needle allowed him to shift at will from tight, meticulous rendering to a flowing freedom of line.
In "Black Lion Wharf" (1859), for example, an extraordinarily detailed row of hodgepodge structures stands on the riverbank, while the Thames rolls before it, clogged with more loosely sketched boats and rivermen. One idle sailor sits in the foreground, his arm resting on the gunwale of a boat.
Despite the massing of details, light fills this and other early Thames views, like the 1860 print "Rotherhithe" (a grungy neighborhood east of the Tower of London) that combines riverscape with portraiture. In it, two men relax on a dock in the close foreground; immediately behind them loom a wall and a maze of masts and rigging. The flat picture space was possibly derived from Whistler's study of Japanese prints. In scenes like these, he often allowed the emptiness of the sky to be reflected in a corresponding patch of water, enhancing the light while providing a calm foil for the action on the river.
In his later years, Whistler turned from realism to a more impressionistic style, preferring low-key colors and the murky atmosphere of fog. From Japanese prints, he had begun to view paintings more as "arrangements" or harmonies than as factual reports. In the early 1870's, he started his long series of nocturnes, which he defined as "arrangements of line, form and color," divested of "any outside sort of interest." He carried out the idea in prints as well as paintings, making his first strong venture into lithography in 1878.
In "Nocturne: The River at Battersea," a small watercolorlike lithotint on blue paper of that year, a lone fisherman or clam digger appears in the foreground of a hazy expanse of water with a blurred but decorative silhouette of buildings on the far bank of the Thames. Whistler was moving toward the impressionistic style that came to full fruition in his wonderful Venetian series.
He went to Venice late in 1879 to carry out a commission from the Fine Art Society of London for 12 etched views of the city. His trip, which came at a time of financial struggle, was a triumph; the dozen prints he produced for the society, usually known as the "First Venice Set," and others that were published later under different auspices established him as a great 19th-century master in the field.
His was not the tourist's Venice. He drew palaces, hidden courtyards, out-of-the-way canals, boats, bridges and people, often working directly on an etching plate he carried with a fine needle or a dentist's tool. And he adopted a new style that seemed tailored to the Venetian environment and character.
With great economy of line, he captured the city's bright atmosphere and the delicate traceries of its distinctive architecture. In "Palaces" (1879-80), his biggest Venetian print, he depicted in lavish detail two palaces along the Grand Canal, next to but not including the most famous Venetian palace of all, the Ca d'Oro. The fine details of windows and doors, the ripples of sunlight on the water, the lineup of dark gondolas, are all achieved with a lightness of touch that seems to capture the very essence of this odd but magical place. Whistler wanted the same tonal effects in his prints as in his paintings, and to get them, he wiped excess ink from the plate with muslin, then manipulated the remaining thin film with his hand to give the effect of light or water. The beautiful results of this procedure are particularly evident in his scenes of bridges and boats on the water, like "Nocturne" (1879-80), an idyll in brown ink that some consider his most important print.
Depicting a wide expanse of lagoon and sky at dusk, with the ghost of a two-masted boat at right center and the hazy outline of the Piazza San Marco in the distance, the print is notable for its exquisite tonal variations, which Whistler achieved by careful manipulation of ink on the plate. Paying close attention to the quality of these etchings, printed in the 1880's, he went over each impression himself, using his wiping technique to evoke different moods and even times of day in the same print.
Whistler produced the last of his great etching cycles in Amsterdam, where he spent the fall of 1889. The difference in technique between the works done here and those of his Venice period is marked. The Amsterdam prints are more linear than tonal, as in "Balcony," a tenement scene with clothes on a wash line. Its effects are produced by detailed drawing rather than the gradations of tone Whistler used in many of his Venice views. He said the Amsterdam set, few impressions of which were printed, was his best; but time has judged differently.
In any case, this show is a fine introduction to Whistler's brilliant printmaking strategies, and a great pleasure to see.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: MARKET PLACE;
For the best of all possible markets, higher earnings coinciding with lower economic growth.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
WITH the first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors need two things to help them reaffirm a positive outlook: a rebound in earnings from the anemic pace of the first quarter and a slowdown in the rapid pace of economic growth in the first three months of the year.
Those may seem like conflicting goals. But a slowdown may be the best near-term course for stock market investors. 
 According to First Call, a firm that monitors earnings estimates and performance, profits grew by about 3 percent in the first quarter, the smallest increase since the fourth quarter of 1991.
But analysts are forecasting an 8 percent jump this quarter and an even sharper rise in the second half of the year. This expected rebound, many analysts have said, is the reason the market rose to new highs recently in spite of last quarter's weak earnings.
But a slowdown in overall economic growth, from 4.2 percent in the first quarter to the 2 percent range, is not the best way to bolster corporate earnings. A slowdown requires companies to make or sell fewer products as demand declines. Revenue growth would also decline.
Still, investors may hope for a slowdown as the only way to keep the Federal Reserve from interrupting their party by raising short-term interest rates. Even the threat of such a move, which came in a report in The Wall Street Journal on April 27, sent the stock market reeling. And the threat is still overhanging the market, contributing to the volatile performance of stocks in the last two and a half weeks.
While there are some signs of slowing in American industry and exports, consumer spending is strong, propelled by low interest rates, mortgage refinancing, inexpensive fuel prices and a stock market that has risen 13 percent this year. Both car and retail sales were stronger than expected as the second quarter began.
A rapid pace of growth would certainly force Fed policy makers to raise interest rates to try to cool off the economy before inflation began to rebound.
Any such increase would be followed by questions about the next one. There would be a debate over whether the Fed would just nudge rates higher or be more aggressive. The resulting surge in interest rates on bonds would make a stock market that is, at best, just at full value look pricey and vulnerable to a fall.
But weak earnings, as long as they are not far out of line with profit expectations, do not seem as negative.
The reason lies in the billions of dollars pouring in each month to stock mutual funds. This flow of money seems to reflect less worry about earnings than an investor rush to get into stocks before they move much higher. Aggressive jawboning by corporations about lower profit forecasts has seen to it that investors get mostly positive surprises when the quarterly figures finally come out.
And American corporations have proved that they can increase earnings by cutting costs, even if sales are sluggish.
"In this expansion, because we have reaped all the efficiencies of running corporations better, earnings have vastly outstripped the economy," said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "There is no ironclad rule that earnings and the economy have to move in lockstep."
But, Mr. Berner said, this means that investors are counting more on earnings from cost-cutting or cost containment than about the growth of sales. Those savings, which bolstered earnings so much in recent years, may be dwindling.
Heidi Kunz, chief financial officer of ITT Industries, acknowledges both the opportunities for savings and the difficulties. "When we look at our business," she said, "we think there are significant cost-reducing opportunities. However, "the question is how much of that you have to share with your customer base" by cutting prices.
All these options should be on the mind of investors as statistics for the second quarter start coming out and the market soothsayers try to divine what the economy is doing and, if it slowing, is it slowing enough.
The first real glimpse into the second quarter comes today, with the Labor Department's employment report for April. The consensus among analysts is an increase of 265,000 jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.6 percent from 4.7 percent.
Those are not the kinds of numbers that would convince the Federal Reserve that the economy is slowing down. But coming after a surprising job decline of 36,000 in March, such figures might not be too disturbing. Weaker job creation, however, would make traders happier, as they seem to grasp anything that looks like good news these days.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Torture From an Indonesian Dissident

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Pius Lustrilanang, a student activist, says he was kidnapped at gunpoint on Feb. 4 at a bus stop in Indonesia's capital, blindfolded, driven outside the city and placed in a cell, naked.
Before the first electric shock, he says, he heard one interrogator say: "Here there is no law. There is no human rights. All you have to do is answer our questions. Some people leave here alive. Some don't. They are never found." 
 His questioners were military men who went about their work methodically and patiently, Mr. Lustrilanang said. "They tortured me to get information, not merely for pleasure," he said in an interview, his first since he fled Indonesia 11 days ago. "They wanted to know the constellation of the opposition, the alliances between different leaders."
They threatened him with death, he said, and warned him that if he wanted to live after his release, he should stay silent forever.
Mr. Lustrilanang was one of about 50 Indonesians who have disappeared in the past three months, apparently into the hands of the Indonesian security forces, according to the nation's leading legal aid organization.
The Indonesia Government acknowledges that there have been disappearances among the political opposition; some Indonesian officials have suggested that they are the work of vigilantes or criminals. But opponents of the Government have suffered death, torture and jail for their beliefs at the hands of the government, the State Department says.
Mr. Lustrilanang, who is 30 years old and leader of a prominent student group opposed to President Suharto, was held for two months and then released after international pressure on the Government. He arrived in the United States on Wednesday night, and testified today at a Congressional hearing.
As Indonesia endures the worst political and economic crisis in the 32-year reign of President Suharto, the Clinton Administration is straining to separate questions of political freedom and human rights from economic support. On Monday the Administration expressed support for resuming financial aid to Indonesia through the International Monetary Fund, while simultaneously voicing concern about the kidnapping of dissidents.
Mr. Lustrilanang said today that the issues are inextricable. "Any aid to the Suharto regime should be stopped because it only props up his dictatorship," he said. If aid continues, "there should be conditions: political reforms, human rights."
The I.M.F. says it cannot insist on human rights in exchange for financial assistance, but the Administration has failed so far to convince Congress to provide $18 billion in additional financing for the Fund.
In Indonesia today, Gen. Wiranto, the chief of the armed forces, proposed that the military set up a commission to study political reform. But Mr. Lustrilanang said he placed little faith in generals as instruments of change. He believes it was Indonesian soldiers who kidnapped him, held him in a jail on a military base with about 10 other political prisoners and punctuated their questions with prods from an electrified baton.
"This weakened Government has become more vicious and brutal toward voices of dissent," he said today in testimony at a Congressional hearing convened by Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican. "Often, the perpetrators of those violations are publicly known. In most cases, they are members of the security forces."
Mr. Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, criticized the Administration for providing military training to Indonesia security forces, including units accused of human rights violations.
American special-operations soldiers have conducted 41 training exercises with the Indonesia military over the past five years, including courses in psychological operations and urban combat, at a cost of more than $3.5 million, according to Pentagon officials.
"The first rule should be that the United States does not give any kind of military assistance whatever to governments that murder their own people," Mr. Smith said.
The White House spokesman. Michael D. McCurry, said today that the United States "would continue to call on the Government of Indonesia to respect the individual human rights of those who are voicing legitimate dissent."
At the hearing today, another Indonesian human rights worker testified under a pseudonym and behind a veil.
"I am an Indonesian from a middle-class background who is scared about telling you my honest opinion," she said, explaining her request for anonymity. "We are a people who are terrified of expressing our opinions and terrified of getting involved in politics of any kind.
"We are not citizens of a state. We are subjects of a modern, militarized sultanate."
In an interview before the hearing, Mr. Smith compared President Suharto to the late African dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who amassed a personal fortune worth billions while his nation, Zaire, now Congo, went begging. And the congressman scathingly criticized the Administration and the I.M.F. for sending $1 billion to Indonesia this week.
"Suharto is the Mobutu of Asia," he said, "a dictator, and he and his family have been made filthy rich at the expense of his countrymen. He uses torture, and meanwhile the West goes begging him to take their money for stability's sake."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that for Indonesia, "the best protection against a political breakdown is the restoration of financial stability."
But Mr. Lustrilanang said in the interview that the Suharto Government was already breaking down, and that only the military was keeping it from falling.
"The military will have to support Suharto or support the will of the people," he said. "Maybe there will be a transition government that will conduct just and fair elections." In either case, by bullets or ballots, change would come, he said.
And, he added with a smile, his own captors had given him some hope of that change: "They asked me, 'What is the goal of your political activities?' I said, 'I want to see Suharto step down.' They said, 'Be patient. Just wait two or three years more.' "

Bridgeport Project Wins State Approval

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The Connecticut General Assembly this week approved a $200 million plan to turn the depressed Steel Point area of Bridgeport into an entertainment and retail complex called Harbor Place.
The state funds supplement $700 million raised by the developer, the Conroy Development Company of Greenwich, Conn., which had been selected by the state and the city. 
 Alexius C. Conroy, the company president, said the 52-acre project would be bigger than the Harborplace in Baltimore. "We going to have about 1.5 million square feet of retail and entertainment," he said.
Under the plan approved late Wednesday night in the waning hours of the Legislature's session, Bridgeport would receive $120 million in special bonds, called tax incremental financing, for the project, which also includes a hotel, commercial space and a ferry operation. The bonds will be paid off though tax revenue generated by Harbor Place.
That city is expected to receive an additional $20 million in other state bond money and may borrow up to $60 million for the project, which is expected to cost about $1 billion.
Mr. Conroy said that construction on the project could start as soon as next summer; the next several months will be spent acquiring land.
Part of the land is owned by the United Illuminating Company, an electric utility, which tore down an old power plant on the site several years ago. Several small businesses and homes also exist on the peninsula, which juts into Long Island Sound.
The state money is coming from a $460 million budget surplus and is part of an emphasis by Gov. John G. Rowland to redevelop Bridgeport and the state's two other large cities, New Haven and Hartford.

HEADLINE: Underreporting Found On Male Teen-Ager Sex

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Male teen-agers engage in risky behavior associated with H.I.V. infection more than previously thought, and they are also much more willing to report such behavior if the survey is administered by computer, rather than on paper, a new study suggests.
The research appears to call into question much of the data that has been gathered on sensitive subjects like drug use and sexual habits, and to confirm what researchers have long assumed to be under-reporting in such areas. The more socially stigmatized the behavior, the greater the disparity in the results between the two reporting methods. 
 The results of the study, to be published today in the journal Science, have significant implications both for public health and the understanding of how people relate to computers. The authors said the findings were striking and unexpected, because paper questionnaires were believed to address adequately the privacy issues that are known to inhibit honest responses in face-to-face or phone interviews.
"We had the analysis done and re-done, but this is real," said Charles F. Turner, director of the program in health and behavior measurement at the Research Triangle Institute in Washington and co-author of the study. "It means everything you thought about the risks adolescents face is an underestimate, if you're deriving your perceptions from past surveys."
Among the 1,600 male respondents ages 15 to 19 surveyed nationally, those who listened to questions on earphones and viewed them on a computer screen were almost four times as likely as the paper and pencil group to report some type of male-male sex (5.5 percent vs. 1.5 percent); 14 times as likely to report sex with an intravenous drug user (2.8 percent vs. 0.2 percent); and 5.5 times as likely to report that they were "always" or "often" drunk or high when they had heterosexual sex (10.8 percent vs. 2.2 percent).
The study, financed by the National Institutes of Health, did not test whether the teen-agers might be exaggerating in their computer-assisted responses. But the authors and other social scientists said the results were consistent with what is generally believed to be more accurate levels of the reported behavior than has shown up in previous data.
For instance, male adults interviewed at a time of their life when they would have less incentive to distort the truth typically report the same level of male-male sex activity during their adolescence as those responding by computer in the survey.
"We know people have a tendency to report more socially desirable or normative behaviors," said David S. Metzger, director of the opiate and AIDS research division at the University of Pennsylvania Center for the Studies of Addiction. "We know that for kids in their adolescence, their drug use is at such an early stage that their primary concern is keeping it hidden. I think this moves us a lot closer to the truth."
Other health researchers who have been experimenting with computer technology said the method yields similar results with different groups of respondents. For example, drug users going to syringe exchange programs in several cities were found to be significantly more forthright about their drug use when the questions were administered by a computer, said Don C. Des Jarlais, director of research at the Chemical Dependency Institute of Beth-Israel Medical Center in New York.
"This provides us with better information which should allow us to do better treatment," Dr. Des Jarlais said.
Joe Gfroerer, director of the division of population surveys at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association, which administers a major national health survey, said the agency planned to switch to computerized questioning by 2001.
Mr. Turner and his co-authors, Leighton Ku, Susan M. Rogers, Laura Lindberg, Joseph H. Pleck and Freya L. Sonenstein attributed the respondents' willingness to be more forthcoming on the computer to a greater perception of privacy.
The gap in the survey results remained after controlling for such variables as race and school performance. Indeed, the gap between those who reported on paper and those who gave their answers to the computer was even greater among the male teen-agers who performed well in school, leading the researchers to speculate that they had a better image to maintain, and hence more reason to hide the truth.
Experts who have studied human interactions with computers said the results were consistent with studies that have shown a decrease in inhibition when a computer mediates human communication. Sherry Turkle, a psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, describes a common perception of the computer as a "safe space."
"It's a mind but it's not a mind," Dr. Turkle said. Further, she said, "We know our computers are networked, but we still experience them as a blank screen for our own self-reflection."
Although it is an expensive method, computer-administered questioning has been praised by some who have used it as helping to eliminate literacy problems among respondents who might not be able to read or write out their answers. In the study of male teen-agers, respondents heard the pre-recorded questions through headphones.
Some hailed the survey by Dr. Turner and his collaborators as a welcome effort to use digital technology to enhance the quality of the information -- even as it raises concerns about previous methodologies.
"Our understanding of the world is shaped more than any other time in history by the data," said David E. Bloom, an economics professor at Harvard University, whose commentary on Dr. Turner's study will also appear in Science. "But to the extent that the data are weak or misleading, it raises grave questions about the quality of the decisions we're making. To me this particular study is consistent with the view that the data are quite bad, especially with regard to sensitive matters, which is often what we're most interested in."

HEADLINE: SHAPING A GLOBAL GIANT: THE UNIONS;
Labor Officials See Little to Fear in a Combination

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Labor unions often cringe at mergers because such combinations frequently portend large-scale layoffs. But the giant unions representing auto workers in the United States and Germany see little to fear in Daimler-Benz A.G.'s acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation.
The reason: There is little overlap in the production of the two companies, and as a result, union officials see little prospect of consolidation and layoffs. 
 Indeed, some union leaders predicted that a combination would bring more opportunities than worries. For instance, officials with the United Automobile Workers predicted that the acquisition would open the door to the union's organizing workers at a new Mercedes plant just outside Tuscaloosa, Ala., a plant with 1,500 workers that has until now fought unionization.
And labor experts also said the deal could result in strong cross-Atlantic ties between the U.A.W. and I. G. Metall, the powerful union representing German auto workers -- perhaps creating a more formal alliance between a European union and an American one than has ever existed before.
At a news conference yesterday in Detroit, Stephen P. Yokich, president of the U.A.W, sounded anything but worried. "I don't believe it weakens us -- not at all," Mr. Yokich said. "We really don't see any layoffs and the company didn't see any when we spoke to them."
Even if the two unions have some major objections to the merger, some labor union officials acknowledged that such objections were unlikely to result in walkouts anytime soon because the two unions have pending contracts with Chrysler and Daimler.
In an interview with a German radio station, Walter Riester, vice president of I. G. Metall, which represents about 160,000 auto workers at Daimler-Benz, said his first reaction was to check whether the merger endangered production or jobs in Germany.
"To begin with, there is convincing proof that this is not the case," Mr. Riester said. "The range of products at Chrysler and Daimler and Mercedes-Benz is very, very different and both operate in different markets."
Philippe Houchois, an automobile analyst with Standard & Poor's/DRI in London, agreed. "The official line is there will not be any job losses or redundancies," he said. "It's a believable line because there is no product overlap."
An outgrowth of the Chrysler-Daimler deal could be the formation of the strongest cross-Atlantic alliance ever between two unions, several labor analysts said. Officials from the U.A.W. and I. G. Metall already compare notes and discuss strategies about coming problems, but as a result of the merger, that cooperation is expected to increase vastly.
"This merger is good for business and good for labor," said Lowell Turner, a professor of comparative labor relations at Cornell University. "It will also be a good stimulus for growing international collaboration among unions as they struggle to counterbalance the enormous power of capital in the global economy."
Several analysts predicted that the deal, by having the unions looking over each other's shoulders, could prompt the U.A.W. to begin demanding some of the goodies received by their German counterparts. "Americans haven't really paid attention that the Germans get six weeks' vacation because they see Germany as a different universe," Professor Turner said. "But when they get pulled more closely together because of a merger like this, it's likely to affect bargaining demands."
For example, Mr. Yokich said yesterday that it would be good if American unions could win the same rights that German unions have. German law gives unions half the seats on the supervisory board of many companies and requires many corporations to have works councils, which are groups of union officials who can block some of management's moves, like layoffs, but not others, such as installing new technologies.
Indeed, several labor experts suggested that since under German law, I. G. Metall has half the seats on Daimler's supervisory board that could make life easier for the United Automobile Workers in future negotiations or in future corporate decisions on plant closings. For example, if Daimler-Chrysler had a showdown with the U.A.W. over wages in American negotiations, Metall might be able to pressure Daimler, both on the supervisory board and on the factory floor, to give their American co-workers a better deal.
But Karl E. Ludvigsen, chairman of Ludvigsen Associates, an automobile consulting firm in London, said he doubted the merger would strengthen either union's hand. "After all the international mergers I've seen, none of the labor unions have really moved the need in being able to go to the headquarter country to try to get a better deal,"he said. "There's much talk among the unions trying to use their leverage across international boundaries, but they haven't succeeded."
Diane C. Swonk, an economist with the First Chicago NBD Corporation, said that as result of the merger, the United Automobile Workers would be more likely to select Chrysler as its strike target in next year's round of bargaining. The union might conclude it could get a better deal from a German-owned Chrysler, she said.
"This," she said, "makes them a target because the union will think there's a tendency that Daimler will roll over and play dead with the U.A.W. more than Chrysler would have."

HEADLINE: AT&T to Offer New Nationwide Cut-Rate Wireless Service

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Flexing its financial, technological and marketing muscle, the AT&T Corporation moved yesterday to shake up the wireless telephone industry with a new service that offers calls from almost anywhere in the United States to anywhere in the nation for flat rates of as little as 11 cents a minute.
The company also said it had short-term exclusive rights to distribute a new wireless phone by Nokia of Finland that can be left on for more than a week at a time -- much longer than most wireless phones. 
 Some elements of AT&T's new plan -- like the elimination of additional long-distance fees -- failed to break new ground in the telecommunications industry. But by eliminating special "roaming" charges for using its phones on other companies' networks, AT&T appeared to take the marketing lead in the growing field of wireless communications.
"This is exactly the sort of thing that someone in this country needed to say to make wireless a service you use rather than a service you avoid," said David Cooperstein, an analyst at Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "They should have done it two years ago. But now that they've done it, it's great."
The new plan seemed to be partly a response to the wave of new competitors that have come after AT&T's wireless customers since the Federal Communications Commission began new auctions of the wireless spectrum a few years ago.
AT&T is the largest provider of wireless service in the nation, with more than 8 million subscribers. But while AT&T added 195,000 users in the first quarter, Sprint PCS grew by 227,000 and Nextel Communications Inc. added 371,000.
Dan Hesse, president of AT&T's wireless unit, said in an interview that next week the company would begin putting on its first television advertisements aimed at promoting a specific wireless plan. Mr. Hesse refused to say how much AT&T would spend on the campaign but said it would also include print and radio.
AT&T may have to move quickly because it has exclusive rights to the high-end version of the new Nokia phone for only 90 days. AT&T said it would offer a new battery for the phone this summer that lasts for up to 13 days at a time.
AT&T announced three versions of the new monthly plan, ranging from 600 minutes of air time for $89.99, or 15 cents a minute, to 1,400 minutes of air time for $149.99, or 10.7 cents a minute.
By contrast, AT&T's One Rate plan for normal residential long-distance service charges 15 cents a minute.
Mr. Hesse said the wireless rates would apply 24 hours a day for calls to anywhere in the United States and from areas covering about 97 percent of the population.
Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint PCS, a joint venture of Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications and Comcast, pointed out that his company already offered a plan that eliminated additional long-distance charges. "What they're trying to play as a ground-breaking thing in the industry is window dressing," he said.
Sprint offers a plan for 1,000 minutes of air time and no additional long-distance charges for about $110, or 11 cents a minute. But so far Sprint PCS's network covers less than half of the United States population, and Sprint PCS normally charges 69 cents a minute for calls from networks owned by other companies.
Thomas J. Lee, a telecommunications analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said AT&T's new plan was aimed not at Sprint PCS but at Nextel, which had mainly aimed at heavy callers as potential customers.
"The real loser here is Nextel," he said. "Nextel's national footprint, which they've always touted with no roaming charges, doesn't look so attactive because Nextel only offers service in half the country and AT&T is offering service almost everywhere."
But other Wall Street analysts questioned whether what was good for consumers was necessarily healthy for the company.
"It's an unnecessary price cut," said John Bensche, a wireless communications analyst at Lehman Brothers. "I think AT&T is going to leave a lot of money on the table. The first-order impact is that they lower the prices they charge their own customers."

HEADLINE: New Policy Center Seeks to Steer the Debate on Climate Change

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
With millions of dollars from a charitable foundation known for its environmentalism and with endorsements from some of the nation's biggest corporations, a former State Department official who helped negotiate the climate-change treaty is mounting a new campaign for action to head off global warming.
Eileen Claussen, who as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for environmental affairs helped develop the climate protocol approved at an international conference last December in Kyoto, Japan, said today that she would run a policy center that would seek to lend "a credible voice" to the debate on global warming. 
 Pew Charitable Trusts gave Ms. Claussen a $5 million annual grant for the project. Already, treaty opponents financed by industry and treaty supporters from the environmental movement are spending millions of dollars each year in a debate over climate change that is sometimes fraught with exaggeration and even outright distortion of the science and economics of the issue.
"It's a big grant, it's a big bet and it's a big problem," said Rebecca Rimel, Pew's president. "There is probably no bigger issue facing the country and the globe, and the time to act is now, because the longer we procrastinate, the bigger the problem grows."
Besides the Pew financing, about half of which will be spent on advertising, Ms. Claussen won endorsements from a group of large companies with annual revenues in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Their support is meant to signal divisions within big business over the effect of climate-control measures that opponents say could wreck the economy by forcing deep cuts in the use of fossil fuels.
Next week, the new Pew Center on Climate Change will publish an advertisement festooned with the corporate logos of its supporting companies, which include the aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, the Japanese auto maker Toyota, the appliance manufacturers Maytag and Whirlpool, the diversified conglomerates United Technologies and 3M, and several big energy companies: British Petroleum, Sun Oil, American Electric Power, U.S. Generating Company and Enron.
The companies are not contributing financially to the new center, but they are promising to seek ways to reduce their own emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and to invest in new, more efficient products and technologies.
The advertisement says that these companies "accept the views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences."
A major tenet of some industry groups fighting the Kyoto treaty is that too little scientific evidence has been accumulated to justify the treaty's call for deep reductions in emissions of gases that trap the sun's heat like in a greenhouse. Automobile and energy companies have been among the treaty's biggest opponents.
Ms. Claussen's group does not explicitly endorse the Kyoto pact, but sees it as "a first step." It has called for more work to put into effect the emissions trading schemes and participation by developing countries that the treaty's negotiators plan to work out later this year. The Clinton Administration has said there must be progress on these issues before it agrees to sign the treaty.

HEADLINE: Retail, 1990's Wallflower, Finally Dances

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
American retailers reported their best monthly sales gains in four years yesterday, capping one of the healthiest quarters of retail sales in almost a decade. Sales in retail stores open at least a year rose 10.2 percent in April, according to the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index.
"The numbers are so good, we can't even fit them on our spreadsheet page," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers. 
 Indeed, for the industry's first quarter of 1998 -- from Feb. 1 to April 30 -- same-store sales, or sales in stores open a year, rose 6.5 percent. That was far above any other quarter in the last 10 years with the exception of the first quarter of 1994, when sales rose 7.9 percent.
By some gauges, the strongest gains were in the mid-Atlantic region, and the weakest area was the Far West.
As economic indicators go, the retail industry is like the last student picked for the gym class dodge-ball team -- sulking on the sidelines, unable to demonstrate prowess. During almost all of the nation's latest economic boom, the retail segment has been left behind, churning out mediocre sales, inconsistent earnings and disappointing Christmas seasons.
Paradoxically, nearly every other piece of economic data in recent years has pointed to consumers willing to spend. Unemployment has been at its lowest in a quarter century, and inflation has remained almost nonexistent. The stock market has been buoyant and consumers have been buying new homes and autos and traveling. In the last quarter alone, the economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate.
Despite all this blithesome news, spending in general retail stores has mostly lagged behind, with many stores reporting same-store sales losses many months of the year. While the 1997 Christmas season was fairly good, most sales were rung up after the actual holiday.
But retailers turned a corner this spring, helped by a combination of the failure of several stores over the last two years, tighter inventory management among retail companies and shoppers who decided that it was time to restock their closets. And the turn of events bodes well for retail company earnings for the first quarter.
"If you look at 1996," said Richard N. Baum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, "retail sales were up 3 percent. In 1997, we crept up to 4 percent. But now, we are up 6 percent, year to date. People feel good about going out and spending money."
Though analysts said sales were consistent around the nation, some areas showed more strength than others.
"The New York region is up above the national average," Mr. Feiner said. "Our index showed sales up 11 percent over last, and I would say New York is about 2 percent higher than that because the upscale stores are doing fantastically well."
Telecheck Services, which monitors check writing, said that the mid-Atlantic region was the strongest, with sales measured by check writing up 4.5 percent, as against an average rise of 3.1 percent.
"The weakest region was the Far West," said William Ford, senior economic adviser to Telecheck. "Sales there only rose 2.1 percent, which could have been an El Nino effect."
Over all, all types of merchandise sold well last month, from bathing suits to house plants to patio furniture to Fendi bags, with the cheapest and the most expensive stores faring the best, as has been the trend for several quarters.
"Warm weather sent people out shopping for apparel, and things were by and large sold at full price," Mr. Feiner said. "Given trends in inflation and interest rates, we do not believe the consumer is spent out."
What retailers seem to be learning is that shoppers hit the stores when they get the urge, not because a holiday is on the horizon or because a store is having a "one day" sale. As a result, retailers have tried to keep their shelves filled with enough but not too much, and to accept that one month may be better than the last for no apparent reason.
"There is something about spring," said Perry Buroker, who lives in Bennington, Vt., and is director of annual giving in the development office at Bennington College. She and her husband just loaded up on garden items, a golf putter, sneakers, clothes and a fence for their backyard. "I'm tired of being inside," Ms. Buroker said. "We have been buying a lot of things."
What seemed a fad two years ago appears now to be a retail reality -- shoppers in all income groups are drawn to discount stores. As such, the cheapest and the fanciest ends of the mall tend to perform well together.
Wal-Mart Stores, for example, had sales gains of 13.2 percent last month, and Target Stores, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said sales rose 10.5 percent. Value City, which sells clothing at a discount, reported a sales growth of 19 percent last month, and Dollar General, another discount store group, said sales increased 20.2 percent.
On the high end of the market, Saks Fifth Avenue said its sales rose 17.7 percent, and Neiman Marcus, a Harcourt General unit, reported gains of 10.7 percent.
"The consumer is feeling confident and coming in to spend all that hard-earned money," said Brian E. Kendrick, chief operating officer of Saks. "The baby boomer's propensity to spend is on luxury goods."
Retailers showing the best results are those that have tapped into consumer desires, such as the need for constantly changing merchandise, and have managed to stay disciplined with business issues, like inventory management.
Gap Inc., for example, had a stellar month, reporting sales gains of 29 percent, with strong numbers in all its divisions, which include Old Navy and Banana Republic.
"The absolute dollar level of our increases is pretty meaningful," said Warren R. Hashagen, the Gap's chief financial officer. "The weather was better this year, but all that does is give you an opportunity. We have much-improved merchandise. We have heightened attention to customer service. We have better in-stock. And we have increased marketing and advertising. It isn't just one thing."
Economists say general merchandise retailers are simply enjoying the fruits of a good economy the way they should have been all along. "The consumer spending data has been very strong," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "My view is that it will continue but not as strong."
All the good news does not necessarily mean that it is time to invest in retail stocks.
"All the signs showed that you were going to see blowout numbers" in sales figures, said Dan Meader, executive vice president of Tara Capital Partners, a Dallas-based hedge fund that specializes in retail. "The retail index has outperformed the S.& P. for almost a year, and today reminds us all that retailing stocks can get ahead of themselves. Many of them are fully valued. There are not too many rabbits to be pulled out of the hat."

HEADLINE: Productivity Grows at Slowest Pace Since '96

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Worker productivity grew at the slowest pace in more than a year in the first quarter, the Labor Department reported today, reflecting a surge in hours employees spent on the job and acute shortages of job applicants.
Productivity -- a measure of the time and effort of providing goods and services -- rose at an annualized rate of two-tenths of a percent. Analysts had expected a rise of six-tenths of a percent. In the fourth quarter, productivity rose at a revised annualized rate of 1.4 percent, down from the initial estimate of 1.6 percent. 
 The productivity data are closely followed because growth in productivity has helped suppress inflation in the growing economy. If productivity slowed for a prolonged period, economists said, that would cause concern at the Federal Reserve. There has been increased speculation in recent days that Fed policy makers may raise interest rates at their meeting on May 19 to head off inflation.
The increase in productivity was the weakest since the third quarter of 1996, when worker output per hour declined at an annualized rate of seven-tenths of a percent. For all of last year, productivity grew 1.7 percent; in 1996, the increase was 1.9 percent.
In further evidence of a tight labor market, the Labor Department reported today that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits unexpectedly declined by 11,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 308,000. On Friday, the Government is expected to report the economy added 264,000 jobs in April after a loss of 36,000 jobs in March led by the construction industry. Many economists expect that the unemployment rate dropped back to a quarter-century low of 4.6 percent, from 4.7 percent in March.
In other signs the economy could grow faster than the Fed would prefer, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories and sales both increased in March.
But Fed data on consumer borrowing for March showed the weakest increase in four months, a sign that people are not borrowing excessively for their purchases. Borrowing rose by $1 billion for the month, far less than the expectations of $4.1 billion.
Borrowing rose $1 billion, to $1.242 trillion, after rising a revised $6.1 trillion during February. Previously, the Fed said borrowing increased $7 billion in February. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $4.1 billion for March.
Wall Street analysts watch the Fed's consumer-credit statistics because they help them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Created Its Own Problems, Justice Dept. Says

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
In a strongly worded court brief filed today, the Justice Department argued that the Microsoft Corporation had known for months that its legal problems with the Government might delay the release of its Windows 98 operating system, due to be released next week. But Microsoft deliberately waited until the last minute to ask a court for protection, Government lawyers charged, so the company could make "a self-generated claim of hardship."
In other words, the Government argued, Microsoft is complaining about a problem of its own making. 
 Windows 98 is scheduled to be shipped to manufacturers next week and is supposed to be available in retail stores on June 25.
On Wednesday, Microsoft asked the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to stay parts of a preliminary injunction that could be used by the Government to block the release of Windows 98. The injunction bars Microsoft from forcing manufacturers to install the company's World Wide Web browser, Internet Explorer, as a condition of licensing its current operating system, Windows 95.
In Windows 98, Internet Explorer is even more closely integrated into the operating system, making it more difficult for manufacturers to ship computers without Microsoft's browser -- and thus more difficult for Microsoft to comply with the injunction if the court applies it to the new operating system.
Microsoft argued this evening that the Justice Department's argument had "no legal basis."
"We've been working with the Justice Department for six weeks, trying to reach a mutual resolution to this problem," a spokesman, Mark Murray, said. "When it became clear early this week that Justice was not willing to reach a mutual resolution, we immediately sought resolution from the appeals court."
In its court brief, Microsoft argued that the Justice Department never raised the issue of Windows 98 in filings to the court before today and so has no standing to do so now.
With today's filing, the Justice Department attached a partial transcript of a deposition in which Paul Meritz, the Microsoft vice president in charge of the Windows group, acknowledged that the company had recognized this problem months ago.
"Yeah, we did think about it" in December or January, he said. "But our decision has to be to go ahead and, given the nature of the Windows 98 product, to deliver that product."
The dueling court briefs are only one part of a growing legal and public relations battle that has grown in recent weeks to involve computer industry executives and two United States Senators as both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general rush to decide whether to file a broad new antitrust suit against Microsoft in time to block the release of Windows 98.
Microsoft has been pressing a multifaceted campaign to block any new suit. On Wednesday evening, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, spent two hours trying to persuade Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust issues, that Microsoft had both a right and a responsibility to incorporate new products in its operating system.
Both Microsoft and Justice Department officials said the meeting had done little to narrow the disagreements between the two sides.
Earlier that same day in New York, Mr. Gates presided at a Microsoft-sponsored "rally" featuring testimonials by 50 or so leaders of businesses in or related to the computer industry about the importance of a timely release of Windows 98.
But the event seemed to steel the opposition of some government officials.
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of 13 states preparing to sue Microsoft, said he and the other Attorneys General "have an obligation to see through the rhetoric" and "the well-orchestrated lobbying and public relations campaign."
The Massachusetts Attorney General, Scott Harshbarger, another member of the group, added, "Self-serving spin will not deter antitrust enforcers from protecting consumers who want more economic choices in a competitive marketplace."
And Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that many of the business leaders who appeared with Mr. Gates in New York had been coerced.
"I have been told that some of these executives in fact hope to see the Justice Department pursue a further case against Microsoft but have chosen to join Mr. Gates on the stage today because they feel that they have little choice but do so in order not to jeopardize their relationship with the industry's most powerful and important player," Senator Hatch said in a statement issued on Wednesday. He made the same argument in a letter to Mr. Gates.
Microsoft wrote back, disputing Mr. Hatch's assertions, and adding that it "would not refuse to help other companies in the personal computer industry in opposing Government action that they also regard as misguided."
Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican and a staunch defender of Microsoft, stepped into the debate. In an angry letter to his fellow Republican, Senator Gorton told Senator Hatch that he was "astounded by your letter to Microsoft" and suggested that Mr. Hatch did not fully understand the issues.
In response, Mr. Hatch prepared a six-page explanation of his views. Senator Gorton then delivered a statement on the Senate floor denouncing Mr. Hatch and his tactics. That, in turn, unleashed a new round of letters and statements.
And with the Justice Department's decision about a new antitrust suit against Microsoft still a few days away, both Senators' offices said they thought the angry rhetoric was likely to escalate.

HEADLINE: Stock Exchange Gets A New Jersey Offer

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange said last night that it had abandoned plans to expand its historic headquarters in lower Manhattan and that it had received an offer by New Jersey to build a $1 billion trading floor for the exchange in Jersey City.
Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, said remaining on Wall Street appears to be "no longer viable" and that his first choice now would be a new complex in Battery Park City. 
 But he said that four New Jersey economic development officials met with him on Tuesday and "very energetically and enthusiastically put on the table a potentially very economically rewarding set of initiatives."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Using Grit and Glitz to Bring Aid to Schools

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
SHE'S relentless," the author James McBride said yesterday about Lisa Belzberg, the woman who installed him as principal for the day at Public School 118 in Queens, and who was eight months pregnant when she asked him to do it. "We had lunch at some tony restaurant near her office, and a lot of these East Side fat cats were coming up, shaking her hand, saying, 'Hi Lisa.' I thought it was interesting that these really arrogant folks would bow to a pregnant woman. And I just assumed that she had a very powerful personality, and that there was no point in resisting. And she was also really nice to my son."
Lisa Belzberg is the president of Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning, or Pencil, the group that runs Principal for a Day, the highly regarded and often criticized program that puts role models in New York City public schools for one day each year. The idea came from Ramon C. Cortines, the former Schools Chancellor, but four years ago Ms. Belzberg stopped producing the "Charlie Rose Show," offered to take over the program, and then made it her own. Yesterday she had principals in almost all of New York City's 1,100 public schools. 
 As usual, a lot of the principals were rich or famous, like the actress Stephanie Seymour, the lawyer Joseph H. Flom and the designer Norma Kamali. As usual, Ms. Belzberg defended the program, saying that it was not intended to make people who have a lot of money feel good about themselves because they spent a few hours in the public schools.
"We have a certain glitz," she said. "Obviously, it gets us the publicity we want. But we don't put money people in and ask for checks at the end of the day. We ask for involvement." She ticked off some success stories: New York publishers now give 1.3 million books to the schools each year. VH1 television has donated $1 million worth of musical instruments. And Ms. Kamali created a student-run T-shirt company.
Last year, Ms. Belzberg was in agony when she watched Donald J. Trump offer sneakers to students at Public School 70 in the Bronx, prompting an astute 11-year-old to ask why Mr. Trump was handing out shoes when he could afford scholarships. This year, Mr. Trump was not in the program.
"Did he follow through on his sneakers?" Ms. Belzberg said. "He did. Did he do much else? No."
Ms. Belzberg, 35, is a direct and personable insomniac who grew up in one of Canada's financial dynasties, then married into another one. Her father is Samuel Belzberg, the corporate raider whose runs at American companies in the 1980's sometimes blew up in spectacular losses. Her husband is Matthew Bronfman, 38, of the Seagram family.
Ms. Belzberg was eight and a half months pregnant with their second child when she married him last December, after his divorce in June. They live in a century-old town house just off Fifth Avenue. There is a Picasso in the living room, a Matisse in the bedroom and white-uniformed servants on all six floors.
DO you want to take the elevator or the stairs?" Ms. Belzberg asked Wednesday morning. The spiral staircase looked fine. On the way up was Tess, Ms. Belzberg's infant daughter, and in the library were waiting bowls of fruit. A servant brought scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. "I'm sensitive about seeming like a rich dilettante," Ms. Belzberg said, gesturing with some humor to the surrounding splendors. "Can't imagine why."
Ms. Belzberg graduated from Barnard College, has a master's degree from the London School of Economics, and once worked for the political consultant David Garth ("I was his slave"). Although she seems at ease with the way she lives, she pointed out yesterday that her money is really her father's and her husband's.
"It's not mine, is it?" she said, sitting on the steps outside P.S. 118 in the Hollis section of Queens. "It's just not mine. You never feel like you have done it for yourself." Someday, she said, "I'd like to make enough money myself never to have to ask anybody for money. Wouldn't that be great?"
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew offered Ms. Belzberg a job, but Ms. Belzberg turned him down, saying she liked the freedom of running Pencil from outside, especially since she has small children. (Her other daughter is 2.)
Will she send her own children to public schools? "I'm an Orthodox Jew," she said simply, saying she keeps kosher and observes the Sabbath with her husband, who was raised in what she calls a "traditional" Jewish home. "My kids will go to Jewish schools."
Ms. Belzberg's husband has never worked for Seagram -- he creates small companies -- but is an heir to the fortune and has been reading the articles describing his brother, Edgar Bronfman Jr., as being over his head with his investments in Hollywood. "Look, he's taking a big hit," Ms. Belzberg said of her brother-in-law. "I think he's obviously really smart. We really believe in his leadership. I don't understand Hollywood. When people say, 'Don't you think that was a stupid decision?' I say, 'I have absolutely no idea.' "
Yesterday, Mr. McBride, the author of "The Color of Water," spent part of his day at P.S. 118 -- his alma mater -- playing the saxophone for students. "This might mean nothing," he said, "or it might make a difference in a kid's life." With Ms. Belzberg, he said, "it wasn't something I was going to get out of doing."

HEADLINE: Critics Fear Role of Politics in CUNY Plan

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
As the battle lines formed Wednesday over the fate of remedial education at the City University of New York, it was becoming increasingly clear that the larger issues at stake were CUNY's tradition of open access and political control at a college system that has educated generations of New Yorkers.
This week, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, long critical of CUNY for admitting too many students unprepared for college work, agreed on a plan to bar such students from the 11 four-year colleges. They are pressing their trustees, most of whom they appointed, to adopt their policy later this month, arguing that it will restore the quality and reputation of the university. 
 Yesterday, on CUNY's campuses and off, the actions by the Governor and Mayor generated alarm.
Many said the limits would exclude students who most need education -- the poor and immigrants from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe -- from an institution that has historically served as a path into the middle class.
"This is the destruction of CUNY as it has been and what it hopes to be," said Julius C. C. Edelstein, a former senior vice chancellor at the City University who helped develop its open admissions policy in the late 1960's. "For all of its shortcomings, City University is the social engine of the city, and the attempt to convert it into Swarthmore or Harvard is ridiculous and is not what people of New York need."
Equally fervent was reaction to the unusually direct intervention by the state and city's top political figures in university admissions -- usually a province of the governing board of trustees. Trustees said they were told the plan itself was drafted not by the board or the administration but by aides to the Mayor and Governor.
"Whether I agree or disagree about the particular issue of remediation, I am concerned about the whole issue of governance," said Ann Marcus, dean of the School of Education at New York University. "The idea that you get that kind of policy making from the board and from policy makers undermines the idea of the university. I don't know how you run a university like that."
But as higher education has become more politicized, CUNY and other public universities, especially California's, have become key to fundamental political debates.
"What we have is a pendulum that began to change direction with the call for national education standards, and now it's hitting the colleges," said Saul Cohen, a member of the New York State Board of Regents and a former president of Queens College at CUNY. "California has been on the front edge, and we have CUNY."
Bradford J. Race Jr., chief of staff to Governor Pataki, says that the involvement is not only appropriate but necessary.
"A significant amount of taxpayer resources go to the university," he said. "It is certainly appropriate that systemwide policies be decided after appropriate consultation with the Mayor and the Governor and other elected officials, including legislators. This is all about the quality of education CUNY is providing, and there is enough objective evidence we've seen in terms of graduation rates that suggest that the system is failing at least a significant number of students."
The involvement of Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani in a fundamental shift in university standards, while unusual, does have precedents at CUNY, said Henrik N. Dullea, vice president for university relations at Cornell University who served as assistant secretary for education and art under Gov. Hugh L. Carey.
In 1970, CUNY decided to adopt its open admissions policy, which, responding to minority demands, guaranteed a spot in the university system to any New York City high school graduate. And again in 1976, during New York City's budget crisis, when the state agreed to pick up most of the city's share of paying for CUNY's four-year colleges, political leaders intervened.
"That kind of involvement is unusual, in that it is not a day-to-day occurrence," Mr. Dullea said. "But when very large issues of structure arise, they were involved."
Despite such assurances, many faculty and students and others feel that CUNY's mission to take in students who have earned a high school degree or its equivalent is being attacked by political officials who are less concerned about education than about cutting spending and privatizing some of the functions of the university.
"It's scary; it's frightening," said Arthur Levine, president of Columbia Teachers College. "This is a political solution; it does not make sense educationally. This could do grave damage to students who are working their way through high school now. Some of them won't have the skill levels they say will be necessary to get into CUNY's colleges.
"The fact is that we need to do something about remedial education, which is expanding all over the country. But this is not the way to do it. The only people it holds accountable are the students."
Some students yesterday said the plan being offered by the Mayor and Governor singled CUNY students out unfairly because many of them are poor or members of minority groups.
"There are remedial courses in private colleges as well, but we're under attack because we're public," said Gisseeleen He, a 26-year-old architecture major at City College and a Manhattan resident. "This is very much about economic status."
Whether the Mayor and the Governor will manage to marshal enough of their trustees to vote for the plan at the end of May remains to be seen. Their appointees constitute the majority of the 17-member board. But some of them are known to oppose their plans. But Herman Badillo, a vice chairman of the board who introduced their plan, said, "I think we have the votes."
By Mr. Badillo's count, which is similar to that of some other trustees, the Mayor is likely to hold at least four of his five appointees, and the Governor is likely to carry four votes for certain and probably more. Nine votes are needed for passage.
In the meantime, many faculty, students, city and state legislators and others are looking for ways to try to fight the proposals.
Last night, the Committee for Public Higher Education, an umbrella group of about 50 city organizations, assembled for the first time in more than five years, to plot strategy. In an invitation letter signed by five organizers, including Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian and a longtime CUNY professor, the group said, "If we are to continue to educate the children of 'the whole people,' we must create a groundswell of support for CUNY."

HEADLINE: Democrats Fault Pataki on Education and the Economy

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Speaking almost in unison, four of the Democratic candidates seeking to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki assailed his economic and education policies last night, belittling his first-term tax cuts as a waste of money and attacking him for vetoing spending that would have gone to rebuilding public schools.
In a debate televised statewide from Rochester, the Democratic candidates disputed Mr. Pataki's upbeat depiction of the state he has led for three years, portraying New York instead as plagued by high unemployment and failing schools, and being run by a Republican unconcerned with those problems. 
 "Today in New York, there is no economic plan," James L. Larocca, a former State Transportation Commissioner, said in remarks that neatly summed up the Democratic case. "There is no plans to make plans. The Governor does not have an economic development strategy."
Richard A. Kahan, a former chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, said Mr. Pataki had spent his first three years "trying to cut taxes -- but the wrong ones, the ones that don't help the people who need them, the small businesses."
Mr. Larocca and Mr. Kahan, along with Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn, appeared for an hour at the first major event of what has so far been a strikingly low-profile Democratic gubernatorial contest. The forum, in which the candidates responded to questions from a panel of citizens and reporters, was broadcast across the state.
It included all but one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Mr. Pataki: Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the New York City Council. Mr. Vallone's aides said he had skipped the event because he had a previous commitment to preside over a New York City budget hearing in Queens.
As is typical in early debates, the candidates avoided any effort to distinguish themselves from one another. Other than Mr. Hynes, who repeatedly attacked what he described as Mr. Pataki's lax ethics and work habits, the candidates turned their attacks only on Mr. Pataki's policies.
All four candidates said they disagreed with Mr. Pataki's push to cut the personal income tax, describing it as a waste of money that could have otherwise gone to education or programs that might promote economic development in the state. "I think it's the worst tax that we could have cut -- and it's gotten the least results," Mr. Kahan said.
Ms. McCaughey Ross said the tax-cut program had done nothing to help the state's economy. "Ask any of the New Yorkers who have been laid off whether the reduction in the personal income tax worked," she said. Mr. Hynes described it as "another example of the hypocrisy that marks the Pataki administration."
Mr. Hynes said: "You just filed your state income tax. I'm sure you didn't see any great reduction, because you're not one of the top 10 percent in this state."
Similarly, the candidates said that Mr. Pataki had wasted money by giving tax breaks to large corporations without insuring that the companies expand their state operations in the state.
"The only economic development strategy this government has had is to give tax breaks to the wealthiest New Yorkers and the biggest companies," Mr. Larocca said. He advocated legislation that would force companies that had received tax breaks to repay the state if they reneged on a pledge to create jobs.
All four candidates urged a variety of additional spending on schools, day care and job training. Mr. Hynes, for example, called for more spending on remedial education, while Ms. McCaughey Ross again advocated universal pre-kindergarten programs as a way of insuring better classroom performance in later years. When it came to financing the spending, Mr. Kahan urged taking the money from the state's huge prison budget.
"We have 60,000 drug abusers in prison," Mr. Kahan said. If we put our efforts into reducing the prison population and we would save billions of dollars."
The candidates also attacked Mr. Pataki for vetoing $500 million in school construction, as part of $1.6 billion in vetoes of legislative spending he announced last week.

HEADLINE: Slight Increase in Rents Proposed

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In a hearing marked by little of the chaos and ear-splitting acrimony of years past, the Rent Guidelines Board recommended last night that landlords in New York City be able to charge slightly more for rent-stabilized apartments and lofts beginning in October.
If the recommendation is approved by the board in a final vote next month, tenants in the city's 900,000 rent stabilized apartments who renew their leases for one year will be charged 2 percent more and those who renew for two years will be charged 4 percent more. A $1,000 rent, for example, would increase to $1,020 under a one-year lease, meaning that the tenant would pay $240 more for the year. 
 The proposed increases are identical to those adopted by the board last year and come amid similar economic circumstances for owners: an annual survey released recently by the rent board found that the average cost of maintaining apartment buildings rose by only a tenth of a percent over the last year, thanks mostly to a drop in fuel oil prices.
Landlords generally applauded the proposal. But they also contended that the survey always underestimates the cost of running the city's aging buildings.
"It is, of course, a political decision. It doesn't do the job or make anyone really happy, but it doesn't make the bulk of the electorate unhappy."said Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association of 2,500 building owners.
The 30 or so tenants who attended the meeting hissed softly when the proposal was approved by a vote of 6 to 2. "At a time when their own numbers show that landlords' costs are not going up, why give them an increase?" asked Michael McKee, policy director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition.

HEADLINE: Stock Exchange On Wall Street Offered a Home In New Jersey

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange said last night that it had abandoned plans to expand its historic headquarters in lower Manhattan and that it had received an offer from New Jersey officials to build a $1 billion trading floor for the exchange in Jersey City.
Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, said remaining on Wall Street, where it has been since the Civil War, appeared to be "no longer viable" and that his first choice now would be a previously announced proposal to relocate to Battery Park City. 
 But he said that four New Jersey economic development officials met with him on Tuesday and "very energetically and enthusiastically put on the table" a set of initiatives that could prove "very economically rewarding."
"Our goal is to relocate in Manhattan," Mr. Grasso said. "At the same time, it is very important to recognize that we are a global business, and we have to position ourselves to capitalize on the growth that lies ahead."
Pete McDonough, chief spokesman for Governor Christine Todd Whitman, declined to comment on whether New Jersey was offering the stock exchange tax breaks and other incentives.
"It is our policy not to confirm or deny whether we are in negotiations with any business," Mr. McDonough said.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dismissed the exchange's announcement as a negotiating ploy, saying that he had an ironclad guarantee from Mr. Grasso that the exchange would stay in the city.
"The New York Stock Exchange will remain the New York Stock Exchange," Mr. Giuliani said on his monthly call-in program on WCBS-AM. "It will not be the New Jersey Stock Exchange. Everybody has negotiating positions and everything else. But I can remember the day that Richard Grasso sat in my office, shook my hand and said, 'We will never, ever move out of New York.' "
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, would not comment beyond saying, "It is the New York Stock Exchange and we are confident that it will continue to be the New York Stock Exchange."
Senior Whitman administration officials emphasized that New Jersey had not broken a no-poaching agreement reached with Mr. Giuliani in 1994 to help end the economic border war between the states.
Shortly after she was first elected, Governor Whitman pledged that New Jersey would not seek New York companies to move to New Jersey, and New York promised that it would not approach New Jersey companies to move to New York.
But Mrs. Whitman has repeatedly said that New Jersey would negotiate with chief executives from New York companies who contacted her administration about moving to the state. That seems to be the case with another New York institution, the New York Yankees, which Mrs. Whitman said she had not pursued; but she said she was willing to talk to the team about moving to New Jersey.
Stocks have been traded in lower Manhattan since 1792, when brokers and merchants agreed to trade securities on commission. With the bulls running and its quarters cramped, the exchange has demanded tax breaks and other incentives to help it expand. The possibility of a move to Battery Park City, disclosed by exchange officials last month, was a first step in ratcheting up the pressure.
Last night, Mr. Grasso said, "The first two words of our name are 'New York,' and the Mayor has been terrific."
He said the exchange wanted to build a pair of 50,000-square-foot trading floors. He said the plans for Battery Park City called for a complex of 1.2 million to 1.3 million square feet at a cost "north of $1 billion."
He said the plans for expanding across from the current headquarters involved a nine-story trading complex, including the two trading floors, at a cost of $700 million to $900 million. "That seems to be no longer viable," he said. The reasons he cited were the difficulty in acquiring the sites and opposition from neighborhood and preservationist groups.
Mr. Grasso said the New Jersey officials did not make a detailed offer, but they said the state would in essence finance construction of a similar complex in Jersey City.
The various financial markets may be as synonymous with New York as the theaters of Broadway, but their threats to decamp have kept Mr. Giuliani's aides busy ever since he took office in 1994. That year, the New York Mercantile Exchange flirted with a move to Jersey City, but was granted $184 million in subsidies to build in Battery Park City.
In 1995, city and state officials persuaded the board of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to cancel plans to move to New Jersey. At that time, remarks by the Mayor indicated that windfalls were to be had by exchanges that demanded them.
"It's important for New York City, within the balance of the things that we can negotiate, to retain these exchanges," he said.

Auto Giants Detail Deal, But Challenges Remain
Officials of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler made their $39 billion wedding official. They plan to form a global auto giant making luxury Mercedes-Benz cars as well as Cherokee Jeeps and Voyager mini-vans.
 
 But as executives of both companies shared their visions of a global automotive powerhouse, a range of challenges and uncertainties ahead became clear, both for the merged company and the rest of the automotive industry. Page A1.
 
Employees of Chrysler were stunned by news of the acquisition and expressed some fear for their jobs. But they also were upbeat about the prospects for the combined company. D5.

The Other Unemployed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The assertion that the Phillips curve does not explain current economic conditions (Week in Review, May 3) begs the question of why the model once meshed with the data and now fails. What changed is that unemployment figures no longer measure the unused labor supply. Downsized workers doing temporary jobs are tallied as "employed." Fifty-somethings face coerced retirement. Able workers idled too long by hiring biases like age are not counted as employable. Politicians insist these cases are anecdotal and non-quantifiable. Then they take credit for the low unemployment figures.

Fed's Outdated Model

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your May 2 Business Day article on the markets, an economist states the common belief that a slowing of the economy is needed to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has fostered the belief that our economy is driven by a demand-led business expansion with potential for an inflation upsurge. In reality, we are in an unprecedented technological revolution that is producing price stability and sustained rapid economic growth. 
 The Federal Reserve needs to construct an up-to-date model of the economy to test its policy concerns without throwing the real economy off track.

HEADLINE: SHAPING A GLOBAL GIANT: THE MULTINATIONALS;
Some Cross-Border Deals May Be Star-Crossed

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
They seem so smart and easy.
Certainly the acquisition by Daimler-Benz A.G. of the Chrysler Corporation makes cross-border mergers appear that way. But for all the excitement about that deal, such mergers -- in which a company in one country acquires a company in another -- never come without headaches, often big enough to swamp the benefits. 
 Even when the purchaser is welcomed with open arms, success is elusive. Last December, Merrill Lynch acquired 50 branch offices in Japan of Yamaichi Securities, which had failed, and the 2,000 brokers in those offices cheered their rescue from unemployment. But Merrill today is deep into the difficult process of retraining the brokers to American standards. That means, among other things, that when a favored client loses money, the broker can no longer give company funds to the client to cover the loss -- a not uncommon Japanese practice.
"It has only recently become acceptable to grow globally through acquisitions," said Stephen Blum, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, which acts as a consultant in many such deals. "Until two or three years ago, cross-border mergers were thought of as too risky."
Such deals completed last year totaled $320.5 billion, or more than double their value of $132.3 billion in 1994, according to the Security Data Company. United Nations data suggest that cross-border mergers have become the biggest single method of integrating the world's economies. Economists warn, however, that international investment data are too imprecise to draw firm conclusions.
The United States is one of the few countries that do have precise data. The Commerce Department reports that for 1995, the latest year available, foreign acquisitions of American companies represented $47.2 billion of the nearly $75 billion invested by foreign companies in plants and equipment here.
Still, given their druthers, corporations everywhere in the world seem to prefer mergers with companies of their own nationality, and within their own borders. Such mergers completed last year came to nearly $1 trillion, Security Data reported.
Nothing seems to draw companies into cross-border deals more than the prospect of gaining a big foothold, overnight, in another market. Departing from its usual practice of opening stores one at a time in countries like Argentina, Brazil and China, Wal-Mart last year acquired a 21-store supermarket chain in Germany from Wertkauf G.m.b.H. The chain has $1.4 billion in annual sales.
The Wertkauf stores, offering merchandise as well as food, are similar to Wal-Mart's format, but acclimating the company's 4,900 employees to Wal-Mart's ways could take more than a year, said Dale Ingram, a Wal-Mart spokesman.
"We are about to open those stores at 7 A.M. instead of 9, and see how the customers, and the employees, respond," Mr. Ingram said. Closing time, by law, is 8 P.M.
The Bridgestone Corporation of Japan sought to jump-start tire sales in the United States with the purchase of Firestone in 1988. But what the new owner got, said Richard Thomas, a community relations manager for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., were old factories with outdated equipment and employees who would not accept a 12-hour-a-day schedule, spread over three or four days a week, that it considered essential.
"Each day we were losing money, and the changes came slowly," Mr. Thomas said. Only after years of losses did Bridgestone/Firestone finally win acceptance of that work schedule and begin to make a profit in the United States. In the interim, the company and its workers had to endure a two-year strike that at one point prompted President Clinton to publicly rebuke Bridgestone/Firestone's Japanese managers.
"You take the good with the bad and work your way through it," Mr. Thomas said. "There is no alternative in most cross-border mergers."
Personality clashes can play big roles in such mergers, sometimes even killing them. That stopped a deal that would have created the world's largest pharmaceutical company, through a combination of Britain's SmithKline Beecham and the American Home Products Corporation, based in Madison, N.J. The talks collapsed in February, after Jan Leschly, 57, SmithKline's chief executive, insisted on becoming chairman of the merged company, a job that John R. Stafford, 60, American's chairman, also wanted.
Sweden's Volvo and France's Renault had planned to merge in 1993, creating a giant auto and truck manufacturing company, but frictions killed that deal, too -- friction between top management and among directors and investors.
Differing national views of how to run a business did in what would have been the biggest trans-Atlantic merger in history prior to this week's agreement between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.
In that doomed deal, British Telecom planned to acquire MCI Communications for $24 billion. MCI welcomed the merger. But the deal, announced in 1996, fell apart in 1997 over differing concepts of risk. British Telecom's shareholders objected to MCI's announcement that its incursion into local telephone service would result in an unplanned loss of hundreds of millions of dollars.
That reaction surprised Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's chairman. Whatever their qualms, American shareholders cannot deter MCI management "from a major strategic direction," he said, adding, "That's unheard of."
Other mergers, logically conceived, go through, only to fall on hard times. Hoping to sell more television sets in the United States by acquiring a popular brand name, LG Electronics Inc. of South Korea purchased a majority stake in Zenith in 1995, even though Zenith was unprofitable. The South Koreans expressed the hope that their low-cost manufacturing practices would turn Zenith around. But last month Zenith, still unprofitable, said it might seek bankruptcy protection soon.
Breaking into the American entertainment industry seemed essential to Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony when those two Japanese giants purchased MCA and Columbia Pictures, respectively, in the late 1980's.
Both sought entertainment "software" to run on their VCR's and other electronic hardware.
But both went on to have a terrible time trying to fathom Hollywood management practices. Matsushita finally gave up, selling MCA in 1995 to the Seagram Company. After losing billions of dollars, Sony appears to have solved its management problem.
And then there is the more common form of culture shock, the kind that can bring an abrupt halt to a traditional way of doing business.
That happened at Brooks Brothers, the upscale men's haberdashery chain, after it was acquired in the late 1980's by Britain's Marks & Spencer, a high-volume mass-market operation. Once-elegant stores soon shrank in size and became more crowded. And buying a suit increasingly meant receiving the coat or pants by mail order, and then returning to the store for alterations.
Perhaps that would have happened at Brooks even without the cross-border merger, said Jay Meltzer, director of Johnson Redbook Service, a retail operation.
"Many old-timers want service and a little ambiance when they shop," he said, "and modern retailers can't afford to do that."
Republicans are skeptical of this tone of apoliticism. They think Rubin uses it as a dodge for playing highly political games. Many are still nursing sores from the end of 1995 when he crushed their attempt to coerce Clinton to sign their budget by threatening default on the national debt. Rubin portrayed himself as appalled by this gambit, describing the threat that America would fail to meet its obligations as "unthinkable," and eventually winning an abject surrender.
In fact, Rubin is canny about politics. It is factored into his expected-value calculations as it has been since he was evaluating antitrust threats to mergers. He treats politics as a consideration in policy-making, but not as an overriding one. As friends note, he is truly chagrined when political considerations overwhelm sound decisions. One recent example was Rubin's objection to sweeping reform of the Internal Revenue Service, on which he eventually had to yield ground. Another, on which he has not yet surrendered, is his obstinate stance against a tax cut cast as an end to the "marriage penalty." Rubin even feels this way even about politics in other countries. Talking to him about Japan, you sense his dismay that the country's leaders are unwilling to take the risks necessary to reverse their country's economic decline -- the sorts of risks he thinks the Clinton Administration took with its economic strategy and then with Mexico.
By the time the Asian crisis hit last year, Rubin had already been thinking about potential problems in the region for some time. He raised concerns about the "frothiness" in Asian markets as early as April 1997. Capital was pouring in and he wondered whether foreign investors were discounting the "risk premium." But no one, Rubin included, was prepared for the consequences when Thailand, as Tim Geithner puts it, "fell of the cliff."
This time, Rubin had less discretion. After Mexico, Senator Alfonse D'Amato added an amendment to an appropriations bill that put conditions on Treasury's lending money without Congressional approval. Rubin could have gone to Congress. But he and Summers and Greenspan discussed it at one of their weekly breakfasts and agreed that it wasn't a good idea to commit American capital. While the danger of an Asian contagion was real, there was a risk of accentuating the "moral hazard," by saving investors from the consequences of their choices.
Rubin's response to any international crisis begins from a kind of Treasury Department corollary of the Powell Doctrine: If the U.S. cannot act decisively, we should not put our resources and credibility on the line. As Summers puts it, Rubin's consistent approach to the crisis has been "that there is something worse than Country X going down, which is Country X going down and taking our credibility and $10 billion of our money with it."
Those around Rubin point admiringly to the way he arrives at such a decision. He begins by gathering all the information he can, toting reams of reports and articles around in a pair of giveaway vinyl briefcases he picked up at a Finance Ministers' meeting in Japan a few years ago. He often reaches down several levels in the bureaucracy to find the person most knowledgeable about the problem at hand, which Treasury officials say his predecessor, Lloyd Bentsen, never did. Being nonhierarchical is something Rubin learned at Goldman, where senior partners trust junior ones to manage their money. He loves to ask questions and embodies the adage, which he sometimes repeats, that you learn more from listening than from talking.
"What so many people have a tendency to do is to lock into a scenario," Summers says. "What Rubin will say, at times to the frustration of others, is that some questions don't have answers -- which is to say that just because a problem is terrible, we don't have to act. It may not be the right time."
When an I.M.F. support program failed to take hold in Thailand, the upside
value of involvement and the risks of not intervening increased. In September, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines began to suffer currency and market declines. Rubin and his team worried that markets for U.S. exports would turn into cut-rate exporters of goods to the U.S., harming the economy and setting back the consensus in favor of free trade. They also feared a contagion beyond Asia. "You had Brazil close enough to the edge that they could have gone, and that would have created a greater risk that Mexico and Argentina would have gone," Geithner says. "And Russia, and everybody else."
Why if Indonesia catches a cold, do Brazil and Russia start sneezing? For one thing, there are financial relationships among emerging markets. Korean and Brazilian banks own Russian Treasury bonds, and in October began to unload them to raise cash. But the larger danger is psychological. Capital that rushes in can rush out just as quickly, a phenomenon Rubin remembers well from his days at Goldman, when the flows were a fraction of what they are today. Panic is a self-fulfilling prophecy, because capital flight fuels the insolvency it fears. Once the dominoes start falling, the only way to stop them is to change the psychology.
The seriousness of the problem was brought home in a series of meetings held in the office of White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles in October. Among those in attendance were the Secretaries of State and Defense. Concerns about South Korea were acute. If Korea failed, officials feared a spread to Brazil, one of the countries that held Korean debt, and a linchpin of the South American economy. Ultimately, they were worried about the potential for "a 1930's scenario" -- a worldwide depression accompanied by massive political instability. A consensus emerged that the U.S. could not stand by as disaster developed.
Ordinarily, the Departments of Treasury and State would fight to control policy at such a moment. But in part because Rubin, unlike many of his predecessors, does not aspire to be Secretary of State, State is not threatened by his encroachments on foreign policy. Another diplomatic advantage Rubin has brought to the situation is his unprecedented cordiality with the Fed chairman. Previous Administrations have tried to "jawbone" the Fed, nudging it to act or not act on interest rates; Rubin, though, has laid down the law from the first days in the Administration: no trifling with the Fed. This has muted the traditional rivalry between the Fed and Treasury bureaucracies.
Greenspan and Rubin and their deputies were all involved in hammering out the basic approach to the Asia crisis. It was developed on a flight to Hong Kong for the World Bank's annual meeting in September. By the time the plane landed, there was a strategy: the U.S. should lead the rescue, through the I.M.F. where possible, by providing conditional support. This approach, which was presented to Asian officials at a subsequent meeting in the Philippines, became known as "the Manila framework."
But the surveillance program put in place in Manila was a mixed blessing. In exchange for I.M.F. aid, the Koreans had to divulge information about their foreign-currency reserves. By mid-November, it was clear Korea was at risk of default. Treasury officials spent the days before Thanksgiving formulating a new financing package. The discussions continued through Thanksgiving Day in a marathon conference call composed of officials from Treasury, State and the N.S.C. (Around 6 in the evening, Rubin, Geithner, Summers and the others on the call decided to take a break and spend an hour with their families.)
The plan they eventually formulated was to support $57 billion in loans from the I.M.F., conditioned on the closure of insolvent banks and the shutting down of bankrupt chaebols, Korea's vertically integrated conglomerates. As Rubin recalled two months later on a flight to London, his view was that delay was crucial. "Buying time in these situations is very important, he said. Even if the effort in one or more of these countries was unsuccessful, if you could buy enough time, you greatly increase the likelihood that creditors and investors will distinguish among countries, and you greatly reduce the likelihood of contagion."
Near midnight on Thanksgiving night, Rubin, at his weekend house in Pound Ridge, N.Y., was on the phone with Clinton at Camp David, prepping him for calls to be put through to President Kim Young Sam in Seoul and Hashimoto in Tokyo. There was a delay in the call to Hashimoto, and Clinton was working a crossword puzzle, and asking Rubin for clues. Rubin, who does not do puzzles, passed a question to his son Jamie. "Who's so dumb they don't know that one?" Jamie asked.
"Actually," said Rubin, "it's the President."
The Thanksgiving fix didn't take. In the middle of a campaign, the Government of Kim Young Sam was unable to inspire confidence in its reforms. On the evening of Dec. 18, the day of the Korean election, Rubin convened a small dinner at the Jefferson. Foreign currency reserves in South Korea's banks were down to $9 billion, with a "drain rate" of $1 billion a day. In other words, the country would be in default by the end of the year. And for Korea to fail could be cataclysmic. Unlike Thailand and Malaysia, whose currencies had melted down months before, Korea had a vast economy in its own right -- the 11th-largest in the world, and 5th-largest among America's trading partners. "It was very, very dark," recalls Summers. "Money was pouring out of Korea. What could we do?"
There appeared to be only two choices, neither promising. The first was to let Korea fail and "try to save the rest of the world," as one of those who was at the three-hour dinner puts it. The other was to speed up loan payments from the I.M.F. and make available the so-called second line of defense -- $10 billion from the U.S. and other countries erected under the Manila framework as a final firebreak.
Summers and David Lipton, the Under Secretary of Treasury for international affairs, made the case for deploying the second line of defense. Geithner was the skeptic of the group, arguing for using I.M.F. money first and not committing American capital until there was more confidence it would improve the odds of success. Summers, whose intellect often has a cutting edge, ridiculed this incremental escalation as the "Vietnam" option. The debate was interrupted by the near-constant ringing of cell phones, and calls to the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, who was at the White House working out the wording for Clinton's congratulatory call to the new South Korean President, Kim Dae Jung.
When Rubin finally spoke, he emphasized the limits of America's influence. He wasn't persuaded that sending more money would be a decisive enough step to restore the confidence of international creditors and investors, who had poured capital into Korea as if it were a fixed fight, and were now fleeing as if it had become radioactive. At the end of the dinner, after one of his regular measured indulgences -- four scoops of cassis sorbet -- Rubin postponed the decision.
In this instance, his preference for optionality made the difference. In a conference call two days later, Summers, Geithner and Edwin Truman, a Fed official who works closely with them, came up with a third, more daring plan. The U.S. could try to "lever" the forbearance of the banks that held the bulk of the Korean debt. If international creditors would agree to extend their loans, U.S. officials would arrange to move forward the I.M.F. money, and make available a portion of their second line of defense if needed.
Discussion of this scheme continued as Under Secretary Lipton was dispatched to Seoul to impress the new President, Kim, with the need for financial reform and as Rubin left for a vacation in Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, where he goes bonefishing. It was shaping up as another ruined holiday. "I brought my rods, but I didn't get to go fishing at all," he says. Instead he spent his vacation on the phone.
The situation was immensely delicate because Treasury officials felt they could not be in the position of forcing private banks to change the terms of market loans they had made. "It had to be voluntary," Rubin says. "Because if it was involuntary, then the fear was that they would all say, Well, we're doing this here, we've got to pull back from every other place, and you could set off the very contagion you were afraid of." Three days of back-to-back international conference calls culminated in a four-hour conversation with William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The plan was for McDonough to talk to the main American creditors while his central-bank counterparts in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Paris held synchronized conversations with bankers in their countries.
The orchestration had to be perfect, and it was. Banks in all five countries agreed to reschedule their Korean debt in the hope of eventually getting repaid in full. President Kim responded positively to the stringent conditions attached to American help, telling Lipton he intended to press ahead with reform, even if it meant layoffs and social unrest. The announcement of the second Korean rescue plan on Christmas Eve
created a pivot in the crisis. By New Year's Day, the Korean stock market and the won had stabilized. Other emerging markets calmed as well. And for the next six months at least, the worst fears about a panic overtaking the world economy subsided.
The situation eased enough that in January, Rubin paused to consider the crisis as a whole. At a speech at Georgetown he tried to assess it. "Foreign investors injected an extraordinary amount of capital into these flawed systems without due weighting of the risks involved," he said. In other words, investors hadn't included a risk premium in their analysis. "I would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor," he continued, bubbling with contempt for such sloppy thinking. "Unfortunately, there was no way to restore growth and stability without sheltering some investors."
It is possible that the I.M.F. alone could have kept Korea from default. Or that Korea would have defaulted, but not spread contagion. Or that the panic might have spread, but been perversely beneficial to the U.S. -- slowing G.D.P. growth a few tenths of a percentage point and further calming inflation fears, and easing the economy into another "soft landing." Whatever its negative effects, a Korean default would certainly have cured the "moral hazard" problem Rubin discussed -- that by bailing out investors, you encourage them to pour hot money into new speculative bubbles.
In other words, there is no way of knowing if the fact that the Asian economic crisis has not yet ended the long boom in the United States is the result of the Treasury Secretary's extraordinary skill, or sheer luck. If the crisis subsides, Rubin may yet have a chance to try to expand programs like Head Start and Pell grants, and advance the cause of some new ones he has in mind, like individual investment accounts -- I.R.A.'s for poor people. But Rubin understands better than anyone that despite his best efforts, what began with a devaluation in Thailand may yet bring the boom to an unceremonious close.
"We're dealing with issues now the world has never dealt with before," he says. "We're dealing with a multiple of countries in trouble at the same time, where the investors and creditors are not just a limited number of banks, but a vast array of individuals and institutions. That combination has never existed, so by definition you're dealing with much more difficult judgments, and much less clarity as to the probabilities of things.
"Luck or skill?" he muses. "We'll never know." On this note, conversation drifts back to Gus Levy and the banter he and Rubin used to swap on the Goldman trading floor. "Gus used to say that it's better to be lucky than to be smart," Rubin says. "And I used to say to Gus, it seemed indispensable to be lucky, but it wasn't so bad to be smart either, if you could arrange both."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 20, 1998, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 8 about the difficulties involved in border-crossing mergers referred incorrectly to the relationship between Merrill Lynch & Company and Yamaichi Securities of Japan. Merrill is taking over Yamaichi's office leases and is hiring its employees, but it is not acquiring the company. The article also misstated the number of Yamaichi branches that Merrill is taking over. It is 33, not 50. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.
A picture caption on page 25 of The Times Magazine today, with an article about Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, misidentifies the man at Mr. Rubin's right. He is Edward S. Knight, the Treasury's general counsel, not Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.

HEADLINE: Of the Turmoil In Indonesia And Its Roots

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
When jetloads of pinstriped Western bankers descended on Indonesia last year to demand that President Suharto salvage his battered economy by shutting down the business monopolies held by his children, one of America's most influential anthropologists was not surprised that he balked.
Prof. Clifford Geertz said that in the tradition-laden culture of the central Indonesian island of Java -- home to more than half the population of that vast archipelago nation, and President Suharto's birthplace -- parents dote on their children in ways that other societies would consider indulgent, even excessive. 
 "Javanese children are spoiled," said Mr. Geertz of the Institute for Advanced Study, whose books include "The Social History of an Indonesian Town" and "The Religion of Java." "In Java, there is a tremendous amount of protection from the father. If he doesn't do that, then he would be no good as a father."
Of course, excessive fatherly love is not the sole reason for Mr. Suharto's refusal to break up a multibillion-dollar business empire controlled by his six rapacious children. The President, who has ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than 30 years and has been accused of using murder and torture to quash dissent, has never responded well to international criticism.
Yet while bankers, economists and diplomats have spent much of the last year trying to make sense of Indonesia's turmoil, scrutinizing everything from its financial institutions to its byzantine political structure, many have failed to look closely at the often misunderstood culture of Indonesia in trying to find a way to resolve the crisis peacefully.
An Indonesian specialist who is considered by many of his peers to be the leading anthropologist of his generation, Mr. Geertz said he worried that the International Monetary Fund and the other Western institutions were so misreading Javanese culture that they could turn a desperate situation in that nation of 210 million people into a dangerous one.
The collapse of the Indonesian currency, which has lost more than two-thirds of its value over the last year, and the corresponding rise in the price of basic commodities like rice and cooking oil have set off street riots in Jakarta and on dozens of colleges campuses.
Several people were killed in clashes with the Government's security forces this week and thousands were injured in rioting yesterday. Many of the demonstrators have demanded the ouster of Mr. Suharto, who has no history of tolerating dissent and is thought ready to use even more violence to stem the protests.
"I think they don't understand," Mr. Geertz said of those in the I.M.F.. "I don't think that someone who has been trained as a financial whiz can go to Indonesia and immediately grasp the situation. I've worked on it for years, and I wouldn't claim to grasp the situation."
Mr. Geertz said that when Mr. Suharto rebuffed the International Monetary Fund last year and refused to close down many of his children's business operations -- they control everything from toll roads to communications satellites -- he was able to draw on centuries of Javanese tradition. Even if that threatened the collapse of an economy that had once been his proudest achievement.
From the windows of his spacious office at the institute, Mr. Geertz (rhymes with "hurts") stares out over an especially leafy corner of the institute's campus -- a grove of sun-dappled trees sways in a gentle spring breeze -- and insists that he can only guess at the extent of the chaos half a world away on the muggy streets of Jakarta, the steamy, smog-shrouded Indonesian capital.
But from what this 71-year-old anthropologist has read and seen from a distance about Indonesia's economic collapse and the reaction of the public to the turmoil, it all seems very familiar, and very Javanese.
"It's not a matter of everybody in Java is exactly the same or that they all have some sort of Javanism in them that essentially determines what they do," he said, seated with his back to a collection of toothy Javanese tribal masks gathered on his travels. "But the way things are going on in that country, at least from afar, it does not seem unfamiliar to me." Mr. Geertz began his career in the 1950's with field studies on village life in Java.
His first bit of advice to Western bankers and economists is one often given to first-time visitors to Indonesia: avoid confrontation with the Javanese, who are trained from infancy to avoid direct personal encounters that might force a display of anger or other emotion, even within their own families.
Among the Javanese, it is unimaginable rudeness to point out another's mistakes. The language reinforces this heightened sense of civility, with elders and leaders addressed in a "higher," more formal style of Javanese.
"There is this pattern of politeness," he said. "The whole thing is to dampen your feelings, to remain detached and calm and quiet. The Javanese usually don't express emotion.
"I've lived in both Indonesia and Morocco, and the difference is that if a Moroccan doesn't like you, you know it in about two minutes. In Indonesia, it would take two years for you to figure that the guy you've been living next to hates you and has hated you since the first day he saw you. And you may never know."
So when the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration dispatched high-ranking delegations of bankers and economists to demand that Mr. Suharto comply with terms of the Western rescue plan, Mr. Geertz says, they created the impression among Indonesians that the West was eager to humiliate the only national leader most Indonesians have ever known.
The image was captured most starkly at a news conference in Jakarta in January, when television cameras whirled as Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F., stood sternly over Mr. Suharto with his arms folded as the Indonesian leader signed an interim rescue agreement.
The image of the fund's appearing to dictate the bailout terms to Mr. Suharto shocked many Indonesians and brought a political backlash against the fund, emboldening the Government to ignore many of the conditions placed on the $43 billion aid program.
If the I.M.F. had been more subtle in its dealings with the Indonesian leader, "they might have gotten what they wanted from the start," Mr. Geertz said, adding: "But I guess you don't expect that from economists."
Mr. Geertz said that in the midst of the worst crisis of his rule, Mr. Suharto was playing a difficult hand reasonably well: "It's unwise to underestimate the man."
Mr. Suharto's strategy in dealing with the economic crisis has become increasingly clear, and alarming to his friends in the West. For decades, he accepted the counsel of American-trained economists who urged him to open his markets and rely on low-technology industries like garment-making. "He did everything they wanted him to," Mr. Geertz said. But now, Mr. Suharto has decided to abandon much of their counsel.
He has instead adopted the rhetoric of fierce nationalism and has appointed a new vice president who is anathema to most Western economists because of his unconventional and occasionally bizarre economic theories. He has placed his eldest daughter in the Cabinet as minister of social welfare and has not dampened speculation that he intends to create a Suharto dynasty by naming her his successor.
"Suharto is suddenly a radical nationalist," Mr. Geertz said. "I think radical nationalism is a deep strain in Javanese lives, and he's trying to tap it."
Mr. Geertz said he was struck by the comparisons that could now be made between Mr. Suharto and his charismatic predecessor, President Sukarno, whose fiery nationalistic oratory helped win Indonesia its independence in 1949 and kept him in power for almost 15 years, even if his economic mismanagement almost bankrupted the country.
"It's eerie," the anthropologist said. "It's like a re-enactment. This really looks like the last days of Sukarno, if not the very last, somewhere near the end."
Mr. Geertz is careful to insist that he does not predict that Indonesia will experience the sort of violence that swept the nation when Mr. Suharto came to power in 1965, "the year of living dangerously," in the words of Mr. Sukarno, when more than half a million people were killed in an anti-Communist pogrom.
But he said he did see troubling similarities between the chaos of the mid-1960's and that of today. And if there is violence, it could come without warning, given the seeming opaqueness of the Javanese. "With the Javanese, you don't see the violence coming until it happens," Mr. Geertz said. "Once this politeness and deference and controlled demeanor collapse, then all hell breaks loose."

HEADLINE: U.N. Lifts Travel Ban on Iraqis Without Objection From U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration offered no objections in the Security Council today when a travel ban on Iraqi officials was ended, but the United States and Russia are still at an impasse over when and how to respond to a report last month that in effect declared Iraq free of nuclear weapons.
The travel ban had never actually been imposed, and American officials said the step was not significant. But the Administration fought hard and long last fall to win Security Council backing for the measure, which would have restricted international travel for top Iraqis responsible for a lack of cooperation with the arms inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission. 
 Only after Iraq blocked investigations entirely by ordering American inspectors out of the country was the United States able, in November, to get the ban approved, at least in principle. But a list of those to whom it would apply was apparently never drawn up. Then the crisis over arms inspections this year intervened.
Next week the Security Council is expected to debate the larger issue of how to respond to the nuclear report, submitted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russia has argued that Iraq should be moved immediately to a system of more routine long-term monitoring from the current regular and often more intrusive inspections and destruction of prohibited equipment. The United States wants to put off any change in Iraq's status until October, when the next major sanctions review takes place.
Iraqis have begun to criticize Russia and France for not being more successful at starting the process of easing sanctions now that cooperation with inspectors has improved. Iraq owes Russia billions of dollars, which Moscow would like to recoup from the proceeds of resumed Iraqi oil sales.
European and Asian diplomats describe the Americans as absolutely inflexible on the issue of the nuclear report. Some envoys fear that without at least small rewards, Iraq will revert to obstructive behavior.
Today's automatic lifting of the travel ban followed a letter to the Council from Richard Butler, executive chairman of the Special Commission. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, had requested a report on recent Iraqi compliance from Mr. Butler.
Mr. Butler said in his letter that Iraq had been providing full access to his inspectors since Feb. 23, when Secretary General Kofi Annan signed an agreement with the Iraqi leadership, and that Baghdad was entitled to a rescinding of the threat of travel restrictions.
Iraq remains under a total economic embargo until Mr. Butler has declared it free of biological and chemical weapons and long-range missile systems.
An American group of more than 90 people arrived in Iraq from Jordan and Syria on Thursday to protest American backing of the sanctions by delivering about $4 million in medical aid to Baghdad. The delegation is led by Ramsey Clark, a former Attorney General in the Johnson Administration, and Thomas J. Gumbleton, a retired Roman Catholic bishop from Detroit.
The Americans, calling themselves the Iraq Sanctions Challenge, said in a statement on Tuesday before leaving New York that "the U.S.-U.N. sanctions are a violation of international law."
"Their intent is the destruction of the a whole population," said the statement. Advocates of the protest say the American-backed sanctions have killed 1.5 million Iraqis since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
An article in the current Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists questions this and other figures, including some from the United Nations, which are considered by a number of experts to be too high and too reliant on information provided by Baghdad. The authors of the article, George A. Lopez and David Cortright, say "estimates of more than a million deaths are almost certainly exaggerated."
"The numbers are still horrifying, though -- perhaps in the range of 200,000 deaths of all ages," they wrote. "This is an appalling tragedy."

HEADLINE: Get Tough With Japan (Phase 2)

BYLINE: By Daniel K. Tarullo; Daniel K. Tarullo, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently resigned as assistant to the President for international economic policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan was armed with charts and graphs when he visited the White House last year. He intended to rebut American fears that an increase in Japan's consumption tax, loaded onto an already fragile economy, would crush any chance for growth.
The unusual step of handing out economic analyses in such a meeting symbolized the denial and delay that have dug the Japanese economy into a deep hole. 
 Just last month, Mr. Hashimoto finally offered a package of temporary tax cuts and public spending to stimulate the economy, and he has begun a campaign at home and abroad to sell the program. But these belated stimulus measures alone will not produce sustained growth. Japan's problems are much more complex. Absent permanent financial reform and deregulation of its domestic markets, Japan will remain a drag on Asia and the world economy.
That point should be impressed on Japan at the annual meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations next weekend in Birmingham, England.
Having participated in these summit meetings over the past several years, I worry that the generally collegial atmosphere will tempt officials of the United States and other countries to give their embattled Japanese counterparts a pat on the back for the stimulus package, without pushing hard enough for further action.
This would be a mistake. The Japanese public is not satisfied. Japanese markets are not satisfied. Japan's economic partners should not be satisfied either.
Given how much Japan has to lose from inaction, outside prompting should be unnecessary. After all, growth has been negligible for much of the 1990's. Unemployment is at a 40-year high. And Japan's downturn has hurt other Asian countries, which depend on Japan to import their products and invest in their economies. As a result, Japan has ceded some regional prestige to China, which by maintaining the value of its currency helped stabilize the Asian crisis.
Unfortunately, Japan is hemmed in by its own politics. When he first came to power in 1996 Mr. Hashimoto tried to break the old mold of a weak prime minister caught in party politics and overpowered by government bureaucracy. But he has lost momentum and is boxed in by the old system.
Other countries cannot be expected to stand by as their own interests are endangered. After all, in the 1980's, Japan, Germany and other nations readily criticized the United States for the risks its large budget deficits posed to the global economy. Uncomfortable as foreign criticism may be for the Japanese, it is essential to press them not only to stimulate their economy, but also to clean up their shaky financial system and to truly deregulate their economy.
The United States has been warning Japan for a year and a half of the risks it poses to the world economy. Asian and European countries have joined the chorus. Yet Japan has taken only the first step toward righting itself.
Patience has its virtues, but so too does firmness, particularly with a country that, unlike its Asian neighbors, has the resources to solve its own problems. Now is not the time to stand down.

HEADLINE: Rome Journal;
Agony Lingers, 20 Years After the Moro Killing

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, May 8

 BODY:
On May 9, 1978, the bullet-riddled body of a former Prime Minister, Aldo Moro, was found in the trunk of a car in central Rome, 55 days after he was kidnapped by members of the Red Brigades. Twenty years later, the anniversary is being marked with an orgy of national brooding.
"It has been 20 years, and still the deeper truth has not come out," said Marco Baliani, 47, an actor-playwright whose one-man show about the Moro case is to be shown live on Italy's second largest state network on Saturday night. "How can we found a new republic if we cannot tell the truth to ourselves?" 
 Like the Kennedy assassination in the United States, the killing of so powerful a political figure remains an obsession for Italians, who view it both as a national trauma that marked the end of innocence for an entire postwar generation, and as a dark conspiracy that remains veiled.
After hundreds of books, a parliamentary investigation that has dragged on for 10 years, five completed trials and a sixth that is about to begin, Italians are so bitterly consumed with the missing pieces that even on the 20th anniversary they overlook a larger irony that was unimaginable only five years ago.
Giulio Andreotti, 79, the wily, powerful politician who was Prime Minister seven times, including the period of the Moro crisis, is currently on trial in Perugia on charges that he conspired to order the killing of a journalist investigating, among other things, an alleged cover-up of the Moro case. Mr. Andreotti's refusal to negotiate with his colleague's captors is one of the more examined mysteries in the case.
All of the 23 Red Brigades terrorists who were convicted of collusion in Moro's slaying, and that of his five bodyguards, have either completed their sentences, or are in lenient home-arrest or work-release programs. Mario Moretti, 52, the most senior Red Brigades leader, who admits he was the one to shoot Moro, commutes four days a week from his Milan prison cell to a computer programming job that pays $850 a month.
And Italian society, so torn in the hate-filled 1970's that the Andreotti Government imposed special laws to combat terrorism and social unrest, is now serenely united on at least one point: The full story behind the crime has not yet been told.
The only prominent dissenters are Mr. Andreotti and his closest aides, some former Red Brigades terrorists who still resist the notion that they were unwittingly manipulated by sinister right-wing forces, and an American scholar, Richard Drake, who wrote a 1995 book that concluded that there was no conspiracy. Mr. Drake's book was widely disparaged in Italy.
The morning of his abduction on March 16, Aldo Moro, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, was on his way to Parliament to usher in the first Italian Government to be actively supported by the Communist Party -- the so-called historic compromise that he had arranged.
Mr. Andreotti refused to make concessions to the terrorists to save Moro. The Italian police and secret services were unable to rescue him, and their stunning display of incompetence was quickly interpreted as deliberate. To this day, most Italians believe that Moro died because the powers-that-were had reasons not to keep him alive.
"On this anniversary I live the need to in some way understand what really happened," said Alberto Franceschini, 50, who, as one of the founders of the Red Brigades, should know. Arrested in 1974, he got out of prison in 1992 and now works at a foundation that distributes European grants to Italian unemployment programs.
Mr. Franceschini said that his comrades had definitely killed Moro, but that they might not have acted alone.
"I don't know whose hands were behind the scenes, Andreotti's or Nixon's," he said. "But I know we were part of a much larger game."
As shown in its fascination with the killings at the Vatican this week, Italy has always been deeply attached to conspiracy theories. For the last 55 days, Italian radio, television, newspapers and magazines have overflowed with interviews, documentaries and debates about the Moro case. News footage of Moro's body in the car trunk has been replayed over and over like the Zapruder film of Dallas.
At least a dozen books about the Moro case and its mysteries have been published this month. It is not quite "Boogie Nights" nostalgia; young people throughout Europe in the 1970's were more preoccupied with dissent than disco. Rather, it is one generation's morbid fascination with its own tumultuous history.
And one reason for the media storm is that the generation of baby boomers who two decades ago wore Palestinian scarves, threw firebombs and at least for a while sided with the Red Brigades are now middle-aged network executives and publishers who shape public opinion.
"I didn't want to do another journalistic chronicle of the case," Mr. Baliani explained. "I wanted to tell the story thorough my own personal experience -- and that of so many people like me."
A counterculture actor at the time, he begins his tale by describing his feelings of "euphoria" over the news of Moro's kidnapping, and traces the bitter disenchantment and horror he felt at his death.
His televised tribute to the case on Saturday is viewed as so momentous that for the first time, the Italian Ministry of Culture permitted filming in one of Rome's most ancient ruins, the Forum of Augustus. The setting was irresistible.
"We wanted to make the connection to classical tragedy," Mr. Baliani said. "The death of Moro is the classic drama of our age -- tragic, yet squalid."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Market Gains on Jobs Data In Spite of a Mixed Outlook

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday, but market analysts were uncertain about what data in the April employment report touched off the rally.
The new jobs data may have comforted investors by allaying fears of an imminent interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. Or the report may have touched off a rally only because there were not too many unpleasant surprises and the market had, after all, fallen sharply in the previous three days. 
 The steady growth reflected in the jobs report could normally be positive for stocks because growth translates into sales and profits. But Fed policy makers have indicated recently that they are leaning toward a rate increase unless the economy slows enough to dampen their concerns about inflation.
Unfortunately, several analysts said, the jobs data did not provide clear answers about the outlook for growth and inflation and, therefore, the outlook for Fed policy.
The surprising decline in the unemployment rate, to 4.3 percent, must be adding to Fed worries about rising wage pressures. And the increase of 262,000 in new jobs, while matching Wall Street forecasts, is not yet indicating that the economy is slowing to a pace that would ease the central bank's inflation fear.
At the same time, the job numbers showed the third consecutive monthly decline in manufacturing jobs, which some analysts took as a sign that the economic turmoil in Asia was beginning to have an effect as American exports decline. Some 16,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since January, ending a string of rapid growth since September.
"The data continue to make life hard," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. He is forecasting an economic slowdown that will be enough to keep the Fed from raising interest rates. The manufacturing data, falling exports and the huge increase last quarter in company inventories make him think the drag from Asia is coming.
At the same time, he has been confounded by a much stronger than expected run-up in consumer spending, which has kept the economy moving ahead briskly into the second quarter.
Robert V. DiClemente, the chief United States economist with Salomon Smith Barney, is also noting the manufacturing slowdown and said that "we are not at the flash point yet" of a Fed rate increase. Fed policy makers next meet on May 19.
But he is worried that the strength of consumer spending may persist, which would be enough to force the Fed to act later in the year. And he is watching the rise in hourly earnings, which were up 4.4 percent for the year through April, and the recent slowdown in earnings. The fall in earnings can indicate that wage increases are eating into profits rather then reflecting increased productivity. This would worry the Fed.
"Since price inflation has been minimal and domestic profit margins firm, productivity appears to have accelerated sufficiently last year to damp increases in unit labor costs," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in January. "How long that pattern can continue is still an unresolved issue."
The bond market did help stocks yesterday by holding relatively steady for most of the day in the face of the surprisingly steep drop in the unemployment rate. The other important figures, the number of jobs added to payrolls and a 4-cent increase in hourly earnings, were in line with expectations.
"The fact that the bond did not blow through 6 percent helped," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
But bond prices dipped in the afternoon, which appeared to set off some stock selling. The price of the 30-year bond fell 10/32, to 10 23/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.97 percent from 5.95 percent. A week ago, the yield was at 5.93 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up as much as 119 points, finished at 9,055.15, up 78.47 points, or almost nine-tenths of 1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index did better than the Dow, rising 13 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,108.14. It was as high as 1,111.42. The Nasdaq index did even better, jumping 1.6 percent, or 29.23 points, to 1,864.37.
Drug, computer system and health care stocks drove the S.& P. 500 higher. The Dow was led by I.B.M., up 2 7/8, to 120; Merck & Company, up 2 7/8, to 117 7/8, and American Express, up 21/16, to 101 11/16. The Nasdaq moved higher on a sharp rebound by Microsoft, up 2 3/8, to 85 3/4, although the Justice Department indicated again yesterday that it might file an antitrust suit that could halt the distribution of Windows 98.

HEADLINE: Some on Wall St. See Buffett's Hand in Bond Sales

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Is Warren E. Buffett selling part or all of his huge position in zero-coupon Treasury bonds? That is the question bond traders across Wall Street are asking, as huge sell orders pour in on the same long-term Treasury issues that Mr. Buffett owns.
It is Mr. Buffett's policy not to comment on any trades he may be making. And one trader reports that Mr. Buffett's people say they are not selling any of the roughly $20 billion in zero-coupon bonds purchased last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Mr. Buffett's investment company. But such a response would be typical for any large investor interested in keeping his strategies under wrap. 
 Zero-coupon bonds are obligations of the United States Treasury that pay no interest but are bought at a deep discount to their value at maturity, or so-called face value. The bonds inch up in price as they get closer to maturity. But their prices also move much more rapidly than interest-bearing bonds when interest rates change.
Bond traders are speculating that Mr. Buffett may be selling because of the size of the trades and the particular issues involved. In the last couple of weeks, some $5 billion face value of the 2020 and 2021 maturities that Mr. Buffett owns have been sold, an enormous amount to be concentrated in just a couple of issues.
In an attempt to keep the trades quiet, perhaps, bond traders say the sell orders are going to only one Wall Street firm, Credit Suisse First Boston. Spreading the trades to firms up and down the Street would draw attention.
If Mr. Buffett is getting out of bonds, he is not alone. Bond traders have seen waves of selling in recent days as pension funds, insurance companies and money managers fret about a possible rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.
David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said that although the Fed is holding steady at the moment, the longer-run picture looks bearish for bonds.
Yesterday's report of a historically low unemployment rate in April and Thursday's report on productivity and unit labor costs both indicate that wage pressures are building in the United States.
Employment costs are an inflation signal that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, watches closely.
In the first quarter productivity rose only two-tenths of 1 percent, versus 1.4 percent in the last quarter of 1997. Unit labor costs rose 3.8 percent.
Mr. Buffett certainly has enormous profits in his zero-coupon trade.
Since the beginning of the year, long-term bonds have risen in price around 50 basis points, or one-half of one percentage point.
If Mr. Buffett has sold one-quarter of his position in the last three weeks, as one bond trader suspects, then his profits for the last few months could exceed $100 million. Not a bad trade for a man who until recently was famously bond averse.

HEADLINE: U.S. Dispatches Its Balkans Mediator With a Warning to the Serbs

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Fearful that fighting along Yugoslavia's southern border is about to erupt into a full-scale war, the Clinton Administration has sent the architect of the Bosnian peace agreement to warn President Slobodan Milosevic of the consequences of the recent violence.
Administration officials said that the American Balkans mediator, Richard C. Holbrooke, and President Clinton's special representative to the Balkans, Robert S. Gelbard, will travel to Belgrade this weekend. They will press Mr. Milosevic to end the fighting in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms what remains of Yugoslavia. 
 "Holbrooke and Gelbard will go in with a stiff warning that the United States regards the situation in Kosovo as dangerous not just to Yugoslavia but to all of its neighbors," said an Administration official involved in American policy in the Balkans who insisted on anonymity. "If Milosevic wants to end Yugoslavia's isolation, he'd better be listening."
It is not clear whether any warning to Belgrade will be enough to prevent the situation in Kosovo from spinning out of control and drawing Albania and other nations in the region into the fighting.
In recent weeks President Milosevic has sent troops and paramilitary forces into Kosovo to put down protests by the province's ethnic Albanian majority, which is seeking greater autonomy -- if not independence -- from the Serb-dominated Government of Yugoslavia. Scores of ethnic Albanians have been killed in the clashes, which have raged along Kosovo's southern border with Albania.
Administration officials said the decision to send Mr. Holbrooke, a former Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and the central negotiator of the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended the civil war in Bosnia, was meant to suggest to Mr. Milosevic that the situation is dire.
"Nobody delivers a threat like Holbrooke, and I mean that as a compliment," a State Department official said.
Last week the United States and five of its allies imposed new economic sanctions on Yugoslavia to protest against its handling of the crisis in Kosovo, and they threatened further action if the Yugoslavs did not agree to negotiate with the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.

Charges Lifted for 14 Bosnian Serbs
 THE HAGUE, May 8 (Reuters) -- The United Nations war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said today that it had withdrawn charges against 14 Bosnian Serbs.
It said the charges stemmed from offenses at the Serb-run Keraterm and Omarska prison camps in northwestern Bosnia. The chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, said the tribunal acted in order to focus its efforts on more senior officials and those responsible for exceptionally brutal offenses.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse First Boston Settles Suit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
Credit Suisse First Boston agreed today to pay $52.5 million to Orange County, becoming the first securities company to settle litigation stemming from the California county's 1994 bankruptcy.
The settlement could serve as a model for other firms to settle as well, although one lawyer said today that he did not believe there were any other substantive settlement talks under way. 
 In a settlement announced last month, the law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, which served as the county's bond counsel, agreed to pay $45 million to the county and an additional $10.2 million to a county community college district.
Orange County, which is just south of Los Angeles, sued nearly 20 securities firms, plus the LeBoeuf law firm, its accounting firm and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit-rating agency, seeking more than $2 billion in damages. The county contended that they were responsible for risky investments that resulted in losses of more than $1.6 billion, leading to the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history.
The main target of the litigation is Merrill Lynch & Company, which was most heavily involved with the county's finances. Credit Suisse First Boston sold only about 4 percent of the securities that led to the county's losses. But the firm played a prominent role in other types of transactions.
Jim Mercer, a lawyer for the county, called today's agreement "a significant settlement from a defendant that's not one of our primary defendants." Mr. Mercer, who is with the Los Angeles law firm of Hennigan, Mercer & Bennett, added, "Up until now, there has been a united front" among the brokerage firms.
Jan Mittermeier, the chief executive of Orange County, said she was pleased with the settlement. "It's good to see those who are culpable admitting their responsibility," she said in a statement. "This is a positive indicator for future litigation results."
Credit Suisse First Boston did not admit responsibility but rather maintained today that it acted "professionally and responsibly" in its relations with Orange County. "But, given the magnitude of the county's losses and the fact that litigation is unpredictable and distracting for any firm, this settlement is the right course of action," Allen Wheat, chief executive, said in a statement. "This chapter is now closed."
Credit Suisse First Boston, which is owned by the Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland, was also the first company sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Orange County bankruptcy. In January, the company and two former employees agreed to pay $870,000 to settle Federal charges that the company had not properly informed investors of the risks associated with a county bond offering it underwrote.
Credit Suisse First Boston might seem an unusual choice for a settlement because the lawsuit against it was toward the back of the queue and so far from a court date that it was virtually dormant. But the county approached the company a few weeks ago, apparently because the two had had discussions in the past that indicated Credit Suisse First Boston might be amenable to a settlement, according to attorneys. The company decided to settle to remove its potential exposure to huge amounts of damages. The settlement is subject to court review.
But if today's agreement serves as a benchmark for other settlements, it could mean the county would go a long way toward collecting its $2 billion in damages.
The trial against the main defendant, Merrill Lynch, is scheduled to start on Sept. 15. In a separate legal proceeding, Merrill agreed last year to pay the county $30 million to stave off possible criminal charges. The company has also acknowledged it is being investigated by the S.E.C.
The money collected by the Orange County Litigation Fund, which now totals $126.5 million, will be distributed to school districts and other government entities that contributed to Orange County's investment pool, which made the risky investments.
Orange County's treasurer and assistant treasurer of that time were sentenced to prison terms. The county, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1996, has not yet recouped its losses from the failed investments. But the area is thriving economically, with very low unemployment and a growing high-technology industry.

HEADLINE: Making Battery Park A Place to Linger

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
It is a fort that never saw battle, an immigrant way station that came and went before Ellis Island, and New York City's most heavily trafficked park, given over almost entirely to visitors from out of town.
Once known simply as the Battery, it is ground zero in New York history: the city began there. But nearly four centuries later, it is known to most residents only as the place to stand in line for ferryboats to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. 
 Now, in a tenacious effort to restore Battery Park as a monument and public space used as something besides a congested transfer point, a private group is trying to renovate and redesign the 23 acres of greenery, statuary and wind-swept harbor vistas at the southern tip of Manhattan.
The project, to be announced today by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, would provide the next installment in a series of major initiatives to create and improve parks along Manhattan's Hudson River shoreline, from the Battery to 72d Street. The renovation is being planned a year after Battery Park City, the park's neighbor to the north, completed a 10-year landscaping and construction project that has resulted in 24 acres of lawns, waterfront esplanades, playgrounds and performance spaces.
"These projects reflect a primeval feeling we all share, that where there is water there should be park," said Henry J. Stern, the city's Parks Commissioner. "They also reflect the realization that first-rate parks need a substantially greater level of support than the city can provide on its own."
Despite the encouragement of the Mayor and his aides, and an injection so far of more than $6 million in city funds, the Battery Park project is not expected to receive nearly enough government support to cover its final price, estimated at $40 million. Patterned after such privately financed initiatives as the restoration of Bryant Park by its surrounding property owners, and the improvements to Central Park by the Central Park Conservancy, the project can succeed only with a huge infusion of corporate and philanthropic contributions, which have so far not materialized.
Less than a quarter of the money needed has been raised, but the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park, so named to distinguish itself from the newer expanse of park space in Battery Park City, is taking a step-by-step approach, hoping that contributions will flow and its work can be completed over a five-year schedule.
The first increment, completed last month, is a newly rebuilt riverfront esplanade, intended to resemble the walkway it joins at the southern border of Battery Park City. Other plans include new landscaping for the entire park, which would create a broad, unbroken expanse of lawn similar to the one in Bryant Park.
The park's 23 statues would be rearranged, with all but three lined up at the perimeter, along Battery Place and State Street, creating something called the Walk of Explorers and Defenders. Ultimately, in the most ambitious part of the project, the park's historically rich central fixture, Castle Clinton, would be rebuilt.
Transformation is nothing new for Castle Clinton, which was built as a fort for the War of 1812, was converted in later stages to a concert hall and an aquarium, was nearly destroyed by Robert Moses in 1941, and now is mainly used as an oversize ticket booth for ferries.
Although plans for the structure are in the early stages, officials of the conservancy said it would probably be enlarged by one or two floors, and a roof would be added to what is now a round stone fortress, open to the elements. Although such construction would radically alter the appearance of the old fort, conservancy officials said it would be restored to something closer to its earlier incarnation as a theater and cultural center. New Yorkers once came in droves to attend performances there staged by P. T. Barnum, including the American debut of Jenny Lind, the renowned "Swedish Nightingale," in 1850.
"This would be a restoration of former use, not of architecture," said Warrie Price, president of the conservancy. "We want to revitalize the castle's soul, and make it a destination point for New Yorkers."
Such grand designs may provide a test of private sector generosity, even at a time when huge gains on Wall Street and an ebullient city economy are fattening the coffers of philanthropic groups.
Unlike the Central Park Conservancy, with its projects supported by wealthy residents of Fifth Avenue and Central Park West, the conservancy working on Battery Park cannot lean heavily on the largess of its neighbors. And unlike Bryant Park, which was a notorious symbol of urban blight before its renovation in the late 1980's, Battery Park presents less civic urgency. It is less blighted than worn at the edges.
"The constituency for Battery Park has to be different," said William Rudin, a member of the Rudin real estate family, which owns five large commercial buildings in lower Manhattan, and has contributed more than $200,000, the largest private gift, to the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park.
Mr. Rudin said his family, spurred in part by its financial interests in lower Manhattan, had a more personal motive -- his great-grandparents, Louis and Rachel Rudin, who emigrated from Russia in the late 1880's, were among the 5 million immigrants processed through a receiving center at Castle Clinton in the almost 40 years before Ellis Island opened in 1892.
Now, four million people visit Battery Park each year, most of them to board ferries to the Federal landmarks on Ellis Island and Liberty Island. "I think it is almost embarrassing for the nation that they have to go through a place that needs a lot of work," Mr. Rudin said.
Even if the $40 million needed for the project can be raised, it remains unclear how much of it the city, state or Federal governments will contribute. Ms. Price said she expected the government to cover more than half the costs, but such support would only be granted if the city's private sector pitches in first with far more money that has already been raised.
"Private participation has got to drive the project," she said. "It has become very clear that Battery Park is important to the people of New York City."
One source of government support could be Congress, where Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, long an advocate of improving public access to the New York Harbor, is pressing for the Battery Park project to be included as a recipient in this year's Transportation funding bill. The project would qualify because the ferries to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty would continue to take on passengers in the park.
In the meantime, officials of the newly formed conservancy said they would seize upon today's announcement by Mr. Giuliani to kick off a series of public events in the park that are designed to lure more New York City residents as visitors, and to drum up financial support.
The first event, a fund-raiser on June 1, is planned as an elegant waterfront dinner in the park, with seats priced at $400, $600, or $1,000. A series called New York Centennial Summer in the Battery, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the city's five boroughs, will include free lunch-time concerts in the park on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from June 16 to August 20.
On June 20, the conservancy will sponsor a benefit concert in the park by the folk rock singer Ani DiFranco. Tickets are $26.
In keeping with her group's step-by-step approach, Ms. Price said the immediate objective was to raise enough money -- $6 million -- to complete the next phase of the five-year project: the rebuilding of a corridor of green space, known as the Upper Promenade, above the park's esplanade.
She said the group is determined to have that work begun by the fall, and completed by July 4, 2000, when huge crowds are expected for fireworks over the Statue of Liberty.
"It simply must be done," she said. "How can we be the host of the eyes of the world without getting this job done?"

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
As a rule, Mary Keselowsky of Oakhurst, N.J., serves salad to her husband and three children at dinner. But when the price of romaine lettuce recently climbed to $1.99 a head, double what Ms. Keselowsky usually pays for it, she refused to add it to her shopping cart.
Then, a few days later, finding no adequate substitute, she relented. 
 "My kids don't eat spinach," she said.
The heavy rains attributed to El Nino that have battered California in recent months have caused a lettuce scarcity throughout the nation, driving up the price of romaine and red- and green-leaf greens to as much as $4 a head and often forcing consumers to settle for inferior quality.
Stores from Los Angeles to New York have posted signs placing blame for the high price of lettuce and some other produce on weather conditions, and some consumers are either combing their neighborhoods in search of bargain lettuce or mixing cheaper substitutes like watercress into the salad bowl.
Others say salad prepared with lettuce is such a mainstay of their diet that they have no choice but to keep loading the costly and sometimes unsightly heads into their carts.
"Lettuce happens to be one of the healthiest foods," Elizabeth Rynkowsky said the other day as she shopped with her sister, Fannie, at a Food Emporium on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where romaine was priced at $2.99 a head. "That's where they've got us," Fannie Rynkowsky added.
With romaine in short supply, some restaurants chains, like Sizzler, have tinkered with the composition of the salad bar by increasing the proportion of the more abundant iceberg lettuce while eliminating the pricier varieties. Other chains, like Wendy's and Ruby Tuesday, have stopped serving Caesar salads.
"We took Caesar salad off the menu about a week ago," said Rebecca Lusk, a spokeswoman for Wendy's, which has 4,500 restaurants around the country. "It was a supply issue. There wasn't enough quality product to supply the system."
But customers at fancier restaurants known for their Caesar salad will not have to do without it.
In recent weeks, Brian Searle, who buys produce for the "21" Club in Manhattan, has paid as much as $60 for a 24-head case of romaine lettuce. That is about four times the typical price, he said, and enough to prompt the restaurant to stop serving that variety at private parties unless it is specifically requested.
But a $13 Caesar salad is still being offered to the restaurant's customers. "If there's a blip on the lettuce screen, we're not going to change all the menus," said Jeffrey Sacchet, the manager of operations.
Nor are customers at Musso & Franks on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles getting short-changed on their $11 Caesar salads, said John Garcia, the kitchen manager. "We're not going to cheat the customers," he said.
The spike in lettuce prices was caused by unusually heavy rains, which disrupted the lettuce-planting schedule in California, the source of most of the nation's supply, said Gary Lucier, an agricultural economist for the economic research service at the United States Department of Agriculture.
"Planting is a continual process," Mr. Lucier said. "If you interrupt that process, you pay for it."
Although prices appear to have peaked last week, and to have declined somewhat since, Mr. Lucier said shoppers could expect more fluctuation until about the second week in June. Prices will dip further between now and June, when the crop planted during the dry spells that punctuated the storms reaches the market, he said.
"What we're expecting is a roller coaster over the next month," Mr. Lucier said, "where prices go down and then go back up."
Some customers are astonished when they see the high prices.
"I've had people come up to me, point to the prices and say we've got to be kidding," said Kevin Krankall, produce clerk at Super Stop & Shop in Stratford, Conn.
Officials at several supermarket chains said they expected romaine prices to drop in a week or so as the New Jersey harvest goes to market. And although the rise in lettuce prices has been felt nationwide, the impact has been less pronounced in places where iceberg lettuce commands more respect.
Customers of the Kroger Company, which has 1,392 food stores in 26 states, mainly in the Midwest and the South, have been reacting calmly to the shortage of romaine and red-leaf lettuce, said a spokesman, Paul Bernish. "Keep in mind," he said, "that those varieties of lettuces represent only a fraction of what we sell in iceberg lettuce."

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Indonesian Loans But Cancels Military Exercise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The United States today gave Indonesia $1 billion in loan guarantees, free of any conditions concerning human rights abuses surrounding the protests against President Suharto's rule. Almost simultaneously the Pentagon, citing the unrest, canceled a joint training exercise with the Indonesian military.
The two actions underlined how the Administration has been sending seemingly conflicting signals to Mr. Suharto's Government all week. While the State Department has warned Indonesia several times about the dangers of further repression and the kidnapping of dissidents, it has declined to link those warnings to the aid being sent to ease the country's economic crisis. 
 Both the new loan program and the Pentagon decision were discussed at the White House this morning, in a meeting to review the rising opposition to President Suharto and the sharp price increases for fuel and other necessities mandated by the International Monetary Fund.
Today the students burned an effigy of Mr. Suharto in the streets of Jakarta. But in Medan, where troops were sent in to back up the police in putting down protests that turned violent earlier this week, demonstrations were peaceful.
The billion-dollar loan package put together by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, an independent Government agency that promotes American exports, was signed here today with Indonesia's Finance Minister, Fuad Bawazier. The president of the Ex-Im Bank, James Harmon, said that by helping Indonesia obtain the raw materials it needs to get its factories running again, "we hope to contribute to stability to calm the social situation."
Earlier this week, the Administration backed down from earlier warnings that it might cut off aid and voted for the resumption of loans to Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund.
It argued that Mr. Suharto had finally begun to meet virtually all the economic commitments it made in return for the loans. But in Jakarta there is abundant evidence that most of the major cartels controlled by Mr. Suharto's family and friends, which are supposed to be broken up under the I.M.F.'s reform program, have resurfaced in different forms.
Major investors have been unwilling to put money back into Indonesia until it is clear that a peaceful transfer of power will take place after the the 76-year old Mr. Suharto dies or leaves office. That is one reason the rioting this week sent the Indonesia currency plummeting.
Today, however, Mr. Bawazier said he did not believe that succession was an issue. "We have a system, and everything is quite clear," he said.
The Ex-Im Bank's chief role is to insure that American companies can sell their goods in countries that find it hard to get financing from banks and other private lenders. Typically, the Ex-Im Bank would offer a guarantee to a private bank that the overseas buyer of the American goods will indeed pay back any financing for the purchase, making the lender willing to make the loan.
The American program went ahead only after Indonesia agreed to a second guarantee, that Jakarta would repay Washington in case of any defaults on the loans. But that accord was divorced from the State Department's request earlier this week that Indonesian forces "show restraint" in putting down demonstrations that seem driven as much by anger at the Suharto family as by rage at rising fuel and food prices.
Mr. Harmon said today that he had discussed the loan program with various Administration officials, but received no special guidance.
The Pentagon, clearly worried about its association with the Indonesian military when its troops are suppressing riots and demonstrations, said it was calling off a military training exercise now under way with Indonesia.
Moreover, it is reviewing its entire program of joint command exercises and training with Indonesia, a Defense Department spokesman said. The Pentagon made no formal announcement of the decision. No official would speak on the record.
A White House official argued today that there was no inconsistency in providing further economic aid while pulling back involvement with the military. The American strategy, the official said, is to prevent worsening instability that is triggered by the huge run-up in prices on basic commodities. The prices are increasing for two reasons: the dramatic drop of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, which makes imports expensive, and the Government's gradual withdrawal of subsidies, which it can no longer afford.
"Our national interest is in seeing the economic reforms go forward," the White House official said. "There is no inherent contradiction between that goal and postponing military exercises until the return of stability."
But senior Administration officials have conceded in recent days that it is a risky strategy. "The bottom line is that there is no way to stabilize the economy without appearing to bolster Suharto," the official said.
Similarly, the military exercises help the United States better understand the Indonesian military -- the most powerful institution in the country -- while appearing to put the Pentagon on the same side as Mr. Suharto's protectors.
United States forces have held 41 training exercises with the Indonesia military since 1993, including courses in counterinsurgency techniques, psychological warfare and military operations in urban areas.
The existence of these exercises came to light in March, surprising and angering some members of Congress who thought they had banned such activities by cutting off funds under an international training and education program in 1992. However, training continued under a separate program; that program was suspended yesterday.
The first ban was imposed after the Indonesian military massacred more than 270 citizens on East Timor in November 1991.
Many of these training missions involve Indonesia's elite Kopassus forces, the arm of the military suspected of the most serious human rights abuses. The Kopassus troops have been deployed in recent months against protesters in Jakarta.
A Pentagon spokesman who asked not to be named said that a month-long training mission that began May 1 was canceled today "because of the current circumstances prevailing in Indonesia." But they may resume in time for two more exercises scheduled later this year.
"There is no permanent suspension of military activities in Indonesia," he said. " Based upon the current situation, there will be a policy-level review, on a case-by-case basis, of future exercises."

HEADLINE: New York Struggles for Biomedical Grant Share

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
After generations as America's center of medical and biological research, New York State has lost its pre-eminence, and its medical schools and research institutes now find themselves struggling to take advantage of a national boom in biomedical discovery and Federal grant-giving largess.
During the last 15 years, amid intense rivalry at home and rising competition from other states, New York has fallen from its perch as the No. 1 recipient of grants from the National Institutes of Health, the country's largest and most prestigious source of biomedical research money. New York is now third behind California and Massachusetts. 
 Last year, New York institutions received $970 million from N.I.H., about 10.7 percent of the $9 billion available from the agency for research. But while the actual dollar amount of its grants has grown, its share is far less than the 15.2 percent New York was awarded in 1983. And in the last 15 years, as the percentage has steadily declined, the state has lost out on $2.4 billion in research grants, as well as other income and jobs that money would have generated.
At the same time, as its closest competitors -- and many up-and-coming states, like Georgia, Washington and North Carolina -- were attracting more top researchers, New York was losing them.
This decline has been going on for years, with little attention in the state's turf-conscious medical and academic establishment. But in recent months, since the Federal Government announced that it would double the N.I.H. research budget during the next five years, some research institutions have been startled into talking about joining forces.
"New York is in a dangerous position," said Dr. Jeremiah A. Barondess, president of the New York Academy of Medicine and co-chairman of the Council on Biomedical Research and Development, an advisory body. "Washington is looking to double the N.I.H. budget over the next five years, and acquisition of those funds will not be easy. New York State will not be able to share in that increase in a significant way absent an increase in bright young researchers who can attract these grants."
The infusion of Federal money comes at a time of surging biomedical discoveries, in areas like cancer treatment, impotence remedies, AIDS therapies and the identification of genes associated with particular diseases. The hope in the scientific community is that a more robust N.I.H. research budget and other Government money, coupled with private and foundation philanthropy, will fuel such dynamic projects and incite others.
The concentration of prestigious medical schools and research institutes, and the competition among them, once made New York the most alluring place for young investigators doing this kind of work.
But as other states began to see the economic benefits of biomedical research and to coordinate research projects and recruitment efforts among their institutions, New York's centers continued to compete independently. Instead of collaborating to enhance their overall position, they often ended up canceling one another out.
At the same time, New York hospitals, which had supported research in their medical schools, began to face more pressing concerns: coping in the new world of managed care, with its emphasis on lower rates and cost efficiency.
And while New York City's crime rate has gone down in recent years, the high cost of living and its medical community's reputation as tradition-bound and stodgy continue to deter young scientists.
"Our choices are very narrow these days," said an official at one leading New York research center, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Generally, the researchers we tend to get now are people from New York, people with strong ties to New York, or mediocre scientists."
Dr. Russ Medford, a molecular cardiologist and a native New Yorker, was on the faculty at Harvard Medical School and completing a postdoctoral fellowship when he was offered jobs by several major New York medical schools, including the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he had received his medical degree and doctorate in molecular biology. He went to Emory University in Atlanta instead.
"New York has a tremendous infrastructure of tradition that makes it hard to get anything new and innovative done," said Dr. Medford, 43. "What distinguished Atlanta and Emory was that it was entrepreneurial in the best sense. It felt young and vibrant, like it knew no limits. In New York, there's all this retrenchment. Everybody seems so bent on consolidating their positions that they're not looking forward."
In his eight years at Emory, where he is the director of molecular cardiology, Dr. Medford has received close to $1 million in N.I.H. grants. And with the university's support, he has started a biotechnology company called Atherogenics, which employs about 25 people, has raised $15 million in venture capital and is conducting human clinical trials for a drug to treat atherosclerosis, a form of hardening of the arteries.
He also owns a house, where he lives with his wife, also a medical researcher at Emory, and their two daughters. "New York can represent significant challenges from a life style point of view," he said.
Recruiting Dr. Medford was an early coup of the Georgia Research Alliance, a partnership among the business, academic and government communities aimed at luring biomedical and information technology research opportunities to the state. Their strategy was to woo scientists the way universities court star athletes. To succeed, rivals for patients, students and philanthropy had to find a way to collaborate.
Among the many ways their success can be measured is Georgia's growing share of the N.I.H. pie. In 1997, Georgia ranked 18th among states in getting these grants, up from 20th in 1981. In that time, the state's share of these Federal research grants grew 25 percent more than the rate at which N.I.H. grant money was were growing, the mirror opposite of New York's experience.
Although institutions receive various streams of financing, N.I.H. research grants are considered the barometer of research vitality. By that measure, 11 of New York's 12 medical schools fell in the rankings of money awarded since 1981. Out of 126 medical schools in the country, Albert Einstein College of Medicine plummeted in those years to 21st place from 6th; Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons dropped to 10th from 4th; Cornell Medical School dipped to 31st from 27th; New York University School of Medicine went to 25th from 15th, and Buffalo suffered the worst decline, to 84th from 55th.
Only Mount Sinai School of Medicine improved in the rankings, edging up to 26th place from 28th.
Now, Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the State Health Commissioner, says she has detected a belated "sense of urgency and panic" at New York's research centers. "There's this feeling, suddenly, that we need to hurry and catch up," she said.
Perhaps the most ambitious effort to catch up is the New York Structure Center, which would be a $40 million collaboration among many of New York's leading medical research institutes. The center, as yet without a location, would house the expensive and space-consuming magnetic resonance spectrometers needed for research in structural biology, a field in which scientists study molecules in the hopes of creating drugs and other therapies to treat a range of diseases.
Trying to coordinate this effort is Willa Appel, president of the Partnership Policy Center. Her first challenge, she says, was getting the institutions to acknowledge the crisis.
"Here you have a bunch of institutions resting on their laurels, still getting basically enough to do what they want to do, not inclined to take in the new reality," said Dr. Appel, whose center is an arm of the New York City Partnership, which tries to focus the business community on economic sectors in jeopardy and transition. "For a long time, people here couldn't quite accept the idea that Birmingham, Ala., or North Carolina actually represented competition to them."
It should not have come as news. In a report 10 years ago, Dr. Lawrence D. Sturman, executive director of the Health Research Council of the State Department of Health, warned of a crisis.
"New York State's biomedical infrastructure is in serious jeopardy," he wrote. "This has significant implications for New York's health economy, and for the growth of technology-based industries such as biotechnology."
But it has taken 10 years for leaders in the academic world to take Dr. Sturman's dire prognostications seriously. Even now, Dr. Appel and others say, getting everyone to concentrate on creating a solution has been daunting. "In a smaller place, with fewer distractions, people decide they want to do something, they focus and they do it," she said.
A major part of the difficulty is getting perennial rivals to work together, said Dr. John W. Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and chairman of the Council on Biomedical Research and Development. "The entire focus of the council now," he said, "is to get these institutions out of the arms race and to realize that if we pull together we can compete better nationally."
The council recently issued a report calling for a statewide research endowment to finance the recruitment and support of 300 young research scientists during the next five years. The council estimated that it would require about $1 million over three years for each scientist: $250,000 to renovate laboratories and $750,000 for equipment, personnel and other costs. The hope is that after three years the researchers would become self-sustaining through grants from the N.I.H. and other sources.
Dr. Rowe said he hoped the state would contribute most of the money for such a fund, arguing that "the research enterprise is as much part of the intellectual capital in New York as finance or the arts, and is less funded."
But Dr. DeBuono said that such reliance on state financing was misguided and unrealistic, and a further sign of the difficulties the academic medical centers have in setting aside their competitive culture.
"Nobody wants to give up potential philanthropic dollars to some joint effort," Dr. DeBuono lamented. "So the easy answer is, 'Let's get money from the state to jump-start biomedical research.' But these guys need to pool together to tap private resources."
Yet even in the face of what experts are calling a crisis in New York, academic leaders still bristle at shedding their competitive armor.
"If we could do this independently, believe me we would," Dr. Dominick P. Purpura, dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, said of the planned structural biology center. "We are all used to being competitive."

HEADLINE: Lawyers Prepare Stage for Lawsuit in Turnpike Shooting

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Leading a team of lawyers known for winning O. J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. invited a crowd of reporters and television cameramen to his offices in TriBeCa yesterday to draw attention to the civil rights suit they are planning to file on behalf of three young men involved in last month's shooting by state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike.
The former "dream team" members requested a meeting with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and demanded assurances of an honest inquiry into the incident. Their new colleague, David G. Ironman of Staten Island, meanwhile, offered new details that he said further contradicted the police account of why the troopers fired 11 shots into the young men's van. 
 Among the details were Mr. Ironman's assertion that the young men had been traveling with the van's cruise control set at the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit when they were stopped by the troopers at about 11 P.M. on April 23. That conflicts with the official state police account that said the van had been speeding at 74 m.p.h.
Mr. Ironman also said the van's windows were not tinted, as the state police contended, but clear, giving the troopers an unobstructed view of the occupants.
Surrounded by parents and siblings of the three young men, Mr. Cochran and his colleagues, Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld, clearly sought to demonstrate their clients' solid family backgrounds. Each family member was introduced, and the lawyers even handed out a list that gave their names, occupations and family histories.
The lawyers said they planned to file a Federal civil rights lawsuit that would accuse the two state troopers of stopping the van solely based on the race of its occupants.
Mr. Cochran said people should be stopped for a clear reason, "not based upon how they look or what somebody thinks about them."
"And it's always brown and black, and in this car there was a black driver and brown passenger in the front seat, and very visible," he said.
That passenger, Danny Reyes, 20, of Queens, remains hospitalized in Camden with serious injuries to his right arm and torso. At the news conference, his mother, Ana Maria Reyes, angrily dismissed what she said were descriptions of her son and his companions as "undereducated and unemployed" by Col. Carl A. Williams, the State Police Superintendent.
"That is the reason why his troopers are the way they are," Ms. Reyes said, "insensitive and racist."
Mr. Scheck made the demand for a meeting with the Governor. "Today," he said, "we are calling on the Governor of the State of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, and the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey to meet with us and provide us with assurances that this investigation will be conducted in a full and fair manner."
Mr. Cochran, repeating the request, also criticized state officials for not apologizing to the young men who were shot at by the troopers.
Mr. Cochran said: "No one from the State of New Jersey, no one from the Governor's office, no one from the state troopers' office has deigned to call the families or any of these young men and said, 'You know we're sorry. We're sorry you were shot on our turnpikes. You have been released. There are no charges.' Common decency would require that."
Mrs. Whitman and the State Attorney General, Peter G. Verniero, both issued statements yesterday saying that they had already guaranteed a fair and thorough investigation into the matter. Both noted the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case and that evidence would be presented to a state grand jury rather than a grand jury in Mercer County where the shooting occurred.
Neither Mrs. Whitman nor Mr. Verniero would respond directly to the lawyers' demand for a meeting.
"Representatives of the State in their official capacity have already met with the victims or their representatives and have assured them that there will be a thorough investigation," the Governor's statement said.
In an interview, her spokesman, Pete McDonough, said: "This is an ongoing investigation and it should not be played out in the media. It is a very serious situation."
The Attorney General's office said that Mr. Verniero had not yet been contacted by Mr. Cochran or any other lawyers in the case about a meeting.
"We have taken rigorous steps to insure that the investigation of this matter is fair and complete in all respects," Mr. Verniero said through a spokesman, Paul Loriquet. "Although I have not been contacted by the motorists or their families, I reiterate my commitment to all citizens of New Jersey, and indeed to everyone concerned here, that this investigation will be full and fair in all respects."
But Mr. Ironman and the other lawyers expressed doubts, which they said were based in large part on the fact that aspects of the official state police version of the incident have since proved to be untrue. For example, the police account said that the troopers had used radar to detect the van's speed. It was later revealed that the police car was not equipped with radar.
Offering another new detail, Mr. Ironman said that air bags had not activated in either the van or the patrol car, indicating that any impact between the two vehicles could not have been with much force. According to the police account, the van went into reverse after being pulled over and struck the police car and a passing Honda before reversing direction again and ending up in a ditch.
And, offering a possible explanation for the van's reversal, Mr. Ironman said the driver, Keshon Moore, might have believed the car was in park when he lifted his foot from the brake and began to search for his wallet. As the van moved backward, the police said, it struck one of the troopers, prompting them to fire their weapons.
At the news conference yesterday, the lawyers spoke in dramatic tones about the implications of the case. "We think that this is an important case, not only for the State of New Jersey, but for everybody in this country who is concerned about justice and fairness," Mr. Cochran said.

HEADLINE: Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia Dies at 96

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Former Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia, a Democrat who was present at the creation of the New Deal and wrote the constitutional amendment that gave 18-year-olds the right to vote, died today at a nursing home in St. Louis. He was 96.
Mr. Randolph had been living at the St. John's Mercy Skilled Nursing Center since his health began to fail in 1988, three years after he retired from the Senate. He was a Senator for 26 years and a member of the House of Representatives for 14 years. 
 For three decades, beginning in 1942 when he was in the House, Mr. Randolph pushed for an amendment to lower the voting age from 21. He pursued his cause at every opportunity, and on his 11th attempt Congress approved it. The measure became the 26th Amendment on June 30, 1971, attaining the approval of three-quarters of the states.
"I believe that our young people possess a great social conscience, are perplexed by the injustices which exist in the world and are anxious to rectify these ills," Mr. Randolph said as his dream became reality.
On the big issues of his time, Mr. Randolph was generally a liberal. As a Senator, he voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He was a strong supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson's anti-poverty programs, and he backed Medicare.
With his home state in mind, he tirelessly supported aid programs for Appalachia. "I essentially am a West Virginia Senator," he once said. "I'm not what you'd call a national Senator or international Senator."
Yet on some issues of global importance, he was prescient. "In the future, we will not be able to depend on the importation of oil from any foreign country, even though it may appear now to be a very friendly one," he said in a House speech in 1943.
That was in wartime, of course, but he was making the point that the United States needed to find new sources of oil and have energy policies that would protect it in peace as well as war. In 1980, with memories of long gasoline lines from the recent Arab oil embargo still vivid, he said, "Now at long last, we realize what the situation is when the nation's monthly payout is over $90 billion for foreign oil."
For much of his time in Congress, Mr. Randolph supported the coal industry. His home state was the biggest coal-mining state, and he often walked a tightrope, trying to balance economic concerns against environmental ones. In 1969, when the consumer advocate Ralph Nader criticized his support of measures that would weaken mine safety, Mr. Randolph changed his position, declaring that the measures were "mistakes" and he could no longer back them.
Mr. Randolph was elected to the House in 1932, benefiting from Roosevelt's landslide victory, and was elected to six more terms. Defeated in 1946, he became an executive of Capital Airlines. In 1953, he became chairman of a Commerce Department panel to study Federal aid to airport construction.
Mr. Randolph was elected to the Senate in 1958 to fill the unexpired term of Matthew M. Neely. He was elected to four full six-year terms, during which he was a strong supporter of the Interstate Highway System, before deciding not to run in 1984.
Jennings Randolph (his parents were admirers of William Jennings Bryon) was born in Salem, W.Va., on March 8, 1902. After graduating from Salem College in 1924, he became a reporter for the Clarksburg Daily Telegram. Soon thereafter, he became an editor on the West Virginia Review and later headed the department of public speaking and journalism at Elkins College in West Virginia until his election to Congress.
Mr. Randolph thought his newspaper background gave him insights into reporters' biases, and he said so. Annoyed at criticism of his remarks about the women's movement in 1970, he noted that he was a co-sponsor of the equal rights amendment. But he did allow that his use of the phrase "braless bubbleheads" to describe some outspoken feminists "was perhaps ill-chosen."
Mr. Randolph's wife, Mary, died about 15 years ago. He is survived by two sons, Jay of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Frank of Washington; three grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.
Mr. Randolph described himself as a "Jeffersonian Democrat." In fact, he was one of the last New Deal Democrats. On the night of March 28, 1933, the young Congressman was in a group of lawmakers who sat with the new President before a fireplace on the second floor of the White House barely three weeks after taking office.
Some in the group urged Roosevelt not to move too fast. The President took off his glasses and said: "By acting now we will assuredly make mistakes. But if we don't act now, I'm afraid we will not have even the opportunity to make the mistakes a little later."
On his way home, Mr. Randolph recalled decades later, he thought Roosevelt might be the man to pull the country together.
